===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-06 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Danilo Juvane, Vice President of Investor Relations, ESG, and Investment Analysis. Please go ahead.
Danilo Juvane: Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in The Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon, we released our earnings press release and the presentation that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, and our Chief Financial Officer, John Porter, will speak to this morning. Also joining us on the call today are Larry Larson, our Chief Operating Officer, Lane Wilson, our General Counsel, and Chad Zamarin, our Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development. In our presentation material, you'll find a disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconciled to generally accepted accounting principles, and these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong: Okay, well, thanks, Danilo, and thank you all for joining us today. We do have a very positive story to share with you on our first quarter performance, which was really driven by the exceptional results within our base business in this quarter. But before I dive into my remarks, I do want to welcome Larry Larson, our new Chief Operating Officer, to the call. This is technically day two for Larry, but he's been a valuable member of the Williams team for more than 25 years. So I know you're going to come to value his perspective and knowledge of our operations just as you have enjoyed that from Michael Dunn, who did retire this past Friday. So Larry has served as an important member of Michael's leadership team over the past several years, so this will be a seamless transition with Larry carrying forward the commitment to excellence that Michael had established in all aspects of our operations. Obviously, some other leadership changes to hit on, but I'll save my remarks on that matter for the end of the call. So beginning here on Slide two, it really is staggering when you step back and consider all the facets of our businesses that are providing high return growth opportunities. The positive results in the near term, like the 9% growth this year, coupled with an improved credit rating already, continue to speak for themselves, but the continued string of very high return projects suggest that we are in the early innings of this long horizon of growth. So let me just share a few of the drivers for my optimism on this level of growth continuing. First, we will be a big beneficiary of the fast-rising data center power load, and we are very encouraged by the uptake we are seeing on the new model we have brought to market and the indirect business we are seeing on our gas transmission systems that is showing up as very high return large-scale expansions. Socrates is our first example on the direct service front, and we talked first about this project during our earnings call in February, and since then we have fully contracted this project that will deliver speed-to-market solutions for the growing data center demand in Ohio. Williams will invest approximately $1.6 billion to provide committed power generation and associated gas pipeline infrastructure for our customer in this area, and the project is backed by a 10-year fixed price power purchase agreement with an opportunity to extend the contract for another five years and beyond. Importantly, we expect the project to generate earnings consistent with a 5x EBITDA bill multiple, an impressive return given the low-risk nature of the power purchase agreement, and the fact that this project does not leverage Williams' existing asset footprint to a meaningful degree. We are full steam ahead on this project and anticipate completing the build-out in the second half of 2026. We also have two other projects that are utilizing the same model in flight now and have ordered equipment that has the same backstopping agreements that we used in the original Socrates project. Much more to come on this, but it is clear that we have a model that works for this customer base and the opportunities are developing fast in the space. Next, on the indirect side, we are pleased to announce Transco's Power Express Pipeline, a 950 million cubic feet per day expansion to markets north of Station 165, helping to serve the power-hungry Virginia area. The project is backed by a significant commitment from an anchor shipper and will utilize existing right-of-ways and infrastructure to dramatically reduce permitting risk and provide scalability. This project will provide the same kind of return as our CESI project and the demand for this capacity has been robust. And finally, we acquired a 10 percent interest in Cogentrix Energy, closing on this deal in early March. This investment enhances our sequent market intelligence and gives Williams insight into how to better serve the emerging power markets with natural gas supply. Importantly, we are excited to be working with the Quantum team on this business and to ensure that the gas supply is optimized for these gas-fired power plants. Next, turning to our operational execution, our team continues to flawlessly deliver on a string of high-return projects that will accelerate earnings growth throughout the balance of the year. This quarter, we successfully placed two projects into service, the Southeast Energy Connector in Alabama and the Texas to Louisiana Energy Pathway along the Gulf Coast. These fully contracted Transco expansions were designed to reduce land use and minimize community and environmental impacts while also delivering clean and affordable natural gas volumes to the region. These projects demonstrate both LNG export growth and coal-to-gas conversion opportunities. Our project execution team continues to deliver on projects throughout this year, starting construction on another expansion in the southeast on Transco, the leg project in Haynesville, and out west on our overthrust westbound expansion. These projects represent nearly 2 BCF a day coming online for the balance of this year. Also, in the deepwater, the deepwater really is coming on strong this year and shows no signs of slowing down. We recently completed two expansions that add significant earnings growth. The well expansion went into service in the first quarter and has been ramping up through the first quarter, and Chevron's Valley Moor started up two weeks ago. Both of prospects are large-scale and will be significant contributors for the balance of the year. Additionally, in the deepwater, both the Shenandoah and Salamanca floaters are now being commissioned, and these will drive a significant cash flows across our discovery assets, which is now wholly-owned. These projects are expected to make meaningful contributions in the third quarter. And finally, let me just hit on a few key financial highlights from the quarter before I turn it over to John to walk through the results in detail. First of all, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint by $50 million to $7.7 million, driven by our strong-based business performance and our Cogentrix investment addition. Our CapEx increase of $925 million reflects the update that we provided with the announcement of our Socrates project. And also in recognition of the resilient business model and balance sheet strength, we received an S&P credit rating upgrade to BBB Plus during the quarter, and very recently were assigned a positive outlook by Moody's. The strength of the base business was really the story in the first quarter, with both the Transmission & Gulf hitting new record EBITDA and strong rebounds from the west and northeast gathering. In the Transmission & Gulf, this record was driven by both record contract gas transmission capacity and record gathering processing and storage fee-based revenue. So the transmission business, we again saw now a record in the long-term transmission capacity, but also saw the fee-based revenue in the deepwater and in our storage business picked up. In the west, it was driven by strong gathering volume rebounds and bolt-on acquisitions. Given the strong volumes we are currently seeing, we expect to see more records surpassed again in the second quarter. Speaking of the second quarter, this marks the 37th consecutive quarter of meeting or beating consensus, and that is on top of this was the eighth time that we've raised our guidance during the same period. So lastly, we increased Williams quarterly dividend in the quarter up 5.3% to $0.50 per share, and demonstrating continued commitment to Williams' longstanding and well-covered dividend program. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to John.
John Porter: All right. Thanks, Alan. Starting here on Slide three, with a closer look at our adjusted EBITDA performance, which was up 3% over the first quarter of 2024, excluding the marketing business, our adjusted EBITDA was up 5% with growth across all the other segments. Our overall first quarter '25 results were basically right on top of our business plan. Additionally, I will note that our business plan anticipated our first quarter to show the least amount of quarterly growth over '24, with our forward 2Q through 4Q'25 quarters each showing substantially higher growth rates. In other words, we expect growth over the prior year will accelerate each quarter through the remainder of the year. I'll address our current thoughts on full year performance in a moment. Walking now from last year's $1.934 billion to this year's record $1.989 billion, we start with our Transmission & Gulf business, which improved $23 million, or 3%, setting an all-time record due primarily to higher revenues from expansion projects. At Transco, we had increases from regional energy access, southside reliability enhancement, and partial quarter contributions from Carolina Market Link. We also continued to see growth from our storage businesses, with renewals at Gulf Coast Storage and NorTex coming in at higher rates as we had expected from those two acquisitions, as well as incremental contributions from our market-based rates at our Washington Storage Facility. In the Gulf, we saw contributions from our Discovery acquisition, as well as initial contributions from our Whale project that were partially offset by some maintenance and producer issues. Even with those issues, we saw about a 12% increase in Gulf gathering volumes and about 42% higher NGL production. Lastly for this segment, I'll just note that although our new Transco rates went into effect on March 1, you're not really seeing much of an impact here as we continue to maintain a conservative reserve pending the final settlement. Next, our Northeast G&P business improved 10 million, or 2%, primarily on higher revenues, including the effect of higher gathering and processing rates. This segment was unfavorably impacted by the Aux Sable divestiture that we made last August. Overall volumes were basically pretty flat with the first quarter of '24. However, they are up about 6% sequentially over the fourth quarter of '24, and we've continued to see overall additional growth in April. In the West, we were 26 million, or 8% higher, driven by strong margins, Overland Pass Pipeline volumes, and a partial quarter from the Rimrock acquisition that closed at the end of January. We did have a small gain on an asset sale that was under our materiality threshold for adjustment of around $10 million. The West was negatively impacted by a step down in our minimum volume commitments at Eagle Ford. On the volume front, similar to the Northeast, overall volumes were basically pretty flat with the first quarter of '24, but up about 5% sequentially over the fourth quarter of '24, and we've continued to see overall additional growth in April. Our Sequin Marketing business had another strong start to the year with 155 million of adjusted EBITDA, which is the third straight year where our first quarter marketing results exceeded $150 million. However, the 25 results were still down about 34 million overall versus 2024, and this segment did see a small one-month, $3 million contribution from the Cogentrix investment that Alan discussed earlier. And then finally, our upstream business included in our other segment was up about $37 million, and roughly half of that was related to our consolidation of the Wamsutter upstream position effective in November of last year. Also, we did see some overall improvement in gas prices year-over-year. So that gets you to the 1.989 billion of EBITDA for first quarter 25 or 3% growth, which as I mentioned a moment ago should be the lowest growth rate we see this year as we look forward to accelerating growth through the remainder of this year. Now let's move to the next slide and discuss what we're seeing in our outlook for the remainder of 25. As Alan mentioned, we are revising our 2025 adjusted EBITDA guidance upward from a previous midpoint of 7.65 billion to now 7.7 billion, and we're moving the top of the range to 7.9 billion. At 7.7 billion, we will see 9% growth in adjusted EBITDA over 24 and a 9% CAGR from 2020. Our current guidance reflects a solid start to 25, the addition of the Cogentrix investment, and our overall confidence in the growth of our underlying business plus line of sight to an extraordinary number of projects coming online in the near future. Speaking specifically to the segment, in our Transmission & Gulf segment, we look forward to settling our Transco rate case and seeing the contributions from the two transmission projects we recently placed in service, as well as completing six additional transmission projects by the end of this year, and we remain optimistic about continued upside from the recontracting of our storage business. Additionally, in the deep water, we've now completed the Whale and Baltimore projects and still have the Shenandoah and Salamanca projects to go for 2025. In the deep water, we are only in the early stages of a volume ramp that will accelerate through the remainder of the year. In our gathering and processing businesses, we continue to see overall strengthening in our volumes, reflecting our exposure to crucial natural gas-focused basins and our Haynesville expansions, including our large-scale Louisiana Energy Gateway project, which is proceeding very well with expected completion in 3Q25. In our more commodity-exposed upstream and marketing businesses, we've generally lowered our expectations for price and tailwinds. However, we are still well positioned to deliver on our plan for our upstream business, as the combination of our first quarter performance and forward hedge book have basically already locked in about 65% of the expected 2025 revenues, and the majority of the marketing business' plan has been realized through the first quarter. As we've demonstrated over the last 10-plus years, our business is very resilient to commodity price swings and especially insulated from the risk of crude oil downturns associated with economic downturns. Williams continues to be primarily focused on two things, demand for natural gas pipeline capacity and the growth in natural gas volumetric demand. We continue to have confidence in the outlook for both of these, regardless of near-term macroeconomic conditions, and look forward to delivering at least 9% growth this year. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Alan.
Alan Armstrong: Okay, great. Thanks, John. And just a few closing remarks before we turn it over to your questions. I'll start by saying it should be very apparent that our business is firing on all cylinders, and we have a track record of generating predictable growing earnings in a variety of economic cycles, which underscores the value of Williams as a weatherproof long-term investment with a high growth dividend. With an ever-expanding backlog of fully contracted projects extending beyond 2030 and our proven ability to capture new business in emerging markets, Williams is positioned better than any other company to benefit from the coming wave of natural gas demand, from the power generation market, industrial restoring, and LNG exports, while continuing to deliver on traditional market needs. Williams is excelling on all fronts thanks to a strong and energized organization that is very passionate and dedicated to our strategy and to doing the right thing. So, I feel that the time is right for the transition we announced yesterday that effective July 1, Chad Zamarin will succeed me as President and CEO, and I will serve as Executive Chairman of the Board. And Steve Bergstrom, who has been a great leader of our Board and a great thought partner to me personally, will become our Lead Independent Director. Since joining Williams, Chad and I have worked together closely, and he has successfully built on our strong natural gas focused strategy while advocating for Williams and the role of natural gas in our clean energy future. He is the right next leader for Williams at this point in our company's history, and I know he will take the company forward with pride and commitment to Williams' values. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chad for a few brief remarks before we get to Q&A. Chad?
Chad Zamarin: Thanks, Alan. I am truly humbled and honored to be asked to lead Williams in the months and years ahead. The rich history of Williams is truly the story of a great American company, and we have many amazing chapters left to write. Alan, you've been a great mentor, leader, and thought partner for me, and I'm grateful for the trust that you and our Board of Directors have placed in me and in our leadership team to carry Williams' vision forward. Rest assured that there are no major sea changes here and no change in how the compass is set for Williams. Alan and I, together with the entire leadership team, have for years worked closely with our board to craft and continually tune our natural gas focused strategy. And as you've heard today, our strategy continues to deliver with abundant opportunities on the horizon. I look forward to continuing to work with the board and with Alan in his role as Executive Chairman to continue to build on our success. Alan, on behalf of every shareholder and on behalf of every current and former employee that has proudly worn the Williams badge, I want to say thank you. It has been one of the greatest privileges of my career to work with you and to witness your unwavering dedication to this great company. I know how much you love Williams and I know how much that you and Shelley have sacrificed for the company and know that we will strive every day to match your passion for Williams and we will always work to make you proud. I hope that you know how much you mean to us and I'm glad that you will still be close by in your role as Executive Chair. And now we will open up the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Praneeth Satish of Wells Fargo.
Praneeth Satish: First, let me offer my congratulations to both Alan and Chad. And Chad, you have some big shoes to fill. Alan, I think you mentioned during your prepared remarks that Williams has ordered equipment for two more behind the meter power projects, if I heard you correctly. Can you help us just understand if the size and returns for these potential projects are going to be similar to what we saw with Socrates? Or do you think that the returns could be even better to the extent you're able to leverage your own existing infrastructure? And separately, given that you've already ordered the equipment, should we expect FID in the coming months?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, Praneeth. I'm going to have Chad take that one. He's been right in the middle of that. So Chad will take.
Chad Zamarin: Sure. Yes. We do expect these projects to reach full commercialization throughout the remainder of the year. And we also expect these projects to be contracted very similarly to Socrates and have likewise really attractive returns. I think we'll hold to see if they're materially different than the projects we have. But I think generally scope and scale will be similar, maybe a bit smaller as we get more efficient in how we design these solutions. But for the most part, we'll look similar to Socrates.
Praneeth Satish: Got it. And then maybe if you could elaborate on the strategic rationale for the Cogentrix investment. Beyond, I guess, market intelligence, do you anticipate this evolving into a platform for additional power generation investments? What's your appetite for increasing your ownership stake beyond the 10% or just making more investments into IPPs?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I'll take that one. I think people should realize that there is a lot of change afoot, particularly in the Northeast on the power market and the way that business is contracted. It's becoming very evident that the short-term power auction markets don't provide for those merchant power plants taking out long-term firm capacity. And that's going to have to happen to maintain a reliable grid in those markets. So we are really watching that with a lot of close interest. And this is a great way for us to really be in a position to help on the gas supply side of that. So you really shouldn't see it as an investment into the merchant power generation space as a strategy as much as you should see it. We recognize there's a lot of change that's going to happen in terms of the gas supply into that business, particularly in the Northeast. And we want to be front and center on what that's going to look like. And then finally, I would just say really excited to be working with the Quantum Energy Group. Great partner in a lot of areas, and we really like working with them. And so this is a great opportunity for us to expand that relationship. So it's not quite what people might think it is in terms of us thinking about going into the merchant power business. And I appreciate that that coupled along with going into the serving the data centers, people might get that impression, but that's not at all what our strategy is.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan.
Jeremy Tonet: Yes, congratulations, both Allen and Chad. Congrats on that. And maybe just moving into behind the meter as well with the question here, just wondering, I guess, Williams has provided a solution that I think a number of others in the market have looked to pursue but have not been able to deliver, you know, energy companies or IPPs or other, I guess, what has enabled Williams to do this, versus others? What do you see as your competitive advantage here? How big is this opportunity set for Williams as you see it?
Chad Zamarin: Yes, thanks, Jeremy. This is Chad. I mean, first thing I'd say is a huge shout out to the Williams team. We are very focused on collaborating across the organization in driving, you know, growth within our core businesses. And frankly, you know, I credit a lot of our success on the Socrates Project and Empower Innovation to the team and to that collaboration. And then beyond that, it's just making sure we can put together solutions for customers and bring all of the different capabilities of the organization. We can provide gas supply solutions. We understand pipeline capacity, our own, and even third-party pipelines through our sequent market intelligence. We obviously build a lot of pipeline and turbine facilities. And so bringing all the different pieces together into a solution that is, ready-made for a customer, I think, has been truly a differentiator. And again, credit to the team for being able to pull all that together. And then I would just mention that, I think John was mentioning earlier, I mean, we like this opportunity. We think it will layer in nicely over time. I know that, there's a lot coming at us really fast. The team is working on making sure that this complements our investment strategy, and we've got a nice layering in of projects over time. And so I would think of these next two projects that we're working to commercialize, in addition to other projects, as layering in over the next few years and through the end of the decade. Yes, and I would just add, Jeremy, one of the things that I think we are really good at as a company is developing high-trust relationships. And that reputation helps us, obviously, when we go into situations like this. But importantly, we also work to have that on the supplier side as well. And so us having a long-term relationship with Solar in a way that provides us a leg up on being able to get the equipment there is very valuable. So those relationships pay off in moments like this, instead of just beating down vendors to the very last nickel all the time. But really trying to work with them to improve their product and service in a high-trust relationship really pays off dividends in times like these. And so I think you see that coming through as well.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful there. Thanks. And just kind of shifting towards the gas markets, maybe a bit more color, in addition to what you said before. And thinking about your conversations with producer customers here, there's a lot of focus on oil-directed drilling, but there's impacts on the gas market as well. And just wondering if you could comment a bit more on how you see the gas market unfolding here, given these dynamics, and what it means for your systems if the call on gas continues and there's less associated gas or otherwise. Just how you see this playing out and what are the impacts for Williams?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. We certainly are seeing that call on gas right now. And a lot of response in the dry gas basins for sure. And obviously, if oil continues to soften, that we'll continue to see rigs rotate into the gas areas, I think. So, it's going to be a little choppy because we're going to see big increases on the demand side, and we're going to see supply responses that are not, you know, always directly in line with the market demand. So, I think it's going to be kind of choppy on the way up, if you will, on the demand side. But we certainly are seeing responses on our system. Saw that growth during the first quarter and certainly seeing that growth on our systems here in April and in the second quarter. So, we are extremely well positioned for that call, and we're certainly seeing it come through our systems right now. So that's been a strategic decision for a long time to really focus on the gas-directed basins because we think that they'll have to be called on in a growing gas demand. And I would just say that's come a little stronger than we've even expected at this point. So, very well positioned on that take, and we certainly are seeing a big call on the gas supply in those basins.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis of Citi. Your line is now open.
Spiro Dounis: Congrats, Alan, Chad, and Larry. Maybe just to start with the project backlog as it relates to capital spending. Sounds like a lot of healthy backlog materializing here, and we've already sort of seen that impact on 2025. But just given sort of constantly sort of percolating list of items coming in, curious how you're thinking about elevated CapEx going forward. Is this going to be a feature over the next few years, given all these projects starting to manifest themselves? And are there any self-imposed limits in any given year, and how much you want to spend?
John Porter: Yes. Thanks for the question, Spiro. I mean, I think as we have discussed in the past in our long-range forecasting exercise we do every year, we've just continuously seen this 2025-2026 timeframe as being a period of time where the company was going to have really more and more balance sheet capacity. Again, reminding folks that our targeted leverage range is 3.5x to 4x. And even with this first project, our guidance this year is for 3.65x, so still very comfortably within that range. And as we've talked about before, as we look forward into the future, we saw sort of an ever-increasing capacity coming on the balance sheet, even with, I think, what are ultimately probably going to be pretty conservative cash tax assumptions going forward. We still saw that sort of ever-increasing level of balance sheet capacity. And so, going back over a year ago or so, a lot of the focus has been what's going to come along to make a really good use of that balance sheet capacity. And so, what we've seen, I think, over the last 12 months is our commercial teams are very busy, and maybe as busy as I've ever seen them. And then, of course, we've had the power innovation stuff come along as well. And so, really, it's very exciting. We're seeing a timeframe where we have enormous opportunities and business coming along at a time when we have really strong balance sheet capacity. And I think what's really exciting is the stuff that's coming in has a very strong return profile, great credit, long-term terms. And so, we really like the capital that's coming at us organically. And I think we have more than enough capacity to fund what's in front of us. And we've stress-tested that. And, of course, we'll be very disciplined on the returns and the credits and looking for the long-term contracts. But we think we've got plenty of capacity and very excited about the projects we're seeing coming from our commercial teams.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I would just add to that that it's very different. The short cycle that we're seeing for the power innovation projects are such a quick return on the capital. Five times EBITDA multiple on a project that takes 18 months to have online is very different than one that takes 36 months to have online. So, really strong returns from these projects that'll continue to expand the balance sheet in our capacity, as John said. So, I would say great problems to have, but so far, we feel like we have plenty of capacity of taking on what's out there and very glad that we've held our return threshold so high against our projects because it is giving us that kind of capacity that we wouldn't otherwise have if we'd been investing at lower return projects.
Spiro Dounis: Got it. Helpful. Thanks, John. Now, second question, maybe just to quickly go back to the leadership change. You both addressed this to some degree in your remarks, but maybe just to put a finer point on it. Alan, long, successful tenor at Williams. Curious why now is the right time? And Chad, it sounds like not a lot will change going forward, but just curious what you think your mandate is going forward.
Alan Armstrong: Yes, Spiro. Thanks for the question. Well, I would just say it's such a great time. I think our culture as a company is in great shape. The business is really running well right now, very excited about the talent in both Chad and the team that's coming up in the organization. So, I think the mix is just right and I think it's a great time to bring Chad's energy and passion to bear across all these opportunities. So, this is not necessarily anything other than just a very objective viewpoint from a shareholder perspective about what I think is the right time for making the change. And so, I couldn't be more excited about this as a personal shareholder myself. And so, I do think it's the right time and we've just got a great future and a lot of passion and energy in Chad and I think he's going to do a fantastic job of taking the organization to the next level.
Chad Zamarin: Yes. And Alan, as far as mandates go, I still remember eight years ago when I joined the company, one of the first things Alan asked me to do is to facilitate our strategy process. And we built a process where we work very collaboratively as a team across the organization and with our board of directors. And when you ask about a mandate, I would expect more of the same. This has been a strategy that we've been very committed to. We will continue to stay committed to stable, predictable growth, protecting the balance sheet. We do explore adjacent opportunities, but with the clear-eyed focus on driving growth and business back to our core business. You know, Alan mentioned that Cogentrix is a great example. We're not taking a large turn into a different strategic area. We're going to take a very small position that will allow us to be better positioned to drive business back to our core business because that's a strong fundamental tailwind that we see in the natural gas value chain. So, I would expect that you would continue to see more of the same. This team has been very ingrained in our strategy process. And the great news is, Alan isn't going far. He's going to be our executive chair, and we'll continue to work through that same strategy process that we have been now for great years.
Spiro Dounis: Great. I'll leave it there. Alan, don't be a stranger.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Theresa Chen: Good morning. I'd like to also offer my congratulations to Alan for your announcement, and congratulations as well to Chad and Larry and your new roles. First, following the FID of Transco's Power Express, I'd like to know, what is the capacity at this point across Transco for additional efficient high-returning projects using existing right-of-ways to mitigate potential permitting delays? How much more capacity is there to bring on projects like Power Express? And what are the next areas of growth and development on Transco?
Alan Armstrong: Larry, do you want to take that?
Larry Larson: Yes, I'll take that one. Yes, it's great question. Obviously, we're excited to be able to deliver another great project like Power Express, which is really building along our footprint across Transco with easy brownfield expansions that provide us opportunity to kind of streamline through the permitting process. I think as the dynamics and the demand continue to grow across the footprint on Transco, we're finding new opportunities left and right. As we're seeing the growth right now in Virginia that's driving Power Express, we're seeing continued growth throughout the southeast markets, as well as along the Gulf as we see rapid growth in the LNG space. And so, those dynamics change quite a bit, especially as we see new supply coming into different parts of the system. And so, I think we'll continue to find these opportunities to meet our customers' needs, and I think it's going to depend upon where the demand materializes and the supply that we start targeting to bring into the system.
Theresa Chen: And on the deepwater side of things, with contribution visibly stepping up in the second half, what are you assuming at this point for annual contribution for this group of projects within guidance relative to the $300 million exit?
Alan Armstrong: John, I'm not sure we've disclosed that.
John Porter: Yes, I don't think we really have a deepwater guidance number, but I would say there's been some timing shifts on some of these projects over the last few years since we had first talked about the overall contribution of these projects in that $300 million number. But ultimately, by the time you get to 2026, you should be more at a run rate level relative to this group of projects.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. So, just to be clear on that, the $300 million as an addition to these projects looks like we'll probably hit that stride towards the end of this year at a run rate level. And so, that remains. I would say that some of these are looking even better. I know Chevron is really excited about Ballymore and how those wells are doing right now. And so, I'm really encouraged to see that. Whale is doing really well, even though it had a very slow start at the beginning of the year. But right now, it is really getting on stride. So, we may be on the higher end of that by the end of the year. But obviously, there's a few things left to happen on Salamanca and Shenandoah that are hard to predict at this point. But so far, looking really good and very encouraged to hear Chevron's comments on what their cost structure is looking like around developing more and more reserves around the existing infrastructure. Because obviously, that'll just continue to feed our downstream pipeline. So, great times in the deep water, both in the current, but I think looking forward, the producers have really learned to take their cost down out there. And that's all that's going to benefit us directly out there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gabriel Moreen of Mizuho.
Gabriel Moreen: My congratulations to Alan and Chad as well. May I wanted to start out sort of at a different angle on the Socrates and Data Center projects. Can you talk about risk management overall for these projects, given long-term fixed price contracts on the power side? To what extent, you know, you're comfortable with locking in gas and gas costs, I guess, for that long? What happens in the event of force majeure? And also, to what extent Sequent may or may not be involved in helping you manage all this risk?
Chad Zamarin: Yes, thanks, Gabriel. Good questions. First of all, what I'd say is when we talk about a fixed price purchase agreement, it's a fixed price effectively return on our capital and a pass through for the gas that we'll be sourcing for the customer. So, we are not exposed to commodity price. And Sequent will be helping to source and deliver gas on behalf of our customer, but we aren't taking commodity price exposure. On things like force majeure, I would just say that, Alan said it. We are, and the team is building a very high trust relationship with these counterparties. I mean, this is some of the best credit out there from a customer opportunity perspective. And the customer has been with us in lockstep, making sure that we can go out and invest in these projects in a bit of a new arena, albeit playing to our core strengths and capabilities and things we've done before. But we have very high degree of protection from a contracting perspective. And so, I think the team's done a great job mitigating the risk and capturing very attractive returns. And so, I don't see any of the risk issues that are problematic for us. In fact, I would say we've mitigated risk on these projects beyond what we could even see on some of our core transmission projects.
Gabriel Moreen: Thanks, Chad. And then maybe if I can ask a question kind of on gas storage, just broadly what you're seeing right now, where some of the maybe potential expansions in your backlog may lie. Just looking at an update there.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. We've certainly announced our Pine Prairie expansion and that we've seen significant interest in the market on Pine Prairie and that Gulf Coast area. We see this new wave of LNG and potentially even additional LNG FIDs that may not have been in a lot of forecast models. We're going to continue to see and we're seeing a lot of interest and frankly need for Gulf Coast storage. And so, Pine Prairie is underway. That's a 10 BCF storage expansion. But we expect to continue to see very strong recontracting across the board on our Gulf Coast storage assets. And we don't want to get too far ahead of making sure we lock down Pine Prairie, but I would expect additional expansions that we'll be working on, in particular, along the Gulf Coast.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jean Ann Salisbury of BofA.
Jean Ann Salisbury: Hi. Congrats to everyone and good morning. Can you share a little more color on what the Transco Power Express project does? Is it taking that 950 MMCFD on Transco north from Station 165 up to Northern Virginia? And I guess, does it rely on Mountain Valley Pipeline expansion going forward in order to proceed?
Larry Larson: Yeah, I can take this. This is Larry. Great question. It is a 950 expansion, primarily sourcing from Station 165 going north. It is not dependent upon Mountain Valley expansion. Mountain Valley Pipeline expansion at this point. And it's really scalable, as Alan mentioned earlier. I think that's a great thing about the ability to be able to move volumes through the Transco system. And so, right now, it's primarily charged to be that north flow capacity.
Jean Ann Salisbury: Great. That's very clear. Thank you. And then, as a follow-up, can you just update us on if you are pursuing Constitution? I think that, relatedly, there's an open season on Millennium Pipeline that looks much like Constitution. So, if that goes forward, would it replace the need for Constitution? Thank you.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I would just say the Constitution really has a direct connection into those supplies, or that project would. So, that needs to happen one way or the other. Certainly, an opportunity, I think, for pipelines to work together out there, to piece together solutions to serve those markets. So, we'll see. We certainly are working that project. Lots of hurdles to overcome there. And, as you point out, really, it does require a combination of pipeline solutions to get all the way into the end markets up there. So, we may see that. But, certainly, working that, also working NESE, and excited about NESE. And, NESE's a lot easier to pull the trigger on, frankly, just a lot less complex and highly dependent on the state of New York and the governor there deciding that they need low-cost, low-emission energy into those markets. So, we'll see what happens on that.
Jean Ann Salisbury: Great. Thanks a lot. And, congrats again.
Chad Zamarin: I don't think that's too much to do to mention yet on the Constitution. We're continuing to work on it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Mackay of Goldman Sachs.
John Mackay: Congrats to everyone from me, as well. I wanted to start on permitting reform. We've seen some Army Corps announcements on kind of fast tracking there under the, I guess, National Emergency Authorization. Just curious what your view is on momentum in Washington, whether we could think about some of the project timelines improving from here. Thanks.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I would just say we're encouraged. We know both the administration is working hard to clear any barriers that exist. The FERC, as well, has been really working hard. And, I think the FERC is really a critical component for us. But, they continue to work hard to clear the deck of whatever obstacles they can control. But, none of that really changes the fact of the permitting process being very exposed to litigation and to obstructive environmentalists throwing wrenches in projects and filing suits that tie the projects up. So, that's the piece that's the judicial reform in the legislative process needs to be fixed. And, we're certainly going to work on that. So, we're encouraged. It's nice to see some people that are actually think their job is to help get infrastructure built as opposed to obstruct it. And so, we're encouraged by that. But, it is going to take, ultimately, some legislative reform to be more permanent. Lane, do you have anything to add to that?
Lane Wilson: No. I agree. I think there's a good momentum in DC to get that reform. But, it's ultimately going to be required.
John Mackay: I appreciate that. Thank you. And, maybe just going to the power projects, should we think of Socrates and kind of whatever's coming next? Are your customers thinking about that as a effectively permanent power solution? Or, is this kind of a phase one with some of these smaller turbines and then, eventually, you'd look to stand up something a little larger and maybe more permanent?
Chad Zamarin: Yes. Thanks, John. This is Chad. For these projects, in particular, generally, the customer is viewing them as a permanent solution. We will have the ability to, if it makes sense for us and for the customer, to make a grid connection and to optimize the use of the equipment. We will have that capability. But, I do think it's important to note, we've talked about, just as an example, on the first project, we do have a 10-year contract with an option for extension. But, the customer has partnered with us on 15 years of pipeline capacity to serve this facility. And so, we view these as making sure that we can provide grid level of reliability but with certainty and control for the customer to get online quickly and continue to operate these facilities for the long term. Yes. One of the things I think is missed in this whole discussion on this topic is that one of the things that kind of attracted us to these solutions in the first place is we were seeing how much money was being invested in diesel-fired backup generation for the full capacity of the facilities. That's an enormous expense on the one hand, and it's also a tremendous amount of emissions, even if it's only running a couple of days. And so, we do see this ultimately as a great -- but that's acknowledging how much money was being invested on standby puts these facilities -- kind of the worst-case condition on this would be this being purchased at its original construction cost and standby generation. So, we think this is a very elegant solution versus all the money that's been spent on diesel-fired generation is to have gas-fired backup, ultimately, at these facilities. So, that would kind of be a worst-case scenario. Our returns don't depend on that, actually, to be clear, but that would be a huge home run if that was the outcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta of UBS.
Manav Gupta: Sorry about that. My question is on the Haynesville side. You obviously have two attractive projects coming on later in the year, but as you see this LNG growth happening on the Gulf Coast, what will be the demand pull on the Haynesville Basin, and how can Williams benefit from all these projects?
Larry Larson: Yes. This is Larry. I'll take that question. Yeah, obviously, we've got the lake project that's coming online here in third quarter this year that's going to create a lot of additional delivery capacity out of the Haynesville. And as we continue to see more and more projects get sanctioned as well as come online over the next few years, we do expect it to be a pretty significant demand pull on the Haynesville supply, and we're working very closely with our customers on potential other projects that could materialize, I think, over the next couple of years. I think right now they're kind of growing back and building up the supply into existing capacity as we saw the pullback from last year, but I think if you look at that outlook over the next several years, we're seeing tremendous pull on the Haynesville several BCF over the next few years just to be able to meet the growing LNG demand. So we anticipate there'll be more projects to come.
Manav Gupta: Perfect. My quick follow-up is, you have a long-term guidance of 5% to 7% EBITDA growth, but the project lineup is looking very attractive. So I'm just trying to understand for 26 and 27, what could push this more towards like 7% versus 5% or even higher for 26 and 27? What could drive you towards the top end of that guide? Thank you.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I would just say we've had that 5% to 7% for quite some time and we have been outperforming on that. And the amount of high return projects that are coming at us right now would certainly drive us towards the higher end of that. And so, one of the challenges has been in the coming years, we continue to beat our prior year estimates. So, you know, the percentage raise gets to be tougher and tougher. But I would say right now, given the projects that we have coming at us, I do think that we certainly have the ability to be towards the higher end of that, even acknowledging the law of big numbers. And so, it is a pretty, you know, exciting time to think that you can continue this pace at the scale that we're operating in.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Zack Van Everen of TPH&Co.
Zack Van Everen: Thanks for taking my questions and congrats to the team. Maybe just sticking on the power projects, could you remind us or give a little bit more details on the gas demand for Socrates? How much you expect that project to pull in, whether it's Sequent delivering it or just off of your pipelines?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. It's a fairly modest amount of gas. It's under 100 million cubic feet a day for Socrates and we will be sourcing gas off of two different pipelines in Ohio. We'll be building pipeline interconnections and laterals to connect the Socrates sites. There are two sites connected to those pipeline supplies. And yes, Sequent will be providing the services on behalf of the customer to make sure that we can buy that gas and deliver that gas to the customer.
Zack Van Everen: Got you. That makes sense. And then maybe one on Cogentrix. Should we think of these earnings as more of marketing style earnings, you know, higher in the winter or are there some fixed contracts on the gas side that will have a base earnings for this business?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I'd say more to come as we spend more time with the Cogentrix team. But for the most part, we do see these earnings as fairly stable. They're going to be reported in our sequent marketing business, but we would expect that the run rate earnings to be fairly stable based on what we've seen from historic performance. But also, you know, we like the fundamentals and the setup over time, you know, as we think we'll continue to see increasing capacity pricing and spark spreads. But again, you know, the focus for us is on a stable, fairly predictable addition to the sequent business, but a vehicle that's really going to position us to understand those markets and we think drive additional core business based on that engagement.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley of Wolfe Research.
Keith Stanley: I wanted to ask on the pace of potential data center projects from here. So the website says you could provide a gigawatt of power solutions to data centers by 2027, which would be quite fast. I'm curious if that's tied to supply chain constraints or any other inputs. And then it seems on the call, you were kind of implying more spacing of these projects with the next two through the end of the decade. So just a sense of what's realistic as far as timing and stringing together more of these projects.
Chad Zamarin: Yes, thanks. This is Chad again. First, I'd say there is certainly going to be some tempering of pace based on supply chain, but we've done a really good job. The team's done a great job of getting out and securing slots within the vendor community to make sure that we can deliver projects. You know, putting exact numbers on is tough, but in that gigawatt, range by the end of 26, I think is reasonable. I think layering by 27 is certainly reasonable. I think layering in that kind of scale is absolutely doable. I will say we're also working with companies that have purchased or have space from a turbine and power generation perspective. We are on these first projects doing the entire project ourselves, but our goal is to bring whatever capabilities we can to put solutions together for customers. So I do think we've got the ability to work with others that may have equipment deliveries and find projects to put to work. But again, our goal is to layer this in in a way that complements the balance sheet capacity, that doesn't stress the credit metrics, and we'll layer in projects year-over-year, I think likely through the end of the decade.
Keith Stanley: And sorry, to clarify on that, the one gigawatt by the end of 2027 is to have those projects online by the end of 27 or to FID them by the end of 27?
Chad Zamarin: No, those would be online.
Keith Stanley: Okay, great. Thanks for that. Second question I wanted to ask on Northwest Pipeline, there's a proposed larger project out there to add looping and compression and bring gas from Wyoming to the Pacific Northwest. Can you talk to the potential size of that investment for that project, timing, and how likely it is to move forward?
Alan Armstrong: Well, I would just say, if you're seeing it in our materials, obviously there's pretty good likelihood it'll be moving forward because it's come through a pretty rigorous test to get to that point. But there is a number of parties to contract with on that project, and effectively, some of those projects are effectively providing power generation in Idaho, a lot of it is providing power generation in Idaho for the benefit of Oregon and Washington because they don't want to put emissions in their own state. But so that's just providing an opportunity for Idaho and for some of the power generation there. So we'll see how that goes. I will say we were very surprised over the last four or five months how many new projects have started to emerge out west as they realize how much they need power in those markets as well, so both on Mountain West in the Salt Lake area and then up through Idaho and even along the coastline. So more to come on that, but I would say that's probably been one of my bigger surprises over the last six months in terms of all the facets of growth we have is how much that's picking up in that area. And people are starting to realize that they are going to need reliable power generation in those markets. So, you know, I think one thing, though, that is something to keep your eye on is a lot of big coal plants in those markets. And with the effort to maintain coal plants, which I think given the power demand issues we have is not a terrible idea, that we may see some of that coal remain online out there. So that's to be determined, but that is a potential shift in those markets out there. But the Salt Lake area and the Idaho area are getting pretty hot in terms of power demands for data centers in those markets, and we absolutely are going to be a part of providing those solutions. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes the Q&A portion of our call. I will now turn it over to President and CEO, Alan Armstrong for closing remarks.
Alan Armstrong: Okay, great. Well, thanks, everyone. Certainly appreciate your time today. I'm just going to wrap up by saying that I have seen firsthand what this company can accomplish, and I'm confident our best chapters are still ahead of us as demand for natural gas continues to accelerate and the value of our critical energy infrastructure is realized. You should be confident, as I certainly am, that the company is in the hands of trusted and capable leaders who have a passion for Williams and its vision to be the very best energy infrastructure company in the U.S. And so, with that, I just want to say a final thank you to investors and the analysts that have followed us for so many years and appreciate your confidence in the company. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-13 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to The Williams’ Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to first speaker today, Danilo Juvane, Vice President of Investor Relations, ESG and Investment Analysis. Please go ahead.
Danilo Juvane: Thanks Marvin and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in The Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon we released our earnings press release and the presentation that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and our Chief Financial Officer, John Porter, who will speak to this morning. Also joining us on the call today are Micheal Dunn, our Chief Operating Officer; Lane Wilson, our General Counsel; and Chad Zamarin, our Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development. In our presentation materials, you’ll find a disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to our remarks and you should review it. Also included in the presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconcile with generally accepted accounting principles. And these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the day’s presentation material. So with that, I’ll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong: Great. Well thanks Danilo and thank you all for joining us today. We have a very positive story to share with you today on our fourth quarter performance, but even more so on how 2024 has really driven positive momentum for growth in 2025 and beyond. So beginning here on Slide 2 is a look back at some highlights from 2024. I’ll start by noting that this winter Transco has experienced unprecedented demand for both natural gas and importantly for peak capacity on our system. In fact, last month we set an all time record moving 522 million decotherms, or about 10% more than the previous monthly record that occurred during January of 2022. Despite the milder weather for this time around, we had back to back to back all time peak days with each one surpassing the previous due to consistent widespread demand across the Northeast Carolinas and the Southeast. And in fact 17 of the 20 highest volume days that we’ve ever recorded on Transco happened just this winter. And it wasn’t just due to cold weather. It was from a combination of heating, power generation loads and LNG exports along the Transco corridor. So we are really rewriting the history book on peak days and we remain convinced that our strategy of staying intensely focused on natural gas infrastructure is in the very early innings of paying off for our shareholders. But a good strategy also has to be married up with crisp execution and our team continues to deliver in a big way on executing large scale expansion projects in a very reliable manner for our customers. And these aren’t the run of the mill projects. They include expanding in some of the toughest areas like 8,800 foot of water depth on our well project that came in well under the original budget, or even more hostile places like New Jersey for our regional Energy Access project. And then in December we brought on the Southside Reliability Enhancement project in Virginia. And for the sake of our customers and the consumers in these areas, it’s a good thing that we did as both REA and the Southside Reliability Enhancement Project are running at full contracted capacity. Despite the opposition claiming they weren’t necessary, the irony is that even though the opposition has been motivated by greenhouse gas emission concerns, these expansions have been key in reducing emissions in the areas by avoiding fuel switching to oil and coal. Not only do we have clear line of sight for the full roster of projects and execution, but we continue to commercialize vital high return projects across our footprint. To that point, we announced six new transmission projects and continue a steady beat of actualizing these new projects. We also further optimize our asset portfolio by consolidating our interest in the Gulf in the Deepwater Discovery System and the Wamsutter upstream joint venture and we also divested our interest in Aux Sable last year. Moving across the slide, I’ll call out our emission reduction project. We’ve long stated that our natural gas focused strategy remains synonymous with sustainability and last year we continued efforts to drive out emissions from our system by replacing 92 compressor units, most of which were over 50 years old. And these older units were certainly not designed to limit NOx or methane emissions. So a tremendous job by our team of getting this important work done in time to be included in the latest Transco rate case and again very crisp execution on some very complex projects across the system. Looking at earnings growth, we reported another year of record adjusted EBITDA, which marks the 12th consecutive year that we’ve grown our earnings. Important to note that 2024’s earnings record was achieved in a backdrop of natural gas prices that averaged about $2.20 per MMBtu, and this was nearly as low as the average price of nearly $2 that we saw during the pandemic in 2020 just to put that in context. So this really does continue to underscore the resiliency of our business through a number of price cycles. So I’m very pleased with our 2024 performance and the long track record of growth, but the fundamentals ahead of us present an even more fruitful environment on a per share growth basis in 2025 and beyond, which I’ll dive into here in the next slide. Our keen focus here on Slide 3, our keen focus on industry leading returns remains a key driver of earnings growth in 2025 and beyond, and I’ll highlight a few notable drivers here. First, we are placing into service eight interstate transmission projects totalling 1.25 Bcf per day over the course of the year. In addition, we will also benefit from a full year’s earnings contribution from recently completed projects such as Regional Energy Access, the Southside Reliability Enhancement, the Carolina Market Link and the Uintah Basin expansion on the Mountain West Transmission system. Also of note, our guidance includes conservative earnings expectations from the Transco rate case, especially considering the large amount of capital we have invested over the last few years in things like our emission reduction projects and other large maintenance projects on the Transco system. In the deepwater we will have four projects commence service during 2025, including the well expansion which Shell began producing into here in January, and these additions will lead to a significant earnings increase from our Gulf of America assets in 2025 and 2026. In our Gathering and Processing business, we will place two large Haynesville projects in service this year, including the Louisiana Energy Gateway project that will come on in the second half of the year and also drive earnings in 2025 and 2026. And we should see a stronger environment for Gathering volumes with the current 12-month strip averaging around $4 per MMBtu versus the $2.20 that drove price related shut-ins last year. To be clear, our guidance does not anticipate a big ramp up in drilling activity, just a lower level of price related curtailment that we saw last year. And as I mentioned earlier, we’re continuing to invest in our business through strategic bolt-on acquisitions. In the Wamsutter we purchased the remaining 25% interest in our upstream JV by controlling these upstream operations and development it will ensure that Williams can maximize the long-term value of the total asset by better leveraging our existing midstream and downstream assets and in doing so capture significant margin on each molecule through gathering, processing, NGL, transportation and fractionation. So lots of incremental value for us coming off this asset as we focus on developing this large play and really driving the free cash flow through our midstream systems. In the DJ Basin, we acquired Rimrock, adding another gas gathering and processing system to integrate into our footprint and add value to the downstream NGL assets. Given the strong fundamentals around our strategic asset footprint, we remain positioned to continue growing our business beyond 2025. I’m pleased to announce two additional projects on the Northwest Pipeline system in addition to the three that we announced last quarter. These are a clear indication of the incremental needs for natural gas consumption in the Northwest that seems to be gaining momentum. Within our Gulf Coast storage facilities, I’m pleased to announce that we are advancing a 10 Bcf capacity expansion that will support industrial, power generation and LNG demand for natural gas as these sectors ramp up and the usage of clean, affordable natural gas supplies. So, really excited to see the support out there for expanding our storage facilities that we acquired just last year. We continue to close on agreements that support our backlog of 30 interstate transmission projects and we are moving attractive projects such as the Dalton Lateral expansion on Transco and the five recently announced projects on Northwest Pipeline from our backlog into execution and have continued to successfully refill the sales funnel, supporting growth beyond 2025. Important to note, this interstate transmission backlog does not include direct investment in data center projects that are currently in development. These projects are moving at a very fast pace and the most mature of these has gone far enough to fully support us ordering all of the major equipment and long lead items for this first project. And we will be announcing more details on this project in the near future once we have a fully binding agreement with this large, creditworthy customer. This deal will contain terms similar to the high value transmission projects that we have been executing along our system. So, really excited about that project and would tell you that a lot of things to handle on the PR and government relations side before we get out in front of ourselves with an announcement on that, but we are really excited about the way that project has moved on very quickly for us. So here on Slide 4, our natural gas focused strategy has differentiated us from our peers and it continues to drive profitable growth year-after-year. Not only have we delivered record EBITDA in 2024, but we have done so with the same share count and without stretching the balance sheet, as evidenced by our EPS growing at an impressive 14% compound annual growth rate over the past five years. This growth has been driven by our sharp project execution where in the past four years we have placed 17 large scale projects in service with an additional 14 projects in execution today. What stands out the most here, again distinct from many of our peers, is the quality of the returns that we are seeing from these projects. Equally impressive is the commercial activity behind our attractive asset footprint which continues to give us confidence in delivering on at least our long-term 5% to 7% earnings growth objective without issuing equity or stretching our balance sheet. To go further, the strong natural gas fundamentals have us positioned to potentially exceed our long-term earnings growth objectives over the next five years as we gain clear line of sight to the impacts of LNG exports, coal-to-gas switching particularly out west as we’re seeing that rapidly change and industrial reshoring and using our skill sets to help solve demand for a whole new customer segment that is looking for highly reliable, fast-to-market and fast following power generation. So, we are really excited at how attractive the current macro environment is in supporting the long-term growth of our business. And with that I will turn it over to John to walk through our financial metrics. John?
John Porter: All right, thanks Alan. Starting here on Slide 6, let’s begin by looking at the longer trend of our financial performance for the company. Starting with adjusted EBITDA in the upper left corner which grew about $300 million in 2024 or about over 2023. At $7.08 billion our 2024 result exceeded our original adjusted EBITDA guidance of $6.95 billion by $130 million in a year where Henry Hub Natural Gas prices averaged about $2.20, which was almost 18% lower than our original business plan assumptions for 2024. On the following slides, we’ll talk about our revised 2025 guidance which features a 3% increase in our adjusted EBITDA midpoint. And as you can see here, delivering on that $7.65 billion midpoint would drive an 8% 5-year CAGR, a growth rate that continues to exceed the high end of our long-term growth rate of 5% to 7%. Our adjusted EPS for 2024 finished above the high end of our original guidance range and at midpoint for 2025, our adjusted EPS will see an impressive 30% 5-year CAGR. Our available funds from operations per share for 2024 also exceeded the high end of our original guidance. At midpoint for 2025, it will grow at a 9% 5-year CAGR. And our dividend will grow at about a 5% 5-year CAGR, while maintaining strong dividend coverage. Some of that dividend coverage has been based on what are increasingly looking like conservative cash tax assumptions, which I’ll discuss further on the next slide. And then finally, you see the improvement we’ve made to our balance sheet strength over these last five years with an 18% improvement in our key leverage metric, finishing favorably to our 2024 original guidance for leverage and with 2025 leverage that’s forecasted to move us close to the low end of our leverage target range of 3.5x to 4x. We’ve got a lot more information about 2024 performance in the appendix. As Alan mentioned, we were impressed with the outperformance of the business up against a tough natural gas price environment where we saw substantial volume curtailments throughout the year. The trends on this slide demonstrates the consistently strong performance of our business through various commodity cycles with a business that is primarily levered to the growth of natural gas volumes and reserved pipeline capacity. Our natural gas-focused portfolio has consistently driven strong earnings growth through high returning capital projects, and our balance sheet strength has allowed for additional growth contributions through immediately accretive bolt-on acquisitions without the use of any equity issuance during this time frame. So having covered the longer trend of our strong financial performance for the company, let’s turn our attention once again to the year ahead with a refresh of the 2025 guidance that we originally issued in February of 2024. So here, you can see on the left side, a few key elements of our original 2025 guidance and on the right, you can see the updates that we have for you today. Starting with adjusted EBITDA, you see our original midpoint of guidance was $7.4 billion, and now we’re moving that midpoint to $7.65 billion, so an increase of $250 million. $7.65 billion would drive an impressive 8% growth in this metric over 2024 as well as a 5-year CAGR of 8%. That $250 million increase in guidance is split between incremental growth from the business since last year and the effects of the Crowheart JV consolidation and the Rimrock acquisition. In the Northeast, we’ve generally shifted expectations a bit lower in certain dry gas areas, but those reductions have been more than offset by improvements in the Northeast liquids-rich areas. In the deepwater, we have seen some producer customer delays that have unfavorably impacted the expected ramp in our growth projects, Shenandoah and Whale. And finally, in the West, we’ve seen some overall modest net improved expectations and additionally, our marketing business is off to a good start with the cold weather that we saw in January of 2025. So we are encouraged by this increase in our adjusted EBITDA guidance that would drive 8% growth over 2024 and that 8% 5-year CAGR as well. Shifting now to AFFO per share, where we’re moving last year’s $4.25 to $4.50, basically just tracking with the expected increases that we just discussed in adjusted EBITDA. I will point out that we continue to not assume any benefit from restoration of 100% bonus depreciation or any other favorable changes in the corporate alternative minimum tax both of which are being discussed as elements of possible tax legislation for 2025. Our current guidance of AFFO assumes around $300 million of cash taxes and restoration of 100% bonus depreciation for 2025 could kept that amount roughly in half, adding approximately another $0.12 in AFFO per share. And most of the cash tax that would remain would be related to the corporate alternative minimum tax, which, of course, can be applied against future regular cash tax amounts owed. However, even without any tax benefits, the $4.50 of AFFO per share in our revised guidance covers our expected $2 per share dividend about 2.25x after growing that dividend 5.3%. Favorable developments on the cash tax front would further increase our AFFO per share growth rate and potentially serve as a catalyst for additional dividend growth. Finishing this slide up, you’ll see improved leverage guidance of 3.55x even after further fueling our 2025 growth with the acquisitions that we’ve discussed. And also, you’ll see no change to our growth CapEx guidance for 2025 at $1.8 billion, excluding acquisitions. So that covers the major pieces of our 2025 guidance update. As Alan highlighted, 2025 is an exciting year for our company with full year contributions from last year’s completed projects as well as eight additional transmission expansion projects and four deepwater projects coming online in 2025. We’ve got a major Transco rate case with the initiation of cash returns on our ERP investments over the last few years. We’ve got expectations for an improved G&P, Gathering & Processing environment versus 2024 for the Northeast and for the West, including our Louisiana Energy Gateway project. And then finally, we’ll see continued growth from our strategic bolt-on acquisitions. Finally, before I turn it back over to Alan, I’d like to cover one more financial performance topic here on Slide 8. For many years, we’ve highlighted the strong cash returns we’ve generated from our capital investments. And we’ve talked about the proof of those cash returns showing up in balance sheet improvement and per share growth driven by a lack of issuing any equity to fuel our growth. Last fall, we were pleased to see sell-side research that highlighted the strength of our cash returns on invested capital, which placed us first among seven of our closest peers for the 2018 to 2023 time frame. On this slide, we’ve mapped out those cash return on invested capital values along the horizontal axis and then we’ve also charted leverage reduction over this period on the vertical axis. The result really shows the strength of the nearly 23% cash return on investment we’ve achieved during this timeframe, which drove a 26% reduction in leverage and additionally we saw a 19% CAGR on our adjusted EPS during this same timeframe with no equity issuances since the buy in of Williams Partners in 2018. We are certainly pleased with the financial performance we saw during this period of 2018 through 2023. However, we are even more excited about the next five years based on the accelerating growth drivers for natural gas volumes and pipeline capacity. So with that I’ll turn it back over to Alan.
Alan Armstrong: Okay. Well, thanks, John. Just a few closing remarks before we turn it over to your questions. We’ve been implementing our long-term strategy to bring Williams to where we are today with a healthy balance sheet and a clear line of sight to the full portfolio of high return projects. During these early years of what is shaping up to be the golden age of natural gas, our natural gas focused strategy is taking hold in a powerful way that is delivering robust growth and compounding returns for our shareholders. Simply put, no one is better positioned than Williams to benefit from the natural gas demand fundamentals. Now, under the Trump administration and a Republican Congress, the U.S. is seeing changes in energy policy that are aimed at bolstering energy independence and economic growth. This policy shift underscores the importance of our country’s strategic initiatives and positions the U.S. to take full advantage of the evolving energy landscape. However, to fully realize our potential and maintain our leadership position as a country, we have to be able to unlock some of the nation’s largest natural gas resources in places like the Marcellus and the Utica. With the support of the administration and potential permitting reform, Williams stands ready both to help solve this problem and to be a major beneficiary of it. Pipelines power America and our country and its citizens have reaped the benefits of this large scale infrastructure for years. We should not take this historical benefit for granted and let competing countries rapidly build out their own infrastructure to capture tomorrow’s opportunities. This is an important moment for our country and Williams has the right strategy, team and experience to deliver on the opportunities that we see ahead. And with that, I’ll open it up for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Theresa Chen of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Theresa Chen: Good morning. On the gas to power side of things, specifically related to data centers in relation to the opportunity that you alluded to earlier, Alan, what is it going to take to get something like this across the finish line and beyond this opportunity, can you help us lay out the addressable market ahead of you within this theme? How have other commercial discussions progressed and how can Williams participate and capture economic value here?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Theresa, thank you. I’m going to take the first part of that and then I’ll ask Chad to fill in on that. First as to what it takes in terms of getting things completed, I would just say, as I mentioned, we are very far along in the process and have full support from the counterparty for going ahead and acquiring the major equipment and long lead items. However, if you think about the complexity of land siding, air permits, a lot of the regulatory issues that need to be dealt with, a lot of that needs to make sure that that has cleared and you’ve gone and checked with all the bases and the key stakeholders before you put those announcements out there. So things are moving very fast. I can tell you, kind of faster than for the scale of projects that we’re talking about, a lot faster than we would normally see. But in doing so, we need to make sure that we’ve laid the groundwork adequately at the government affairs and public relations side to be able to make those announcements. And I think we’re more focused on making the project successful than we are beating somebody to the punch on making an announcement. And so I think that’s what’s driving us today. In terms of other alternatives, other projects a lot is happening on that front, but a lot of those areas require gas pipeline infrastructure, expansions, and a lot of work that goes into that. I would tell you the thing that I think has impressed us the most though is the desire for speed on these projects. And that that probably the one thing that is moving the fastest, but again our counterparties, particularly the big folks that they’re not really in a race to get an announcement out there and they’re the customer and we’re going to honor that as we move through these projects. So Chad, I’ll turn it to you, if you had anything to add.
Chad Zamarin: Yes, I would just add that, I don’t think, I think we are really well-positioned. We’ve been very intentional in creating a full suite of capabilities within the natural gas value chain. And so we are focused on project development. And I think as Alan said, not just announcing opportunities but developing projects the same way that we develop a Transco expansion project. And so what it would take for us to get to announcement is you’ll expect to see us have fully contracted commitments from high quality customers and we are developing projects to the point where when you see announcements that will be effectively shovel ready to start to start those projects and what I would say is we are – we have developed the capabilities to provide across the full value chain. There are projects that we’re pursuing that will be pipeline interconnects and laterals and gas supply services to customers. But also as Alan mentioned, we have the capability to go all the way to delivering power generation on the footstep of data center project. And so that’s what we’ve been working on. And once we’re fully contracted for a project, you’ll see an announcement. It’ll look a lot like any other large scale transmission project that we would pursue.
Theresa Chen: Thank you. And related to your gas storage project, clearly, this is a part of the overall value chain that is seeing significant need for investment. Can you remind us how much expansion capability do you have remaining across your footprint and what do the economics look like for something like this?
Micheal Dunn: Hey, Theresa, this is Micheal. Yeah, I think we’ve got a lot of opportunities within our Gulf Coast Storage opportunity that where we acquired those last year – or sorry earlier this year and this is just the first one of those, a 10 Bcf expansion, which is about a 20% increase at that location. But we’ve got opportunities out in the west as well. The Clay Basin storage facility is something that we’re keen on getting expansions done there. The interruptible expansion that we’ve done is already in place and hopefully we can convert that to firm storage at some point in the future with some pretty nominal investment on our part. So we’re certainly exploring those opportunities and it looks to us now that prices have come up, especially in the Gulf Coast area that where we can accomplish these brownfield storage expansions and get nice returns on those, and certainly comparable to what we’re seeing on our [indiscernible] projects across the transmission footprint.
Theresa Chen: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Praneeth Satish of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Praneeth Satish: Thanks. Good morning. So maybe just staying on this behind the meter opportunity, the first one that you’re close to the finish line on, can you help frame how large of a project it is? Is it kind of in the $1 billion range, just trying to figure out the scale. And then secondly, can you help us understand how scalable this opportunity is given supply chain constraints around turbines? I know speed to market is the main selling point here, but I guess, how fast can you get both this solution up and running and future solutions up and running?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Praneeth, I would just say, this will be a meaningful project in terms of impact on our capital budget and this is not in our current capital plan. So just in terms of the size of the capital, this will be a very meaningful capital project and it’ll come pretty fast, a lot faster than the typical transmission project would come. In terms of the scalability, you’re spot on that there is like – we think there’s likely to be a constraint hit on power generation equipment. We’ve been very pleased with what we’ve been able to pull together in that regard. But I do think that these opportunities, that’s a likely point of constraint is power generation equipment. So far, we’ve got capacity, it helps that we’re such a large buyer of equipment already in that regard and have key relationships that have certainly helped us on this transaction. But I do think that, that is a limitation that will hit this market, it is the power generation equipment.
Chad Zamarin: Yes. And I would just add, I do think though, we do see line of sight. I don’t want to get too far ahead of this first – the first project that we might announce. But I do think we see line of sight to be able to layer projects in over time, that supply chain will lead to us layering in projects maybe further out. But there is a speed to market opportunity ahead of us. I think there’s also a likely ongoing need for a combination of grid expansion and behind the meter solutions to support the need of data center development, at least through the end of the decade. And so our strategy would be to continue to layer on projects, even more predictable ongoing basis with obviously the earliest projects being the nearest to be at service.
Praneeth Satish: Got it. That’s helpful. And then one thing that surprised us is the 2025 CapEx guidance, $1.8 billion that was maintained despite the opportunity set. And it looks like you’ve got a good amount of white space for more investments, I think, around $400 million to $500 million of excess free cash flow in 2025. So maybe you could just help us think through two things first. What is your willingness to flex CapEx higher in 2025 if this BTM, behind the meter project goes through are some of those 30 potential front-of-meter projects? And then secondly, what’s your philosophical approach to pushing closer to free cash flow breakeven levels or even exceeding it in 2025 or 2026 if you’ve got the right projects?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Well, first of all, as I mentioned, that project, despite the fact that we’ve made equipment orders that are fully supported by the counterparty that is not included yet in our capital and won’t be until we fully consummate the final agreements on that. But in terms of our capacity, yes, I think we have plenty of capacity, and I think we’ll remain very disciplined because the kind of returns that we’re seeing are very attractive returns and well above the multiples on our cost of capital. So we certainly have the capacity to go after that, and we really will continue to look at things from a risk-adjusted return up against our set of opportunities. So I actually see the – certainly, we’re not going to stretch the balance sheet. And so that’s a limitation. We’re not going to go there. And we certainly are proud of the fact that we’ve gotten to where we are today without issuing equity, and we think that distinguishes us in the space. So I think those are kind of limitations on the upper end against the projects that we have out there in front of us, and therefore, it becomes just a survival of the fittest within our capital allocation plan on a risk adjusted return basis. And that’s really how we’ll continue to look at things.
Praneeth Satish: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Neel Mitra of Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Neel Mitra: Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you could give your outlook for gathering volumes in the Northeast into Haynesville. I think you mentioned that you didn’t expect a big uptick in activity, but some of the shut ins and turned in line wells that were delayed to come on. Just wondering what your producers are indicating now that we’re in a much higher gas price environment in 2025 than 2024?
Micheal Dunn: Hey Neel, it’s Michael. Yes, I think we’ve still got the ducts and the tills, the deferred tills that our producer customers are still holding back on. And we’ll see those come on as prices continue to firm up and they bring those volumes on. But we still think we’ve got close to 3 Bcf a day of IP that’s out there that could come on throughout the year at some point between the ducts and the deferred tills. The producers are talking about a lot of capital discipline as well, and they’re talking about pricing needed to be sustained and much higher than even where it is today, possibly for rig activity to increase. And so we’re taking a pretty optimistic approach, but pragmatic as well in regard to what our guidance is embedded in it, and certainly I think pricing will help producers ultimately make the decision to start drilling at a higher activity rate than they were last year. But right now we’re pretty optimistic about the ability to bring on gas very quickly, should the prices justify that for the producers where the ducts are? We’ve got those connections virtually already made, so they can get to market pretty quickly if they’re ready to do so.
Neel Mitra: Okay. Great. And not to beat a dead horse on the power generation opportunities, but wanted to ask, what gives you a competitive advantage in kind of being ahead in the supply chain for turbines, given that’s the main supply chain constraint? Is it because you have ordered so many high horsepower compressors through the Transco rate case and upgraded that system? And essentially those can be used as power generation turbines? I’m just trying to understand how you’re able to kind of scale that versus some of your competitors.
Alan Armstrong: Yes, you got right on it there. The same drivers that are used for our large compressor systems are the same drivers that are used for power generation on simple cycle turbines. And so when you’re talking speed to market, the simple cycle turbines are going to be the ones that are going to be getting utilized, and it is the same equipment on the power side or on the driver side of the project. So, yes, that puts us in a very advanced position given the amount of purchasing power that we have on that front.
Neel Mitra: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan Securities. Your line is now open.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning.
Alan Armstrong: Good morning.
Micheal Dunn: Hey, good morning.
Jeremy Tonet: Just wanted to come back to the servicing data center opportunity set. I was just curious, I guess, how you think about the opportunities across your footprint, be it in Pennsylvania or Texas or Wyoming. Do those solutions – possible solutions look different in any state? It seems like in Wyoming with these recent acquisitions you now have gas supply, GMP, pipes, marketing, land that could really be a compelling offering there. So just wondering how you think about what the opportunities look like from location to location.
Alan Armstrong: Yes, Jeremy, you are right. We do have some very attractive features and attributes that we bring to the table in some of those areas for the – particularly for hyperscalers that are looking to set up new opportunities. And so I do think – as Chad mentioned, we do think that we’ll see a series of those kind of opportunities continue to build out over time. And so you are right. I think we’re extremely well positioned in a lot of those areas and we are seeing a lot of activity. But it does – it takes a lot of time to bring to fruition, setting up a whole new campus area, if you will. So, but places like the Salt Lake market is a great area for us and we’re extremely well positioned out there. We’re really excited about some of the development we’re seeing out there as well as a state that has been working hard to provide a friendly environment for development out there as well. So I tell you, the grids as well as the state politics are going to be pretty critical at trying to be able to keep up with the pace that’s out there. And that is going to drive some of the winners and losers on this. And you certainly are seeing – particularly for the big hyperscale projects, you’re certainly seeing people start to look back to the areas where the energy resources are like Wyoming where you have both the wind and the gas resources in the area and are not constrained. But I think that’s kind of at least chapter two in this process because those are big long-term projects to develop. So I think in some of those areas that will be kind of chapter two on this spread.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That’s helpful. Thanks. And just want to dive into Pennsylvania a little bit more if we could. As far as we can see in this date, if we look at constraints, electric transmission relative to natural gas transmission, it seems like on the electric transmission side there’s not the same constraints as we see on the gas side. Just given that it’s hard to get new interstate pipes built and so if there is ample supply and it’s tough to get the gas out of the state, potentially lower gas prices could feed a higher electricity prices, a wider spark spread. And given your position there, it seems like Williams could possibly take advantage of the wider economic rent there, just wondering if there’s any thoughts you could share?
Micheal Dunn: Yes, I think what I’d share and maybe just also related to Alan’s prior comments around the activity we’re seeing for increased power demand, data centers. Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, been kind of the most mature markets to date. I do think the way we will think about it is, we can offer a natural gas solution that is even potentially more competitive than grid power for projects along our footprint. And so we are seeing that opportunity. I think it’s yes, there’s a desire for speed to market. There’s obviously challenges with not just the speed of expansion of the grid, but also the cost and even some of the social public, I think concerns around reliability and cost to the consumer. And so, I think it presents a great opportunity, not just in Pennsylvania, but certainly in those core areas of our footprint to provide a solution directly to these new loads that is both very cost effective, low emissions and in many cases a better solution than grid capacity. So that’s certainly part of the theme that we’re pursuing, not just for data centers, but across the whole footprint.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Makes sense. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta of UBS. Your line is now open.
Manav Gupta: Good morning. You raised the guidance by 3%, which was very positive. Help us understand what could push you towards the top end of that guidance for 2025?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, yes. Good morning, Manav. Thanks for the question. We’ve got a pretty wide range there and I think a lot of that would have to do with what exactly we do see in some of the gathering and processing areas. For example, we discussed this morning that we are remaining fairly conservative about overall growth levels in some of our gathering and processing areas. We actually pulled back pretty significantly in some of the dry gas areas versus our original guidance. And so there’s always definitely room that we could see outperformance around the producer customers in some of these gathering and processing areas. Sequent, as we all know, is a little bit of a hard one to predict. Maybe to just touch on that. We still have a pretty wide range of potential outcomes for Sequent, but we did get a strong start to the year here with January. So, we’re pretty confident we’ll beat $100 million or so for Sequent this year, but still really unclear whether we would get back to a level like we saw in 2024, which was $215 million. So some range of potential outcomes that you could see around Sequent. Continuing on, I mean, we talked about the number of projects that we have coming in service this year. Early in service dates for a project always represents a potential upside to our base case. And as I mentioned earlier, we do have a number of projects coming online. We also have the Transco rate case, which we hope to settle this year if we can. And we’ve got, I would say, a fairly conservative assumption embedded in our guidance. We did not change that assumption relative to the original guidance that we put out in February of last year, too. So really, a number of different things that could come together, each one of them or a combination of those factors that could drive us more toward the high end of guidance.
Manav Gupta: Perfect. I’ll just quickly follow up, Slide 35. Can you talk a little bit more about the coal to gas switching opportunities and how they are progressing as you see out there?
Alan Armstrong: Slide 35, was that Manav?
Manav Gupta: Yes, sir. Ample coal-to-gas switching opportunities, potential for 8.4 Bcf gas growth.
Alan Armstrong: Sure. This is just showing within our footprint what we’re seeing out there from coal-to-gas switching. I will tell you the area that we really kind of has taken off in that regard has been out in the MountainWest region where we’ve seen a lot of big conversions on some very large plants like the Jim Bridger plant and the Naughton coal plant, which are in the Wyoming area there. So we are really starting to see a lot of the big plant operators out there make those kind of commitments. Obviously, we’ve been seeing that in the Southeast and the Mid Atlantic for some time, we have a project in Alabama that is specifically focused on repowering a Alabama Power plant to coal. So, we are capturing a lot of those projects as we speak. And it’s not really a big stretch for us to capture a lot of these projects, particularly out West, as you can see, those are right on proximity to our systems out there. And we’re seeing some strong interest from the big power player out there in converting those plants. So this continues to be kind of a drumbeat for us in a lot of these markets. The Dalton Lateral expansion project that we announced last quarter there in Northern Georgia is partially a conversion of coal as well as an expansion of power generation opportunity in that area as well. So we are seeing a pretty steady drumbeat on this opportunity.
Manav Gupta: Thank you so much. I’ll turn it over.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities. Your line is now open.
Jack Wilson: Yeah. Hey, good morning. This is Jack Wilson on for Neil. Could we maybe just double click on the momentum you’re seeing in The Northwest looks like you’ve got about 580 [ph] additional capacity coming on by 2028. Do you see additional headroom beyond that or is that kind of reaching saturation in that market?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. No. Jack, I would say in the last six to nine months, this has been the area where I think we’ve all been kind of surprised in our monthly commercial review meetings. We’ve just been really surprised with the amount of continued demand for capacity expansions out there and has actually gone faster than we’ve expected it to. But I would tell you that based on some requests for service that we’ve seen recently, this is going to – I would expect this to grow even faster than what we’ve seen here recently. So lots going on out here and pretty exciting.
Jack Wilson: Okay. It sounds like continued opportunity up there. And then is there going to be any sort of cross-border impact? I think it’s the Huntingdon connector up there or is that kind of a non-factor?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, Jack, that’s a non-factor.
Jack Wilson: Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of John Mackay of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
John Mackay: Hey all, good morning. Thanks for the time. Last year you guys were pointing to potentially revising the long-term growth target of 5% to 7%, up or at least kind of talking about potential upside to that. Can you just frame up where that conversation stands now? Is that dependent on maybe formal FID of some of these data center projects? Maybe just walk us through that?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I would say that, and as I just mentioned, a lot of growth in the Northwest, one of the things that I think the market misses on this growth opportunity is that because we serve so many of the big utilities that in turn serve a lot of the data centers either on the gas side or on the power side. We’re seeing a lot of these expansions. And while everybody wants to just isolate it to what the actual project – direct project is, and certainly those will drive growth beyond 5% to 7%, I feel pretty confident at this point if we’re able to consummate projects that we’re finalizing. So the answer to that part of the question is yes. But I will just tell you that a lot of the growth like we’re seeing in the Northwest, ultimately that’s going to go to serve power generation demand, which will indirectly is being driven by a lot of the data center load. So while everybody’s kind of hyper focused on the individual project announcements, we’re seeing the impact of that growth show up in the way of IRPs from our utilities, which is in turn driving gas transformation demand on our systems. So I actually, I know people are super excited about the data center projects. If I were an analyst paying attention to this, I’d be more excited about seeing the kind of peak day demands that we saw on Transco this year and 10% growth in January that was not driven by weather over the previous cold snap. To me that is more the fundamental drivers of growth for our business. And I’d be paying attention to seeing these peak days continuing to be hit that are not being driven by heating degree days more so than these individual projects.
John Mackay: Yes. Thanks. Absolutely. That makes sense. Just second one from me, can you just remind us what the general strategy on the E&P side is just following the JV buy in? What’s kind of the long-term plan there?
Chad Zamarin: Yes. Thanks, John. This is Chad. Look, I think Alan said it on Wamsutter and we’ve talked about how powerful that basin is with respect to driving value through our Midstream infrastructure. We gather, we process, we move the NGLs through our NGL infrastructure, we fractionate the NGLs, we market the gas, the NGLs from that basin. And so very high margin from a production perspective. And we had a great partner with Crowheart and really thankful for what they did to help us consolidate that basin and position it for optimization. But if you look at that basin from an Upstream only perspective, you might not develop it the same way as you would when you think about maximizing the value of the downstream infrastructure. And that’s what our strategy is from an Upstream perspective. It’s all about driving value to our core business. And so the consolidation was all about making sure that we can drive the very best decisions from an Upstream development perspective to maximize the value of our downstream infrastructure. And so we’ve consolidated the economics now of that basin with our Midstream infrastructure and we’ll now work on making sure we’ve got that optimal development program that takes into account the full value chain. And it’ll take a bit of time to I think dial that in. And at that point, we’ll determine whether or not we need to be a long-term owner or we can then reposition the Upstream asset with an Upstream counterpart. But clearly the focus is on making sure that that basin gets optimal development to drive value to our downstream assets. And then still in Haynesville, we’ve pretty much achieved that. We’ve said before we’ve kind of step down the ownership there as was designed by the original partnership and GeoSouthern has been a great partner for us in the Haynesville that’s helped drive expansions of our gathering system and help support our LEG expansion project. And we have one more expansion project that we’re working on for our Midstream infrastructure that will add additional value for our Haynesville core business. And so that’s something we’re actively working on now and we would expect to accomplish hopefully this year. And at that point think we’re in a good position to move further towards disposition of the Haynesville asset.
John Mackay: All right. That’s clear. Thanks, Chad. Appreciate the time.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Keith Stanley: Hi, good morning. Wanted to follow up on the 5% to 7% long-term EBITDA growth target. Do you expect that to be pretty linear over time or lumpy? And I ask because there’s not a lot of major new projects starting up in 2026 and 2027, but you do have a lot of balance sheet capacity if you wanted to do more M&A. So just how you’re thinking about that?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. What I would say is we certainly don’t include all of our projects that would be driving 2027 growth. Obviously, you’ve seen the [indiscernible] project, which is a powerful growth driver, but we have a lot of other drivers of growth going on within the system, including what we think will have to be a big pull on gas ultimately to keep up with the demand, which will drive some pretty substantial increases in EBITDA on our gathering systems without capital. So the growth we’re going to see is going to be pretty powerful. And there’s really not a way to balance the market and the demand side without pulling on some of these big gathering systems and we are extremely well positioned to see the free cash flows generate off those assets. So actually, I would tell you, we’re always most excited about growth that comes without capital and I think we’re positioned to see a lot of that.
Keith Stanley: Thanks. One other follow-up just on the cash taxes. So $300 million you’re baking in for this year. I think you said with bonus depreciation extension that would be pretty much eliminated. Just can you give an update on path to being a full cash taxpayer both with and without bonus depreciation legislation?
John Porter: Yes, actually just to clarify, so it’s $300 million in the current AFFO guidance for 2025. Restoration of 100% bonus depreciation would cut that in half. And so that would be about $0.12 of AFFO per share, so pretty significant effect. What would be less would be corporate alternative minimum tax, which is also sort of under review and there’s been some proposals that especially for energy related firms that maybe we take another look at whether we should be doing that. All of that is, it would be speculative to be to assume that any of that makes it through, but it definitely are things that are being discussed right now. So a lot kind of to take in this year in terms of the future. What we’ve assumed in our long range plan, which I do believe is pretty conservative, is just a gradual ramp in our cash tax rate until we get toward the latter years of the decade where we start to become more of a full cash tax payer. I think there’s a lot of things that would be affecting that trajectory. If you get 100% bonus depreciation, it could be really impactful in this cycle of capital investment that we’re looking at. When you think about things like some of the behind the meter solutions, non-regulated CapEx projects that would fall under the bonus depreciation. So the ability to defer taxes, I think could be really accelerated with we get a change in the bonus depreciation and then we also see a cycle of strong capital investments, both of which seem like pretty good assumptions. But again, we’re being conservative. We’re not assuming that the bonus depreciation changes, but being conservative with our long range plans and maintaining strong dividend coverage accounting for that plan.
Keith Stanley: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Brandon Bingham of Scotiabank. Your line is now open.
Brandon Bingham: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions here. Just a couple of quick ones. I was wondering if you could maybe provide some incremental detail about the 30 or so projects in the backlog, just thinking things like composition and that 30 of project sizes and in service dates at a high level? And then if you have any thoughts on the likelihood of some of those projects coming to fruition, just if you maybe have like a risk outlook or a probability weighted outlook that you could speak to?
Alan Armstrong: John, you want to take that?
John Porter: Yes, the 30 Transco project I think cover – we’ve been providing this kind of a back – look at our backlog now for many years. And what we’ve seen over that timeframe is just a steady progress and moving projects through the backlog and into our guidance. So I think it’s pretty consistent with what you’ve seen in terms of the performance that we’ve had over the last many years. We do say here that they do cover a broad range of potential customer bases, industrial power and LNG facilities. Importantly, this 30 does not include the direct behind the meter type solutions. But we’re going to win some of these, we’re going to lose some of these, but what you’ve seen in our track record is a very consistent progress toward moving a substantial number of these from the sales funnel and then into our actual guidance. I don’t know, Michael, anything to add?
Micheal Dunn: No, I think you’ve got it right. Every one of these have a probability waiting on them as well. So, these are all specific discrete projects that we’ve identified and that we’re working to commercialize with customers and every one of them have a separate entity probability waiting for them.
Brandon Bingham: Awesome, awesome. Thanks. And then just real-quick if we could go back to the Haynesville, more looking towards the broader outlook here in the slides, you show kind of expected production growth through, I think 2033. And I was just wondering if you could provide some detail around some of the drivers behind it, activity schedules or just. Whatever you’re seeing baked into that outlook to get that growth and maybe how it compares to what you saw exiting 2024?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Yes. I’d say, first of all, when you think about long-term supply growth, I mean, fundamentally, we’ve got to match demand. And so, when you look at the amount of growth we’re going to see, we’re already seeing from LNG ramp through the end of the decade and even through the mid-2030s, more than doubling over the next decade, adding 10 plus BCF by the end of the decade. You’ve got the increase in power, load and demand. You’ve got the increase in industrial demand across the industry. Just solving for balancing supply and demand, you’re going to need to see significant growth out of the Haynesville. And that’s really where these forecasts, the longer term forecasts are derived from. Certainly in the near-term, I think we’ve spoken to what we’ve seen as far as curtailments and a return of activity and Michael talked about and the price signals we might need to see to see a ramp up in growth. But if you just run the expectations for supply to meet the demand, you’re going to have to have a pretty significant call on the Haynesville. And I think generally we’re showing here not necessarily our own forecast, but I think it’s a generally consistent forecast that the Haynesville is going to have to bring around 10 Bcf a day of growth over the next, call it eight years. And even then you’re going to need ongoing growth out of the Permian, a little bit of growth coming out of the Northeast in order to meet that demand. And so that’s really where that supply forecast comes from.
Brandon Bingham: Got it. Helpful. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes online of Craig Shere of Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open.
Craig Shere: Morning. Thanks for fitting me in. First question, thoughts about, I mean obviously the data center opportunity is huge, but thoughts about still looking at LNG offtake and partnership opportunities like you had a couple years back with an MOU with Sempra?
Chad Teply: Yes, this is Chad. We continue to look at those opportunities. Hopefully what you’re seeing here is that we do and Alan mentioned we’ve got a great inventory of investment opportunities at really attractive returns. And so we’ve been very focused on making sure anything we do in the LNG space will compete with the attractive returns we’re seeing across our core business. Clearly, we’re focused on supplying LNG opportunities. Our LEG gathering system will deliver gas to Gillis and we continue to look at additional projects to expand deliveries into both the existing LNG terminals that we serve and also the ones that are coming online. But we continue to look at whether or not it makes sense for us to take a further downstream position on a project or from an offtake perspective. But we remain very disciplined in ensuring that whatever we might do would fit within the profile of how we want to grow the business, but also compete with the attractive opportunities we’re seeing across the footprint. So still well within the fairway of our strategy, but has to compete with the attractive opportunities we’re seeing across the footprint.
Craig Shere: Understood. That attractive opportunity or return point segues into my second question. We’ve all talked for a long time about the challenges of avoiding long term excess deleveraging if you’re constantly investing at four to six times EBITDA or better, maybe half levered. And as I think about the behind the meter data center opportunity, I’m thinking about kind of a core, kind of directly contracted infrastructure that may be in the eight times, investment to EBITDA area. But when I kind of envision the pull that has and all of your other spare capacity for related gas services and fuel supply, the all-in returns across the entire enterprise may still be in the mid-single digits or better. Am I thinking about that right?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, Craig, I would just say obviously that’s very dependent on where the opportunity is, if we have available capacity that we can utilize. The one thing that’s going to be different about the data center load from a typical merchant power facility is the very high degree of reliability that’s expected on these facilities. And so capacity availability is going to be key in serving the behind the meter. And so to your point, in areas where we have lower cost expansions, we’ll see very low multiple projects complementing those projects and in those cases certainly would drive it lower. In other areas where it’s constrained, we wouldn’t see those kind of opportunities. So, your point is spot on. But it’s going to be highly dependent on where exactly the location is. And on these kind of what I would call the Chapter 1 of these projects, they are moving at such a pace that the location to getting it near where there’s existing pipeline capacity probably see less coordination. I think Chapter 2, we’re seeing another level of attention on where available resource is. So anyway, your point is spot on, but it is going to be highly dependent on where the project is.
Craig Shere: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I will now turn it back over to Alan Armstrong for closing remarks.
Alan Armstrong: Okay, well thank you all very much. Excited about the performance that the team delivered in 2024, particularly given the backdrop of super low gas prices. And very excited about the continued great execution on projects that we’ve been enjoying. And we’re continuing to see improvements on that, that are driving very high returns for us, even in a lot of cases better than what our initial expectations have been. So great execution by the team and our strategy has us in a very enviable position that we’re excited to deliver the benefits of that to our shareholders. So thank you for joining us.
Operator: Thank you for participation in today’s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-11-07 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to Williams Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Danilo Juvane. Please go ahead.
Danilo Juvane : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in the Williams Companies. This morning, we released our earnings, press release and the presentation that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong will kick-off in a moment. Also joining us on the call are John Porter, our Chief Financial Officer; Micheal Dunn, our Chief Operating Officer; and Chad Zamarin, our Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development. In our presentation materials, you'll find the disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to generally accepted accounting principles. And these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong : Great. Well, thank you Danilo and thank you all for joining us today. A lot of positive updates to walk through with you this morning as we delivered another record quarter of adjusted EBITDA, driven primarily by our natural gas transportation expansions and Gulf Coast Storage acquisition. In fact, our better-than-planned execution on growth projects and higher-than-expected performance on acquisitions along with core business strength gives us the confidence to once again raise our guidance midpoint for 2024, which John will detail in his remarks. The returns of our projects and acquisitions have been strong enough to overcome what has been a very challenging natural gas price environment and fairly impactful hurricane season so very pleased to see the way our entire portfolio responded in this environment. In fact, a recent Wells Fargo note on mid-stream return supports our view that Williams has delivered one of the best cash returns on invested capital in the sector, generating a 22.9% return for the 2018 through '23 period, nearly double the sector median of 11.9%. Now looking here at Slide 2, I'll start by noting that the strong cash returns expected within the suite of our recently completed projects, will lead to visible five year EBITDA CAGR of over 7% at the midpoint of our 2025 guidance, all without equity issuance and while improving our credit metrics during this period. Additionally, this pace of growth has been right into the headwinds of low gas prices and production curtailments this year. The drivers of growth for next year are clear and fully contracted. These include the following projects where the CapEx and construction risk is behind us. And in fact, in August, we placed Transco's Regional Energy Access into full service ahead of schedule and under budget, ensuring clean and reliable natural gas is available to serve the Northeast region for the upcoming winter heating season. We were also successful in placing a portion of the Southside reliability enhancement project and service as well as completing our MountainWest Uinta Basin expansion. And in the deepwater, we've completed all of our construction for the very large well project and we are excited to see Shell begin ramping up production in December. And as we mentioned on our last call, there are now two new fields on our Discovery system that started up in the third quarter. Chevron's large anchor development and Beacon's Winterfell 5-well program are all fully connected and will help drive a large increase in EBITDA in 2025 as these programs also begin to ramp up. Beyond these drivers for '25, we already have a total of 5.3 Bcf a day of contracted gas pipeline projects that will drive a high rate of growth for the next five years. These include the following: First, on Southeast Supply Enhancement Project or SESE. We filed the FERC application for its 1.6 Bcf a day expansion of existing Transco capacity in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama. SESE is a fully contracted and will provide a record EBITDA contributions from a Williams transmission project that demonstrates how valuable contracted capacity is going to continue to be in the next wave of demand growth that we are just now starting to see the benefits of. And as we mentioned before, this singular project will generate EBITDA greater than our entire Northwest pipeline system. And in fact, by itself, SESE would be the equivalent to the tenth largest long haul pipeline in our nation on its expected EBITDA contribution alone. This project is a good representation of some of the amazing growth opportunities that will continue to drive growth well into the future. Utilities across the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast markets have come out saying they missed their growth targets for power generation and we are extremely well positioned to serve these customers with projects like SESE, starting at Station 165 and delivering volumes south as they take advantage of the new supplies coming in from Mountain Valley Pipeline. Moving down the list, we received our FERC order certificate from the MountainWest Overthrust Westbound expansion and that is a project that will add approximately 325,000 dekatherms of fully contracted firm transportation service on this MountainWest system by the fourth quarter of '25 and we began construction on several key projects, including our Louisiana Energy Gateway Gathering System, where we were pleased to receive the FERC order in late September that confirm this system is exempt from FERC's jurisdiction so we are full steam ahead with an expected in-service date in the second half of next year. Construction is also well underway on Transco's Commonwealth Energy Connector project in Virginia and I'm pleased to announce that we've entered into binding agreements with three new expansion projects on the Northwest pipeline, recently totaling roughly 260 million cubic feet a day of firm capacity. These are small projects, but individually, but very strong in terms of the collective returns that these projects will generate. So really nice to see the very strong signs of growth showing up now in the intermountain region on both Northwest and on our MountainWest acquisition. For some time now, we've talked about just how attractive the current macro environment is in supporting the long-term growth in our businesses as the line of sight to LNG exports, coal to gas switching, industrial reshoring and data center demand becomes clearer and clearer. The recently signed precedent agreements for an expansion of the existing Dalton Lateral that will serve Northern Georgia is a great example of this. Just like SESE, this is another project that leverages off of our existing system to provide high returns and demonstrates the path we are on to deliver many more fully contracted transmission projects that will provide attractive earnings growth beyond the end of this decade. And finally, we recently signed commercial agreements with Lakeland Electric, a Florida based utility, who we will partner with in the development of a 75 megawatt solar farm. The project, which will be designed and built by Williams is cited on land that's been owned by Williams for decades and that was unsuited for traditional real estate development but it is an ideal site for solar and energy production in an area that has got a tremendous amount of demand growth. Our list of prospects beyond these newly contracted deals continues to grow fast and the environment for demand driven projects, it's much better than the environment that has driven the 22.9% cash return on invested capital and the over 7% CAGR of growth across our business. So we really want to stress that while we've had a great run here in the last five years of growth, the environment that is in front of us right now and the kind of opportunities we're seeing is much stronger than what we've seen in the period that's generated these kinds of opportunities. So we are really excited to be able to deliver up against the demand that is growing very rapidly in the space we're in right now. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to John to walk through the third quarter financials. John?
John Porter : All right. Thanks, Alan. Starting here on Slide 3 with a summary of our year-over-year financial performance, beginning with adjusted EBITDA, we saw about a 3% year-over-year increase where once again, for the third quarter, in spite of low natural gas prices, our resilient business continue to grow even as producer customers continued significant temporary production reduction measures. And we also saw a greater hurricane impact for the third quarter of 2024 versus 2023. As we see on the next slide, our adjusted EBITDA growth was driven by strong growth from our large scale natural gas transmission and storage businesses, including the favorable effects of our recent acquisitions but also unfavorably impacted by asset sales. And of course, we don't include gains from asset sales and our adjusted performance metrics, adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA or available funds from operations and we did have a $127 million gain in the third quarter of 2025 from the sale of our Aux Sable interest and about $130 million of gains last year on the sale of the Bayou ethane system. Year-to-date, our adjusted EBITDA is now up about 5%. And year-over-year, you see that adjusted EPS growth is lagging our adjusted EBITDA and AFFO growth and that delta is due primarily to a step-up in non-cash depreciation expense from our recent acquisitions. But again, looking to 2025, we would see the delta in growth rates close back up as the non-cash depreciation charge flattens back out. For third quarter, available funds from operations AFFO growth was about 4.5% and 4% year-to-date. But looking through 2025, we see a five year CAGR of 7%. Also, you see our 3Q dividend coverage based on AFFO was a very strong 2.22x on a dividend that grew just over 6% over prior year and 2.33x coverage year-to-date. And our debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.75x in line with our expectations for 2024 before dropping back down in 2025, the guidance of 3.6x or better. So before we move to the next slide and dig a little deeper into our adjusted EBITDA growth for the quarter, we'll provide an update to our financial guidance. We are pleased to increase the midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA $125 million from the original guidance of $6.95 billion to now $7.075 billion, reflecting a new range of $7 billion to $7.15 billion. Additionally, as we mentioned before in our prior calls this year, based on our improved 2024 adjusted EBITDA outlook and other changes, we see our key per share metrics, adjusted EPS and AFFO per share coming in at the high end of their ranges for 2024. So we've now shifted the 2024 guidance for those metrics to midpoint of $1.88 and $4.35, respectively and we see improvement in the leverage guidance from 3.85x to 3.8x. Finally, we are reaffirming our 2025 financial guidance as originally issued, but we plan to provide an update when we release our full year 2024 results in February. So again, very pleased with the financial performance of the company for 2024 and our ability to raise guidance even though it looks like 2024 Henry Hub natural gas prices will likely be around 15% lower than the January 1 strip prices that we set our business plan on this year. So let's turn to the next slide and take a little closer look at those third quarter results. Walking now from last year's $1.652 billion to this year's $1.7 billion, we start with our transmission in Gulf of Mexico businesses, which improved $76 million or just over 10% due to the combined effects of a full quarter contribution from the Hartree, Gulf Coast Storage acquisition, which is delivering as expected, following a flawless integration effort, higher Transco revenues, including from the Regional Energy Access project. Now in the Gulf of Mexico, we saw total hurricane related impacts of about $10 million unfavorable there and segment growth was also unfavorably impacted about $9 million by last year's Bayou ethane divestiture. The Northeast G&P business was flat versus last year and also basically flat in total against our original 2024 plan. We've seen volumetric underperformance in the dry gas systems with some offset from rate escalations on those same systems and we've seen growth in our rich gas systems, which has also provided a strong favorable offset. The 3Q Northeast results also reflected the sale of our interest in Aux Sable on August 1, 2024. Shifting now to the West, which increased $15 million, benefiting from the DJ transactions that we completed in the fourth quarter of 2023. Segment performance was also favorably impacted by higher NGL services results, including higher Overland Pass pipeline volumes were low natural gas prices have supported greater ethane recoveries. Overall, West gathering volumes were lower as a result of those temporary producer reductions primarily in the dry gas Haynesville area. And then you see the $12 million lower marketing results and those were in line with our business plan for the third quarter. Our upstream joint venture operations included in our other segment were down about $23 million from last year due primarily to lower realized prices. So again, it was a third quarter that was in line with our business plan, proving once again our ability to grow our business in spite of a tough natural gas pricing environment the impact of Gulf of Mexico storms and portfolio asset sales. And with that, I'll turn it back to Alan.
Alan Armstrong : Okay. Well, thanks, John. So just a few closing remarks before we turn it over to your questions. I'll start by emphasizing what a truly compelling story we've been able to share with you this morning. Despite the low natural gas price environment we're in, we've exceeded our own financial expectations each quarter this year. And our teams continue to excel in executing large-scale expansion projects to serve the growing natural gas demand that is really ramping up both in this year and as we look to the future, certainly. Not only do we have a clear line of sight to a full roster of projects that are in execution, but we continue to commercialize vital high-return projects across our footprint. And don't forget, this is an issue that I think people are probably missing as they think about the forecast of our business right now that we've been able to deliver these in the face of quite a bit of production curtailment on our systems which really does provide a loaded spring as a very strong catalyst for earnings growth as natural gas prices rebound. So really, the environment we're seeing today is a very strong long-term bullish position for natural gas is all of the demand that we're connecting on our transmission systems will begin to pile up. But our gathering systems are really going to get a big pull through when that demand comes on. And importantly, very little capital required on our part because a lot of it is just production curtailment or drilling without the producers turning it into line on existing pads. So a pretty powerful catalyst that sits out there when we do see the call on this gas to support all the growing demand we're seeing. So all of this activity does underscore the accelerating demand for natural gas transmission capacity in the United States, particularly in the growing regions where we operate. We are confident in the role our valuable natural gas infrastructure will play in meeting both today's energy demand as well as the projected growth from power generation, reshoring of energy intensive manufacturing and LNG exports. As the most natural gas centric energy infrastructure provider with access to the most prolific U.S. basins, Williams is the best positioned to serve steadily increasing domestic needs for clean and affordable energy while also helping unlock vast U.S. reserve for the global market. In closing, we've built a business that is delivering record profitability and strong financial returns in the present, but is positioned for even faster growth in the future. And with that, we'll open it up for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan Securities.
Jeremy Tonet : Thanks for all the commentary on the call on the gas macro situation. I wanted to come back to that a little bit, if I could, just as far as producer conversations at this point, expectations into 2025. Could you -- how much of an uptick possibly could you see here if it's price supportive? And then I just wanted to put a fine point, I guess. There's open space on some of your pipes. Just what type of operating leverage do you see in an environment where maybe some of the second or third tier basins have a higher call on them and you wouldn't have to spend much money but the pipes could fill up?
Alan Armstrong : Yes. I'll hit the last part of that and I will ask Michael to hit the question of what kind of response we could see on our gathering systems. On the pipes, I would just say, our systems for the most part are completely loaded up but the ability to expand our existing systems through addition of interconnects between pipes like MountainWest and Northwest pipeline, which we've got some projects that take advantage of the combination of those assets are a way that we're seeking out some additional capacity out of the systems. And in general, obviously, a lot of these systems have the ability to be expanded at a pretty low cost. And so a recent project that we just did this quarter adds compression in the Clay Basin area on Northwest pipeline and get some more very critical capacity in between the Piceance and the Opala and Kern River markets, which obviously is in demand these days. And so that's just an example, pretty small amount of capital relative to the value of that project, and those are the kind of things that are occurring in the West right now. And Michael, I'll turn it over to you to talk about the gathering operating leverage we have.
Micheal Dunn : Jeremy, there's definitely a lot of opportunity to increase production on the producer end coming into 2025, and it will certainly be somewhat price responsive. We have about 4 Bcf per day right now, it is either shut in from what was originally flowing or ducts or wells that have been complete drilled and completed but aren't flowing and have been connected to our systems. And so that's between the Marcellus and the Haynesville. So there's definitely an opportunity to increase some gathering volumes through our systems as prices rebound. And we've actually seen some of the curtailments come off and the producers are now flowing gas that has been once curtailed earlier this summer. So we are encouraged by the opportunity to be able to increase the volumes pretty rapidly through our systems. In some of these is just the operation of turning about to bring on some of these volumes very quickly. So it can respond very quickly when prices do rebound, which we expect them to do. There's going to be some demand growth next year on the power generation side. We've seen that over the last several years, the year-over-year growth from power generation and I don't see that deciding at all with all the coal plants that have been taken offline, still even with this growing power demand markets that we're seeing in virtually all of our markets. And I am encouraged by that.
Jeremy Tonet : Maybe pivoting to the industry at large, Williams has done some bolt-ons in recent years, nicely adding to the portfolio. We have seen broadly in the industry entity consolidation steadily continue. Just wondering, how Williams thinks about industry consolidation in the future? Would entity level consolidation never makes sense? Or you see more bolt-ons? Or there's not really attractive opportunity there?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, certainly, that has been a driver of growth for a lot of players in the space. We've been very fortunate to have a lot of organic growth within our mix. And obviously, that's always what we're comparing when we look at any kind of acquisition, and obviously, we do look at acquisitions on a pretty steady basis. But really the hurdle that we always have to overcome there is the amount of growth that we have in our base business. And frankly, that is a process of constantly updating it these days with the level of growth that's accelerating, it's pretty hard to keep up with, frankly, seems like as soon as we get one plan done, it's outdated with the kind of growth we're seeing in other areas. So that's really the -- I think the issue from a Williams perspective is just the very strong growth that we have off of our own business and to the degree that's not fully valued in our stock makes that acquisitions and tough things to do. So the good news is we have a lot of capacity and debt capacity that we're growing as our EBITDA grows so rapidly and that is providing for us to be able to do bolt-on transactions on assets that we think are kind of where the puck is going, our acquisitions on storage, a great example of that where we kind of got ahead of the market a little bit on where that is going. And that has turned into a very solid performance for us. And in fact, it's one of the things that helped us overcome the low gas price environment we've had this year. So I would just say, I think bolt-ons will continue for us and we'll be continuing to think about where the puck is going and acquisitions that will be strategic for us down the road. So that's kind of the way I see things in our space right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Praneeth Satish with Wells Fargo.
Praneeth Satish : Obviously, there's a lot of demand from data centers, power generation. I guess with all the increased competition for pipeline space and capacity, are you seeing upward pressure on rates as existing contracts come up for renewals? Is there an opportunity to kind of increase the rates there? And then secondly, are you seeing opportunities to shift more capacity from your cost of service or recourse rates to negotiated rates at higher rates as this competition intensifies?
Alan Armstrong : Yes, it's a great question. The challenge on that front for us is that any capacity that exists on our system is super precious and people know that relative to the cost of new capacity. And so we always like to tell the story the last time we had any capacity come available the only way anybody can distinguish themselves for the existing cost of service already built capacity. The only way anybody can distinguish themselves in the bid for that is on term, and the term for that was 84 years. So that's what we're seeing is a lengthening of term when they would become available. We don't really have the ability to price that up if it was already in that original base capacity that was offered to our utilities. And so that gets offered out when -- if anything does get turned back, which is very rare. I think that actually that’s a really old story. I think that was like five years ago now. So it's not very often, we do see capacity turn back because people appreciate how incredibly valuable and the money that capacity is. So, unfortunately, I don't see a whole lot of opportunity to price that up. I do think the opportunity for us is to combine the expansions along our existing system where we have great leverage . Dalton Lateral expansion is a great example of that. We built that, we knew that it probably could have some expansion opportunity down the road when we build that. And so, we built that in a way that, that expansion. And so when that expansion opportunity comes along, very high return opportunity because of the relatively low cost to build that expansion relative to the value of that new capacity. And that's the kind of things we're going to continue to see is the relatively low cost expansions along our existing system, which are driving very high returns.
Praneeth Satish : And just looking at the opportunity set in front of you, it's large, it seems like it gets larger each quarter. And it seems like there's potentially billions of dollars of spending here on gas expansions at good returns over the next few years. I guess how are you thinking about the potential to increase CapEx spending over the next few years if you kind of sanction some of these projects? And would you consider moving closer to kind of a free cash flow neutral after dividends stands to capture more of these opportunities?
Alan Armstrong : Yes. I mean the challenge is when you're doing sub-four multiple projects, you just keep expanding out your capacity. So that's a very high-class problem. But in fact, we're really not chewing up capacity when you're doing projects that have that kind of expansion, especially as these high-return projects, if you were having to load the ship up and you're having to wait for four years for those to come through that would be one thing, but things like the deepwater are coming on now, things like regional energy access are coming on now. These are very high-return projects. And so we've kind of already got the train rolling there, and it's pretty hard to chew up capacity when you're generating those kind of returns on projects. And so that's really the picture for us that is a very high-class problem to have is that we're continuing to generate so much incremental capacity with these high-return projects.
Operator: Our next question comes from Indraneel Mitra with Bank of America.
Indraneel Mitra : I wanted to put a finer point on maybe the shut-ins and delay turn in lines that you're seeing. I think last quarter you said between the Northeast and the Haynesville, there's about 2 Bcf a day between the two combined. Wondering, how that's trending in the third quarter now that we have similar gas prices to where we are in the second quarter?
Alan Armstrong : Yes. We're at about 4 Bcf today between the Marcellus and the Haynesville about three of that is in the Marcellus Bcf in the Haynesville and the shut-ins in the Northeast is about 1/3 of that [ gas ] that's been shut in. It's about a 50-50 mix as the Haynesville or -- sorry, it was -- we're now in the Haynesville, it's primarily ducts and delayed tills in the Haynesville. So most of the gas in the Haynesville has come back online. But in the Northeast, it's still some shut in gas up there about 25% in the Northeast instead of 1/3 is shut in today. So, seeing some of that come back online. I think you saw EQT has announced that they had brought all their gas back online. So we are seeing some producers respond as prices have rebounded a bit there in the Northeast.
Indraneel Mitra : My second question, SESE obviously went to market first and delivering market to the southeast utilities. Now you have a lot of peers proposing projects to go from essentially Louisiana with an endpoint to Georgia. I know it's early in the process with SESE, but over the longer term, how do you see Transco competing for additional Southeast demand going forward? And where you have an advantage or disadvantage versus your peers and competing for some of that load?
Alan Armstrong : Yes, The [Sonat] project that [Kendra] announced recently, a lot of that is effectively a bigger distribution system in Georgia and hits a lot of the southern markets and South Central markets that Transco is not positioned in. So the Transco runs through Atlanta and cap and up through the northeast part of Georgia. And so a lot of the projects that we're capturing are going to be the large-scale power generation projects. And I think the [Sonat] system, that expansion is positioned to deliver a more distributed gas into the south and central parts of Georgia as it's configured. So I think from our perspective, we like where we're positioned, but our big high-pressure transmission system that can access gas out of the Appalachia is super critical. And I do think that, that's a bit of the station that's going to occur here is where the supply is coming from and what that availability. So if you think about Marcellus and Utica supplies capable of serving both the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast markets, from that area and then you think about the Mississippi Crossing project that [Kendra] has proposed to supply the [Sonat] system, that's more going to be Haynesville based supplies. And so that's really the difference between those two projects. I think certainly, Transco has the ability to distribute Haynesville production as well. But in terms of those two projects, that was the major distinction there is kind of where the supply was sourced on.
Micheal Dunn : Yes. I would add Alan to that. A lot of these projects that are being proposed coming over from the Haynesville is going to pile up a lot of gas at Station 85, which is actually going to be beneficial for us to expand transfer the northward out of that area as well. So that will be a benefit to us to paint those projects given FID.
Operator: Our next question comes from Manav Gupta with UBS.
Manav Gupta : My question relates to Slide 20. I could not help but notice two more additions at the bottom Wild Trail project and Dalton natural expansion. Can we get some more details about these two new additions on the slide deck?
Micheal Dunn : Yes. The Wild Trail project is one of the ones that Alan mentioned on the Northwest pipeline system. This is a project to move gas, basically grow the White River Hub, which in the Piceance area up to the Opala market area in Southwest Wyoming. It can also move capacity from White River hub down to the Four Corners area as well as the way it's been proposed. It's a greenfield compressor station in Northeast Utah, which will give us a lot of opportunity to increase our deliverability and takeaway from the Clay Basin storage facility which is on the MountainWest system, but it has an interconnect to Northwest pipeline and Northwest pipeline has capacity in Clay Basin. So a great opportunity to have connectivity to storage there and also move gas to markets in the fourth quarter here as well as Southwest Wyoming and a very efficient capital project. It's a greenfield compressor facility. We'll be a 7c application to the FERC. So that process take between a year and 1.5 years to get permits or something like that and about a year for construction ultimately program we filed. As far as the other projects that we have for the Naughton conversion. That is a coal plant in Southwest Wyoming that is partially converted to gas usage from coal and our project there is to expand that further for the other two units that are moving from coal to gas over the next several years. So a very capital efficient project there, basically metering modifications and then something like capacity that the shipper has taken on. And same with the Stanfield project, metering modifications and those last two projects which we have prior notice at FERC. So typically, those are a much quicker process.
Alan Armstrong : And then he asked about the Dalton Lateral.
Micheal Dunn : Yes. So the Dalton Lateral is near Atlanta. So it's just west of Atlanta. It was built about six years ago. It's a 115 mile long lateral. It's a partnership with AGL, so we're 50% partners on that with them. And this project would be really a fairly simple scope. It's about 23 miles of 24 inch loop. It's a brownfield compression, just over 40,000 horsepower and then greenfield about 40,000 horsepower on that lateral. So from a scope standpoint, fairly simple. And the 2029 in-service date is what we're contemplating now that's based on the desired in-service date from the customers that we're talking to. We have an open season that closes today for the remainder of that capacity but we have an anchor shipper already in place for 460 million a day. We believe we could reasonably expand that to 500 million cubic feet per day or a little higher, depending on how the open season turns out that like I said, will close today.
Manav Gupta : A quick follow-up here is your balance sheet is in a good position. Any strategic priority to further simplify the JV structures, whether it's Brazos, Blue Racer, anything on that front?
Alan Armstrong : Chad, do You want to take that?
Chad Zamarin : Yes. This is Chad. We continue to look at whether or not it makes sense to tuck in JV interest. Alan mentioned the capacity that we have bolt-ons. We like those kinds of transactions because we know those assets, they come with low risk and high kind of integration capabilities. But it really is, also, as Alan mentioned, just a matter of capital allocation, making sure that those tuck-ins work from a returns perspective. So yes, we continue to kind of look at how we can optimize the portfolio. You saw that earlier in the year when we did the Discovery acquisition with P66 and bought in that interest, while at the same time, we sold our small interest in Aux Sable. So we will continue to look at those, but they'll have to compete with the attractive kind of organic growth projects that we're seeing.
Operator: Our next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays.
Theresa Chen : Maybe turning back to the macro. Alan with the tailwinds behind you and the environment in front of you, following the election results, what are your views on how the Trump victory impacts your business and what it means for the energy infrastructure industry in general?
AlanArmstrong : Yes. I would say probably first and most tangible that we would expect, particularly if the house goes Republican and even with the Senate Republican is a very favorable tax outcome, particularly a bonus appreciation will be a very huge positive to what we have in guidance and in plan right now. So I would say that's probably from our vantage point, as we look at in the immediate term, most impact to us financially. In terms of how that will drive the macro environment, boy, it's just some -- we have so much growth we're trying to address right now. I think it's just going to be a piling on of that perhaps if the economy continues to expand. Certainly very hopeful with more Republican control at the permitting issue finally gets dealt with in a durable and meaningful way. And I think that would be beneficial for really all industries, certainly beneficial for the power industry as well as the energy infrastructure business and probably -- hopefully, removing some restraints in that. It's not going to be a simple task and I don't want to underestimate the challenge that, that's going to present to get that done. But certainly a lot more positive about that occurring with Republican control of both the executive branch and legislative branch. So I would say, certainly, a very optimistic point of view as it relates to that in terms of freeing up infrastructure build. But I think as an investor looking at us right now, thinking about the impact of taxes, which we've had quite a bit of curtailment of our outlook associated with that and quite a bit of reserve held back and coverage on our dividend. Because of that, that could be a pretty meaningful change for us. So that's probably the thing we're most keeping our eyes on at this point.
Theresa Chen : And turning to the fundamentals. At this point in the fourth quarter, would you be able to provide some color on your guest marketing activities, how that's trending and what your expectations are from here?
Alan Armstrong : Chad, do you want to take that?
Chad Zamarin : Yes, sure. This is Chad. A lot of our marketing activity takes place in the first quarter of the year. And so winter is certainly something we're well set up to take advantage of if we see volatility or dislocations but we have seen less volatility this year than in the prior couple of years. And so we -- I would say are sitting and expect positive results here for the remainder of the year, but also are well set up for if we see a winter event or volatility but primarily, we see the results of the marketing business show up in the first quarter of the following year.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs.
John Mackay : You guys mentioned you're kind of tracking in line with your 5% to 7% kind of longer term growth rate. Alan, you've also been talking about opportunities to maybe beat that going forward. Can you just spend a minute or two talking about what you're looking for specifically that could -- have you come revisit that target? What we should be looking for from here?
Alan Armstrong : Yes, great question, John. Well, I would certainly say as we look in the longer term, the higher returns on these projects and large amount of new projects that are showing up as opportunities for us right now would drive that. We're obviously not going to call that until we've got that business contracted that will drive that growth. But just the large amount of stuff we already have that's contracted. Now is a bit unusual to have this much growth contracted already without the benefit of other growth that would come on. And so if you kind of roll the clock back on that and you think about the acquisitions we've done, we do not have any bolt-on acquisitions or anything like that built into our growth, even though we'll have plenty of capacity to generate on that. So that's one thing I would highlight. Said another way, we've already got the business contracted that will help drive that kind of growth already. And so the capacity and new opportunities that have not identified themselves over a horizon are the kind of things that will drive that growth. Additionally, we really don't have built in the loaded spring that you heard Michael talked about in terms of a lot of this production springing back on. That's a very large catalyst for us. And so those are probably the things that are pretty evident to us as a team right now is converting a lot of the opportunity that we're looking at right now to contracted business in a way that we would start to include it in our guidance and our growth.
John Mackay : And just as a quick follow-up, now that you've had the benefit of a few more of these conversations over the past couple of months. Could you maybe just frame up what some of these data center opportunities are actually looking like? Is behind the meter? Part of the conversation? What's willingness for them to kind of give you guys returns that look better than what we've seen before? Maybe just anything on kind of how those conversations have progressed versus what we're -- maybe wondering what they could look like at the beginning of the year.
Alan Armstrong : Yes. Well, I would say it is certainly a mix of both behind the meter and a lot of conversion. I mean if you look at some of the IRPs that are out there right now, you look at Duke's latest IRP that's got approved for 9 gigawatts of gas fired generation in their market. We're dealing with the large power generators in the MountainWest region right now and some very big numbers that they're talking about for power generation demand. Both -- and in terms of -- if you stack on to that, the coal conversion like you saw with Naughton, we're seeing with Jim Bridger, the number gets to be very large when you stack on both the conversion and you stack the growth on top of that. These numbers are getting very large and a lot of that is being built up to serve data center load in those areas. The governors of a lot of states that we work with are really starting to pound the table with their planning commissions and making sure that they're not left behind on having enough power in the regions because that's becoming a key issue and so we're working with the states and trying to make sure that a lot of them are very concerned that they're not being left behind in these opportunities. So I would say on the grid opportunity, they are really blossoming. The Dalton Lateral expansion is another one of those projects that's ultimately being driven by that kind of growth. And frankly, just reshoring of industrial and manufacturing because stuff that used to be done in places like Europe and the energy costs have just driven those businesses back to the U.S. So I think the low cost energy we have here is driving a lot of that home. And then finally, though, on the behind the meter, a lot of very detailed discussions going on with a lot of players that you would expect on that front. And some of that is just for us to just provide the gas and some of that is in joint ventures where we would help provide the power generation in whole on that. Our focus, obviously, is in getting the gas transportation business out of that. But there's a number of very detailed discussions going on where we would provide more than that and particularly in areas where we have the land and the infrastructure already set up that can help support data centers. So it's pretty much across the board in terms of opportunity. And those -- it's hard for us to predict, frankly, exactly how much of that will actually hit because this is kind of a new area for us. So in terms of where we started at the first of the year to where we are now, I would say it has gotten much more concrete and more positive than where we started at the first of the year for sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research.
Keith Stanley : I wanted to ask on LEG. Can you remind us how much of the capacity has take-or-pay commitments at this point? And were you surprised by some of your competitors moving forward just because now we're going to have three large Haynesville greenfield pipes getting built at the same time.
Alan Armstrong : First of all, the vast majority of our capacity is contracted on that. Fact it, is take-and-pay contracting that we've done on that. And in terms of the other project, I'm not too terribly surprised if you look at the balance of where gas is going to have to come from and particularly gas that can meet the LNG specs and low nitrogen specs that are going to be required. I'm not too terribly surprised just because of how much demand growth we're seeing that's going to have to come from somewhere, and it's starting to mount up pretty big. So I'm not too terribly surprised by that, frankly. I don't know how well contracted those other projects are. I assume they're well contracted like ours is. But if they're not, I would be surprised. But assuming they're well contracted, I think it's just a sign that people know that there's gas for this incremental demand is going to have to come from somewhere.
Chad Zamarin : Yes, this is Chad. I'd also add that the Haynesville historically was plumbed to move gas to the East and Northeast. And so there's even going to be volumes that will want to move existing volumes that will want to move south to the LNG markets. But to Alan's first point, I mean, models, not ours but even third-party models are showing over 10 Bcf a day of growth out of the Haynesville by the early 2030s to meet LNG demand. And so that's a lot of gas that's going to need to find its way to those LNG markets.
Keith Stanley : The second question, I'm not sure if I missed this or not, but on Regional Energy Access, any update on where things are in seeking a temporary certificate from FERC and any next steps or time line you're watching for from the DC circuit?
Micheal Dunn : Yes. I think all the filings have been made in regard to the DC circuit actions and we made our application for a temporary certificate as well. And so we're awaiting FERC action on that. But as of now, we're flowing gas. The pipeline is operational and all that work is complete from a mechanical standpoint, we're just waiting for the legal action to take place. And I would say I was pretty encouraged by the response that FERC provided in regard to our renewing request with the DC circuit. And it looks like FERC is very firmly standing behind their decision and we're very confident, ultimately, that we'll have a certificate to operate REA.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Catellier with CIBC.
Robert Catellier : I'd like you to comment on how the significant growth profile you have ahead of you will influence the dividend growth policy. Where do you see yourself having enough balance sheet capacity to handle what's in front of you here?
Alan Armstrong : Yes, Rob. We certainly will have just because, again, as I mentioned earlier, these projects are so high return that really not -- and now we've kind of got -- that train has started now as these big deepwater projects come on, the regional energy access. A lot of these transmission projects that we've been investing in previously kind of prime the pump, if you will for these high-return projects. Once we're on that, we really are not chewing up a whole lot of capacity because we're generating so much EBITDA growth at the same time. So no concern at all about needing to pull back the dividend at all. In fact, I would say it's probably the other way around just because we're trying to figure out exactly what we will do with the excess capacity and capital that we have available. So yes, that has not come on our radar screen. I'll put it that way.
Robert Catellier : And then I want to go back to the presidential administration question, what might change here. Speculative, obviously, but one of the things we could speculate about is, we might be adding growth on growth. So that tends to inflation risk arguably. So how are you protecting yourselves and your project returns from the potential of inflation risk?
Alan Armstrong : Yes. Our gathering business, we build that in automatically to the contracts. And if you think -- if you look at the operating margin that we make on these projects, it's a very high operating margin. And so the real driver for the rate is the capital that we initially invest and we absolutely build in, we are very conservative when we're estimating to make sure that we either know what that inflation risk is going to be or we lock it in and the price of steel and inflationary impacts like that. So I would say the capital risk is really where our risk would be not so much our operating leverage. The other thing I would tell you is that the way that our rates work within our pipeline, obviously, we file those rate cases every five years. So unlike a lot of competitors in the space that haven't filed a rate case in a long time because they're over earning, we're in a position to capture that inflation adjustment and our rates just because of the way that we're set up in the business. And so really not too big of a risk to us other than the capital side risk and that's a matter of making sure when we set our estimates that we take that into account.
Robert Catellier : Last question, I'm just curious with respect to your storage position, given how much you've done in recent years, should there be a medium to large size acquisition in the storage area, how important would that be to you from a strategic point of view?
Alan Armstrong : You're saying if somebody else acquired?
Robert Catellier : Yes, while there was something for sale that had some pretty significant scale.
Alan Armstrong : Yes. I mean, I think, obviously, it just depends on the price and how well it fits into our strategy. So we're very bullish storage right now, but we also realize that we're kind of in a very sweet spot right now where the pricing has been such that only kind of brownfield expansions are being supported from our perspective, but yet much higher margins than what we've been acquiring the assets at. So kind of in a nice spot right there. So we've been in -- we've watched the storage cycles before. And I think as bullish as we are on the demand for storage. We don't want to see it get overbuilt in a way that it would decrease that pricing over time either. So that's the thing we're keeping our eye on that.
Chad Zamarin: Yes. And I think it's important to note that not all storage is created equal. If you think about what we focused on Clay Basin in the Rockies is really an important storage asset to bridge against critical markets between West demand and East production. Nortex and the Dallas-Fort Worth area and that power complex. The Gulf Coast Storage transaction, our ability to integrate those assets with Transco for both injection and deliverability. So we will look at storage but not all storage is created equal. And so we're constantly looking for. As Alan mentioned earlier, what might be next and what might be needed? And is there something that fits kind of the fundamental setup.
Operator: Our next question comes from Zack Van Everen with TPH & Company.
Zackery Van Everen : Just going back to the question around Haynesville pipelines and LEG, with those additional projects being announced, is there still a need or a want to potentially expand LEG in the future?
Micheal Dunn : Yes, I would say there's definitely an opportunity to do that. As Chad talked about earlier, there is an expectation that Haynesville production would grow by 10 Bcf over the next decade or so or even quicker depending upon the LNG appetite there. So I think there's definitely an opportunity to economically expand the LEG project either by additional compression or by looping a portion of the projects so that's certainly not foreclosed by anybody that's entering market today.
Zackery Van Everen : And then maybe one on Transco with SESE ongoing right now. Can you remind us, is there a certain amount of time you have to wait just with respect to those customers before you announce another large project along the mainline? Or are you able to do that if the appetite is there?
Alan Armstrong : Yes. I would just say the Dalton Lateral is a great example. That comes right off of that capacity and is within the path of that. And so that's a great example of something that has no overlap whatsoever with the capacity that we're building there, yet it's still along in that same region. So I'd say I think this issue has been a little bit overblown and perhaps from my own comments on the topic, it is an issue when you talk about permitting, it is an issue once you file, and once you're down the road on if you're doing something within that same work area that would have environmental impact, that is a risky proposition to add another project on top of that because they might get combined from a permitting standpoint and drag the other. And so we're very sensitive to that because we have customers that are very dependent on us delivering these projects on time, and we take that very seriously and particularly Duke has been very clear with us about not putting any risk on timing for that because they do need that gas so badly. So we're going to protect our customers' interest in that regard and not put things at risk. But it doesn't mean you can't expand the pipeline in that area. It just means that you're doing it within the same regions of impact, like if you were to expand to lose or try to make a look larger than you originally called for or expanded it into a wet land, those are the kind of things that could drive a project and have it combine back to another. And those are the things that were sensitive. It certainly does not mean that we can't expand the pipeline, while another project start an expansion of that pipeline while projects going on is just not in the same work zone.
Micheal Dunn : And I would say the key to that, though, is making sure you have distinct supply and demand customers identified and I've got a great example where the sell-side reliability enhancement project and the Commonwealth Energy Connector are really in the same corridor where we're actually installing compression at the same site for both of those projects, but they were separate and distinct projects, FERC evaluated and analyzed them separately but allowed us to do those projects simultaneously, if you will.
Chad Zamarin : Yes, I don't think we see any commercial opportunities that we're not going to be able to commercialize because of the concern of stacking projects. I think we've done a really good job of filling kind of the commercial activity on the first phase of SESE and we don't expect to be deferring commercial opportunities because of the project. It looks like -- we believe that the commercial pace of kind of the next wave of opportunities will fit well within kind of the time line needed to navigate through the permitting process.
Operator: Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist.
Jack Wilson : This is Jack Wilson on for Neal. Just a quick question around near-medium-term flexibility around Transco. Are there scenarios where small data center-driven pipes could relatively soon be tapped into? And will this require much change to compression or other equipment?
Alan Armstrong : I mean the answer to your question is yes. We have areas that we could make relatively small direct expansions of Transco, and we are looking at a few of those. So the answer is yes, we can do that very dependent on size and scale of the facility that we're looking at and so that's really the -- if you're talking about one of the hyperscale facilities that's a completely different setup than somebody that's looking for 180 megawatt or 200 megawatt kind of facility. So, those kind of facilities, we certainly can accommodate.
Operator: Thank you. That's all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Alan Armstrong for closing remarks.
Alan Armstrong: Okay. Well, thank you all for your interest. I really appreciate the plugging in. We are really excited about the environment we're going into and really pay close attention to what happens here with the house as it relates to tax benefit as well as perhaps some pretty comprehensive permitting reform that would provide for a lot of expansion of infrastructure here in the U.S. that we think we'd be a beneficiary of. So excited about where we are today and really excited to see what the future holds for our own forecast as we see some of these changes roll suit. So thank you for joining us today.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-06 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to The Williams Second Quarter Earnings 2024 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Danilo Juvane, Vice President of Investor Relations, ESG and Investment Analysis. Please go ahead.
Danilo Juvane: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in The Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon, we released our earnings press release and the presentation that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and our Chief Financial Officer, John Porter, will speak to this morning. Also joining us on the call today are Micheal Dunn, our Chief Operating Officer; Lane Wilson, our General Counsel; and Chad Zamarin, our Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development. In our presentation materials, you'll find a disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important integral to our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in the presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to generally accepted accounting principles. And these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong: Great. Well, thanks, Danilo, and thanks for joining us today. The story that John and I get to lay out for you this morning is one of consecutive growth as Williams continues to deliver on a long-term trend of per share growth and resilience regardless of the macro environment. In fact, we delivered record second quarter results, driven by the strong performance of our Transmission and Storage business this quarter, even our Gathering and Processing business held up very well despite challenging natural gas prices. The good news is that a meaningful increase in natural gas demand that continues to exceed our expectations will take advantage of these abundant supplies driving growth for years to come, and the supply side is poised to respond with over 1 Bcf a day of volumes from delayed TILs and temporary shut-ins to return to our gathering systems. And before we get deeper into the financial metrics, I want to hit on a few key themes from the quarter, namely our crisp execution of key projects that are positioning us for continued earnings growth and the ongoing focus we are optimizing our portfolio and ensuring sustainable operations. So starting here on Slide 2. Our teams have executed on an extraordinary amount of strategic priorities, including placing projects into service in the Northeast, West and the Deepwater, Gulf of Mexico. Just to run down the list quickly here. Last week, we placed Transco regional energy access into full service ahead of schedule and under budget once again, ensuring clean and reliable natural gas is available to serve the Northeast region for the upcoming winter heating season. And while the DC Circuit Court did issue a decision last week to vacate the FERC certificate for ARIA, we believe the court's concerns about the FERC process is once again flawed and will be fairly easy for the FERC to resolve. In the meantime, we are taking the necessary legal and regulatory steps to address the court's concerns, and ensure that this much-needed firm transportation capacity continues to be available to serve the needs of our customers without interruptions. I'll remind you that our industry has seen court rulings in the past with projects such as Sabal Trail as well as fires expansion. With both of these projects operating today, we see limited risk on a eruption REA operations and are prepared to help the FERC in reaffirming the merits of this important project. Other notable expansions, we've recently completed include the Marcellus gathering expansion that serves Southwestern rich gas zone in the Marcellus and the fully contracted Basin transmission expansion. In the Deepwater, there are 2 new fields that will increase EBITDA in the third quarter on our Discovery system, which we now fully own. So we're excited about the acquisition of the additional interest in Discovery, and we're really excited about the kind of growth that we're seeing both here in the near term and the long term. So first of all, Chevron's large anchor development and Beacon's Winterfell 5-well program are both fully connected and will drive a large increase in EBITDA for 2025 as well as for the balance of this year. Additionally, brought on their prospect on June 25 that will grow EBITDA on our Eastern Gulf assets. We were also active on advancing construction for several key projects. We initiated construction activities on the Louisiana Energy Gateway gathering, treating and carbon capture project as well as Transco's Texas to Louisiana Energy Pathway project, which we call TLEP. TLEP project provides our anchor shipper EOG resources with access to the LNG corridor in higher-priced markets on the Transco Pipeline and specifically all the way into the Louisiana market. So we're excited about getting started on that fairly significant project for us. And then recently, we also signed a precedent agreement on Transco's Gilles West expansion. This will bring new, reliable and low-cost supplies to CenterPoint Energy Houston area markets from Louisiana, so this is effectively a backhaul on Transco, helping CenterPoint to reduce their dependence on the Texas intrastate gas pipeline systems. Importantly, this quick turn project will add meaningful EBITDA with very little capital required on our part to place it into service. I also want to call out the significant emissions reductions and cost savings accomplished in the quarter as part of our system-wide emission and emission reduction program. Thus far, we have replaced 57 transmission compressor units and are on track to meet our goal of 112 units to be replaced by the end of this year, so that we can begin recovering on these investments in our listed rates. And on that note, we will file our new rates on Transco at the end of this month and the new rates will go into effect in March of '25. So incredible amount of work going on by teams to replace a lot of these very old units with modern low-emission equipment on the system. And a lot of times, those kind of projects kind of get overlooked, but tremendous amount of effort and great execution going on by the teams on that front as well. Looking at the second column, we continue to take steps to optimize our asset portfolio. We sold our stake in the Aux Sable joint Venture and an attractive gain and consolidate our ownership interest in the Gulf of Mexico Discovery system and an attractive value given both the very near and long-term growth on this asset. From a financial perspective, we remain on track to achieve the top half of '24 EBITDA guidance and we also reaffirm our expectations for 2025, which translates into a 5-year EBITDA CAGR of 8%. More importantly, the growth in our per share metrics will be just as strong over this 5-year period with AFFO per share CAGR of 7% and our EPS CAGR of 12% over this 5-year period. Of note, the fundamentals to sustain and even improve on this industry-leading earnings and cash flow growth beyond '25 actually continue to improve. Our Southeast -- our project is just of a few projects we expect from the secular end of increased demand for power generation, and we remain in the best position to secure additional infrastructure solutions in and around our Transco pipeline footprint. And finally, we continue to prioritize being a responsible operator in all that we do. And this is clearly outlined in our 2023 sustainability report that we published last week. This report is really a deep dive on how we focus on doing business the right way, and one area I'll call is our efforts in progressing on our decarbonization goals. We are focused on proving up that the natural gas industry can play an even more important role in providing affordable and reliable energy while also continuing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions here at home and around the world. And so with that, I'll turn it over to John to walk through the second quarter financials. John?
John Porter: Thanks, Alan. Starting here on Slide 3 with a summary of our year-over-year financial performance, beginning with adjusted EBITDA, we saw about a 3.5% year-over-year increase, despite low natural gas prices that fell about 5% versus 2Q '23, averaging close to -- for second quarter of 2024. And that 3.5% adjusted EBITDA growth is over a second quarter last year that had grown about 8%. So in spite of low natural gas prices, once again, our resilient business continued to grow even [indiscernible] customers employed pretty significant temporary production reduction measures like not completing drilled wells and/or not turning in-line wells that now stand ready to flow as prices improve. As we'll see on the next slide, our adjusted EBITDA growth was driven by strong growth from our large-scale natural gas transmission and storage businesses, including the favorable effects of our recent acquisitions. Year-to-date, our adjusted EBITDA is now up 6%, so inline in the middle of our long-term growth target of 5% to 7%. For Q2, our adjusted EPS was up 2% and year-to-date EPS is up about 3%. So a bit slower EPS growth in '24 as compared to the 19% 5-year CAGR that we've seen through 2023. But as Alan mentioned, looking through '25, we do see a 5-year CAGR that will be in excess of 12%. For 2Q, available funds from operations, AFFO growth was 3% and 4% year-to-date. Similar story here with this slower '24 growth is following an 8% 5-year CAGR through 2023. And when you look through 2025, we see a 5-year CAGR of 7%. Also, you see our 2Q dividend coverage based on AFFO was a very strong 2.16 on a dividend that grew 6.1% over the prior year and 2.38x coverage year-to-date. And our debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.76x, which is in line with our expectations, slightly higher leverage in 2024 before dropping back down in 2025 to guidance of 3.6x or better. So before we move to the next slide and dig a little deeper into our adjusted EBITDA growth for the quarter, we'll provide an update to our financial guidance. In general, our second quarter update is unchanged from what we provided in our first quarter earnings presentation. Based on our strong start to '24, we guided to the upper half of our 2024 adjusted EBITDA range of $6.95 billion to $7.1 billion, and we indicated that we were well positioned for upside to drive toward the high end of this original guidance. We also shared that we remain well positioned to deliver on our 2025 adjusted EBITDA range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion. And that based on our improved '24 adjusted EBITDA outlook and some other changes, we saw our key per share metrics, adjusted EPS and AFFO per share coming in at the high end of their ranges for 2024. So again, no major shift to that first quarter update, except perhaps to say that we are increasingly comfortable that we can clear the $7 billion level for 2024 adjusted EBITDA while still not counting on any additional help from Sequent. And of course, we also wouldn't include the around $150 million gain we expect to have on Aux Sable sale in there as well as we exclude gains and losses on asset sales from our adjusted EBITDA measure. So let's turn to the next slide and take a little closer look at our first quarter results. Walking now from last year's $1.611 billion to this year's $1.667 billion. We start with our transmission and Gulf of Mexico business, which improved $64 million or just over 8.5% due to the combined effects of a full quarter contribution from the Hartree Golf storage acquisition, which is delivering as expected, following a flawless integration effort. We also had higher Transco revenues, including partial in-service from the Regional Energy Access project, and segment growth was unfavorably impacted by last year's Bayou ethane divestiture and also some planned downtime in the Eastern North of Mexico. Now the $36 million unfavorable variance for the Northeast G&P business is really against a strong quarter last year that included the effect of a onetime $15 million favorable gathering revenue catch-up adjustment. However, we did see lower Northeast gathering volumes that were driven by those temporary producer reductions that were basically roughly in line with our plan for the year. And partially, those volume reductions were partially offset by rate escalations across several franchises in the Northeast. Shifting now to the West, which increased about $7 million, benefiting from the DJ transactions that we completed in the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase in the DJ Basin results was about the same magnitude as the unfavorable loss of hedge gains we had in 2023. Segment performance was also favorably impacted by higher NGL service results, including Highland Overland Pass pipeline volumes where low natural gas prices have supported greater ethane recoveries. Overall, West gathering volumes were also lower as a result of temporary producer reductions primarily in the dry gas Haynesville area. And then you see the $2 million lower marketing loss that was in line with our plan based on the expectation that our natural gas marketing will typically have a loss in the second quarter. Our upstream joint venture operations included in our other segments were up about $2 million from last year. So again, a second quarter that continued to beat our business plan, proving once again our ability to grow our business in spite of a challenging natural gas pricing environment and also giving us further confidence in our ability to beat $7 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2024. And with that, I'll turn it back to Alan.
Alan Armstrong: Okay. Well, thanks, John. Just a few closing remarks before turning it over to your questions. I'll end where I started with my remarks, and that is to emphasize what Williams has been able to deliver in the current environment and how well positioned we are for the future as natural gas demand continues to grow. As we think about our long-term strategy, we are confident in the role our valuable natural gas infrastructure will play in meeting both today's energy demand as well as the projected growth from power generation and LNG exports. We are seeing demand grow at an unprecedented pace and expansions of our uniquely placed infrastructure will demand a premium. Simply put, there is no other midstream company today that is set up better than Williams to capture this demand growth. We are the most natural gas-centric large-scale midstream company around today, and our natural gas-focused strategy continues to deliver growth on top of growth quarter after quarter. And to that point, we've now seen 11 consecutive years of adjusted EBITDA growth and an 8% compound annual growth rate of our adjusted EBITDA since 2018. In addition, we have realized a 19.5% return on our invested capital during the last 4 years, and our steadfast project execution led to record contracted transmission capacity and will continue to drive per share growth in 2024 and beyond. In fact, our current projects in execution have higher returns than this prior 4 years. So in closing, we've built a business that is delivering record profitability and strong financial returns in the present, but is positioned for even faster -- for an even faster-growing future. And so with that, we'll open it up to your questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Praneeth Satish of Wells Fargo.
Praneeth Satish: Maybe I'll start with data centers here. So you mentioned that you're looking is just the first and maybe a handful of other data center projects. I guess 2 questions here. Can you give us a sense of the size and scope of some of the other projects that you're looking at in the backlog? And then how do you think about the returns on future projects for SES, I mean, we're estimating around a 5x EBIT Delta. Do you think that some of the future data center projects that are in the backlog could earn similar types of returns?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Well, first of all, Praneeth, thank you for the question and important issue. First of all, on actually, our return is even better than that, probably, as we've mentioned, the best return we've ever seen on a large-scale project on Transco and actually any of our transmission expansions over the long history for Williams. So pretty extraordinary return opportunity there. In terms of the data center load, we are right in the throes of that. We have a very long backlog of projects. And I will tell you that particularly in the Southeast and Atlantic, those expansion opportunities that we have, we frankly are kind of overwhelmed with the number of requests that we're doing and we are trying to make sense of those projects. Obviously, we're not going to start or announce another expansion project on the top of because obviously, that would force a combination of projects. And so it doesn't make any sense for us to be making any announcements when we've got a large project that we've committed to our customers to do everything we can to get that permitted cleanly and push that ahead. So extremely critical expansion for our utility customers in the Mid-Atlantic and the Southeast, and we understand that. And we're going to make sure that we deliver on that first to our customers. But despite the fact that there's a lot of attention there in the Southeast and the Mid-Atlantic, we're actually seeing strong demand response, a lot of projects that we're dealing with and trying to figure out how we can respond to in the Rocky Mountain states, particularly in Eastern Washington, the Quince area, in Idaho, in Salt Lake City region. So a lot of demand going on everywhere. And frankly, the big developers that we're working with are looking to find where they can -- because the time is of the essence, probably more than we can even imagine in our business. And so they are looking to where the permitting regime is right, where there's access to abundant natural gas supplies and frankly, where expansions on our systems are available. And so -- this has moved from being one of where people have been very focused previously in cloud-based data centers. They've been very focused on the latency issue or in other words, the connection into the -- into very fast and broadband networks to where they are now focused on the latency being less of an issue, not -- I wouldn't say it's not an issue, but less of an issue and the speed to market for power generation and gas resources being available to power that are coming front and center, along with the local air permitting issues associated with that. So I would just tell you, it is kind of an exciting time for us and even for me personally to be in such a steep learning curve on how we are going to make the very best use of our assets, but there certainly is not a dearth opportunity for us in that regard. In fact, as I said, it's a little bit overwhelming, and we're going to have to just make sure we make the very highest use of our assets because there obviously is as we expand the lower-cost expansions drive very high returns, but we only have so many of those. And those are precious, and we know that -- and so we're making sure that we make the various high return associated with the expansion around our assets. So we're not going to put a number on it because I hear people putting a number on it. And frankly, that's a very large guess. And in a time frame frankly, that's out there so far that -- and if you're not speaking to the returns that you're making on the project, I'm not really the purpose of quoting those kind of numbers when you're not really talking about the economic or financial impact to your business, and we're not ready to lay that out. But I can tell you that if anybody else has more opportunity than we do, I wish them luck because we're going to have a hard time keeping up with the opportunity in front of us right now. So hopefully, that gives you some color, but I would tell you, I think it's not all that meaningful to quote volumes on expansions if you're not talking about returns and you're not talking about the time frame for those opportunities.
Praneeth Satish: Got it. No, that's helpful. That's great. And maybe just switching gears, can you help us understand what the next steps are for REA following the DC Circuit Court's decision? I guess, have you filed for an emergency petition to keep the pipeline in service? And is there gas flowing today? Just trying to understand whether this impacts the early in service at all?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Well, first of all, yes, gas is up and flowing, and kudos to our team for being able to respond so quickly to that. Just incredible project execution on that project in a difficult area. And I'm going to turn it to Lane Wilson, our General Counsel, to speak to the label proceeding.
Lane Wilson: Yes. So I think the next step will be speaking at temporary certificate. This is not new to FERC. They've dealt with this issue before. We fully anticipate they'll be defending the certificate. We'll be seeking rehearing on a timely basis, and that's probably about 35 days out at this point, maybe 37, 38. But we don't have any concerns that we're going to be able to continue to operate. Don't have any concerns about getting a temporary certificate and ultimately don't have any concerns about defending what FERC has done on this project.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan.
Jeremy Tonet: Just want to look at the guidance here and what the current thoughts are with regards to producer production expectations over the -- I guess, the balance of the year and into 25 years is the expectation that we've kind of hit the lows and there's kind of a growth from these points? Or just how you see production trending across your gathering assets?
Micheal Dunn: Jeremy, it's Micheal. Yes, I think right now, we feel good about where we're at in regard to our current forecast for the production profiles coming from our customers. You've got to look at it between the rich basins and the dry gas. And obviously, the dry gas is challenged by pricing now. So producers are making a month of decision on gas volumes that they might shut in. I think you probably saw Cutera's announcement where they were shutting in $300 million for the month of August. And it's really a month-by-month decision for all the producers out there. But right now, we've anticipated this, as you've probably seen through the first half of the year. The team did a really good job anticipating where the production shut-ins would occur and the delayed tills and ducts. I would say right now, we've got over a Bcf of delayed TILs in the queue right now between all of our customer base, meaning that the producers have drilled the wells and completed them, and we've connected to them, and are ready to go when the price signals are there. And there's over 1 Bcf as well of us, so they've been drilled but not completed on our systems. So there's definitely a lot of opportunity to bring on gas as a producer, we see a price signal. And so I'd say our risk basins are still outperforming. We're seeing good pricing netbacks for the producers there, and that certainly buffers the dry gas situation that we have right now. But all in all, we feel good about our end-of-year forecast. And certainly, 2025 is going to be presentative as well. The Golden Pass LNG facility, you probably saw the announcement yesterday that they're going to be an end of 2025 in service, it appears. And so that should have been anticipated already by the market. It looks like with the forward curve. And producers will be making decisions on these curves. And when prices elevate, obviously, they'll hedge into that and keep their volumes flowing is what we anticipate. So we're really comfortable with where our current forecasts are.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. And I just wanted to pivot towards LEG, if I could. And I just wanted to see your latest thoughts on moving forward there. With regards to FERC requesting more information, just wondering if you could update us there on how you think about that?
Chad Zamarin: Yes. We've responded to the FERC data request, and we fully anticipate that FERC is either going to dismissed this matter or find a LEG as a gathering system. We don't -- really don't have any concerns there. And so there's really nothing for us to do right now except to continue down the current road, which is in construction. Again, we feel pretty confident about where we are in this project.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis of Citibank.
Spiro Dounis: Alan, I want to go back on your closing comments there and maybe if we could tie power generation demand with how you're thinking about the EBITDA outlook longer term. So one of your slides, Slide 17 points to 10x the amount of electricity demand grow over the next 10 years versus the last 10 years. I think you mentioned in your comments there, you guys have been able to grow at about an 8% CAGR historically. So as you think about the go forward here, you guys have that 5% to 7% growth target out there. Is it sort get about that as maybe potentially moving higher in this environment, which I don't think you contemplated when you sort of laid that out there.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Spiro, it's a great question actually. And I do think that there is plenty of potential, even in the face of just the law of big numbers and continuing to put an absolute level of growth against a bigger and bigger number, that's as you know, has grown faster than we've expected over the last 3 or 4 years. But I do think that given the strength of the return on our projects and the kinds of opportunities that are coming at us right now, I do think that, that is a fairly high profitability that we could expand beyond that. And particularly, as we get into the '27-'28 time frame, and because I do think that people thinking that, for instance, data center load and power gen load -- for us, that's going to result in capacity sales on our transmission systems. And that is going to take time to -- we're completely contracted out on our existing capacity. And so that is when we take time to build that out. But I do think as we get into '27 and '28, we're going to see a very strong impact from the kind of demand that we're seeing right now. The good news is for us, and I think a little bit uniquely, I think, is the number of projects we already have coming on in '25, '26 and '27, give a great runway of growth. And I don't remember a time when we've looked out and thought we've got this kind of accelerating growth into that past the next 3 or 4 years. So I do think that we just got done with our long-range plan and strategic planning. It was a very encouraging look at what our business looks like for the future with the kind of demand that we have coming in. And frankly, I would say we've been pretty conservative in marking that into our plan at this point. So yes, I do think that we certainly -- there's very high profitability that we'll be able to exceed that over the next 5 years.
Spiro Dounis: Great. That's helpful color. Second question, just going to M&A. Was hoping for an update on the landscape. And if you're seeing the same value proposition you saw over the last 2 years or maybe if we could expect you to look a little bit more inward now and consolidate some of these other JV positions?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I mean there's certainly an inventory of opportunity. Obviously, the discovery joint venture that we bought in here in -- just recently, obviously, is one of those that was important for us and particularly where we're seeing the growth. And certainly, as we look at the free cash flow that this business generates, we are looking for places to make wise investments with that capital. And so that certainly represents a target opportunity for us in terms of the joint ventures that we -- I would say, we were very fortunate to have great partners like the Canadian investment -- Canadian Public Investment Fund that helped us in the OVM area and helped us really expand that area pretty dramatically. And we're excited to have them as partners, but there will be a time perhaps where they would want to monetize that. So a good example of one where it worked out perfectly well and now provides an inventory investment opportunity for us in future. But I would say we're going to be patient about that, and we're going to have to have a willing seller on the other side to want to go and execute those.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta of UBS.
Manav Gupta: Quick follow-up a little bit on the lines of Spero. It looks like you bought some stuff from PSX. I know as a part of a partnership, about $170 million you paid for it. So help us understand the strategic thought rationally if buying at this point and buying from PSX? And obviously, I think PSX is in market with some other assets would you be interested in those also?
Chad Zamarin: Yes. This is Chad Zamarin. I'd say, again, we owned 60% of the Discovery joint venture with Phillips 66, and they've been a great partner for us. But -- you've heard a lot about our offshore growth. And so it's certainly a core part of our business and a very attractive growth profile ahead. And so we very core for us, I think you'd probably hear not core for PSX. So as Alan mentioned, where we have joint venture interests, we understand the operations of those facilities. It's a low-risk investment for us. We see growth coming. In this quarter, if you think about Discovery, we were able to acquire that at what we think is a low multiple on a go-forward basis, as you'll see the growth in Discovery really ramp up remainder of this year and even more impressively into 2025 and beyond. And are stable on the other hand, again, an asset that we've owned for a had a great relationship there, but not core to our business, and Pembina has been consolidating their ownership in Aux Sable and the Alliance pipeline system. And so we're able to sell that we saw pretty high mobile and. And you think about the difference in those cash flows, Aux Sable is a more volatile commodity-exposed set of cash flows discovery contracted asset that's going to grow. So I don't think that, that should be translated to other assets that PSX may own. It really is us, I think, rotating and optimizing our portfolio in a way that's going to create incremental value. And that's really the strategy when we look at any transaction, where do we have a unique opportunity to turn something into more value by owning or consolidating that interest.
Manav Gupta: Perfect. My quick follow-up is, obviously, we get a lot of questions on storage. So what is your thought process on current storage rates and expansion opportunity? You could talk about the set of opportunities as it is to storage?
Chad Zamarin: Sure. Yes, this is Chad again. We've only owned the Hartery storage assets for just 6, 7 months, and we've already seen really attractive recontracting of storage at rates that have exceeded our expectations. We have been in the test whether or not we're seeing those rates and the tenor of terms approach expansion economics. We've seen the storage market certainly growing in value. That's why we acquired Nordex, the Gulf Coast storage. We acquired Clay Basin in the largest storage asset in the Rockies as part of the MountainWest acquisition. And in all cases, we've seen an increase in value in storage over the last few years. I'd say that we're still climbing the curve towards what we think makes sense from an expansion perspective are, I think, approaching the rates that are required for both brownfield and potentially greenfield expansion, but we're still needing to see a bit more depth in erosion rates for us to put large capital to work in expanding those facilities. But all signs are -- we've shaped the fundamentals. We haven't grown stores as a country at all over the last 10 years, while gas demand has been and will continue to grow significantly and importantly, we'll grow in more volatile markets. And so we have a lot of confidence that storage will continue to increase in value and we will, at some point, reach the point at which expansions it makes a lot of sense.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities.
Neal Dingmann: And my first question, just on the gum, especially. Could you talk about the continued upside there. Specifically, it's interesting. It seems like you have a lot of opportunities for additional projects. I mean, I think you all mentioned the 2 to 0 CapEx tiebacks that you announced after in that acreage dedication. So I'm just wondering sort of not even for the remainder of this year, but in '25, how are you sort of looking at upside potential there?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, great question. A lot of exciting things going on in the Deepwater. And again, we've got so much activity going on. I think it's easy to overlook the amount of execution that's gone on, on projects like Well, which were -- Shell is working the way at most of our work has retired on that at this point. And so there's a little bit of remaining commissioning but for the most part, our work there and the risk of our work has been retired. So we're excited about seeing that project come on. And that by far is the largest. The second largest is Chevron's Ballymore project, and that's actually been accelerated a little bit, from our original plans in terms of the timing on that will take a shutdown on the in faith platform that feeds into us here in the back half of this year. But exciting project coming on there as well. And a great example of one where very large project kind of like anchor, but no capital required on our part. Those are very favorite projects in terms of adding incremental value in the business. And there's a lot of drilling activity going on and -- in and around our assets that we think is going to continue to drive value. One of the things that's really changed in the Deepwater is, if you roll the clock back 15, 20 years ago, people were building these mammoth platforms -- floating platforms, deepwater platforms that were an incredible engineering feeds. But it took a long time, a lot of uncertainty and a lot of risk. And today, what we're seeing is producers working hard to find reserves and develop reserves around their asset base and their existing infrastructure. And with that comes extremely high incremental returns for us because we're not having to build out to that new infrastructure. And so I would say in the Deepwater, that is one of the really powerful things for us is the fact that we built a lot of this infrastructure with latent capacity in it and add that -- just because it costs so much to lay a line in that depth of water way. And as that latent capacity fills up, we're getting very high incremental cash flows off of that. So -- but we are continuing to see a lot of activity and the producers happen to be. We're very fortunate that a lot of the activity happens to be centered around our asset base in the Deepwater. And it really goes not just in the Western Gulf where there's a lot of activity. The Central Gulf, which we talked about today with both Anchor and Winterfell and Shenandoah is the next to come on. Next year, we spend a lot of time and effort getting prepared for Shenandoah because it is a fairly large prospects that will be coming on to our discovery system that will be coming on next year. And then in the Eastern Gulf, of course, you heard me mention the Hess project, it's a tieback Gulf Star as well as the Chevron's Ballymore prospect. So a lot of activity going on could be happier to have the really strong competitive advantages that we have
Neal Dingmann: Fantastic details. And then just one quick one on West. Specifically, you've been -- there's been quite a bit going on in the DJ with -- around the acquisitions there. I'm just wondering can you talk about potential near-term upside around what you see for those acquisitions?
Alan Armstrong: Sorry, me on Curtin and our Rock?
Neal Dingmann: Yes.
Alan Armstrong: Chad, do you want to take that?
Chad Zamarin: Yes. I would say that area continues to perform and, frankly, outperform. We really like the positioning that we have. We've got not only are we seeing more integration value in being able to optimize processing and gathering in basin. But because we market and transport the NGLs, we see a lot of margin from that growth further downstream. And so -- yes, I think you're already seeing some of the important contributions, and we do expect that to continue to grow for a long time to come. So we expect our performance
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Zack Van Everen of TPH & Company.
Zack Van Everen: Just shifting to the Northeast. You mentioned rates on the Susquehanna and Bradford ticked up this quarter. I know you have cost of service contracts, at least on the Bradford side. Was that part of dynamic? Or was this something else? And is this kind of a good run rate going forward? Or is this kind of a onetime revenue makeup like we saw last year?
Micheal Dunn: Well, this is Micheal. With the cost of service agreement we had in Bradford has reverted to a fixed fee for the contract terms. So that has been finished and completed and negotiated with all the customers on the Bradford. And so I would just say, we did have a onetime drop last year that obviously affected the comparable for this year. But other than that, you should expect to see this as a run rate. Fee with obviously escalation being the variable there going forward. And then any expansions that we do would be negotiated as well through the capital that would be invested in those expansion opportunities there in Bradford.
Alan Armstrong: Probably the main thing that you see in the numbers you're looking at a the fact that when we see more and more activity in the rich gas like we've been seeing, you see our margins in the rich gas are almost double what they are in the sometimes more than that. And so as the drilling moves into some of these rich gas developments like in the Utica and in Southwestern PA and West Virginia, you will see our average rate increase as the more and more of the mix moves into the rich gas. In addition to that, though, we have the inflation adjuster that hits every spring as well. And so that picks up those rates as well. So a lot of positive momentum on rates. And importantly, as we've said in the past, when the dry gas area is challenged, typically, we see the rich gas respond, and we make somewhat higher margin on the rich guest because of all the services we provide on it that tends to offset declines in the dry gas.
Zack Van Everen: Got you. That makes sense. And then maybe shifting to the Rockies. One of your peers announced they'd be converting their crude pipe out of the Bakken that flows into Wyoming into NGL service. Probably a little bit far out, but is there a space on Overland? And would you guys be interested in able to take those volumes if they were to approach you on that?
Alan Armstrong: Chad, do you want to take that?
Chad Zamarin: Yes, sure. This is Chad. There is based on Overland Pass and we do see that as an opportunity. And I think good, frankly, for the Bakken producers that are some takeaway diversity, and we're certainly focused on making sure we'd be a good option to receive NGLs from the Bakken and from the Powder River Basin. So yes, we do think there's an opportunity there. We're not going to get too far ahead of that, but we're hopeful to see those barrels fighting south. And yes, we've got capacity in one pass that would be available.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Catellier of CIBC Capital Markets.
Robert Catellier: Understanding that you flow rates by the end of the month on Transco. Could you give us any insight into the progress you're making there in the likelihood of a settlement? And also your interpretation of shipper appetite to support modernization investments in light of your new methane intensity targets?
Micheal Dunn: Yes. Thanks for the question. Yes, we would love to see a settlement there. We'll obviously get our rate case filed at the end of the month and then work on seeing if we can get to a settlement. We've obviously been talking to the customers for quite some time about the modernization efforts that we have underway. And there should be no surprise to them when we make our filing and they see the amount of investment that we've made there. And so we do think that will help possibly grease the skids for some type of modernization tracker with them so that we could smooth out some of these increases going forward on the Transco assets, just like we've done on the Northwest pipeline. Rates with our last rate case that we settled there. So that is the intent going in as hopefully, we can get a modernization tracker, not just for our emissions reduction program, but for some of our pipe replacements that are needed some of the growing population centers there. We have a significant amount of pipe that we derated over the last several years and decades that we could upgrade and we will be doing that, but it would be better to do that through a modernization tracker as well. So that is the intent. But we've had a pretty good opportunity to discuss and alert the customers as to what to expect in this rate case. And once we get it filed, we'll start the settlement opportunities. But -- as you probably well know, the rates will go into effect on March 1 of next year, subject to refund once we either get a settlement or fully mitigate the outcome on the rate case.
Robert Catellier: Okay. And then next question here is just on the -- what's going on in the legal realm. How does the DC circuit decision in REA and also the Chevron difference case reversal impact how you're approaching permitting?
Alan Armstrong: Lane, do you want to take that?
Lane Wilson: Yes, it's Lane Wilson. On REA, well, I mean, first Chevron difference. I don't think anybody really knows for certain -- how that's going to play out, except that it will likely force the administration and subsequent administrations to stick more closely to what Congress has set out in laws and probably means fewer pendulum swings. I think that's probably good for the industry on the whole. And in terms of REA, what was your specific question?
Robert Catellier: Yes. I'm just wondering if that decision changes how you approach future permitting activities?
Lane Wilson: Yes, I don't think so. I mean, I think we feel like FERC active certificate order that was very defensible. It's -- the decision is unfortunate that the DC Circuit did what it generally does in this situation to kind of lay out a path for the FERC to fix the certificate, and that's what we expect to happen. I don't think that the Chevron case, Lower has any real impact on the way we'll approach certificates in the future.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson of Scotiabank.
Tristan Richardson: Just a question on the Gillis West project, a small project, but can you give out maybe some of the key differences between this project is a Transco expansion versus, say, a LEG from a permitting standpoint, right-of-way standpoint? It seems like this is certainly a smaller project, but offers quite a few efficiencies from a capital and permitting perspective.
Alan Armstrong: Tristan, thanks for the question. And the reason this is important is because that CenterPoint has been plagued with a number of very high price spikes in the Texas intrastate market for various reasons. And this allows them access to gas supplies that are more associated with the Henry Hub from a pricing point and gives them reliable access to supplies from Louisiana without being dependent on the volatility that some of the Texas intrastate pipes and markets have imposed on them, both for power generation and for normal residential loads. So we think it's a great project for CenterPoint and important for us, really, all we need to do there is primarily just an interconnect and that will allow for us to provide gas supplies coming into the Louisiana market, places like Giles, which is becoming obviously an important pooling point for supplies. And this will allow them access to those supply points from places like the Haynesville and diversifies their supply and again, kind of moves them away through volatility. So for us, it's a great project because it's effectively. We're getting paid for transportation capacity flowing back to Texas and requires variable capital on our part, mostly just the interconnect there. So -- exciting and I think a meaningful improvement for Texas and the volatility they've had to deal with there from some of the suppliers into that market. And -- but in terms of -- this is just basically transmission quality gas coming out of Giles that will help supply directly to their markets there down the Transco corridor. So pretty simple on one hand, but pretty important on the other.
Tristan Richardson: I appreciate it, Alan. And then maybe just on the last line of questioning a broader question about the regulatory environment. It's been 2 years since we've had a full board of commissioners and we're here at a time where you're seeing meaningful demand in the Southeast Mid-Atlantic. Can you talk about what you would like to see on the permitting side from a streamlining or just anything to be able to better accommodate the demand you're seeing?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. It's a great question. I think the primary issue with the permitting, it's not really the FERC. FERC, I think, has been very responsible agency, particularly under Chairman Philips leadership. And I think they're trying to do the very best to see responsible infrastructure get developed, and they realize it's very clear to them the kind of challenges that we're going to have on the grid if we don't have natural gas supplies available to provide incremental power supplies on the one hand and backing up renewables on the other. That is not lost on them at all. They face that responsibility as a commission and an agency, and I think they take it So that's not really where the problem. The problem really revolves around the NEPA process and the handles that it gives to environmental opposition to take up issues that have very little to do with the pipeline construction, but have to do with their own fight against fossil fuels. And because the NEPA process allows them to kind of grab hold of projects and appropriately the NEPA reform is probably the most important thing and really excited everybody has been talking about the Chevron deference, which we think is important, but you also saw the Supreme Court agreed to take up a review of the NEPA process as well. And I'm actually really excited to see that. That could really reform permitting in a way that's meaningful and really stop people from being able to just arbitrarily stop projects and they're tracking cause lawsuits in the process, which is the NEPA process that we know today. And so anyway, that's important to the 401 water quality certificate that the states are allowed that gives them a right to just stop projects is important to see that turned around and as well as the judicial standard for the way that a court would review a complaint against the permit. So those are really the 3 primary things that we're looking for. And I actually were pretty normally not very optimistic about seeing anything happening on the permitting reform, but really excited to see the Supreme Court taking on the NEPA review. So we could see some. It's not going to be quick, but we could see some relief there down the road.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen of Barclays.
Theresa Chen: Based on what we've seen in the market very recently as far as the data center related or data center-driven brownfield expansion on natural gas transmission. The implied rates seem to be far above several multiples of existing tariffs and economics. Is that consistent with your expectations as you move through the process of addressing the sheer number of requests you have? And is that a key hurdle in getting these projects done in addition to speed to market?
Micheal Dunn: Theresa, this is Micheal. Yes, I would say we're still going to be seeing negotiated rate contracts as we've been doing on our transmission businesses that are in excess of our base tariff rates believe that's what your question was. And as Alan said, there's a lot of opportunities that we're exploring, not just on Transco at on Northwest Pipeline or MountainWest Pipeline and Overthrust pipeline that we're considering and allocating resources to all of the analyze has been a bit of a challenge. And so redeploying some of our engineers and project development teams to really focus on this has been a critical activity over the last several months. But I would say we're going to see really good multiples on our projects. We aren't doing 6x multiple projects on any of our transmission businesses. And in fact, none of them have a 5 handle anymore. So I think that is a trend will continue because, as Alan said, the speed to market is incredibly important for these data center loads. And the fact that they need to be online quickly as their biggest priority as opposed to what their energy appears to us. And so that does certainly give us some leverage in the workplace especially with the I think it gives us an incredible opportunity to serve these new loads.
Theresa Chen: Got it. And a follow-up on the regulatory front. As we approach the election season in the fall, what are your latest thoughts around that as it pertains to assets within your business? Any key considerations on your mind as we move through the next few months on this front?
Alan Armstrong: Yeah, well, that's a big, hairy topic, but I'll just try to address it quickly. First of all, the taxes is probably are the most important thing, and it's very real to us in terms of the ability to continue to invest in these high-return projects that we have as an opportunity in front of how the tax impact on our business and the amount of free cash flow. So it's pretty obvious to us that delta and something we're keeping a close eye on. Beyond that and you have to remind people this that even during the prior Trump administration, we had major projects get stopped like Constitution and Nesi because of the 401 water quality certificate that allowed to stop project without really an ability for the government to solve that. And so I think it's great that there will be a bigger push. I actually think paying more attention to how Congress turns out and the legislative front is actually a bigger push because that's actually where we might see some reform in the law in a way that allows us to build out the pipeline infrastructure that we need. And so we saw recently the Manchin, Barrasso Bill did really nothing for the pipeline. And while we are very thankful to both Senator Mansion and Senator Manchin to Senator Barrasso and what they've done for our industry. In this case, that was really a throw to the transmission side of the business and really didn't do much for pipelines. And so we think there's got to be some -- and we did that. That's the state of the current Congress and the way the numbers stack up in there today. I think they both would like to do more, obviously, for pipelines if they thought that was possible. And so we do think that watching to see how the legislature turns out could be an opportunity to see some serious reform on the permitting front. So I would say we're paying a little more attention to that, frankly.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Mackay of Goldman Sachs.
John Mackay: I wanted to go back to the conversation quickly if we can around data centers. Just on the comments around speed to market. I was just wondering if you could flesh that out a little bit more for us, but that would actually look like? Is that the location on Transco? Is that something non-FERC jurisdictional? Anything you can bring up there would be helpful.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Well, John, thanks for the question. I would just say that what we're seeing is a shift because I think that the developers are realizing that they're kind of up against a brick wall right now in terms of extracting more generation off the grid. They realize that that's pretty well exited. And so they're going to look to areas where both natural gas resource is available. The capacity for it is available and as well as the permitting allows them to go build out some very significant power generation behind the meter on the one hand. We still are seeing a lot of growth on the utilities as well, more for the conventional data centers and the cloud-based data centers, a lot of growth continuing as well as just general electrification of load. Sorry, that is driving that as well. But in terms of the hyperscaler and their approach right now, we are seeing them look all the way back into areas where the gas resource is abundant and the permitting allows for getting on with developing the infrastructure that they need to have reliable and affordable power into those markets. But as Micheal -- I think the -- in my earlier comments, the speed to market seems to be the thing that is most top of mind for the big, big hyperscaler developers. And so that's where we think there's going to be opportunity in places like Wyoming where we have a lot of gas resource available and a lot of wind resource available as well. And so I think we're going to see that. But we're also going to get a lot of indirect load from our utilities in these other areas as both the conventional data centers and electrification continues to grow in those markets.
John Mackay: I appreciate that, and I acknowledge we're at top of the hour. I'll squeeze one more in. It's relatively small, but pretty interesting. I guess we've had a lot of conversations around trying to get gas out of Texas into Louisiana given the LNG ramp. I guess I'd just be curious your perspective, is this a macro trend kind of shifting? Is this kind of more of a maybe one-off with this customer? Anything you can kind of frame up from a kind of Louisiana demand-ramp perspective would be interesting.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Well, I would just say, if you think about all of the supply that the Haynesville has available and some of the resources even south of Haynesville that we think will get developed in a pricing environment that's coming forward right now. We think that having access to those Louisiana supplies the diversity of supply, is really important. Again, as I've mentioned in my comments, if you think about the pain that has been inflicted on some of the Texas utilities from the Texas intrastate market where they didn't have us to a more diverse supply. We think this is a trend. I mean, it only makes sense that they're going to look to see what's been imposed on them from a pricing standpoint and look for more liable loss supplies to be available. And to me, that's the important thing about this is then recognizing that, that fluctuation did not occur in places like Louisiana and really only incurred on the Texas intrastate markets, and this gives them access to a more diverse supply. So that is the keynote to take away from that project.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back over to Alan Armstrong, President and CEO, for closing remarks.
Alan Armstrong: Okay. Well, thank you all very much for joining us today. An exciting time for us here at Williams as we continue to deliver the long list of projects that we have in execution and that continues to mount growth for us. and importantly, how strong the future is in terms of the demand that we are excited that we have an opportunity to help address, but an exciting challenge for the organization that we're excited to show what we're made of on that front. So with that, thank you very much for joining us today.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-07 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to The Williams First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Danilo Juvane, Vice President of Investor Relations, ESG and Investment Analysis. Please go ahead. 
Danilo Juvane: Thanks, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in The Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon, we released our earnings and press release and the presentation that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and our Chief Financial Officer, John Porter, who will speak to this morning. Also joining us on the call are Micheal Dunn, our Chief Operating Officer; Lane Wilson, our General Counsel; and Chad Zamarin, our Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development.  
 In our presentation materials, you'll find a disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in the presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconcile with generally accepted accounting principles. And these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the day's presentation material. And with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong. 
Alan Armstrong: Okay. Well, thanks, Danilo, and thank you all for joining us today. Well, another first quarter and another strong start for Williams. So let me begin here on Slide 2 by calling out a few operational financial and strategic achievements we saw this first quarter. Starting here on the left of this slide, Yet again, we've set a record for contracted transmission capacity led by Transco, the largest and fastest-growing natural gas pipeline. And in January, we closed on our acquisition of a portfolio of Natural Gas Storage assets from an affiliate of Hartree partners for approximately $1.9 billion. The transaction included 6 underground natural gas storage facilities located in Louisiana and Mississippi, making us the largest owner of storage on the Gulf Coast.  
 Demand for natural gas has greatly outpaced natural gas storage capacity since 2010. And our thesis of this underinvestment is now being realized as this newly acquired storage is being re-contracted at rates above our acquisition expectations. In fact, storage rates have reached the point of supporting Brownfield expansions, and we are gauging interest from customers willing to underwrite potential expansion of these facilities in the form of long-term contracts. Also in the first quarter, we announced the expansion of the Southeast Supply Enhancement project to roughly 1.6 Bcf a day of capacity, and we prefiled this project with the FERC on February 1. We expect to make the official FERC filing later this year. And I'll remind you that this project will serve both the Mid-Atlantic and the Southeast markets. These markets are experiencing increasing gas demand from power generation and the reshoring of industrial loads.  
 Since the time of our open season, the large utilities that we serve in this area have come back and provided dramatic increases to their generation needs based on data centers to be built in the region, as well as reshoring of industrial markets. So we believe that we are in the early innings for expansions in these Mid-Atlantic and Southeast markets. Our project execution teams also delivered an impressive list of accomplishments this quarter. 
 In total, we have 20 high-return projects in execution across our business, including approximately 3.1 Bcf per day of expansion on Transco, which equates to a 15% increase in fully contracted long-term capacity that will be coming online over the next few years. Within these Transco opportunities, a few noteworthy accomplishments to hit.  
 First, we placed the Carolina Market Link in service and now began receiving the full revenues in this quarter. Next, we commenced construction for the Southside Reliability Enhancement and the Southeast Energy Connector projects, and we received the FERC order for the Alabama-Georgia Connector and the Texas to Louisiana Energy Pathway projects. And finally, we're advancing a number of modest but high-return expansion projects on our MountainWest Transmission System.
 This is a period where we have a tremendous amount of large projects and sometimes it's easy to overlook things as large as even the well deepwater project but happy to report to you that great execution by our teams there in some pretty difficult environments has that project coming in quite a bit below our original capital estimate on that project, and we do expect now this project to start up towards the end of this year. So congratulations to our deepwater team that have been working on that project for about 4 years now, and pretty remarkable accomplishments to get that project in on budget and actually below budget.  
 And then finally, our teams are well on their way to replacing 112 mainline compressor units with state-of-the-art low-emission turbines and electric drive units on Transco and Northwest Pipe. As a reminder, these projects will generate an incremental regulated return realized through a rate case or a traction mechanism that will begin in 2025. So again, a huge body of work there to go in and replace this compression that is well past its useful life, but the team is doing a great job. You can imagine the efforts that go into replacing that scale of operations. But we have so much going on. It's kind of easy to miss. So and we're excited to see the earnings from that show up in '25. So now turning to the highlights of our first quarter financial performance.  
 We delivered quarterly EBITDA of $1.934 billion, which was 8% higher than last year, an impressive feat given the tough comp we were up against and the 25% year-over-year decline in natural gas prices and the lack of severe winter weather in most of our markets. An important takeaway from the quarter is that our outperformance occurred despite year-over-year lower earnings in the marketing and upstream segments, which reaffirms the strength and resilience of our underlying business, no matter the commodity price environment. To this end, we expect to deliver our EBITDA in the top half of our earlier guidance.
 And to be clear, we think we can accomplish this with continued soft gas prices and without any further earnings contributions from our Marketing segment. Due to the ongoing steady growth and resilience of our business, we recently raised the 2024 dividend by 6.1% underscoring our confidence in our ability to continue this strong record of per share growth through even extreme low commodity price environments and with the slate of high-return growth projects under execution right now and in development.  
 Williams remains well positioned to grow at this rate for many years to come. And with that, I'll turn it over to John to walk through the quarter and year-to-date financials. John? 
John Porter: All right. Thanks, Alan. Starting here on Slide 3 with a summary of our year-over-year financial performance. Beginning with adjusted EBITDA, we saw an 8% year-over-year increase despite natural gas prices that averaged less than $2 for the first quarter of 2024. Now included in that 8% overall growth is almost 13% growth from our primarily fee-based infrastructure businesses, excluding marketing and the upstream JV. As we'll see on the next slide, our adjusted EBITDA growth was driven by strong growth from our core large-scale Natural Gas Transmission, Gathering and Processing and Storage businesses, including the expected favorable effects of our recent acquisitions. And it also included strong performance from our Sequent Marketing business, which had another strong start to the year despite falling a bit short of the extraordinary start they had to 2023.  
 Our adjusted EPS increased 5% for the quarter, continuing to grow off of the 19% ,5-year CAGR we've had for EPS for 2018 through 2023. And available funds from operations growth was just over 4%. Also, you see our dividend coverage based on AFFO was a very strong 2.6x on a dividend that grew 6.1% over the prior year. And our debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.79x in line with our expectations for slightly higher leverage in 2024 before dropping back down in 2025 to guidance of 3.6x. So before we move to the next slide and dig a little deeper into our adjusted EBITDA growth for the quarter.
 We'll provide a few updates to our financial guidance. Overall, based on our strong start to 2024, we are now guiding to the upper half of our 2024 adjusted EBITDA range of $6.95 billion to $7.1 billion and we are also well positioned for upside to drive towards the high end of this original guidance. We also remain well positioned to deliver on our 2025 adjusted EBITDA range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion.  
 Additionally, based on our improved adjusted EBITDA outlook and other changes, including interest expense and income assumption shifts, we now see our key per share metrics, adjusted EPS and AFFO per share coming in at the high end of their ranges for 2024, which in the case of AFFO per share would lead to a higher overall dividend coverage ratio as well. Now specifically for 2024, our transmission in Gulf of Mexico business is tracking a bit ahead of plan with a good first quarter and expectations of continued best-in-class execution on our many key high-returning organic projects, as well as immediate results from our Gulf Coast storage acquisition with strong performance expected going forward.
 Our Northeast Gathering and Processing business was basically right on plan for first quarter with drilling in the higher-margin wet gas areas and inflation adjusters offsetting lower volumes in some dry gas areas.  
 The West got off to a strong start in the first quarter, where DJ performance following our recent transactions along with all the hard work our teams did in preparing for winter allowed for excellent execution, especially across our Rocky's assets. We see the West also tracking a bit ahead of plan, although we're also embedding a bit more conservatism around Haynesville volume assumptions. For both the Northeast and West G&P assets, our guidance update today provides room for additional volume reductions and for upside movement toward the higher end of the range if those don't occur. For the Marketing business, we've had a strong overall start to 2024. But again, beating the midpoint of our full year 2024 guidance doesn't rely on any additional help from Sequent at this point.  
 And then finally, nice to see our upstream joint ventures off to a strong start versus our plan, again, supported by the preparation our team made for winter weather. So we expect our upstream joint ventures to perform well against their plan this year as well. So let's turn to the next slide and take a little closer look at the first quarter results. Again, it was a strong start to the year with 8% growth over the prior year.
 Walking now from last year's $1.795 billion to this year's record $1.934 billion, we start with our Transmission in Gulf of Mexico business, which improved $111 million or 15% due to the combined effects of nearly a full quarter contribution from the Hartree Gulf Coast Storage acquisition, which is delivering as expected, following a flawless integration effort thus far. Higher Transco revenues, including partial and service from the Regional Energy Access project, and also a full quarter contribution from the MountainWest Pipeline acquisition, which closed mid-February in 2023.  
 The Segment growth was unfavorably impacted by last year's Bayou Ethane divestiture and also some planned maintenance at Discovery. Our Northeast G&P business performed well with the $34 million or 7% increase driven by a $22 million increase in service revenues. This revenue increase was fueled by rate escalations that occurred after the first quarter of last year. Overall Northeast Gathering volumes performed roughly in line with our plan, down about 2% versus the prior year, with those decreases focused in the dry gas areas. Shifting now to the West, which increased $42 million or 15%, benefiting from a great start for the DJ transactions we completed in the fourth quarter of 2023.
 Now the increase in the DJ Basin results was about the same magnitude as the unfavorable loss of hedge gains that we had in the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, last year, the West was significantly unfavorably impacted by the severe Wyoming weather and January processing economics at our Opal, Wyoming processing plant.  
 As I mentioned a moment ago, much work was done by our teams to prepare for winter weather this year, and those preparations proved effective in getting us off to a great start for the West and also for our upstream operations in Wyoming. Overall, West gathering volumes performed roughly in line with our plan, up 5% on the benefits of our DJ transaction and better Wyoming volumes, which more than offset declines primarily in the Haynesville area. And then you see the $41 million or 18% decrease in our Gas and NGL marketing business. 
 As I mentioned a moment ago, it was another strong start to the year, but it did come up a bit short of the extraordinary 2023 start. Our upstream joint venture operations included in our Other segment were down about $9 million or 15% from last year. Our Wamsutter upstream EBITDA was actually up about $8 million with strong volume growth that was substantially offset by lower net realized prices. However, the Wamsutter increase was more than offset by lower Haynesville results from both lower net production volumes and net realized prices. So again, a strong start to 2024 with 8% growth in EBITDA, driven by core infrastructure business performance with continued strength from our marketing business.
 And with that, I'll turn it back to Alan. 
Alan Armstrong: Okay. Thanks, John. And so just a few closing remarks before we turn it over to your questions. First of all, natural gas demand is not just growing now, it is accelerating. This period of low natural gas prices is reaffirming the great bargain that natural gas offers as a practical low-cost, clean energy solution and the power hungry world we live in is rapid turning to natural gas to generate this power. This compounded with the hard to miss growth in LNG exports and data centers as well as the continued drumbeat of electrify everything and resort it is accelerating demand and the expansions of our uniquely placed infrastructure will demand a premium. We have been betting on and setting our strategy around the benefits of natural gas for many years and have focused our investments in this space. 
 So if you want to invest in natural gas infrastructure, no one is more concentrated than Williams. We are the most natural gas-centric large-scale midstream company around today, and our natural gas-focused strategy will be relevant for decades to come, thanks to the accelerating natural gas demand we are seeing today. Our strong conviction of the strategy led us to the bolt-on acquisitions of strategic assets like MountainWest Pipeline, Hartree Storage and NorTex Storage. A couple of points on these acquisitions. First, these deals were quickly -- sorry, these deals were directly in line with our strategy based on where we thought the puck was going. The synergies and commercial opportunities we expected are already being realized, thanks to clear plans and decisive actions. And finally, I'll reiterate our belief that Williams remains a compelling investment opportunity. 
 Our conservative but distinct strategy continues to deliver steady, predictable growth and value to our shareholders and checks all the boxes that a long-term investor looks for in a durable and winning portfolio. We've now seen 11 consecutive years of adjusted EBITDA growth and an 8% CAGR of adjusted EBITDA since 2018 and I'll remind you that, that is without issuing equity to drive this growth. In addition, we have recognized a 19.5% return on our invested capital during the same period, and our steadfast project execution has led to record contracted transmission capacity and will continue to drive growth in 2024 and beyond. On the predictability front, we have met or beat analyst estimates for 33 quarters in a row now and beat the estimate 2/3 of the time over this 8-year period. And this year marks the 50th year in a row that The Williams Companies has paid a dividend. 
 In closing, we've built a business that is delivering record profitability and strong financial returns in the present, but is positioned even better for the future. And with that, I'll open it up for your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Spiro Dounis with Citi. 
Spiro Dounis: First one, maybe to start with the guidance, two-part question there. So John, you'd mentioned leaving room for some volume reductions from here. Curious if you could provide a little more detail there and how to think about maybe the cadence as we go throughout '24? And just given that you've left '25 EBITDA unchanged. Sounds like maybe '25 also contemplates some slower activity levels. So just curious to kind of get some confirmation around that? 
John Porter: Yes, I'll start and then Micheal can chime in as well. But yes, I think, overall, we are being cautious, obviously, with where natural gas prices are and especially during the shoulder months. So we started off with a plan that I think embedded a fair amount of cautious, I think, caution, and I think since then, we've taken a little bit more caution just given where things finished from the time that we were at Analyst Day, which was really mid-winter to where we finished the year. So hopefully, we will actually experience some upside relative to these assumptions, but we are going into the rest of the year with quite a bit of caution, especially around the dry gas areas. 
Micheal Dunn: Yes. This is Micheal. I can add to that. Obviously, we talk to our producer customers quite often about their plans and they're shifting, obviously, back and forth, depending on where prices are. We feel really comfortable where we've had predicted our results to occur in the second half of the year here with our guidance -- confident. Based on the volume expectations that we have coming from the customers. And so just as a reminder, and I always say this, we have a lot of diversity across geography, customers and rich gas as well as dry gas. And obviously, that benefits us and having that diversity and so we're still seeing some activity on the rich gas side, it's benefiting not only our gathering but our processing business in the Northeast. And as I said, we feel confident about the volumes that we have embedded within our going-forward plans here in 2024. 
Spiro Dounis: Great. Appreciate the color there. Second question, maybe going to data centers. Alan, your credit, you've been talking about data center demand for a few quarters now. It seems to be a bit more mainstream to say the least at this point. So curious to maybe get your updated thoughts on how you're thinking about that data center demand going forward? And really what I'd love to know more about is when do you think we start to see tangible sort of commercial discussions start to take place and filter through? 
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Great question, Spiro. And I do think that this is one that will grow over time. Each individual data center isn't going to show up as a big pool and demand given the size and scale of most of these big transmission systems. So it is going to be the collective amount of data centers in these markets that's going to show up. But there certainly is a lot of fury going on right now, I would say, both with our utility customers. And we certainly are working closely with them to make sure that we can serve their needs and the growth in their needs. I would tell you that it's broader than even though data centers and AI gets all the hype, it's actually broader than that in terms of a lot of reshoring of industrial loads that is occurring as well. And part of that is because natural gas is so low cost here. If you think about the rest of the world and the energy cost expanding in the rest of the world and the U.S. sitting here on such a great resource of low-cost energy, it is reshoring industrial loads as well. 
 And so I would say it's a combination of those things that tends to center around low-cost power. So I would just say, first of all, this isn't going to be a one-and-done kind of issue, it's not going to happen maybe as quick as some people are expecting, but -- because it does take a long-term planning to be able to serve the kind of ultimate loads that we're talking to our customers about. But I do think it is going to be very sizable and very impactful. I just don't think it's going to happen quite as quick as a lot of people think it will, just because a lot of these areas, we are constrained on infrastructure. And so it's going to take some time and planning to be able to address that. But we are looking at it both with our customers, and we are also looking in terms of both direct serve as well, where all of the combinations of low-cost gas, land and communication capacity all come together. So I would tell you, we, as Williams, are working very hard. It's a very high priority for us to make sure that we don't let any of these opportunities slip by us, and we've got a great team assembled that's working on that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. 
Jeremy Tonet: Just want to dive a bit further into the natural gas market, if I could. It appears a bit oversupplied at this point in time. And just wondering any thoughts you could share, I guess, in how you see supply-demand balancing over the course of this year and into 2025 and I guess how that might impact Williams trajectory at that point? 
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Great question, Jeremy. I firmly agree with the notion that the market is oversupplied right now. And it's kind of a unique time because we've had the market in such strong contango here for quite some period. Putting a lot of value on our Storage. I would tell you we feel very fortunate to have bought the storage that we bought in the time frame that we bought and to pick up the contracts that Sequent had on storage as well. So a lot of in the money business around the storage business because of the strong contango. But that strong contango is also keeping rigs running that might not otherwise be running right now. And I think that's adding to the oversupply situation. But we certainly are starting to see producers respond to that. And we're also starting to see the demand side respond to that as well. And I think we'll see more of that this summer, and the market always finds a way to balance itself with low enough prices. 
 But it's definitely oversupplied right now. And I do think that once the demand materializes that we would expect in -- starting in mid-'25, I do think that we're going to start to see a big call on gas that will last for years to come. So it is going to be a period though of people having to be patient and waiting on the market. And it's going to take some turn back, if you will, here in the short term, but I think people are appropriately looking to the future. And it is -- the future is pretty clear and pretty transparent when we think about LNG demand, and we think about incremental demand from our customers on both power -- traditional power generation is maybe as well as direct power generation as well. So short term, we're oversupplied. That's causing a lot of contango in the market. But I think that contango is well-founded because there's such a transparent and clear picture of demand for the future. 
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. And then I just want to pivot over to LEG and I was wondering if you could provide any updates on project progress at this point given litigation other items in play? And any thoughts, I guess, on Basins in Southern Louisiana just given there seems to be a concern that, that could widen out without the infrastructure coming into service? 
Micheal Dunn: Jeremy, this is Micheal. I'll take that. I'll start with a bit of a higher level in regard to pipeline crossings and generally, we have almost 26,000 pipeline crossings in the U.S. that have been built over the last several decades, just under 2,200 of those are with energy transfer. And for the most part, those are all being done by our operators in the field unless you have some design issues that you've got to get your engineers involved with. But for the most part, each of our companies work that out in the field until most recently. So we've been challenged in Louisiana and some other states by Energy Transfer and our ability to cross their pipeline. And I would say the tide is turning now on the legal issues. We're seeing the appellate ruling from the Louisiana court that overturned, the lower court ruling in the DTM case. 
 We certainly think that's going to be the same outcome that we'll have on our cases, ultimately, it certainly is troubling that we're having these difficulties with an industry peer. But ultimately, we're going to get our pipeline project built out of the Haynesville, there's definitely a need to move volumes to our gathering systems. To the demand centers in the Gulf Coast area and ultimately, we'll get through the legal process. We'll get through the FERC process, has now been initiated by Energy Transfer, certainly, this was a move that we expected Energy Transfer to do. And so it was anticipated, and that was established within our project schedule that I talked about at the Analyst Day. So we still expect the second half 2025 in service date. And just in closing, we filed permitted and installed more FERC regulated pipelines in the U.S. than any operator, over the last decade. 
 We fully know well when a project is when it comes to either being a designated gathering line or when it should be FERC regulated. And we've taken that certainly into consideration in the formulation in the design of the LEG project. And ultimately, we'll get it built. And it's unfortunate that we're having these delays, but I'm very confident in our ability to finish this project as we've outlined in our most recent schedule. It's going to be needed. The growth in the LNG demand in the Gulf Coast is going to happen. We're certainly seeing the expectations of that occurring late this year and early 2025 when some of the new facilities are coming online. And so we're as I said, very confident about the project and looking forward to getting the legal issues behind us and getting on with construction. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Manav Gupta with UBS. 
Manav Gupta: Congratulations on a very strong quarter. I only have one question. When we look at your 2025 guidance here, can you help us elaborate the growth CapEx, like key projects that you'll be looking to spend the money in 2025 to grow your EBITDA from '25 ahead? But can you help us identify some of those key projects that the good spending will be done on? 
John Porter: Yes, absolutely. So when we look at 2025, we've got really quite a bit of spend expected on the Louisiana Energy Gateway project that Micheal just referred to. So that would be in the category of gathering and processing expansions. And by far, the biggest in the gathering and processing area would be the Louisiana Energy Gateway pipeline project. We do have some new Energy Ventures investments that we're expecting to begin to spend some money on, including our first Carbon Capture and Sequestration project, which is at the terminus of the Louisiana Energy Gateway project. So it's related to that LEG project. But we also have some solar projects that we'll be investing in. 
 We will have some of our contributions to our upstream JVs, those are typically smaller amounts of capital. But then finally, you can see the long list of transmission projects that we have on Transco and MountainWest that are still in execution. Obviously, we're wrapping up regional energy access this year, but you'll see many, many that will continue to have a spend going into 2025 as those reach their in-service dates in 2025. So that would be the main pieces of the growth capital for 2025. 
Alan Armstrong: And Gupta, I would just add in terms of drivers for growth in '25. We have a number of large deepwater projects that we've already spent a majority of the capital, those will be coming on towards the end of this year and into next year. So we're really excited about the big step-up in deepwater growth and how well we're positioned out there for what we think is going to be a lot of continued growth in that area. So -- but in terms of drivers for growth, that's one additionally, drivers for growth would be the rate case on Transco. And so the benefit of all the money we're spending right now on the emission reduction projects will show up. The benefits of that will show up when we start charging our new rates in March of '25. So those are some of the other drivers for growth. 
John Porter: Yes, I didn't do a great job of connecting that to growth. So thanks, Alan. Just specifically, we have 6 Transco growth projects that are in service between the second half of '24 and 2025, and 5 major Gulf of Mexico projects, that are in service as well as well as that Transco rate case that Alan mentioned. And -- but in many cases, those are projects where we've already spent the capital. Or in some of the cases of some of the deepwater projects, there were no capital requirements at all. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Praneeth Satish with Wells Fargo. 
Praneeth Satish: Maybe let me start with a data center question here. So most of the expansions on Transco over the last few years have taking place in the Northeast. But if we start to see large AI data center build-out or even some of the reshoring that you talked about in other regions along Transco's path like the Southeast and that the bottleneck for more capacity shifts south on Transco. Just trying to think about how that impacts things. Is there more opportunity for maybe higher return compression expansions on the southeastern part of Transco or just more available capacity there? Or do you think expansions anywhere along Transco are kind of uniform in terms of return? 
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Good question. Yes, the first evidence of that, even though it really was before the data center load became quite so evident, is our Southeast supply enhancement project. We've announced that and now filed it in the first quarter for 1.6 Bcf a day, and that does serve both the Mid-Atlantic and the Southeast markets. Since that time, as I mentioned, those utilities have come out and said that they were missing their growth targets by many multiples. In fact, I think Southern companies came out and said they missed their original growth for power generation by 17 times. So lots going on in those markets. In terms of our abilities to serve those, we're extremely well positioned to serve that. 
 Again, Southeast Supply Enhancement project is the first initial example of that, and that will serve projects along Transco to the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast, starting at Station-165, and we'll take advantage of supplies coming in from the Mountain Valley Pipeline at 165. In terms of the future, continued ability to expand along system and ability to restore pipeline pressures on systems that have been derated over time due to population encroachment in the areas. So lots of ways for us to expand along that existing capacity. And believe me, there is a lot of work going on right now with our teams and with our customers in those areas, figuring out the very best solutions to serve their growth needs in that area. And there's a lot going on in that front that we're not in a position to talk about yet. But a lot of -- a lot of expansion in that corridor. And again, Transco is extremely well positioned to serve that with the expansions of our existing systems. 
Praneeth Satish: Got it. That's helpful. And then I just had a couple of questions here on the Washington Storage Transition to market-based on Transco. Can you just help frame maybe how much of an uplift you expect for moving that from -- to market base from, I guess, cost of service? How much difference in rates could you see there? And then how much of that capacity do you need to go through an open season now? And how much of that capacity do you think third parties could take versus Sequent? And then finally, is this shift to market-based rates and the upside is that reflected in 2025 EBITDA guidance at all? 
Alan Armstrong: Mike, do you want to take that? 
Micheal Dunn: Yes, I'll take that. So yes, to answer your last question first, that is embedded in our guidance for 2025. So the process where it stands now. FERC has approved our settlement with the customers, the customers have a choice to take a tranche of capacity on a term that they so desired. So they're making that decision now between now and the end of May. So ultimately, they'll decide upon how long of a term they want and there's already a pre-determined rate for that was embedded within the settlement. And so once they make that decision, that will be effective as of April of 2025. So that's when those rates will go into effect. So we definitely embedded what our expectations are with where we think the customers will end up in regard to their choices of selection. 
 Ultimately, we think that we fully subscribed by existing customers. It's a really good project for them. It's a great project for us. The storage is in high demand. We don't expect anybody to turn back any of that capacity at this time. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Gabriel Moreen with Mizuho. 
Gabriel Moreen: A quick one on your Gulf projects. I think there's been some talk about there about Shenandoah being delayed, maybe half a year plus or minus. Can you talk about whether you're potentially seeing that? Or whether that would impact project economics or would just demand fees kick in regardless? 
Alan Armstrong: Yes, Gabe, I would just say our part of that project is on schedule. We're not really at liberty to get into details of the contracting details in that. But remain confident in what we have in the forecast for that project. So anyway, we're not going to speak for the producer. Our part of that project and our work there is on time and team's doing a great job of executing on that, and we'll be ready to serve when we were supposed to be ready to serve on that project. 
Gabriel Moreen: Understood. And then maybe if I can just talk LNG a little bit. There's a stake in the facility LNG export facility under construction that I know you've looked at pretty hard over the course of time. Are you interested in potentially looking at that stake? And just how it may or may not fit into a broader LNG strategy that you may be pursuing over time? 
John Porter: Gabe, are you referring to Port Arthur? 
Gabriel Moreen: I am. 
Unknown Executive: Chad, do you want to take that? 
Chad Zamarin: Yes. I think in general, we're focused on high-return projects that we operate -- we build and operate. And so we continue to look at how we can connect our customers to the most attractive markets. LNG markets are obviously an important destination for U.S. natural gas. And so we're going to continue to look for ways to connect our customers and our value chain to those international markets. But we've typically not been looking for non-operated positions in infrastructure projects. We've got so many opportunities to invest in our kind of organic projects, that's been our primary focus. But again, if we find opportunities that come with our ability to connect our customers to better markets, we'll look at them, but that's certainly not the primary focus of our LNG strategy. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Neel Mitra with Bank of America. 
Indraneel Mitra: I had -- I wanted to follow up on the [indiscernible] expansion in your conversations with your big three utility customers there. You had an interesting slide at the Analyst Day where you talked about those utilities having quotes about not recurring enough natural gas and kind of underestimating power. When they made those quotes in your conversations, did that reflect the AI team. So do you think that the project that you've contracted so far has some AI components in it? Or is it just general electrification so far that's being reflected in that demand? 
Alan Armstrong: Yes. To answer your question, our work on that in terms of developing that project, obviously, was even further ahead of when we announced that. And so you kind of have to remember that as you think about the timing of that. And to answer your question very simply, the degree -- the kind of incremental demand that we're talking about is not reflected in the [indiscernible] project. There might have been some expectation for that. But in terms of the large incremental growth impacts that customers are now starting to reflect in their integrated resource plans. Those are somewhat, I wouldn't say perfectly incremental, but certainly, a big chunk of that is incremental to the load that we're serving on [indiscernible]. 
Indraneel Mitra: Okay. And then I wanted to follow up on some of your producer activity. I know one or more of your customers are delaying sales til gas prices get better. Do you have any updates on that? And then how do you factor that into '25 guidance if you just have a lower base going into '25 if those don't get turned in line? 
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Well, first of all, there's a lot of productive capability in these fields. And the ability to ramp that up and respond to the market. And I think the producers are managing their business in a way that they will be ready to respond to respond to it, as I mentioned in my comments earlier around gas supply demand balance, that's certainly what we're seeing is producers being willing and able to commit to what they need to on their end to be ready to respond to that. So I think there certainly will be some upside to our business in '25 as the market and supply start to respond to that. But it is typically a very long lag period and very difficult for the market to be able to respond quickly. 
 I do think, however, this time, and I hate to be the guy calling it's different this time. But because there is such strong contango in the market right now, we are seeing a different response and a different positioning from our producers than we typically see in this situation. And again, I think that's because there's such confidence in both the fundamentals and the visibility to the forward market that's suggesting that that's how they should behave at this point. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays. 
Theresa Chen: Alan, I'd like to go back and touch on the comments of strong contango benefiting your storage assets. Can you give us a sense of what you're seeing in changes in storage rates as contracts come up for renewal? And is this largely due to the current contango? And as we come out of the contango, do you think these economics are durable? 
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Good question, Theresa. I'll give you my comments, and I'm going to ask Chad to give you a little more detail on that. But I think over time, we have seen the value of storage, and we've certainly seen it with our own Sequent operations. We've seen the value of storage in these volatile markets and markets that are having to respond very quickly to shifts in demand continuing. I think it's also pretty visible to see that both with an increase in renewable power on the market as well as more and more LNG as that comes on LNG is going to need to be a little more responsive. It's not going to run at 100% load factor when the LNG is more -- is closer to meeting the more mature demand from that market. So I think those are a lot of the drivers for the increase in storage capacity. 
 As Micheal mentioned earlier, we certainly have seen a pretty strong response from our customers and making sure that they don't lose the benefits of the Washington storage facility and the flexibility of their business. And I think as the market turns to more and more hourly type service, and pipelines tighten up on the flexible services and no noted services that they previously offered. I think that's going to continue to put more and more pressure and more need for the storage business. And I think that's becoming pretty evident to the gas marketing business. In terms of contango driving the value, it's certainly one of the elements of value that is driving that. But I think it's a little broader than just the contango in terms of what's driving the pretty rapid increase in storage rates. And I'll let Chad talk a little more specifically about what we're seeing in rates. 
Chad Zamarin: Yes. I think it's a really important theme to keep an eye on what both the ability to set up our infrastructure to benefit from volatility and price that supports extraction value. But also importantly, we're seeing the transition. We've been talking about it for a while, increased volatility in power markets, Alan talked about the power demand that we're seeing -- I mean we talk often -- I mean, PJM numbers themselves say that by 2040, peak demand will more than double. That's a significant -- from a set of infrastructure that's already full. And so assets like storage will not only be driven from a value perspective by dislocations in price over time, like the contango we're seeing in the current market, but we are seeing an evolution and a recognition that you're going to need those assets for reliability. 
 Power -- produced power companies will need storage LNG companies. We're seeing much more variable demand coming in the future. And so not only will we be set up for storage to have value in the near term when there are price dislocations like we're seeing with the contango in the market, but we're also seeing an evolution of the market to recognize that storage value will increase even when there may not be apparent price dislocation, there will be a need for reliability in backup, both in supply and the ability to put gas into storage when upset conditions occur. So we're set up really well to benefit from both the value dislocations you see in the current market and the long-term fundamentals around the need for storage for reliability. So all that to be said, I don't think that the contango in the market is the only necessary driver for long-term storage value. We see long-term storage value both in markets where there are dislocations from a price perspective but also because of the long-term need for reliability and the important role that storage plays in providing reliability. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Tristan Richardson with Scotiabank. 
Tristan Richardson: Alan, just maybe switching back to the thematic for a moment. At the Analyst Day, you and some of your guest speakers talked a lot about sort of that general need for permitting reform and how critical gas supply is to power sort of this increased demand we're seeing in electricity. How critical is sort of permitting or form or at least a more amenable regulatory environment for energy supply to kind of meet this accelerating demand growth you guys have talked about today and the slide you talked about with sort of the 3x demand you're seeing over the next decade? 
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I would just say as the world turns off of coal, as the reliable baseload and is shifting more and more and more to natural gas as the base load, as Chad mentioned, that reliability issue is going to be really key and us continuing to stretch and deny the amount of capacity we really need in these markets, is going to become a louder and louder drumbeat. You're hearing it from the ISOs already. You're hearing it from -- starting to even hear from the utility commissions about how important it is that they have access to natural gas. You're even starting to hear it in places like Connecticut that are upset that they don't have low-priced gas into those markets because Governor Cuomo stopped a number of projects coming across the state. So it's unfortunate. 
 It's kind of like sometimes it's a terrible situation as we think about long-term infrastructure and politics, but the two don't meet very well together, unfortunately. And sometimes the bridge has to fail to people to realize that we have to spend money on maintaining and keeping our bridges safe. And I would say similar situation on gas infrastructure. We are heavily under-invested in gas infrastructure right now in terms of keeping up with this growing need. The good news is, I think the screen is going to get pretty loud and it's not just going to be from the gas industry when the tech industry is really struggling to get adequate supplies for data centers and power, I think that both the utilities are going to get loud on this. I think the tech companies are going to get loud on this.
 And hopefully, it doesn't come to a catastrophe in some of the markets, but it's amazing to me how quickly people forget how close we got last -- this last winter, how close we got to losing parts of the Northwest markets due to a couple of very small failures on some of our competitors' pipeline serving into us that caused a shortage as well as distorted at one of the big storage facilities up there. 
 So we've been able to manage. We've been able to keep the gas service on, but we really haven't experienced a situation in these big heavily populated areas where we've lost gas service because people, I think, tend to think just like losing your power and it just clickers off and comes back on. That's not the way gas service works. And it will be a pretty catastrophic event. So thank you for asking the question because we certainly try to make it clear that we've got to invest adequately in our infrastructure, and it is going to take permitting reform to do that. I would say we're hopeful that we're getting more and more the moderate left engaged on this issue and understanding how important this is for their constituents as well. So I do think we're making progress on it, but it is a very large issue if we hope to keep up with demand. We're going to have to get better at building out infrastructure here in the U.S. 
Tristan Richardson: Appreciate it. And then maybe, John, just a smaller one. You appreciate kind of laying out sort of some of the puts and takes in the [indiscernible] segment year-over-year. But is there a number we can think of as what was the organic growth in the quarter? Just thinking about Hartree contributions as well as sort of a partial anniversary of MountainWest? 
John Porter: Yes. I think we think the acquisitions as it relates to Hartree and MountainWest Pipeline have tracked very well to the announcements we made in terms of the valuation and the multiples that were involved there. So I think you can -- you can rely pretty much in terms of sizing those impacts as to the announcements we made at the time of the acquisition. Obviously, with MountainWest Pipeline that closed on Valentine's Day in 2023. So that kind of allows you to size the relative size of the uplift in '24 versus '23 for MountainWest Pipeline. With Hartree, it closed very early in the year. So we pretty much had a full quarter of Hartree. So I think that I would just say size those two pieces.
 It was a strong quarter for Transco. No doubt, they did have the nice uplift from partial and service of Regional Energy Access, but they had some good seasonal revenues as well. And we did mention a couple of things that work the other way though, the Bayou Ethane divestiture that we had last year, and I think we put some information out about that -- the size of that divestiture as well. And then we did have some planned downtime at Discovery, which was an impact as well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. 
John Mackay: Maybe to keep it in the gas demand policy front. You guys have also talked a lot about coal plant retirements on your footprint, you kind of framed up maybe an upside number at the Analyst Day earlier this year. Just be curious, any thoughts you can share on the recent EPA updates around power plant carbon emissions? And how that's playing into your forward view? 
Micheal Dunn: John, this is Micheal. Yes, obviously, we're watching that closely and the fact that these new gas-fired power plants have to have some kind of sequestration on them in the -- in the midterm, I would say, is certainly taken into consideration by the utilities that are building these plants. I think ultimately, we'll probably be tempering of that. That's my opinion that whenever you see the EPA power plan come out with a new rule, it's certainly subject to litigation as they happened several times now, and I suspect this one will be no different. But that will be a challenge, I think, for the industry to respond to a lot of that sequestration requirement in regard to these combined cycle power plants. I mean it's technology that is available but it is going to be expensive. It's going to be expensive for the end user and the consumers. 
 And I certainly think utilities will take that into consideration in their plans. But we'll definitely see some coal plant retirements accelerating. And I think the rub there is, will they be able to meet demand with the acceleration of coal plant retirements with the AI boom that we're seeing. And I think that's going to be a big base in the boardrooms for the utilities to come. 
Alan Armstrong: Yes. And I would just add to that, the issue around sequestration, if you think about how difficult it's been to build sequestration pipelines in South Dakota and Iowa, in serving those markets. And if you think that we're going to be able to take sequestration to a new level in areas where there isn't good underground resources for sequestration along the East Coast. And pipe that through heavily populated areas. I just think that is very unrealistic perspective right now. And so I think this is a place again where politics and the popular notion of politics and good old-fashioned hard physics are not matching up. And to have the Sierra Club fighting a CO2 pipeline in Iowa that's going to sequester carbon, is really, I think, a forewarning about the practical nature of being able to sequester large volumes of CO2 in these heavily populated areas. 
John Mackay: I appreciate all that. Maybe just zooming back in on you guys specifically quickly. Appreciate the frame up of the gas storage opportunity. At the very beginning, you mentioned the rates have come into making brownfield economics work. I guess I'd just be curious like, how much do you think you guys can add on a Bcf basis across your existing footprint from a Brownfield perspective? 
Alan Armstrong: Well, I mean, the fact is we have the right away through those areas. And so there's a very large number, but it's not as simple -- it's not a finite number by any stretch of imagination and it has its economic limits. And so said another way, it may not have its physical limits because we have the right of way through there, but it certainly has its economic limits. And so obviously, the easiest thing to do is to add compression in the area. And then next is replacing lines that are -- that we've had to derate over time. 
Unknown Executive: I think it's about storage. 
Alan Armstrong: Sorry, on storage. Sorry, I thought we were back on Transco sorry about that. I'll let Chad take that forward. 
Chad Zamarin: Yes, sorry. Just on storage. We do have quite a bit of capacity at the salt-cavern facilities that we acquired in the Gulf Coast. And so -- and those expansions that we're looking at would likely come in kind of 10 Bcf tranches at each facility. And there is a lot of capacity to expand. I think we're going to be thoughtful about how to do that incrementally as the market kind of recognizes the need. And we're seeing that evolution, but we need to see storage contracts shift from short term to long term for us to support that kind of infrastructure expansion. But it would look like kind of 10 Bcf cavern expansions at those salt-cavern facilities. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global. 
Sunil Sibal: So I wanted to start off -- a little bit big picture question. So it seems like you're executing pretty well on the guidance, the '24 and '25. So I was curious if your actual performance comes out to be above the top end of your guidance ranges? What's the best incremental use of the cash flows in the current environment, especially if this permitting constraints continue? 
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Well, that is a great question and one that gets a lot of debate both and this team and within the boardroom as well. And it's a very astute question because if you look at the math, that starts to build on us pretty quickly, we saw the outlook -- positive outlook change coming from S&P on our Credit Rating. And so that we think will meet the conditions for that here through the balance of the year. So only so much more value, I would argue to be added in that regard. But I would say, certainly, our dividend policy is one lever, share buybacks, another and acquisitions of bolt-on transactions that have continued to add a lot of value and ones that we're really excited about the way our teams have performed on taking these assets and extremely quickly extracting the synergies that we expect out of them. 
 And so we have been very purposeful about building the capabilities within the organization to be able to act quickly and decisively on those kind of bolt-on transactions. And so we'll keep our eyes on that. Certainly, we've seen -- so far, we've seen a lot of value that we can add by being the operator on those kind of assets to make them immediately accretive transactions. And so we'll sort of keep our eyes open for those kind of bolt-on, very tightly aligned with strategy acquisitions as well. 
Sunil Sibal: And then in the Northeast, it seems like MVPs really start up pretty soon. And I was kind of curious in the current gas price environment, how do you think that impacts the producer reactions and then what kind of operating leverage you have in your systems to kind of benefit from that in the near term? 
Alan Armstrong: Yes, great question. I think right now, as we sit here today. The power gen loads will be pretty strong this summer if the weather predictions that are out there are accurate right now. I think we'll see some pretty strong pools and that pipe and those gas supplies serve that will be capable of responding to that. And that's probably the extent of what we would see here in the immediate term for that, as our expansions that we're working on like the Southeast supply and expansion, system come on in the years ahead, that will start to take full advantage of those incremental supplies. And we'll see areas where we gather the volumes upstream on that benefit from that. But importantly, our ability to expand Transco is a lot lower cost and a lot higher margin for us if we have supply coming in there at 165. 
 And so that's a huge positive for us to have high-pressure supplies coming into our system right there at 165. And so we'll see. I'm fairly confident we'll see some fairly significant additional expansions from 165 and take advantage of that on the Transco system. 
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to Alan Armstrong for closing remarks. 
Alan Armstrong: Okay. Well, thank you all very much. We're very excited to deliver another record at the company and not just for the quarter that it produced in terms of the present a lot of people are talking about what they're going to do in the future. We continue to deliver in the present. But we also have a very strong future ahead of us and are extremely well positioned for not just the next couple of years, but for the next decades, as we were contracting for these major expansions on our system. So very excited to see a strategy that we've stuck with for years now really coming home and all the benefits that we thought natural gas had to offer the market start to be realized by others and putting a lot of demand on our infrastructure. So very excited to see this turn here in the quarter and very thankful for all the extraordinary efforts of the employees and the leadership of this company and the management team that I get to work with for continuing to deliver such great results. So thanks for joining us today. 
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-11-02 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to The Williams Third Quarter Earnings 2023 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and please be advised that this call is being recorded. After the speakers’ prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Now at this time, I’ll turn things over to Mr. Danilo Juvane, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Danilo Juvane: Thanks, Bo, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in The Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon, we’ve released our earnings press release and the presentation that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and our Chief Financial Officer, John Porter, will speak to this morning. Also joining us on the call are Michael Dunn, our Chief Operating Officer; Lane Wilson, our General Counsel; and Chad Zamarin, our Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development. In our presentation materials, you will find a disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to our remarks and you should review it. Also included in the presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to generally accepted accounting principles. And these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today’s presentation materials. So with that, I will turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong: All right. Well, thanks, Danilo, and thank you all for joining us today. As our first slide here shows Williams delivered another quarter of impressive accomplishments and starting out with our operational execution. So first of all, our project execution team completed the first half of Transco’s Regional Energy Access project, well ahead of schedule and our commercial and government affairs teams followed-up with the contracting and FERC authorization needed to place this in service and beginning full rate revenues for the initial capacity here in late October, so great efforts by our teams there and great results in a very difficult area. We expect the total project to be online in the fourth quarter of next year with the capacity to move approximately 830 million cubic feet a day of natural gas from the Northeast part of the Marcellus into the Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland markets. We also completed several other expansion projects including a fully contracted gas transmission line that enables our newly acquired NorTex storage system to directly serve new gas-fired generation markets in that area. And in our West Gathering segment, we completed a large expansion of our South Mansfield gathering system in the Haynesville for GeoSouthern, which proud to say was the nation’s fastest growing gas producer last year. And in the Northeast, we completed the first expansion of many to come on our Cardinal gathering system for Encino’s rich gas drilling operations in the Utica condensate window. But the really big news this quarter comes in the new projects column. We recently signed precedent agreements of over 1.4 Bcf a day for the Southeast Supply Enhancement project, which provides takeaway capacity from Station 160 – from our Transco Station 165 to the fast growing Mid-Atlantic and Southeast markets. And based on the open season results, we have even more demand to be met in the future that would result likely in a follow on project. So we are proceeding into the permitting process for this initial project due to the urgent demands to be met for this first group of customers. So in terms of impact, this will be the largest addition of EBITDA ever for a Williams pipeline extension yes, even more than our Atlantic Sunrise project and in fact, significantly more than the entire EBITDA generated from our Northwest Pipeline system. And I’ll remind you that these are 20-year contracts from the time the project starts up, which would be at least through 2047. And we recently signed anchor shipper precedent agreements for a Uinta Basin expansion on our MountainWest system. We continue to be very pleased with the successful integration of the MountainWest assets into our operations and the opportunities we see to execute on more profitable growth with this asset than we had originally planned on. In fact, this is the second piece of substantial business that we have signed up just this year on the MountainWest Pipelines, and neither of which of these expansions, neither of these were in our pro forma for this acquisition. So really pleased with the team from MountainWest Pipeline and the leadership we have working to grow that business, but very pleasantly surprised with that acquisition today. Moving across the slide, we are acting on opportunities that we believe will further high grade our portfolio of assets. First of all, Williams recently sold its our Bayou Ethane Pipeline system for $348 million in cash. And this represented a last 12-month multiple of over 14 times our adjusted EBITDA. The proceeds from this asset sell along with expected proceeds from a recent legal judgment will help fund an important strengthening of our hand in the DJ Basin with the following transactions. First, the acquisition of Cureton Front Range LLC, whose assets include gas gathering pipelines and two processing plants to serve producers across 225,000 dedicated acres that are just to the north of our existing KKR system. And second, the purchase of KKR is 50% ownership interest in the Rocky Mountain Midstream, which results in us now owning 100% of that. So KKR was our partner in Rocky Mountain Midstream. They’ve been a great partner there, but it was coming time via those agreements to exercise that. So we’re really pleased to have had the relationship we had with KKR and a great partner there. But this is really an exciting expansion of our business out there that will allow us to deliver volume into our downstream assets and including taking existing gas supplies and feeding them into our Rocky Mountain Midstream, so really excited about that. These acquisitions have a combined value of $1.27 billion, and this represents a blended multiple of approximately 7 times the 2024 adjusted EBITDA. So the synergies here are very tangible to us. Again, because we can just take these existing gas volumes, feeding them to our processing, and then enjoy the downstream NGL – the coupon clipping on the downstream NGL transportation, fractionation and storage. These are – the transactions are expected to close by the end of 2023, making Williams the third largest gather in the DJ Basin and progressing us towards the company’s strategy of maintaining top positions in the basins we serve. So, just a few other items to hit on this quarter. We finally are taking over operatorship of the Blue Racer gathering and processing system in West Virginia and Ohio later this year. This is important due to our ability to significantly lower cost and more easily capture synergies between this and our other operations in the area. And lastly, we’re continuing to advance our efforts to commercialize clean hydrogen through our support of two clean hydrogen hubs that were announced by the Department of Energy last month, one in the Pacific Northwest and one in the Appalachian region. We’re looking forward to leveraging our operating expertise and our right of ways into the emerging hydrogen space. Looking at some of our financial highlights from the quarter. John will obviously get into more details here in a minute, but overall, we’ve delivered another quarter of strong financial performance even in the face of dramatically lower gas prices as compared to the third quarter of 2022. Year-to-date, our adjusted EBITDA is up 9%, our adjusted EPS is up 11%, and gathering volumes are up 6%, versus the first nine months of 2022. And we expect the strong performance to continue, providing us with the confidence to raise our 2023 guidance this quarter up by $100 million to $6.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA. And we are tracking in line with our 5% to 7% adjusted EBITDA annual growth rate and this quarter marks the 34th first quarter of meeting or beating the adjusted EBITDA consensus and the fifth time we have raised guidance during the same period and I’ll also point out that we haven’t got there by lowering our guidance. In fact, we have not lowered our guidance during this entire period, and that includes through the pandemic. So in summary, our strict adherence to our strategy, our commitment to an improving return on capital employed and extraordinary execution by our team, all have continued to deliver predictable growth through a variety of commodity cycles. Importantly, this discipline also has Williams position to capture significant future growth and return this value to our shareholders. And with that, I’m going to turn things over to John to walk us through the financial metrics of the quarter.
John Porter: All right. Thanks, Alan. Starting here on Slide 4 with the summary of our year-over-year financial performance. It was a strong performance by our base business, which we define as excluding marketing and our upstream joint ventures. That base business increase was 6% over the prior year third quarter. As we’ll discuss in a moment, last year’s third quarter saw very favorable commodity prices for our marketing and upstream joint ventures, which did make for a tougher year-over-year comparison in total, but we did still grow total adjusted EBITDA, as well as that 6% increase for our base business. Year-to-date, our total adjusted EBITDA is now up 9%, driven by the growth of our core infrastructure businesses, which continue to perform very well even as natural gas prices decreased 63% for the first nine months of 2023 versus the first nine months of 2022, once again demonstrating the resiliency and strength of our natural gas focused strategy, assets and operational capabilities. So for third quarter, adjusted EPS flipped a little bit from that very strong 2022 number, but you can see, it's still up 11% year-to-date, continuing the strong growth we've had in EPS over the last many years. Available funds from operations was generally flat with last year's strong cash flow and you see our third quarter dividend coverage based on AFFO was a very strong 2.26 times on a dividend that grew 5.3%. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen with debt to adjusted EBITDA now reaching 3.45 times versus last year's 3.68 times. On CapEx, you see an increase primarily reflecting the progress we're making on some of our key growth projects, including Regional Energy Access and Louisiana Energy Gateway. So based on the continued strong financial performance of the business, we now feel confident raising our consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance to $6.6 billion to $6.8 billion, shifting the midpoint up $100 million from $6.6 billion to now $6.7 billion. In a moment, I'll provide a little color on our expectations for the remainder of the year and a few thoughts regarding the outlook beyond 2023. So let's turn to the next slide and take a little closer look at the third quarter results. We see a 1% overall increase, but a strong 6% increase in our base business EBITDA over the prior year, even as average natural gas prices for the third quarter decreased 68%. Now even for the base business, excluding marketing and our upstream joint ventures, that dramatic decrease in natural gas prices had a significant impact on our revenues. In fact, we saw about $70 million of lower natural gas price based gathering rates at certain of our franchises in the West and Northeast Gathering & Processing segments. Last year, saw those rates significantly lift from the floor values they had been at for many years, and in 2023, we've seen them return back to their floor values. Looking now at our core business performance, our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico business improved $83 million, or 12%, including about a $47 million contribution from our MountainWest Pipelines and NorTex acquisitions, but we did see other increases in our transmission and deepwater businesses as well. Our Northeast gathering and processing business performed well with a $21 million or 5% increase, including a 4% overall increase in volumes versus last year. This 4% volume growth happened even though we saw much lower shoulder season natural gas pricing in 2023 versus 2022. And as we expected, that particularly impacted our dry gas systems, including some significant shut in volumes in Northeast Pennsylvania. However, as we've talked about before, when low natural gas prices weigh on dry gas production, we tend to see a shift to our liquids rich systems where higher margins tend to compensate for lower volumes. And that's what we see in third quarter this year, with about a 22% increase in processing plant volumes fed by those liquids rich systems, with related increases in NGL production, volumes and associated fractionation and transportation revenues as well. So shifting now to the West, which decreased $22 million or 7%, where the unfavorable impact of those lower natural gas price based rates fueled by last year's much higher natural gas prices overcame what was strong volume growth in the Haynesville. And then you see the $22 million decrease in the gas and NGL marketing business. Last year's third quarter saw much more favorable conditions for the gas marketing business with stronger natural gas price volatility in particular. Our upstream joint venture operations that are included in our other segment were down about $52 million versus last year, that includes the Haynesville upstream EBITDA, which was down about $36 million despite higher production, but due to much lower net realized prices and a lower working interest percentage on new wells beginning in January 2023. The Wamsutter upstream EBITDA was down about $16 million, where increases in gas and oil production significantly offset much lower net realized prices versus last year. So again, the third quarter continued our strong base business performance in 2023 with 6% growth and EBITDA driven by core infrastructure business performance in spite of natural gas prices that were 68% lower than third quarter of 2022. Let's turn the page and touch on the year-to-date comparison. Year-to-date, we've seen a 9% increase over 2022, even as average natural gas prices year-to-date fell 63% versus last year. And walking now from last year's $4.6 billion to this year's $5.1 billion and looking at our core business performance, Transmission & Gulf of Mexico business improved $210 million or 10% really on similar themes as our third quarter, namely the impacts of the MountainWest Pipelines and NorTex acquisitions, and still seeing other increases in our transmission and deepwater revenues as well. Our Northeast G&P business has performed very well with $138 million or 10% increase driven by a $217 million increase in their service revenues. And this revenue increase was really fueled by a 6% increase in total volumes focused in our liquids rich areas where we tend to have higher per unit margins than our dry gas areas. And in the appendix, you'll find a slide that compares our 6% volume growth to the overall basin growth of just over 2%. Shifting now to the West, which increased $20 million or 2%, benefiting from positive hedge results and strong Haynesville volume growth, including the Trace acquisition in the Haynesville, but the West was significantly unfavorably impacted by those lower natural gas price based gathering rates and also lower NGL margins. And then you see the $122 million increase in our gas and NGL marketing business, as you'll recall, really caused by the very strong first quarter start to the year for the gas marketing business. Our upstream joint venture operations included in our other segment were down $92 million versus last year. The Haynesville upstream EBITDA was down about $18 million, where the benefits of our 175% increase in net production volumes were more than offset by dramatically lower net realized natural gas prices. The Wamsutter upstream EBITDA was down $74 million due to the combined effects of the historically difficult winter weather we saw in Wyoming this year on production volumes as well as lower net realized prices. So, again, a continuation to the strong start to 2023 with 9% growth in EBITDA driven by core infrastructure business performance with strength from our marketing business that dramatically overcame weaker than expected results from the upstream joint ventures. As I mentioned earlier, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to $6.6 billion to $6.8 billion with $100 million shift upward in the midpoint. This increase comes thanks to the steady performance of our base business, even after a historic decline in natural gas prices that did lead to some recent shut-ins and also after that historically difficult winter that continued to have unfavorable impacts through April of this year. And this 2023 guidance raise comes after two consecutive years of record breaking adjusted EBITDA growth in 2021 and 2022. In the appendix, you'll see other positive shifts in our financial guidance metrics that are generally aligned with the higher EBITDA guidance. And from a leverage perspective, we finished the year, not knowing the exact timing of when we'll receive payment of the $602 million judgment awarded to us from energy transfer in the recent Delaware Supreme Court decision, as well as the exact timing of the close date of the DJ transactions that we announced yesterday. Our expected payment in the energy transfer matter, net of legal fees will be in excess of $530 million and is still growing every day for interest charges as well. Considering all of these moving parts, we still believe we'll end up close to our original 2023 leverage guidance of 3.65 times, even though that guidance was issued before consideration of the MountainWest pipeline and DJ transactions and about $130 million of share buybacks that we've done this year as well. So, in summary, we are finishing 2023 with a guidance raise that builds on a strong multiyear trend of outperformance and we're setting our sights on continued growth in 2024 before another big growth step up in 2025. And with that, I'll turn it back to Alan.
Alan Armstrong: Okay. Well, thanks, John. So just a few closing remarks before we turn it over to your questions. First, I'll start by reiterating our belief that Williams remains a compelling investment opportunity. We are the most natural gas centric large scale midstream company around today and the tightly integrated nature of our business is unique. Second, our combination of proven resilience, a five-year EPS CAGR of 23%, steadily growing two times covered dividend, a strong balance sheet and high visibility to growth is unique amongst the S&P 500 and unique within our sector. Our natural gas focused strategy has allowed us to produce a ten-year track record of growing adjusted EBITDA through a record – through a large number of commodity and economic cycles. And it is continuing to deliver significant growth in the current environment. And the signals coming from the market show that it is going to continue to deliver substantial growth well into the future. Shoring up our nations and the World's Energy Foundation with natural gas is going to happen whether the opposition wants it to or not, because we are running out of time and real world options to meet the growing need for energy while reducing emissions. Natural gas is the most effective non-subsidized way of reducing emissions and it has become the practical alternative. Ramping up the production of natural gas has allowed the U.S. to meet our evolving domestic needs as well as provide energy security and support to our global allies. It stands unmatched as the most affordable and reliable source of energy and has been the most effective tool to date at reducing emissions. At Williams, we are committed to a clean energy future that focuses on driving down emissions while protecting affordability and reliability. The drive for electrification is on and dispatchable power capable of keeping up with the large number of government incentive electrical loads like carbon capture, hydrogen production and data centers is going to be largely served by natural gas. This includes scaling up renewable sources to reduce carbon, while backing up those sources with the flexibility, scale and reliability of natural gas. So we are here for the long haul and are committed to leveraging our large scale natural gas infrastructure network for the benefit of generations and our shareholders for generations to come. And with that, I'll open it up for your questions.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Armstrong. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first this morning to Spiro Dounis at Citi.
Spiro Dounis: Thanks, operator. Good morning team. Maybe to start with Southeast supply enhancement. Alan, you mentioned that being the largest EBITDA contribution I think you said we've ever seen, which at least for us was maybe something we didn't appreciate. So curious if you maybe just provide a sense of how you think about the capital costs, maybe even the returns around the two phases of that project. And also if you could maybe just talk about some of the physical capacity at 165 today to handle volumes when MVP comes online. I know it's something you've addressed in the past, but still seems like some level of confusion there.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Hey, Spiro. Thank you. Good morning and thanks for the great question. First of all, I want to clarify one thing, because it might have got confused a little bit in the commentary. When we talk about this potentially delivering another phase of expansion there, the EBITDA that I'm talking about and the scale of the EBITDA is on this initial phase. So we're not counting on a second phase to grow that EBITDA to that kind of scale, just to be clear. So that EBITDA that I mentioned, being larger – being the largest and being larger than our entire Northwest Pipeline system is on the initial 1.4 Bcf/d for clarity on that topic. In terms of returns, we're not going to put that number out there right now, but I can tell you, it's one of the most attractive returns we've ever seen for any pipeline expansion of scale. And we're really excited that capacity is precious, coming out of there. And just to remind you on the physical capacities that we have out of there, the total physical capacity out of there is 5.7 Bcf/d, 2.5 to the north, 2.5 to the south, and 700 million a day on the Virginia lateral. So that's the existing capacity that we have out of there, physical capacity that we have from 165 today. Obviously, there's a lot of demand for that and capacity, and so it's not like it's just sitting there available for somebody to come in and buy. And that's obviously why we're able to put together such an attractive project here. Utilizing – by the way, utilizing our existing right away and obviously structuring that in a way that will be provide the least points of resistance from a permitting standpoint for expansion south on that. So actually not a terribly complicated project. Easy for me to say that I don't have the responsibility for getting that done directly, but it is on our existing right away and avoids a lot of the typical area wetland problems that we get into and tend to snag the permitting process. So, great job by the team on working with our big customers out there of meeting their very urgent needs on this and providing a very attractive project. So couldn't be prouder of the team and the way they've worked through this.
Spiro Dounis: Got it. Helpful color and appreciate the clarification on the EBIT contribution for that first phase. Second question, maybe just turning to these two DJ Basin acquisitions, sounds like downstream benefits also drove part of the decision to expand there. So two questions on that front. One, does that 7x blended multiple impute any downstream benefits or is that sort of standalone for the assets? And then two, how should we think about the Cureton NGL volumes coming onto the downstream system? Is that something that happens immediately or do we need to wait for contracts to roll off. 
Alan Armstrong: Spiro, I'm going to have Chad Zamarin take that.
Chad Zamarin: Yes. Thanks, Spiro. So that 7x multiple really reflects the standalone acquisition value and we do see significant opportunities to integrate those assets. It will take a little bit of time as there are some current commitments, but Cureton has more volume that they're gathering than they can process and deliver into downstream infrastructure. And Rocky Mountain Midstream has some excess capacity. So we're going to be able to consolidate those volumes and move a significant amount of incremental NGLs down our infrastructure. But there are some dedications over the next 12 months and beyond that will roll off and that will allow us to move those volumes fully over to our system, so you'll see that value increase over time.
Spiro Dounis: Got it. Helpful color. Thanks, Chad. Thanks everybody.
Chad Zamarin: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next now to Neel Mitra at Bank of America.
Neel Mitra: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First on a macro level, it seems like some of the Southern Utilities are worried about having gas supply, especially with a lot of the Haynesville moving north to south with projects like your LEGpipeline. Are you seeing interest from Southeast customers rather Southern Utilitiesto move Haynesville gas on Transco towards that area?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, it's a great question actually. And I think the market will figure that out. I think the way, for instance, our LEG project is structured, that will give people the opportunity as they come in there at [indiscernible] that'll give Haynesville producers the options of either moving down the traditional path on Transco towards 85 and into those markets or selling into LNG, whichever their preference is. And so that's the beauty of the Transco system is it gives people those options and the networking effect of our entire system gives people greater market options that they'll appreciate. So I'm not sure that people will have that a producer, for instance, will have to declare one way or the other on that as much as they'll be positioned to enjoy the benefits of either one of those markets. But we certainly are going to see, I think, competition for Haynesville supplies that have traditionally come in, a lot of that's come into Station 85 and that will certainly be in competition with 165 for a while. And that'll really dictate which way the volumes flow on there. But as those big LNG – and the LNG capacity growth is not all that hard to predict. The projects are out there and they're hard to sneak up on anybody just because they're so big and take so long for permitting. So that LNG market is becoming very evident and it will certainly take away supplies that a lot of the Transco customers have depended on coming in Station 85. And I do think to your point, I do think that's why we're seeing such an interest in picking up supplies off of Mountain Valley Pipeline. But I also tell you that largely just because the markets are growing in those areas is really what's driving that as they really start to run out of options for meeting power generation loads in those areas.
Michael Dunn: And Alan, probably important to note this is not a near-term macro. This macro setup is going to be over the next decade and beyond as LNG demand increases and power demand on the eastern side of the United States continues to change. There's going to continue to be a competition between utilities and LNG exporters for natural gas, and there is no better asset set up to benefit from that and provide the supplies that are needed than our footprint in the Transco system.
Neel Mitra: Great. And then my follow up, your Texas to Louisiana Energy Pathway Project, I think it’s roughly $364 million a day in 2025. And it seems like crossing the border between Texas and Louisiana is actually harder than we initially expected. What are the opportunities for you to be able to move Transco volumes from South Texas, whether they’re sourced from the Permian or Eagle Ford up to the Louisiana Energy Corridor with compression or even looping in what are kind of the impediments towards scaling up the size of Transco to be able to do that?
Michael Dunn: Hey Neel, it’s Michael. Thanks for the question. Yes, the TLEP project is just awaiting at 7C [ph] permit. So we would expect that to be imminent. So we’re excited to get that one off the ground. And that’s really the first opportunity we’ve had to really increase our capacity from the South Texas area into the LNG corridor order on the other side of Houston. I would just tell you, we’ve got a lot of great opportunities to continue to expand that pathway on Transco. We have a lot of looping capabilities through that area, additional compression that we can add and really move a significant amount of gas to either South Texas or the Katy area over to that Texas, Louisiana coast line where the LNG facilities are being contemplated for expansion. So really excited about those opportunities. We are talking to parties on both sides of that, whether it be a producer or a consumer of the gas on both sides of that opportunity. And the biggest impediment there is Houston, as you probably well know that the Transco pipeline system to reverse is just north of Houston there in that corridor, and we have one of the best quarters, we think, to expand from the west side of the Houston area over to the eastern LNG corridor.
Neel Mitra: Got it. And just to follow up on that answer, what’s the FERC lag in terms of approving a loop. I know compression is much easier. I think that’s what you did with Texas to Louisiana pathway. But how much harder would it be to get the regulatory filing for a loop on Transco once you make that compression on that front?
Michael Dunn: Yes. So right now, FERC has lowered their hurdle, I would say, for smaller projects like TLEP. So it was originally an environmental assessment and FERC basically came back and said, "No, we need any EIS and then they pivoted back and said, "No, this can go under an environmental assessment, which is a quicker process. You probably save six months to nine months on the environmental review typically between an EIS and an EA. And I would say any looping project of any magnitude is most likely going to take an environmental impact statement. And so that’s – whether it be a looping or a greenfield, it’s going to be an EIS, and that process is typically one and a half year to two years from filing to 7C approval. So I would just say that’s the kind of the time line you should be thinking about for any type of looping project. I would say the looping projects are less controversial when you start talking to the environmental organizations and landowners just because we’ve obviously been in the area for a long time. We have relationships built in those areas and landowners are certainly much more receptive to a looping project than they are a greenfield type pipeline. And certainly, the environmental impact is less as well. And so I think you do have a better opportunity to get approvals for looping project because they’re just less controversial and FERC is very interested in condemnation authority in the use of that these days and it gives us a great benefit when we’re looking at looping projects just like our [indiscernible] project, we built 36 miles of loop along that pipeline and did not have one condemnation with several hundred landowners and it’s a great testament to what the brownfield expansion is going to do for our company.
Neel Mitra: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go next now to Theresa Chen at Barclays.
Theresa Chen: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. First, on the DJ acquisitions, if 7x is stand-alone, how low do you think you can bring that in multiple with the downstream synergies? And are there additional opportunity for and portfolio optimization going forward?
Chad Zamarin: Yes. Thanks, Theresa. This is Chad. I won’t speak specifically, but we are typically looking for leveraging our footprint and our strategic positioning where we operate. We’ve been focused on bolt-on transactions that typically provide better than one or two turns of synergies and optimization. This is an integration that allows us to both increase gathering, processing, also we moved the NGLs down Overland Pass with our partnership with Targa, we can move the barrels all the way to Mont Belvieu, where we have interest fractionation. And so there’s a lot of opportunity to capture synergies along that value chain. So those are the kind of opportunities that we really look for that, provide very clear commercial and operational synergies. So that’s really a focus. As far as additional opportunities, I think the Blue Racer example is another great one. We’ve been focused on cleaning up inefficiencies within our business. The team has been very successful, both within our commercial core dev and operating teams in finding opportunities to further take efficiency out of the business. And that’s actually the last of the non-operated joint ventures that we participate in. So we’ve made great progress and again, taking that kind of inefficient structure out of the business. And we’ll continue to look for opportunities to do that. And with the scale and geographic footprint like ours, these low-risk, high-value bolt-ons, I think, will continue to be opportunities.
Theresa Chen: Got it. And thus far into fourth quarter, can you provide some color on the progress made to date on the marketing efforts, just given the seasonal tailwinds this winter?
Chad Zamarin: Yes. I’d say it’s too early to really speculate the winner is just getting started. We’ve got – I mean, the great thing about the Sequent platform is it’s set up to be a very low risk platform, and we can sit and be opportunistic as weather events materialize. But at this point, we’re going to continue to remain cautious on kind of over-interpreting or trying to over predict the weather itself. And so we’re well set up well positioned for the winter, if we see dislocations. But remember that as that asset, that footprint is primarily structured for basis differentials and differentials in time and so we’ll continue to watch the weather play out. But right now, we feel pretty good how we’re set up.
Theresa Chen: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next now to Jean Ann Saulsbury at Bernstein.
Jean Ann Saulsbury: Hi good morning. Congrats on the Southeast Supply Enhancement precedent agreements. I just had a couple of questions on that. Does the spin start when MVP goes in service, and therefore, kind of the clock. So the 4Q 2027, if basically MVP starts a lot later than expected, that would also push back?
Alan Armstrong: No. Well, just to be clear, the agreements go – the clock starts on those agreements for 20 years when we place the expansion in service. And so that was the reference to 2047. I would say it’s pretty optimistic to think we would have that in service in 2027, certainly would be probably the latter part of that just timing standpoint. But that’s – obviously, we’ve set it up for permitting success, so we may be able to do that, but that was a reference to that. So it doesn’t – the timing doesn’t have any of those terms don’t have anything to do with Mountain Valley Pipeline. They are, many of those agreements are dependent on Mountain Valley Pipeline coming into service. But not under that timeline.
Jean Ann Saulsbury: Got it. Yes, I think I meant more for you to have the project online. If Mountain Valley gets pushed, would your start date also kind of get pushed because you would wait to start working on it.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Sorry, Jean. I’m sorry, I didn’t understand your question. Yes. I would just say if that didn’t get done, I think it’s very low probability that over between now and 2027 that it wouldn’t be placed in service, but that’s what you’re suggesting, then we would probably have – those markets are going to have to have supplies from somewhere. And so we would have to come up with another way of getting those supplies to them, which would be a bigger project.
Jean Ann Saulsbury: Got it. That makes sense. And is it all going to be kind of the 1.4 Bcfd, and kind of all one day kind of shows up – not one day, but at one time? Or could it be sort of phased in gradually leading up to the final.
Alan Armstrong: Right now, our plans would be for it to all come on at once.
Jean Ann Saulsbury: Got it. And then another follow-up. I think most people believe that we’re entering a period of significantly more volatility in gas price both in regional spreads and in time spreads. Can you kind of just walk us through the specific part of Williams portfolio that would benefit from this over time versus this year, which wasn’t particularly volatile? I know that there’s sequence, obviously, in but also sort of market rate storage, the gas-linked gathering contracts that you referred to, et cetera?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Sure. Chad, do you want to take that?
Chad Zamarin: Yes. I think you mentioned several of them. I think the fundamental base business benefits, I mean, at the end of the day, pipeline infrastructure is built to mitigate basis. I mean, so we like the setup certainly near term from a marketing, from a storage and optimization perspective. It’s obviously drives the need for our producers and our supply areas to be better connected to different markets. But ultimately, volatility and basis differentials are what drive value across our core infrastructure. And that’s why we think we’re set up so well to continue to grow our base business and layer in is kind of the cherry on top, layer in these other assets and capabilities that capture that volatility. But at the end of the day, our business is converting volatility in infrastructure, and that’s really what we’re focused on. And we think we’re really well set up to follow basis differentials and volatility and bring infrastructure solutions to help mitigate that long term.
Jean Ann Saulsbury: Makes a lot of sense. Thank you.
Chad Zamarin: Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go next now to Brian Reynolds at UBS.
Brian Reynolds: Hi good morning everyone. Maybe to peak ahead to 2024, excluding today’s acquisitions. We have some tailwinds around full year Mountain West and some small expansions also by some hedging headwinds, it seems like, but kind of just curious if you can maybe just talk about the existing base business and whether there are any rising ties as it relates to volumes or kind of what Jean Ann alluded to some nat gas storage opportunities or margin uplift that could move the needle one way or the other next year as we think about just the 2024 versus 2023? Thanks.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Well, first, I’ll take a high-level cut at that, and then John can provide some more detailed remarks on it. First of all, the base business is continuing to grow nicely. I think how much growth we see in the gathering business next year will be somewhat dependent on producers’ response. And obviously, their response will be somewhat dependent on both the prompt price as well as shape of the forward curve. And so a little bit of TBD, I would say, in terms of volume growth on the gathering systems and as that would affect our gathering revenues. I think on the transmission business, our opportunities there are acceleration of existing projects that we have out there. The team has been doing a great job like they did on REA of bringing that first phase in early. So I think the opportunities there as you – if you look at our projects, most of those come in, including the big deepwater business comes on towards the end – very end of 2024. So some acceleration of those projects would be where the opportunities would exist on those very tangible and identifiable growth projects that drive a very large increase in 2025. So I think it’s a little bit early right now, frankly, to be calling what we’ll see from the producer community in 2024, and that will probably drive that on the margin. But I’ll let John take the more specifics on that.
John Porter: Not a lot really to add. I do think a really good reference for information about our growth in 2024 and really beyond is in Slide 18 in the appendix, you’re going to spot a number of projects, as Alan mentioned, that will contribute to 2024 based on what we know today, including several projects in the transmission and Deepwater Gulf of Mexico business as well as several gathering and processing expansions. You mentioned the full year of MountainWest Pipeline acquisition and now these DJ transactions that we’re discussing today, too, that will layer into 2024. And you also mentioned working against these increases, we will see the absence of some of the gathering and processing related hedges that we had in place in 2023. But again, that’s Slide 18 in the appendix, I think, really clearly shows the projects that will be leading to the growth of 2024 and obviously, the much more significant growth in 2025 and beyond. And as Alan mentioned, it kind of shows you the different projects that could potentially add to upside if we’re able to bring them in early.
Brian Reynolds: Great. Thanks. Makes sense. Maybe as my follow-up, we’ve seen the market talk a lot about NGL and LNG opportunity sets over the next, call it, three years to five years with some downstream expansion opportunities. So I was kind of just curious, just given Williams strategic position on the transmission business, if you could just refresh us on your kind of $1 billion to $2 billion CapEx run rate or we could see some lumpy attractive projects ultimately move into the backlog and grow returns just given the thought process that we see 20 Bcf of natural gas demands coming over the next decade. Thanks.
Alan Armstrong: Yes, Brian, thank you. We’re pretty careful to not put things in there until we’ve got pretty high level of optimism about those projects going forward in that backlog. And I would tell you, I would be frankly very surprised if we didn’t see some – a lot of those projects that are in our pipeline move forward, given the amount of demands and projects that are coming on and the way we’re positioned with our infrastructure to serve that. So to answer your question, I think it would be very unlikely that we wouldn’t see some additional projects come in to help serve a lot of these gas demand increases. And I say that from a few fronts. One, if you look at what the alternatives are for power generation, say, in the Northeast now, the answer for power generation up there was going to be offshore wind, that is looking very unlikely now within the decade that we’re looking at right now, and so some other answer is going to have to happen. Unfortunately, we’ve shut down the Indian Point Nuclear Facility, and there’s pressure to take down other facilities up there. And I just think that’s – people are going to have to get sober pretty quickly here on what the alternatives are up there. I think our customers on REA are going to wind up looking really, really smart for taking that capacity that they took because I think that’s going to be in precious demand. So in the Northeast, I think harsh reality is going to set in here before long. In the Mid-Atlantic, we saw great evidence of demand well beyond what this initial project that we’re building in the Mid-Atlantic States and into the Southeast. And then obviously, the LNG market continues to demand more and more infrastructure in that area that we’re well positioned to serve. So it would be pretty shocking to me if we didn’t see that – a lot of that backlog into 2025 and 2026 really turned into some pretty material projects up there.
Brian Reynolds: Great. Super helpful. Hopefully some more returns like Southeast Supply. I’ll leave it there. Enjoy the rest of your morning.
Alan Armstrong: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. We go next now to Jeremy Tonet at [indiscernible]. Jeremy, your line is open, if you do have a question at this time. Hearing no response. We’ll move next now to Tristan Richardson at Scotiabank.
Tristan Richardson: Hey, good morning, guys. Alan, you noted in your comments, you’re surprised at the level of demand you’re seeing as you seek to commercialize healthy supply. I mean, suggesting that there could be other opportunities. Is this a dynamic where the scope of Southeast Supply could change over time? Or are you thinking of addressing this demand really with separate projects and thinking way down the road?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. It’s a great question, Tristan, and you picked up on an important point there. Our issue is that our customers, which are some of our best and biggest customers on Transco are their demands are very urgent. And for us to sit around and wait for – to finalize any more of the demand that was pending out there, really, it doesn’t serve those customers very well. And so we’re moving ahead with those customers that we’re ready to put binding contracts in place. And that – and we’re not – I would just say we’re going to try to protect that – the time line of that project. And that will be kind of first and foremost in our thinking as we move ahead on that. So could that expand a little bit where somebody else coming in under the wire before we do our pre-filing. Yes, but I’d say, we’re not going to get ourselves strong out there in a way that we can’t move ahead with this initial project because our customers have made it very clear how important it is that we get on with it. So that kind of hopefully gives you a little bit of idea of what we’re dealing with there. But I would say it’s obvious from the open season and from the additional requirements that are continuing to service. I’d be just like I said earlier; I would be very surprised if we didn’t see another project come out of this. It’s just – we’ve got to get on with it because the demands are so.
Tristan Richardson: That’s great context. And then as we look out to 2024 and the acceleration of EBITDA growth into 2025, is there a thought about the appropriate pace of dividend growth relative to your 5% to 7% long-term EBITDA growth, particularly with the visibility you guys have over the next couple of years. And as we’re seeing the midstream space broadly return to a period of accelerated dividend growth?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I would just say, obviously, that’s a Board-level decision in terms of how we grow that dividend. I do think, as we’ve said all along, we do intend to continue to grow it in line earlier with our EBITDA and now with our AFFO just because we do have to make sure that we don’t ignore any tax liability that would start to affect that. And so that’s the reason for the switch from EBITDA to AFFO growth. But having said all that, I think the 5% to 7% is well within our wheelhouse and it certainly looks like that growth even as our EBITDA gets bigger, here for the next several years, at some point, the law of big numbers starts to overcome that. But for right now, I think the 5% to 7% growth rate is very achievable within our dividend growth rate.
Tristan Richardson: Appreciate it, Alan. Thanks all.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go back next to Jeremy Tonet at JPMorgan. Excuse me. 
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, can you hear me now?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Got you, Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet: Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to start off, if I could, with regards to capital allocation. And just wondering, as you’ve talked about it in different points of the call, but specifically as it relates to higher rates out there, how that impacts, I guess, thoughts on return of capital hurdles for capital deployment, specifically thinking about the dividend rate now, price appreciation has increased the yield a bit. Just wondering how this all mixed together with higher rates today?
John Porter: Yes. Thanks, Jeremy. Thanks for the question. I mean I don’t think we really have any significant change to the returns-based approach that we’ve been discussing for capital allocation now for the last couple of years. We have seen a slight uptick in our borrowing costs, but we’re managing through that. I think very well. And of course, we’re seeing the returns on many of our projects as we’ve been discussing with that Southeast Supply enhancement being stronger than ever. So, I think the spread in our business between the returns on our invested capital and our cost of capital continues to be holding up very well, if not improving over time. I think as far as the capital allocation decision matrix that we’ve discussed in the past, as I know you’re familiar with, we are somewhat unique in terms of our ability to make fairly discretionary large investments into our regulated rate base and achieve regulated rates of return. We do have a rate case coming up starting next year or so, we’ll be revisiting our ROE on our Transco rate base. And – but again, we do have a somewhat discretionary and somewhat unlimited ability to invest into that regulated rate base and achieve that regulated rate of return. So that really does set the floor of our capital allocation decisions. And I think going forward, you’ll see us, as we have done in the past, just monitor what we see as the return on share buybacks up against the potential to continue to make additional investments in the regulated rate base. And if we see dislocations in the stock price based on what we – what the current yield is trading at and our view of the growth into the future, then we’ll quickly act to buy shares as we’ve done in the past.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. And I would just add at a macro level there, Jeremy. The strange as it may seem, the higher interest rates are actually on a macro level, I think, pretty good for this business and a couple of reasons. One, given the structure of our gathering contracts and the inflation adjustment in those, which goes against the entire rate, not against just the operating cost side of that rate. So that really continues to push our operating margin up. I would tell you that we don’t plan on the inflation rate continuing as we look to our long-term model. But to the degree that occurs, it’s actually a net positive for us. But in addition to that, I think you’re seeing the impact of high interest rates come across the alternatives as we think about power generation and infrastructure to meet power generation demand. And in a simple term, a gas-fired generation facility has a huge advantage on the capital costs associated with it, but as a disadvantage on the fuel cost. And so the fixed capital element of power generation is very positive from a natural gas standpoint just because of the capital required on the front end is so much lower, but the savings are in the fuel. And so I think we’re in a very attractive environment right now for our business in our industry in general as interest rates have moved up. It’s just put more and more pressure on people’s need to have natural gas as a very real-world alternative to meet the very rapidly growing power generation demands that we’re seeing in the markets we serve.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Makes sense. I’ll leave it there. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go next now to Praneeth Satish at Wells Fargo.
Praneeth Satish: Thanks. I guess I’ll start with a high-level question, which is maybe touching on your prior remarks. Alan. But I guess, as you mentioned, there is pressure on offshore wind, even solar deployments under pressure under the higher rate environment. So I guess as you talk to your utility customers, have you observed any shift there in terms of their long-term perspectives on natural gas? And has there been any adjustments there in terms of their decarbonization time lines?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I think for a number of reasons. I think even some of the shifts we’ve seen here in the mid-Atlantic states are the rapidly growing demand that they’re seeing from things like data centers and all kinds of incremental loads that they’re seeing, even industrial load from the fact that we have such low priced gas here in the U.S. is driving some of that demand. So yes, we’re seeing that mostly in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic states. I think the Northeast is yet to come. I think people have kind of been holding out for that. And I think there’s been plans to depend on that offshore wind and I think, as I mentioned earlier, I think the harsh reality is going to hit us there. So we’re – we very much see ourselves as a complement to renewables, and we are all for seeing that develop. But here as we sit in the Northeast to answer your question, we haven’t seen the shift or the capitulation perhaps you might describe it as in that market yet. But I would say we certainly are seeing a very sober mid-Atlantic and Southeast markets because they’ve been up against the – they’re seeing the demand growth in their markets, and they’ve got to have an answer for it.
Chad Zamarin: And I think it’s important to remember the fundamentals of the eastern third of the United States, and there are less than 10% intermittent resources today. So there is – they’re just getting started in deploying alternatives like solar and wind. And if you look at forecast for PJM it’s, I think, widely understood that by 2040 and this is long term. By 2040, peak gas demand is going to double from where it is today. And so the utilities have recognized that, one, they need gas here and now and long term in order to achieve decarbonization goals are going to need even more.
Praneeth Satish: Got it. And then switching gears on Overland Pass. Do you see any disruption to volumes on the line after ONEOK expands Elk Creek if they decide to divert volumes, will that impact Bakken flows on Overland Pass? And then, I guess, if so, would you expect some of the NGLs picked up from the DJ assets? Could that potentially backfill any volume loss on OPPL?
Michael Dunn: Yes. This is Micheal. I’ll take that one. Thanks for the question. Yes, I would suspect if and when ONEOK gets the El Creek expansion done, we’d see less Bakken flows kind of a just they’ve been diverting some of the flows into the OPPL asset. We’ve got space and OPPL today to bring in the DJ volumes. So that’s really not a constraint as we see it today. But certainly, opening up more space is not a bad thing on OPPL ultimately, if we have the need to bring in more DJ volume. But we certainly enjoyed the volume from the Bakken to ONEOK has brought to our partnership.
Praneeth Satish: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions this morning. Mr. Armstrong, I’d like to turn things back to you for any closing comments, sir.
Alan Armstrong: Okay. Well, thank you. Thank you all for joining us today. Really exciting to get to announce a lot of accomplishments in the quarter and a real, I think, very clear picture of the kind of growth that we are seeing emerge ahead of us. And so very excited for the current performance, but even more excited about the growth and the signs of even more growth that we’re seeing in – across our strategy right now. So thanks for joining us, and I look forward to speaking with you next time.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Armstrong. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the Williams Third Quarter Earnings 2023 Conference Call. Again, I’d like to thank you all so much for joining us and wish you all a great day. Goodbye.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-03 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Williams Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Just a reminder, today’s call is being recorded. And now at this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Danilo Juvane, Vice President of Investor Relations, ESG, and Investment Analysis. Please go ahead, sir.
Danilo Juvane: Thanks, Bo, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in The Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon, we’ve released our earnings press release and the presentation that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong and our Chief Financial Officer, John Porter, will speak to this morning. Also joining us on the call today are Michael Dunn, our Chief Operating Officer; Lane Wilson, our General Counsel; and Chad Zamarin, our Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development. In our presentation materials, you will find a disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to our remarks and you should review it. Also included in the presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to generally accepted accounting principles. And these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today’s presentation materials. So with that, I will turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong: Okay. Well, thanks, Danilo, and thank you all for joining us today another positive story to share with you this quarter, and you can see some of those highlighted here and called out on Slide 2. First of all, adjusted EBITDA up 8%, adjusted earnings per share up 5%, and our gathering volumes were up 6%. And certainly, while this growth and beat is impressive, our resiliency in the face of low commodity prices is even more impressive and gave us another opportunity to distinguish ourselves from the pack, which is largely post to declines this quarter. And our growth continues to compound despite these price swings in natural gas. This quarter was a perfect example where we saw an 8% EBITDA increase on the back of a very strong 14% increase for the same period last year. John will dive deeper into the numbers in a moment, but let me start out with a few highlights from the quarter. Our financial performance is our track record, but it is the day-to-day focus on execution by our teams that drives these results and really does set us apart. As an example, our teams have done a fantastic job of quickly integrating the MountainWest acquisition into our core business, and in fact, we’re pleased to announce that we’ve already secured binding precedent agreements to support a significant expansion on the newly acquired Overthrust Pipeline. This project was not even in our upside case for this investment, and the team has identified even more growth to come that is beyond our original expectations. Much of this growth is centered around coal to natural gas conversions in the western states. On Transco, we continue to advance our emission reduction program and recently completing – completed our first large scale compressor replacement project in Virginia, our backlog of high return pipeline expansion opportunities continues to progress driven by a large wave of incremental demand that continues to exceed our expectations. As evidence of this continued wave of increasing demand, we recently concluded a non-binding open season to advance another large scale Transco project that will provide much needed capacity to serve our customers South of Station 165 in Virginia. Our customers recent – customers requested capacity that has been well in excess of the 800,000 dekatherms per day that we offered. Importantly, the minimum required term for this service offering was 20 years. This underscores our belief in the durable and fast growing demand for capacity and the market’s confidence in our ability to deliver this capacity with the lowest environmental impact. Following the approval of the Mountain Valley Pipeline. We’re now working to find a way to serve as much of our customers’ needs as possible and hope to have an update on this exciting project soon. Moving on to financial performance, as I stated earlier, despite a weakened natural gas price environment, our financial results not only grew against a difficult comp in a difficult environment, but this quarter marked the 30th consecutive earnings print that either met or exceeded consensus estimates. Within our legacy based business in the Northeast, we produced record EBITDA and record gathering volumes delivering growth that far outpaced the total production across Marcellus. Our strategy to focus on connecting our producing customers to the best markets with the most reliable service available has grown this business to the point it is nearing $2 billion per year of EBITDA. The completion of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, our Regional Energy Access project and continued growth of gas-fired generation in the local market will continue to provide market and volume growth well into the future. In the West, we also achieve record gathering volumes once again showing that our diverse geographic position is built to weather commodity price swings. In our transmission in Gulf of Mexico segment, we are enjoying the beginnings of a long runway of growth in the deepwater gearing up for a long string of expansions on Transco and enjoying better than expected growth in our MountainWest acquisition, which speaks to our successful integration. Importantly, the strength of our base business more than offset weaker E&P earnings and expected low seasonal cash flows from our marketing business. The quarter’s results continue to prove out the inherent stability and stubborn growth of our business. However, when we see the market fail to appreciate our ability to deliver in most price environments, we will continue to execute on our authorized repurchase program much like we did during the second quarter. And finally, a few notes on our sustainability efforts. Last week, we issued our 2022 sustainability report and completed our annual CDP Climate Questionnaire. These are both important markers that detail our progress on key issues like environmental stewardship, community sport, and workforce development. To us, sustainability means running our business in a way that will create value for the perpetual shareholder. So we’re proud to have also be providing our shareholders with industry-leading returns on invested capital, and we expect our shareholders to further benefit from enhanced capital returns as we execute on our large growth backlog, which among others include seven out of nine major pipeline projects that are coming online in the fourth quarter of 2024 and that will be stacked on top of a solid foundation of a sustainable based business. And with that, I’m going to turn things over to John to walk us through the financial metrics of the quarter. John?
John Porter: Thanks, Alan. Starting here on Slide 3 with a summary of our year-over-year financial performance, beginning with adjusted EBITDA, we saw another strong quarterly increase of 8% over the prior year, and this happens to coincide with an 8.6% CAGR over the last five years for this same measure. And this strong performance included a new record for gathering volumes, which increase 6%. Year-to-date, our adjusted EBITDA is now up 13% driven by the growth of our core infrastructure businesses, which continue to perform very well, even as natural gas price decreased 61% for the first half of 2023 versus the first half of 2022, once again, demonstrating the resiliency and strength of our natural gas focused strategy, our assets, and our operational capabilities. For second quarter, our adjusted EPS increased 5% for the quarter, continuing the strong growth we’ve had in EPS over the last many years with our year-to-date EPS now up 23%. Available funds from operations AFFO growth for second quarter was in line with adjusted EBITDA and you see our second quarter dividend coverage based on AFFO was a very strong 2.23 times growing about 2% despite growing our dividend by 5.3%. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen with debt to adjusted EBITDA now reaching 3.5 times versus last year’s 3.82 times and that’s even after closing the Trace, NorTex and MountainWest acquisitions and also repurchasing $139 million worth of shares since last year. On CapEx, you see an increase primarily reflecting the progress we’re making on some of our key growth projects, including Regional Energy Access and Louisiana Energy Gateway. For the full year, there’s no change to our consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance of $6.4 billion to $6.8 billion or any of our other guidance metrics. But in a moment, I’ll provide a little color on our expectations for the remainder of the year versus the performance we’ve seen thus far in 2023. So let’s turn to the next slide and take a little closer look at the second quarter results. A strong 8% increase in EBITDA over prior year even as average natural gas prices for the second quarter decreased 71% walking now from last year’s roughly $1.5 billion to this year’s $1.6 billion, we start with our Upstream joint venture operations that are included in our other segment, which were down $43 million versus last year. Our Haynesville Upstream EBITDA was down about $14 million despite substantially higher production due to much lower net realized prices and a lower working interest percentage on new wells beginning in January of 2023. Our Wamsutter upstream EBITDA was down $29 million due primarily to lower realized prices, but production also continued to be impacted throughout April from the historically difficult Wyoming winter weather we saw in the first quarter. Shifting now to our core business performance, our transmission in Gulf of Mexico business improved $96 million or 15%, including about a $52 million contribution from our MountainWest Pipeline and NorTex acquisitions, but with other increases in our transmission and deepwater revenues as well. Our Northeast G&P business performed extremely well with a $65 million or 14% increase, driven by an $81 million increase in service revenues. And we did have a one-time $14 million favorable gathering revenue catch up adjustment in that second quarter increase in service revenue. But this revenue increase was really fueled by a 6% increase in total volumes in the Northeast. Shifting now to the west, which increased to $16 million or 5%, benefiting from continued strong volume growth in the Haynesville and positive hedge results that partially offset the impact of lower commodity base rates. And then you see the $22 million decrease in our Gas and NGL Marketing business and the majority of this decline was actually related to lower NGL marketing results from inventory valuation changes where we had to gain on NGL inventories last year at a loss this year. So again, the second quarter continued our strong start to 2023 with 8% growth in EBITDA driven by core infrastructure business performance in spite of natural gas prices that were 71% lower than second quarter of 2022. So let’s turn the page and touch on the year-to-date comparison. Year-to-date, we’ve seen a 13% increase over 2022, walking now from last year’s $3 billion to this year’s $3.4 billion, we start with the upstream joint venture operations included in our other segment, which were down $39 million versus last year. Now, year-to-date, Haynesville is up nicely on very strong volume growth that has been significantly offset by lower realized prices. However, the overall Haynesville increase was offset by lower Wamsutter results due primarily to the historically difficult winter weather we saw in Wyoming this year. Shifting now to our core business performance, transmission in Gulf of Mexico business improved $127 million or 9% that’s really similar themes as our second quarter, namely the impacts of the MountainWest Pipeline and NorTex acquisitions, however, we have seen other significant increases in our transmission and deepwater revenues as well. Our Northeast G&P business has performed very well with $117 million or 13% increase driven by $154 million increase in service revenue. This revenue increase was fueled by a 7% increase in total volumes focused in our liquids rich areas where we tend to have higher per unit margin than our dry gas areas. And in the appendix, you’ll find a slide that compares our 7% volume growth to the overall basin growth of just under 2%. Shifting now to the West, which increased $42 million or 8%, benefiting from positive hedge results and the Trace acquisition, but the West was significantly unfavorably impacted by the severe Wyoming weather and January processing economics at our Opal Wyoming processing plant. And then you see the $144 million increase in our Gas and NGL Marketing business caused by the strong first quarter that we had at the start of the year. So again, a continuation to the strong start to 2023 with 13% growth in EBITDA, driven by core infrastructure business performance with strength from our marketing business that dramatically overcame weaker than expected results from the upstream joint ventures. So as I mentioned earlier, there’s no change to our consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance of $6.4 billion to $6.8 billion or any of our other guidance metrics. We’ve definitely had a strong start to the year with $3.4 billion of EBITDA through the first half of the year. And thanks to the performance of our base business we have clear visibility to hitting at least the mid-point of our guidance even after a historic decline in natural gas prices and a historically difficult winter that continue to have impacts through April. So you may be wondering, why we aren’t raising our guidance on the back of such a strong start to the year and a bright future ahead. First, I will remind you that our guidance does include a range of $200 million above our midpoint. And second, while we usually experience stronger third and fourth quarters than second quarter, the third quarter does occasionally see hurricane outages for our deepwater business. Finally, we could also still see downward shifts in natural gas prices for the balance of the year that could unfavorably impact our upstream joint ventures in particular. While we are not suggesting, there is a high likelihood of realizing these impacts, we do need to be prepared to overcome these scenarios. Therefore, it is too early to raise our full year guidance. But once again, we are confident in the continued performance of our base infrastructure businesses, allowing us to once again meet or exceed the midpoint of our guidance range. We’re setting our sites on continued growth in 2024 before another big growth step in 2025. And with that, I’ll turn it back to Alan.
Alan Armstrong: Okay. Thanks, John. Just a few closing remarks before we open it up for your questions here. First, I’ll start by reiterating our belief that Williams remains a compelling investment opportunity. We are the most natural gas centric large scale midstream company around today and the integrated nature of our business from our best-in-class long haul pipes to our formidable gathering assets, which are complimented by our Sequent platform that delivers upside to our base business is unique and we have a track record to prove it. Second, our combination of proven resilience, five year EPS CAGR of 23%, industry leading coverage on our steadily growing dividend, a strong balance sheet and high visibility to growth we think is unique amongst the S&P 500 and unique within our sector. Let me emphasize that our natural gas focused strategy has allowed us to produce a 10-year track record of growing adjusted EBITDA through a number of commodity and economic cycles. And it is continuing to deliver significant growth in the current environment. And we’re now celebrating 7.5 years of delivering inline or better quarterly results. That is especially impressive when you consider the sectors ups and downs over this period. And the fundamentals are setting up stronger than ever for this long-term predictable growth to continue. And finally, as we think about our long-term strategy, we see that U.S. natural gas infrastructure is key to meeting both today’s energy demand as well as projected growth of electrification and renewables build out in the future. Simply put, you cannot implement and accelerate wind, solar and large scale electrification without having natural gas as a reliable complimentary partner to these big system changes. In fact, despite continued growth in solar and wind capacity, the country saw record natural gas power demand in July, reaching as high as 53 Bcf per day last week to meet summer power loads. This tops the previous record set last July by 6%, again, compounding growth on top of compounding growth. And so if we truly do want to meet our country’s growing power demand for things like data centers and EVs and accelerate wind and solar power generation, we must continue increasing natural gas infrastructure capacity. This fact has become evident to both the majority of our legislators and the Biden administration as they came out with unprecedented support for Mountain Valley Pipeline’s completion. Williams is here for the long haul and we are committed to leveraging our large scale natural gas infrastructure network for the benefit of generations to come. And with that, I’ll open it up for your questions.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Armstrong. [Operator Instructions] We’ll take our first question this morning from Spiro Dounis at Citi.
Spiro Dounis: Thanks, operator. Good morning, team. First question, maybe start with gas macro. Looks like, we’re maybe approaching a trough here and some of the producer activity. So just curious to get your all’s view on what your producer customers are seeing and doing and really just how you’re thinking about the volume and price trajectory from here as we head into 2024 and really wait for LNG volumes to pick up a lot of the slack.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Spiro, well, certainly, I wouldn’t say, there’s one answer to that question, but maybe I’ll try to summarize it a little bit. I think the majority of producers see a pretty bright future for demand right now. And as a result of that, they’re making sure that they’re not letting their systems fall into decline in a way that’d be hard to recover from. So I would say, they are much like a cat kind of poised for demand growth in the future, but really watching cost and trimming out cost where they can and kind of proving up their capabilities in certain areas. So I would say, it feels to me like the producers are trying to maintain level volumes as much as possible, but being poised for future demand growth, that’s pretty evident down the road.
Spiro Dounis: Yes. It’s helpful. Second question is maybe moving to leverage as you guys pointed out, you’re down to about 3.5 times now this quarter, so already below your target on the year. So just curious how you’re thinking about utilizing this excess balancing capacity. Is that the plan or really maybe even thinking about operating at these lower levels?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I would just say, I think we really enjoy the flexibility that we have right now and we’ve been pretty clear about capital allocation. It’s nice to have a – such a large pool of ability to invest in our rate base at some pretty decent returns, and I think probably even some higher returns once we get through the next rate case, given the inflation and the cost of debt that’s gone up, that will drive us to be able to earn even an higher return in our rate base. So that’s really nice to have that pool of capital to be able to invest in. And that really kind of sits at the bottom of our stack of capital allocation, but team’s doing a great job of deploying that. As I mentioned, we completed our Station 180, which is a very large compressor station in [indiscernible] and the team brought that in a little bit ahead of schedule, and Michael and I actually got to go up there a few weeks ago and see that great effort by the team of modernizing our facilities there. And so anyway, I would just say to answer your question more directly, we have places to place capital for nice return like that and I think we’ll continue to do that, but we certainly enjoy the flexibility that we have at this level to be able to place capital towards those kinds of opportunities.
Spiro Dounis: Great. I’ll leave it there. Thanks for the time guys.
Operator: Thank you. We go next down to Jeremy Tonet at JP Morgan.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.
Alan Armstrong: Good morning, Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet: Just wanted to start off with Appalachia, if I could Northeast G&P quite a good quarter there, recognize there’s a little bit of timing with the revenue catch up there. But just wondering if you could talk a bit more about what’s a normalized EBITDA level in the Northeast G&P right now. And are you seeing kind of a shift in production wet versus dry and is that impacting margins, just trying to get a bit of color for what the trajectory is here?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I definitely think we saw producers focusing, where they have it available. We saw producers focusing on wet where there are producers that have that ability to shift. But while at the same time, I think keeping themselves poised for markets to open up. And so I would say, that’s kind of what we’ve seen. In terms of normalized EBITDA, I think the first two quarters are a pretty good sign of that. I think anytime you can just average that out over a couple of quarters, I think that’s a pretty good sign of a normalized number. But I do think as markets open up through both MountainWest and Regional Energy Access and continued industrial and power generation demand in the local markets, I think we’re going to see that PJM, certainly found itself very short power lasts year or – and during the winter time as well. And I think we’re going to continue to see people build out power generation to take advantage of that. So I’m pretty encouraged, frankly, about in terms of the market outlook over the next couple of years for the Northeast. I do think that we’ll see the Northeast have an opportunity to take back some of the market share across the U.S. as a result of some of these markets opening up.
Jeremy Tonet: That’s very helpful. And just to clarify, when you say new markets opening up, is this regional energy that kind of prime in the [indiscernible] or MVP or others?
Alan Armstrong: Well, there’s really three distinct issues there. Mountain Valley Pipeline certainly, and it’ll be competing. There’s been some confusion out there. I think in the market, we have plenty of capacity to pull all that MountainWest can deliver. It’s just a question of how it’s going to compete with Haynesville gas coming in at Station 85 on the system. And so there – but there’s – it’s just going to be a question of producers competing for those markets. But I will say that market in particularly at south of Station 165, as was demonstrated by a recent open season is going to continue to grow pretty rapidly. And last winter got caught in a very short situation on natural gas. And so we’re going to continue to see the markets in the Carolinas there and Virginia and the Southeast continue to expand. Mountain Valley Pipeline’s going to be that connection. In addition to that Regional Energy Access is also going to provide new market and that’ll take some time. It’s not going to be a snap your fingers and we’ll see that kind of growth pulled out of that area, but it will open up new markets and new demand. And then finally, as I mentioned, regional loads in the area as well and people taking advantage of low price natural gas, and in fact, the shell big cracker there is just one good example of the industry growth, but as well we’re seeing power generation load to continue to build there as well in the PJM area. So I think really pretty clear examples of market growth for the Northeast.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Very helpful. And just one more on gas, if I could. I think in our stakeholder conversations across various states, we’re starting to see gas peakers come back into integrated resource planning that we had not seen in recent years or maybe had fallen out in recent years. And just wondering if you’re seeing this trend as well, particularly as it relates to Transco and its unique positioning? And could this lead to incremental opportunities beyond kind of what’s in the slides today?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I think as we mentioned, the open season that we had for capacity south of 165 really kind of caught our attention, frankly, and far exceeded our expectations. And so when we say that it exceeded what we had to offer, it was a very large multiple versus what we had to offer there. So yes, we definitely are seeing the signs of people taking advantage of low price natural gas. And importantly, I think this is something that gets missed too often, Jeremy, I know you follow this, but I think sometimes the broader investor base misses this that – what we have to sell is capacity. It doesn’t mean that that’s going to be an annual average increase in volume as much as it does mean that people are absolutely going to have to buy capacity for those peakers and for baseload. And we actually, I think we’re going to see quite a bit of baseload pick up as well, because the amount of data centers, the amount of electrification load that’s going on is well in excess of what our increasing wind and solar generation can keep up with. And so we’re not only going to see peaking, we’re going to see baseload increase as well. But again, all of that boils down, whether it’s peaking or it’s baseload, people still have to buy the full amount of capacity on our pipeline. And that’s certainly coming through in these open seasons that we’ve been having on – in that area.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Right. Makes sense. Coal to gas baseload conversion clearly there, but the peaking needs – I think it seems a bit underappreciated. So very helpful color. Thank you for that.
Alan Armstrong: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go next now to Jean Ann Salisbury at Bernstein.
Jean Ann Salisbury: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the comment that was just made Alan about there being plenty of capacity on Transco and it kind of being a competition between the Haynesville producers and the Appalachian producers. I think that for the open season for the 800,000, that timeline is kind of set for 2027. So is it accurate to say that capacity is there, but sort of needs to be unlocked to be usable over the next few years?
Alan Armstrong: Well, also Jean Ann, you have to realize I think we have six projects along that exist, along that corridor or five along that corridor, excluding Regional Energy Access that are also expansions in that same area that were not dependent on Mountain Valley Pipeline supplies coming into that area. And so there’s a number of projects that and we got them listed there in our materials. So that is – obviously those come on before this latest open season would, but those are increments to serve increasing demand for power generation in the Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia areas.
Jean Ann Salisbury: Okay. But they’re kind of – I guess, maybe my broader question is like, if – like, there need to be projects that Williams does that are kind of negotiated rate incremental contract.
Alan Armstrong: Well, yes, the point I think that’s misunderstood, Jean Ann, is that we have the physical capacity to move that gas from Station 165 period into sentence and not very complicated. We have plenty of capacity to move from that point. The piece I think that got missed by some of the market consultants was the fact that the – how much would actually move from that point, because people are already buying supplies from Station 180 – or sorry, Station 85 and moving it north, but those same shippers have the ability to pick their gas up at 165 if they choose to. So it’s just going to be a matter of where they decide to pick their gas. But we have plenty of capacity to move gas out of station, the 2 Bcf a day out of 165. So the physical capacity exists, the shippers actually are the ones that decide how we operate the system and where we move the gas from. And if they decide, they want to buy it at 165, 85 will get backed off and 165 will get picked up for supplies.
Jean Ann Salisbury: Got it. That makes sense. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, there was a big tick up in NGL and crude volumes that you classify as Overland Pass and Rocky Mountain Midstream this quarter. What was driving that?
Michael Dunn: Hey, Jean Ann, this is Michael. Some of that was Bakken volumes coming in on the OPPL line from a third-party as well as some methane volumes that picked up in the quarter.
Jean Ann Salisbury: Great. That’s all for me. Thank you.
Alan Armstrong: Thanks, Jean Ann.
Operator: Thank you. We go next now to Brian Reynolds at UBS.
Brian Reynolds: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Maybe to start off in the 2023 outlook, John, you talked in the prepared remarks about year-to-date outperformance, which supports at least the midpoint. But just kind of curious if you can give some commentary around, uncertainty around these hurricanes in nat gas pricing. Is that baked in to your confidence over the midpoint and thus just assuming constructive or normalized second half fundamentals, just kind of curious if you could sensitize the upper end of the range as well. Thanks.
John Porter: Yes. I think we want to have a lot of confidence in hitting our midpoint. So we do account for things that could happen around the hurricane season and perhaps additional weakness that could come, as I mentioned, from a further decline in natural gas prices. So we’ve built in some ability to handle those kinds of downsides relative to making sure that we can hit our midpoint. So I think conversely, the things that would move us higher in the range would just be better than forecasted performance in the underlying gathering and processing systems in the base business, which is always possible. And it is also possible that we could have a stronger marketing result in the fourth quarter. Sometimes we have fairly strong for example, Novembers and Decembers, but that is unpredictable. Most of that performance comes in the first quarter. So we don’t like to overly depend on any kind of a marketing result to make the numbers. And so we got a lot of confidence just from the base business around hitting the midpoint of our guidance and certainly think we could exceed it as well, but still fairly early in the year and just weren’t comfortable yet in raising the guidance.
Brian Reynolds: Great. I appreciate…
Alan Armstrong: Brian, I would just add – yes, I would just add to that. On the natural gas – sorry, on our marketing business that I think it’s really important to recognize that really what drove the negative in there was primarily just the markdown on NGL inventory. So that’s just – that’s not really cash, moving through the books, it’s just a change in price on the inventory that we hold. And so unless you – if we were to mark that book right now, obviously, you’d see a pretty big step up in that, just because ethane prices have come up so much. But I think that’s really important for the Street to understand relative to balance of the year.
Brian Reynolds: Appreciate that. That makes a lot of sense. As my follow-up, great to see the environmental assessment for the Texas to Louisiana Energy Pathway Project to bring nat gas from Texas into the Louisiana border. LNG demand continues to be a theme, particularly on gas E&P calls this quarter. So just kind of curious if you could just discuss perhaps further greenfield opportunities beyond TLEP that Williams could pursue to bring even more natural gas from Texas across to LNG to support that future demand. Thanks.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Thanks, Brian. Well, I would tell you we are engaged in a number of projects there. And we’re not in a position to be able to disclose those at this point, but we are involved in some pretty large scale projects that we’re excited about and we think we’ll add a lot of value to our shareholders as well as the industry in general and much needed. So we’re pretty excited about that, but we’re not in a position yet to disclose exactly what’s going on there.
Brian Reynolds: Great. Makes sense. We’ll leave it there. Enjoy the rest of your morning. Thanks.
Alan Armstrong: Thanks, Brian.
Operator: Thank you. We go next now to Praneeth Satish at Wells Fargo.
Praneeth Satish: Good morning. I guess, on Southeast Supply Enhancement, first, do you think the project could be upsized given that you noted a very strong open season? And then I guess, I’m still confused maybe a little bit on the lead time. The lead time for the project seems pretty long. It has an in-service date of Q4 2027. Is there anything in particular causing the timeline to be that long or is there may be a contingency in there for permitting?
Michael Dunn: Hi, good morning, Praneeth. This is Michael. Yes, the open season results were a pleasant surprise and we’re currently working through the scenarios with the various customers that requested capacity there. It definitely can be upsized from the 800,000 to be published in the open season notice and we’re just working through that today. So hopefully, we’ll have some more information on that in the very near future in regard to the outcome of those negotiations. But it’s really just a combination of looping and compression additions alongside our brownfield Transco pipeline corridor. And it’s just getting the hydraulic modeling done and developing the proper scenarios and then ultimately giving the rates to the customers that would be identified by the looping and compression on those scenarios. So it’s a little bit of an iterative process, which we’re going through right now, but it can definitely be upside from the 800,000 a day. I’d say the schedule, right now, a lot of that’s driven by the customer’s desired in service date. And so a lot of this capacity is for new gas-fired power generation and anticipating when those new power plants come online is the expectation that the customer’s laying out there for us. I do think there may be an opportunity to accelerate the project at some point, but obviously we have to have customer agreements in place before we can start designing the desired schedule for the customers as well as our capital cash flow. So that’s really what we’re looking at right now. I think 2027 is probably the outside date that we’d be looking at and we’ll try to pull that in where we can.
Praneeth Satish: Okay. That makes sense. And then I guess, just looking at the futures curve for natural gas, it’s in Contango, it’s pretty wide winter, summer spread right now. Just wondering if you could kind of talk through your ability to capture that at Sequent. I guess how much storage capacity does it have right now and how much of that is open and able to take advantage of these wider spreads?
Michael Dunn: Yes, absolutely. The Sequent has a very large storage portfolio. I don’t know that we’ve actually disclosed the aggregate size of it is, but it is a very large storage portfolio and we would expect them to be able to lock in the intrinsic value of that storage. And they also have a lot of deliverability capabilities out of that storage and can optimize around that storage position as well. I don’t think we’ve given a lot of the specifics about the aggregate size of that storage position, but it is a strong storage position that we would expect them to be able to lock in a lot of value around.
Alan Armstrong: Yes, I would just add to that, the way we would book those earnings, we actually would not book those earnings until we delivered. And so that’s really why our fourth – sorry, our first quarter is usually pretty sizable for us is that’s when you see the pricing and the most value for that storage is usually offered in that period. And so that’s a great example of why our first quarter tends to be so large. Some of that, like we said, make them in the fourth quarter depending on what pricing looks like and if we can cycle that storage twice, but we do have to cycle it to be able to take the earnings on that.
Praneeth Satish: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next now to Colton Bean at TPH and Company.
Colton Bean: Good morning. I was just following up on the question on the Northeast saw it’s pretty significant sequential increase in G&P revenue. I know you mentioned the $14 million benefit from a catch up payment there. But even after adjusting for that, it seems like the year-on-year increase is still well above what we would’ve expected from inflation escalators alone. So I guess, are there any other contractual provisions that are pushing unit rates higher across the basin there?
John Porter: No, I think really – as was asked earlier, the question of rich versus lean, obviously when there’s more rich gas drilling, there’s a lot more services that we offer around that. And so that does – that shift to richer gas does tend to drive our margin – our unit margin up across the basin.
Colton Bean: Okay. And that’s primarily showing up in gathering I think on a processing basis volumes looked pretty consistent.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Right.
Colton Bean: Got it. Okay. And then two related questions on cost control. I think if we look at the transmission segment, it looks like OpEx is roughly flat to your pre-acquisition levels after adjusting for the transaction expenses there. So you seeing MountainWest synergies materialize earlier than expected, or should we expect some degree of cost increase moving forward? And then just more broadly, it looks like pretty impressive cost control across all segments expenses flat to down on a year-over-year basis. So if you could just comment more broadly on your cost control initiatives and expectations through the balance of the year.
Michael Dunn: Yes. Colton, thanks for that recognition. Yes, the team’s doing a great job controlling our costs even in this inflationary environment. We have found some ways to actually continue to take cost out of the business and as you’ve indicated, the MountainWest acquisition is really the cost increase that we’re seeing there on the e-comm side of the business. And so I think going through the balance of the year, we would have an expectation that we can continue that cost control. Now, there’s always a lot of variability throughout the second and third quarters with our maintenance activities and our overhauls that are recurring and that would be the only variance that we would see there typically coming up between the second and third quarter, but other than that team’s doing a great job controlling costs this year.
Colton Bean: Great. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next now to Neel Mitra of Bank of America.
Neel Mitra: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to clarify on Jean Ann’s question, the available capacity on Transco. So if I understood it right, are you saying that there’s available capacity on Transco from MVP if you were to back off volumes from Zone 4? So it essentially would be shifting volumes from one area to another to accommodate the existing utility demand. And then I guess the follow on to that would be to accommodate new growth and new demand from utilities, there would need to be Transco expansions. Am I thinking about that the right way?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Neel, let me try explain it one more time. The way the most of the system rates work on there, the shippers have pay the same price, they pay us no matter where the gas is moving from. Generally the – those utilities in that corridor have the ability to pick up gas and they have a volume available that they can pull from at various receipt points. And so they basically are out trying to buy the lowest price gas on the system that they can have delivered into their meters every day. And when we talk about system capacities, we’re actually talking about kind of the delivery capacity to those locations, and it’s – this particular path that somebody buys capacity from on the system. But the big long haul system and the original base system, the shippers have the ability to choose where they want to pull their supply in from. And so even if they’re – we have a number of expansions going on, but even if you just looked at it in a static environment, if somebody today was buying gas Station 85, that gas is likely coming in from either system gas on in the Offshore or Haynesville or gas that’s made its way in from the Permian. But Station 85 or 65 would be a place that customers would be nominating their supplies from and they’d be buying gas from maybe a Haynesville producer at Station 85. If they – if somebody from the Marcellus decides, they want to sell their gas cheaper at 165, then that customer’s going to be able to say, well, I’m going to nominate from Station 165 – at the 165 location instead of 85. Same amount of gas eventually flows to their delivery point. But it’s just a matter of where they source their supply from. So in – so we – it’s just going to be a question of where producers decide to sell their gas set and who wants to compete the most for those supplies. As we build out the system and the demand then matches back up to that supply then the system would be back in balance. And – but that’s the way it always worked. There’s always periods where supply builds up because you have more supply locations, then you have delivery, and then eventually you build out the delivery market like we’re doing in all these projects. And then more supply is needed, which is kind of the situation at Station – sorry, at Zone 5 right now. People got caught short there in the winter because there was not enough supply coming in there. So MVP will provide that needed supply that was missing this last winter.
Neel Mitra: Yes. I think maybe the confusion is whether if all things are static and you didn’t back anything off of Zone 4, how much could you move South on Transco down from Zone 165 with the MVP volumes that are coming in?
Alan Armstrong: Well, it doesn’t have to just move South. It can move North and South. So I think that’s maybe the missing concept there is the gas can – will move wherever the market is, but we certainly have more demand on the system in both directions from 165 than 2 Bcf a day.
Neel Mitra: Got it, got it. Okay. Perfect. Thank you.
Alan Armstrong: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next now to Tristan Richardson of Scotiabank.
Tristan Richardson: Hey, good morning, guys. Just curious your views on the transmission M&A landscape. I mean, it seems like the funnel of assets in the market is really only growing and clearly we’ve seen a lot of transactions clear the past 12 months, even if they’re passive stakes. Have you just seen more opportunities that would potentially be a strategic bid? And then do you see these multiples as attractive in transmission with some of the transactions we’ve seen clear?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Good question, Tristan. I would just say we were really pleased with multiple, we were able to pick up the MountainWest assets pretty seldom that you get assets that are – that well contracted that have that much growth around them, which frankly has been more than we even expected. Pretty rare to see that kind of multiple. I think that the issue there that kind of dampen the market was the concerns over Hart-Scott-Rodino that had been raised earlier in the Berkshire Hathaway and Dominion transaction that involved those assets. And I think that had the market a little bit spooked on that. So maybe that’s why we were able to bridge over that in that case. But yes, so I would say, we’re going to keep looking for those anomalies like that and where we have confidence in our ability to add value to assets. But I think it’s going to be rare circumstances that we see those kind of multiple. There’s usually a reason in this case, I think a lot of the issue was the risk around Hart-Scott-Rodino that it already surfaced itself on those assets earlier.
Tristan Richardson: That’s helpful, Alan. And then maybe just a question on MountainWest, I mean, with the Overthrust Expansion, sounded like that was maybe incremental to your expectations or at least what you saw as the opportunity set for the acquisition at the time of close. Maybe curious kind of is one of potentially other expansions that it could occur. And then maybe if there’s anything on the scale and timing of that project that you didn’t already mention.
Alan Armstrong: Mike, do you want to take that?
Michael Dunn: Yes. Tristan that was not in our pro forma economics for the acquisition. So it’s certainly a pleasant upside there with the MountainWest acquisition. This is about an 11% increase in the Overthrust capacity for the 325,000 dekatherms a day expansion. And it’s a pretty simple expansion. It is two compressors that we’re adding at existing compression facilities on that system, but there’s definitely more upside opportunity there. There seems to be a desire to get more gas Westbound toward the Opal pricing point. That’s been a pretty solid pricing point for a number of years now. And even this summer, we’ve seen gas trading at $4 there at the Opal hub, even higher than that, just driven by California economics with the heat that hits California this summer and gas generation that’s picking up there. So I would expect to see a lot of desire for customers to get to that Opal pricing point. And that certainly bodes well for Overthrust at the direct connection into that hub. And as far as the rest of the MountainWest system, we see a lot of opportunity there for coal to gas switching. There’s a number of very large coal-fired power plants in Wyoming and Utah that do have opportunities for conversion to natural gas. And some of those we’ve already acquired and we’re actually building expansions for off the Overthrust system today in Bridger Units 1 and 2 in Wyoming on the [indiscernible] system are converting to gas. And we’re building a pipeline over to the – that facility this year. So we’ll continue to see opportunities like that on the MountainWest system and those are certainly upside opportunities, not only for us, but gas will be sourced out of the Wamsutter field with our Upstream production and we’re driving that gas to those markets as well with the secret platform.
Tristan Richardson: That’s great. Appreciate it. Thank you, Mike.
Operator: Thank you. We go next now to Gabriel Moreen at Mizuho.
Gabriel Moreen: Hey, good morning, everyone. It looks like you had a lot of E&P hedges since your last update in 1Q. I was just wondering if you can not to beat a dead horse on 2023 guidance, which I know I’m doing, but just what the exposure is at this point on the E&P side, and then also as you think about hedging 2024 for on the E&P side, which what you’re thinking, and maybe in light of also potentially doing some transactions around E&P with the gas curve having creeped up a little bit here.
Alan Armstrong: Yes John, you want to take the first part of that and I’ll take the last?
John Porter: Yes. Absolutely. We have continued to add hedges on the expected Upstream JV production. We generally don’t go too far in hedging. We like to have a comfortable spread between what’s hedged and what’s not hedged, just to account for the potential for any kind of production offset. So there is a fairly significant portion that that remains unhedged. We do provide in our materials all of the current hedges that we have outstanding against the Upstream business and that’s in the appendix.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. And Gabe, I would just add to that, I think in terms of our approach to hedging on the E&P side, we have been putting on some April through October hedges for gas in 2024. And as John said, large – so part of that’s driven by the fact that we don’t really want to get caught short in an up market. I think everybody experienced that a couple of years ago. And so we tend to not get ourselves in a position where we could get caught short on production, particularly since we don’t operate that production. So that’s how we think about hedging on the E&P side there. So – but in terms of the – in the broader scheme of things, in terms of transactions around E&P, I would just say we continue to entertain a lot of interest in that. And I would just say I – as we look at the landscape and the demand that’s building for not just – everybody’s very focused on LNG and we think obviously that’s going to continue to be a big driver for demand, but the macro picture we’re seeing around electrification and the amount of power demand increase that continues to build in this country is pretty impressive. And we’re also seeing a lot of industrial demand pick up in and around our assets as well, and things that were previously powered by either fuel oil or coal or onshoring ammonia production here in the U.S. there’s just a lot of demand building and we have a pretty good insight to that. So it’s kind of seems shortsighted to get in a hurry to sell out particularly at like the Haynesville where the team, the GeoSouthern team has done a great job there and they continue to find ways to lower cost and increase production there. So we think both from their operational capabilities, which we’re enjoying and the macro fundamentals around gas is just not really a compelling reason to liquidate in this environment.
Gabriel Moreen: Thanks, Alan. And then maybe if I can just ask a follow-up on the ERP spend at Transco, and I recognize it’s – Transco’s got an awfully big rate base to it, but as you think about having to file the rate case at Transco and its upcoming, how do you think about ERP spend within that context? Does it matter at all with the rate case coming up as far as accelerating it or refraining from doing that?
Michael Dunn: Hey Gabe, it’s Michael. Yes. We just put in service at Station 180 replacement. We’ve replaced 14 units there with two new state-of-the-art turbines, and we’ve got three more stations that will be very similar fashion coming on before the test period closes on the rate case. And so that’s the anticipated bin curve there, similar to what we did on 180. And its really highly dependent after that on the rate case outcome and whether we get an emissions tracker, which we would certainly hope to achieve on the Transco rate case, similar to what we were able to do on Northwest Pipeline. And that would really drive our decision making in the near-term on spending beyond the 2024, 2025 timeframe. And we layer that into what our next rate case tranche looks like on the Transco system and really try to balance that spending curve where we think those rate cases are going to line out there in the future. But obviously hoping to go into this one with an emissions tracker, modernization type tracker coming out of the negotiated settlement that we hope to achieve with the Transco customers and we’ll see how that turns out.
Gabriel Moreen: Got it. Thanks, Michael.
Operator: We’ll go next now to Neal Dingmann at Truist.
Jake Nivasch: Hi, this is Jake Nivasch on for Neal. Just a quick one on cap allocation. I think you guys might have covered it, but I just want to make sure that I heard it correctly. Just in regards to distribution growth, I mean, you guys are pretty well covered even after that 5% boost this year. Are you looking – and you might have covered this already, but are you looking to accelerate that at some point in the near-term? Or just curious how you guys are thinking about that?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, really good question. I would say that we’ve said all along that we expect this business to generate in the 5% to 7% growth on EBITDA and that we would expect that to keep our dividend somewhat in line with that. And so I think as we think about it forward AFFO per share really is the number I think to keep your eye on that’ll drive our decisions on dividend looking forward. And so I think that’s a really good number for you to focus on. But yes, we certainly have plenty of room, plenty of capacity and in terms of that dividend increase, and it’s just going to be driven by what we’re seeing as a kind of a long-term sustainable AFFO per share is really what’s going to drive our dividend decisions.
Jake Nivasch: Got you. Okay. That’s it for me. Thank you.
Alan Armstrong: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll go next now to Robert Catellier at CIBC Capital Markets.
Robert Catellier: Hi, Rob Catellier, I just wanted to follow-up on capital allocation this time on M&A. So understanding that you’ve been quite active in the last 18 months or so. Can you comment on the company’s appetite for additional acquisitions and maybe on the state of the M&A market understanding that maybe MountainWest was a little unique. So just how the low commodity prices and higher interest rates are impacting bid of spreads?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I would say that that’s not completely clear to us yet. It’s a good question and you would think it would ultimately have some impact, particularly people that are exposed to floating rates that, that, that certainly would drive some transactions. But I would say we haven’t seen great evidence of that occurring just yet. And I would just say we’re going to be like we have been hanging around the hoop looking for things where we have a unique competitive advantage that drives really strong accretion and value to our shareholders. And so far that patience has paid off really well for us. And I don’t see any reason we would change that patience to keep kind of looking for those things that are very unique and that we have a unique competitive advantage on. And so that’s what I would tell you to expect more of, but I’m not sure that, that I yet see the market being flooded or depressed with assets yet from people that might be sitting on floating rate capitalization. So we’re very fortunate where we stand from both a debt capacity and an interest rate standpoint without floating rate exposure. So we’re really excited about where we stand, but there may be some businesses and assets that get a little bit damaged and have to look for transactions to solve their problems, but that’s not evident to us just yet.
Robert Catellier: Okay. That was the color I was looking for. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We do have no further questions this morning. Mr. Armstrong, I’d like to turn things back to you for closing comments.
Alan Armstrong: Okay. Well, thank you all for the great questions this morning. Thank you for your continued interest in the company and we just want to reiterate how excited we are about our continued growth on top of growth here in the business and our abilities to demonstrate our resilience this quarter and we appreciate your confidence in our company. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you again. Ladies and gentlemen, I will conclude The Williams second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. I’d like to thank you all so much for joining us and wish you all a great day. Goodbye.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-04 16:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Williams First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Danilo Juvane, Vice President of Investor Relations and ESG. Please go ahead.
Danilo Juvane: Thanks, Abby and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in The Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon, we have released our earnings press release and the presentation that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong and the Chief Financial Officer, John Porter, will speak to this morning. Also joining us on the call today are Michael Dunn, our Chief Operating Officer; Lane Wilson, our General Counsel; and Chad Zamarin, our Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development. In our presentation materials, you will find a disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to our remarks and you should review it. Also included in the presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to generally accepted accounting principles. And these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today’s presentation materials. So with that, I will turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong: Thanks, Danilo and thank you all for joining us today. Our natural gas-focused strategy continues to deliver steady predictable growth and this past year was no exception – sorry, this past quarter was no exception with our adjusted EBITDA, up nearly 20% compared to the first quarter of ‘22. And let me remind you that last year was a record year for growth as well when we were up 14% on an annual basis, so really a big quarter for us on a tough comp. We saw strong performance across all key financial metrics in the first quarter and set new records in our key operational stats as well, once again demonstrating our businesses’ resiliency through commodity price swings. But beyond this obvious financial performance in the headlines, please don’t miss the importance of the accomplishments in this past quarter that will serve to produce growth in ‘24 and beyond. So let me start out here on Slide 2 by highlighting a few of these accomplishments that will continue to drive what has now been over 10 years of consistent year-over-year EBITDA growth. First, we closed the acquisition of the MountainWest Natural Gas Transmission and Storage business, well ahead of our expectations. This acquisition enhances our position in the Western U.S. and expands our services to key Rockies markets. We are really happy with how the integration of MountainWest and The Williams has been progressing since we closed in February. And in fact, we are already seeing several expansion opportunities that were not in our pro forma, proving this asset is best positioned to be optimized within The Williams platform. Our team also accelerated the timing on key deliverables for several other fixed fee-based projects that are all supported by long-term contracts. This includes our Louisiana Energy Gateway project, Transco’s Southeast Energy Connector and Transco’s Regional Energy Access project. In fact, project execution is now in full swing on both Regional Energy Access and Louisiana Energy Gateway. And as a result of the quick action by the FERC and our construction teams, we now expect to bring approximately half of this regional energy access capacity into service ahead of schedule and actually in the fourth quarter of this year. So, that will be just in time to meet growing demand in the Northeast region ahead of the winter heating season. Of course, this will also provide new market for producers on our Northeast Pennsylvania gathering systems, which of course is incremental to the returns on a project like that. We also executed several key agreements with Chevron to facilitate natural gas production growth in the Haynesville and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. As part of those agreements, we gained a large dedication to our recently acquired Trace gathering system and a long-term capacity commitment on our Louisiana Energy Gateway project. This is a great example of Williams and Chevron working together to connect prolific domestic resources to expanding LNG export markets. We also placed several large-scale gathering expansion into service this quarter. The Marcellus South gathering expansion in Southwest Appalachia increased our capacity by 100 million cubic feet per day from rich gas supplies in this area and significant progress was also made on our build-out of the new and fully contracted capacity on our Susquehanna County gathering system in Northeast PA. We also added 100 million cubic feet per day of capacity this quarter as part of the second phase of our Haynesville Spring Ridge expansion. And we saw first flow for the Taggart expansion project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico across our Devils Tower platform. Importantly, this is the first of five significant expansion projects that are expected to come online over the next 2 years and that will ultimately double our Gulf of Mexico earnings contributions. Finally, I will add that we are moving forward on a number of projects in our backlog and our visibility to growth on the transmission side of the business is as good as we have seen it. From a financial perspective, the strength of our assets across all areas is reflected in our solid first quarter results and in fact, our base business produced record contracted transmission capacity and record gathering volumes even after we exclude the contributions from acquisitions. The one underperforming area was in NGL processing margins, but more about this in a moment. Importantly, this was a quarter in which we saw Sequent fully optimized assets in our base business, underscoring the balance and improved commercial competencies that the Sequent acquisition has delivered for the benefit of our natural gas strategy. So for example, in the Northeast, we benefited from record gathering volumes and significantly outperformed the broader Marcellus production trends as Sequent provided takeaway markets uniquely for our producing customers in Ohio. In the transmission and Gulf of Mexico segment, we realized higher short-term firm sales on our pipes as Sequent helped to commercialize more business in that area as well and now back to the big variance in our processing margins. In the West, our NGL processing margins on the legacy Williams business were actually negative due to abnormally high natural gas prices at Opal and really throughout everything west of Opal. Normally, this would have shown up as a significant negative issue for the quarter. However, Sequent was able to capitalize on these large natural gas basis spreads in the West and more than offset the negative NGL margins turning this volatility into a net positive for Williams. Our acquisitions continue to deliver as expected proving that our capital allocation strategy to fund these transactions with excess Sequent and E&P cash flows is setting us up for continued reliable and predictable earnings growth. I’d also note that as the market continues to underappreciate and undervalue the strength and resilience of our business, we stand ready to utilize our repurchase program as we did during this first quarter. So overall, a great quarter that has us set up for growth in ‘24 and beyond. And with that, John will walk us through the financial metrics for the quarter. John?
John Porter: Thanks, Alan. Starting here on Slide 4 with a summary of our year-over-year financial performance, beginning with adjusted EBITDA, we saw a 19% year-over-year increase. As we will see on the next slide, our adjusted EBITDA growth included growth of over $100 million from our core large-scale natural gas transmission and gathering and processing businesses, including new records for both gathering and contracted transmission capacity. But it also included strong performance from our Sequent gas marketing business, which dramatically overcame a perfect storm of severe winter weather impacts on our Wyoming businesses. Those Wyoming impacts included hits to both upstream and gathering and processing volumes as well as our Southwest Wyoming gas processing margins which were much lower from a surge in January shrink replacement gas price. Our adjusted EPS increased 37% for the quarter, continuing the strong growth we have had in EPS over the last many years. Available funds from operations, AFFO growth was even better than adjusted EBITDA at 22% year-over-year. Also, you see our dividend coverage based on AFFO was a very strong 2.65x on a dividend that grew 5.3% over the prior year. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen with debt to adjusted EBITDA now reaching 3.57x versus last year’s 3.81x. And that’s even after closing the trade, NorTex and MountainWest acquisitions and also repurchasing $83 million of shares since last year. On growth CapEx, you see an increase over first quarter last year primarily reflecting the progress we are making on some of our key growth projects, including Regional Energy Access and Louisiana Energy Gateway. So before we move to the next slide and dig a little deeper into our adjusted EBITDA results for the quarter, we will provide a few updates to our 2023 financial guidance. No change to our consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance of $6.4 billion to $6.8 billion or any of our other consolidated financial performance metrics. Looking further into the year, our core transmission and gathering and processing businesses should see some additional growth from the first quarter level. For transmission in Gulf of Mexico, we will see some ramp from a full quarter of MountainWest Pipeline and some other smaller sequential improvements through the rest of the year that should allow for a strong finish to the year. In the Northeast, we are expecting a modest increase towards the end of the year from the first quarter EBITDA level, primarily from our higher margin liquids-rich systems. Overall though, we are not counting on a lot of additional growth in the Northeast from this $470 million first quarter level, which was up 12% over the prior year. In the West, we are expecting some modest increases through the remainder of the year from the $286 million first quarter level, especially reflecting improvement from some of the challenges we saw in the first quarter, which we will discuss further on the next slide. For the marketing business, we have had a strong overall start to 2023. And importantly, hitting the midpoint of our guidance doesn’t rely on any additional EBITDA from Sequent at this point. With respect to the upstream joint venture EBITDA guidance, it’s been a tough start to our Wyoming operation with the extremely difficult winter weather that significantly impacted producing volume and our drilling plans. So we see this business likely trending towards the lower half of the $230 million to $430 million guidance range. But to be clear, for our consolidated adjusted EBITDA, we are still focused on hitting at least the midpoint of our guidance range at $6.6 billion. We are increasing our growth CapEx by $200 million to reflect the acceleration of our largest Transco project, Regional Energy Access, which we hope to bring into partial service later this year, early partial in-service for regional energy access won’t have a huge impact on 2023 and is really just upside to our hitting the midpoint of our guidance for EBITDA. So, let’s turn to the next slide and take a little closer look at the first quarter results. Again, the first quarter matched our expectations for a very strong start to the year with 19% growth over the prior year. Walking now from last year’s $1.512 billion to this year’s record $1.795 billion, we start with our upstream joint venture operations that are included in our other segment, which were up only $3 million over last year. Our Haynesville upstream EBITDA was up about $32 million as there was really very little production in the first quarter of last year. However, the Haynesville increase was offset by lower Wamsutter results due primarily to the historically difficult winter weather we saw in Wyoming this year. In fact, we estimate overall weather-impacted volumes during the first quarter were probably about 3.5x what we normally expect. And of course that impact flowed through to our Wamsutter gathering and processing assets as well. Shifting now to our core business performance, our transmission in Gulf of Mexico business improved $31 million or 4% due primarily from the partial contribution from the MountainWest Pipeline acquisition, which closed on February 14 and a full quarter from the NorTex acquisition. Our Northeast Gathering and Processing business performed very well with a $52 million or 12% increase driven by $73 million increase in service revenue. This revenue increase was fueled by 7% increase in total volumes in the Northeast focused in our liquids-rich areas, where we tend to have higher per unit margins than our dry gas areas. And in the appendix, you will find a slide that compares our 7% volume growth to the overall basin growth of just under 2%. Shifting now to the West, which increased $26 million or 10%, benefiting from positive hedge results and a full quarter of the Trace acquisition, but the West was significantly unfavorably impacted by the severe Wyoming weather and January processing economics at our Opal Wyoming processing plants. Overall, gas processing margins were $44 million lower this year than last and that was largely a January phenomenon. All in, the West was about 3% short of our plan, although the winter weather impact was much worse than we had planned. And then you see the $165 million increase in our gas and NGL marketing business. And at our Analyst Day, we did point to a strong start to the year for this business due to the economics that we saw around our year end Sequent transportation and storage positions. Ultimately, the $231 million for gas marketing was driven by positive transportation margins across all regions and strong storage margins that benefited from the lower cost or market write-down we discussed in the fourth quarter review. So again, a strong start to 2023 with 19% growth in EBITDA, driven by core infrastructure business performance with strength from our marketing business that dramatically overcame weaker-than-expected results from the upstream joint ventures. And with that, I will turn it back to Alan.
Alan Armstrong: Great. Well, thanks, John. And so, now just a few closing remarks before we turn it over to your questions. First, I will start by reiterating our belief that Williams remains a compelling investment opportunity. We are the most natural gas-centric large-scale midstream company around today and the integrated nature of our business from our best-in-class long-haul pipes to our formidable gathering assets and our value-driving Sequent platform is unique. Our combination of proven resilience, a 5-year EPS CAGR of 23%, coverage that is now approaching 3x on our high growth dividend, a strong balance sheet and high visibility to growth is unique amongst the S&P 500 and unique within our sector. I will add that there is a reason we have stuck with our natural gas-focused strategy for as long as we have. This strategy allowed us to produce a 10-year track record of growing adjusted EBITDA through a large number of commodity and economic cycles and is continuing to deliver significant growth in the current environment, but the signals coming from the market show that it is going to continue to deliver substantial growth for the long-term as well. Natural gas demand continues to build, and the recent low prices actually will drive even more growth in demand over the long-term as the combination of low price, low emissions and energy security is exactly what the world will need more of. U.S. natural gas infrastructure is key to meeting both today’s energy demand as well as projected growth of electrification and renewables build out in the future. Natural gas is the solution for the most complex challenge of our time, producing affordable and reliable energy while meeting our climate goals and the United States is positioned better than any other country on this front. But access to our abundant and low cost natural gas reserves is dependent on having the appropriate infrastructure to move energy when and where it is needed and we are seeing and feeling today the impacts of inadequate infrastructure with consumers bearing the brunt of these actions in the form of high utility bills, unnecessary blackouts and energy-driven inflation. The good news is that we have a solution that is readily available, a solution that will support global emission reductions, keep energy cost affordable and grow our nation’s competitiveness. Enabling this efficient, unobstructed build-out of our nation’s energy infrastructure to ensure delivery of natural gas is foundational to the U.S.’ leadership on greenhouse gas emission reduction and energy security. And we at Williams will proudly continue our efforts to strongly advocate for actionable energy policy solutions and permitting reform in the days and months ahead. So with that, I will open it up for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Reynolds from UBS. Your line is open.
Brian Reynolds: Hi, good morning everyone. John, appreciate the color in the prepared remarks on being able to hit your guidance with the base business without marketing. That said marketing clearly showcased a really strong results for the quarter. And while I know the segment is volatile. I was curious if you guys could provide perhaps an updated view on maybe an annualized EBITDA run-rate for the marketing segment, just given the recent acquisitions of NorTex and MountainWest? Thanks.
John Porter: Yes. Thanks, Brian. We certainly have seen that since we bought Sequent back in about 18 months ago or coming up on 2 years ago, Sequent has a great ability to capitalize on natural gas price volatility, but also doing that using a low-risk business model. I would say though that we are really not ready to take the $50 million to $70 million long-term run rate that we have talked about before up at this point. Some of these positions that they utilize are more short-term in nature, especially the storage positions. And again, we would emphasize that a big reason they have been able to do as well as they have has just been the historically high natural gas price volatility, especially what we saw last year through the summer months and also in the fourth quarter. So those are a couple of reasons that we would like to stick with the $50 million to $70 million long-term run-rate. However, as I mentioned in my commentary, I forecast – our current forecast does show that we do not need any additional EBITDA from Sequent this year to make the midpoint of our guidance. And as I also mentioned, the favorable results really did show in the first quarter how Sequent was able to counter the unfavorable results we saw in our gas processing margins and some of the other things that we saw in the Upstream and Wamsutter gathering and processing EBITDA.
Brian Reynolds: Great. Thanks. Appreciate all that. Maybe just a follow-up on the nat gas macro, Williams has highlighted that I can continue to show base business growth in a low nat gas environment. So kind of I was wondering if you could perhaps discuss two sides of the coin. One, how low nat gas prices are supporting increased demand for transmission projects in that 2025 plus timeframe? And then second, near-term, how could low nat gas prices kind of impact some volumetric headwinds on the G&P side of the business over the next, call it, next 6 to 12 months? Thanks.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Thanks, Brian. This is Alan. First of all, I think what we are seeing already, April numbers came out on power generation and power generation was already up about 2 Bcf a day on a previous 27 Bcf a day load for April of ‘22. So we are already seeing some pretty good pool based on price on natural gas in the power generation space. And I think we will continue if prices stay low like they are, I think we will continue to see that through the summer on the full side. So that’s a good thing for us just because obviously, the capacity demand will be important for us. I think on the – in terms of that impact on the G&P business, I think we’re certainly paying close attention to that. Many of our big producers are hedged out pretty well, and we’re seeing people continuing to produce through that. So don’t expect – we’re certainly not expecting growth on average across the space, to be clear, but we’re pretty fortunate to be in some of the lower-cost basins and with producers that have been managing this pretty well. One of the areas that we’re really seeing continued growth is in the rich gas and some of the condensate areas in the Marcellus and the Utica areas, and so we’re fortunate to be pretty well exposed to that area as well. So I would just say, as always, we have such a wide variety of exposure across so many different basins that will whatever the demand pool is on natural gas, our volumes will reflect that and really excited this quarter to see our Sequent team, it’s been a strategy of ours for our Sequent team to go out and provide market and preferentially to our gathering customers in places like the Marcellus because obviously, there is value for our gas moving over the top of other gas in the basin. And so certainly, our Sequent team has shown their ability in that area and we’re excited to see that. So I would just say we’re – I’d say on the macro side, it certainly see an oversupply situation. Supply grew almost 6 Bcf in first quarter of 23% versus first quarter of 22%. So supply side is certainly continuing to grow a lot faster than demand and obviously that means lower prices. But I do think we will see a pretty big response from power generation this summer as we’re already seeing here – as we already saw in April.
Brian Reynolds: Great. Appreciate all the color. I will leave it there. Thanks. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.
Alan Armstrong: Good morning, Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet: Just wanted to kind of switch to natural gas and exports, LNG, if I could. Just wondering your wellhead to export strategy at this point. So the Sempra HOA and just wondering if you could expand a bit there. I guess, what your vision is for that dynamic? And how big could that be over time?
Chad Zamarin: Yes. Thanks, Jeremy. This is Chad Zamarin. We continue to advance our wellhead water strategy since our Analyst Day update. And I’ll start by saying you referenced the Sempra HOA. I mean we think very highly of the Sempra team and have continued to engage with Sempra following the non-binding HOA we announced last year. But we’ve also been evaluating a number of competing opportunities as well. We’ve been spending a lot of time with our producer customers as well as with international LNG buyers, and we’re seeing really positive strong interest in both producers wanting access to international prices and international LNG buyers wanting access to domestic producers so they can buy LNG from U.S. supplies at international prices. And so we think we provide a unique solution. We haven’t finalize the definitive agreement yet, but we continue to build confidence around our ability to add LNG as an extension of our natural gas value chain in a way it will provide for fixed margins for Williams while shifting that international price exposure to producers and LNG buyers. And so I would just say that we continue to prove up the strategy. We feel really good and feel like we’re making great positive strides. And I think we’d expect to finalize a definitive arrangement with Sempra or with an alternative LNG partner sometime here in the near-term 2023.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That’s helpful there. Thanks. And I just wanted to kind of shift to REA in the partial and service this winter. Just wondering how you think about timing there? Maybe it’s not much of a 23% EBITDA contribution, but any thoughts and really, I also want to see on the Northeast G&P, does that kind of unlock growth there? Or do you think producers might be timing production with when that comes online and just wondering how much EBITDA uplift could you see in the Northeast GMP associated with REA unlocking incremental capacity there?
Michael Dunn: Hey, good morning, Jeremy, this is Michael. Yes, I would just, first of all, I want to thank our project execution team for doing a tremendous job being prepared to start construction on that project. It’s a challenging permitting environment, especially in the Northeast right now, and the team designed this project so that it could be permitted and we really got through that process fairly quickly there. Ultimately, and the team was certainly prepared to the tree-clearing window that was closing very rapidly post FERC certificate issuance and really pleased that we got that tree-clearing done early, and we’ve actually fully mobilized contractors for the pipeline loop installations. So we do expect a partial in service by the fourth quarter of 2023. So there will be a contribution to 2023 EBITDA. We’re not predicting the actual in-service date of that yet, but it will be before year-end. And I do think that will translate to some opportunities in the gathering business as well upstream. The producers have been awaiting this additional capacity to be unlocked in the Northeast. And we are certainly pocketing those producer customers up there to be anticipating when this project will come online. But I do think it will provide additional value in ‘24 as well, and I think that’s really where we’re going to see the additional uplift on the gathering business, certainly not only on the Transco side. Really pleased with how it’s gone so far, and we will keep you updated as we progress with the construction through the summer.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That’s helpful. I will leave it there. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Marc Solecitto from Barclays. Your line is open.
Marc Solecitto: Hi, good morning. Could you maybe help us unpack the weather impacts that affected the West segment during the quarter, particularly on the volume and cost side and maybe the underlying trajectory of that business through the course of the year?
John Porter: Yes, Marc, I’ll take that on. Michael can add any color. I think break it down into a couple of different areas. One, we’ve talked quite a bit about the impact of the NGL margins, which is pretty clear. If you look at the analyst package on the appendix to the press release, NGL margins were $44 million lower year-over-year. So that’s a pretty good go by in terms of the impact there. Almost all of that decrease in NGL margins happened at the Opal processing plant and almost all of that was related to the historically high shrink cost that we had in January of this year where natural gas prices were in the $50 a dekatherm range. And since then, we’ve seen that come way back down into something much more normal like $2.50. As far as the rest of the impact, if you kind of look at the sum of what happened in the upstream JV part of the business at Wamsutter plus the Wamsutter gathering and processing impact. Some of those two were about $70 million lower than our planned expectations for the first quarter. So again, between those two, about a $70 million impact, yes, we saw – I think one of the things we looked at said that we saw probably about 12 Bcf of impacted volumes for the whole first quarter, whereas in a normal year, that might be a little bit more than 3 Bcf. So just very historic conditions out there and the recovery is ongoing. It’s – now we’ve transitioned to high rivers and muddy roads but the recovery is happening and volumes are being restored and margins are returning to a more normalized level. So expect quite a bit of improvement there when we get to the second quarter versus what we saw in the first quarter.
Marc Solecitto: Got it. That was very helpful. And in terms of the domestic demand outlook in the medium to longer-term, there is obviously a lot of focus on the incremental LNG export capacity expected to come online over the next few years. But also curious to get your take on domestic industrial demand outlook in the U.S. with potential onshore and just given everything going on geopolitically?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Thanks for that good question. I think really, if you break that down, the areas that are going to be driven. Obviously, anything that is heavy gas use is coming home. If we’re going to be – we are the major exporter and will be the growing larger exporter. It means we’ve got the lowest price natural gas around the world likely, and that will bring the industry here, like fertilizer business, obviously, is a big piece that been picking up pretty significantly from that, but a lot of other industries that are heavy natural gas users will continue to be domiciled here in the U.S. So that, I think, is fairly certain. I think in terms of how much that is, it will probably be pretty small in comparison to the LNG growth that we’re seeing. And it’s pretty impressive right now to look at the amount of NGL growth I think right now, there is about 23 Bcf of new expected on by 2032. And that’s up against a ‘22 number of about 10.9 Bcf a day. So, a lot of growth coming in that space. The other area, as I mentioned earlier, obviously, the power generation sector and for us, that’s kind of got two facets to it that I think sometimes the market misunderstands for us. First of all, certainly, when low gas prices are there, we will see that take out a lot of the baseload coal business that’s out there today. We’re already seeing that here in the shoulder, but we will certainly see it this summer. But in addition to that, from a Williams perspective, we sell the capacity. And so as you see more and more electrification occurring, it’s very clear that the utilities are going to be left with really no other alternative in gas-fired generation as a backup for that, and we are certainly seeing that in our discussions with our customers and a demand for that incremental capacity that’s available that we can uniquely provide into some of those markets. And so that demand for capacity as opposed to volume is a really key thing to note from a Williams perspective because we’re not all that concerned about the annual average demand for natural gas as much as we are the capacity that has to be provided to back up renewables. And as you study electrification, that is really going to fall to the benefit of natural gas-fired generation and particularly to the infrastructure, both on the transmission and the storage side that can support that. And obviously, we continue with our MountainWest acquisition and with our expansions on the Transco system, our conversion of Washington storage and our purchase of NorTex storage last year. We are all about being in a position to serve that business and serve it well.
Marc Solecitto: Got it. That’s very helpful. Appreciate the time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Praneeth Satish from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Praneeth Satish: Thanks. Good morning. Just maybe a follow-up on Sequent, do you think at this point, Sequent is basically like a hedge against worsening gas prices? In other words, do you think Sequent could generate higher results if gas prices go lower and therefore, kind of offset some of the exposure you have to gas price on the E&P and G&P side?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Well, I would just say where there is volatility, that’s where Sequent going to perform well and where there is basis dislocation that’s where they are going to perform because effectively, what we’re really monetizing with Sequent is we’re monetizing storage. So price movement from one period from a time-based period obviously drives value for us. as well as dislocation and basis differentials when we own the transportation between those locations. That’s really what drives value for Sequent. And so I would say that it’s pretty hard to forecast a period where we don’t see quite a bit of volatility in price as we’ve got a big growing demand for LNG looming on the horizon and people not being exactly certain when that’s going to be available. And certainly, the value of storage to serve those loads and to serve quick swing loads for renewables is definitely on the horizon. And I think we will continue to cause volatility both from a time spread and both from a basis spread perspective. And so we’re pretty excited about the way that Sequent will perform in that. But what it wouldn’t protect from is if we were sitting here with a completely flat curve at both prices far out in the future, that’s the environment that it wouldn’t provide us any protection and to be clear. But as long as we’ve got basis spread and we’ve got time spread and value there, that’s where the Sequent team is going to perform well.
Praneeth Satish: Got it. And I was just wondering if you could comment on your JV with GeoSouthern and the outlook for production there with gas prices at these levels. I guess the futures curve is still pretty good. So is there still an intent to increase production to, I think it was a goal of 800 million cubic feet per day by 2025 or could the pace kind of moderate a bit until prices recover?
Chad Zamarin: Thanks. This is Chad. As of right now, that team is continuing to perform and performed exceptionally well. We’ve got great partnership with GeoSouthern. And right now, they are holding production based on the available midstream capacity. And as Alan mentioned, as you noted, the forward curve is constructive, so they intend to kind of keep that development pace going and we’re looking at kind of the gas macro coming into late ‘24, early ‘25 and seeing demand pick up. So I think there is a desire to want to be ready to make sure the volumes are there as the market continues to balance towards more demand. And so our expectation is that they’ll continue to keep pace with the midstream capacity. They work very closely. Again, the Sequent story, I mean we are working really hard to make sure they find good markets. And so we think also with the Louisiana Energy Gateway project and our ability to get the GeoSouthern volumes connected to really good markets that they’ll continue that growth that we’ve laid out.
Praneeth Satish: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gabe Moreen from Mizuho. Your line is open.
Gabe Moreen: Hi, good morning, everyone. Can I ask on a quick question on the share repurchases for the quarter? John, it looks like you beat the average price for the quarter quite nicely in the buybacks. Should we think about this still is pretty opportunistic and then the $75 billion figure is that about your bogey for what you think you can handle quarter in, quarter out at this point?
John Porter: Thanks for the question, Gabe. Obviously, financial performance continues to be really strong for the company, and the balance sheet is in great shape. Regarding the buybacks, really no change to the returns-based approach that we’re taking on the share repurchases, very similar to what we discussed at Analyst Day, we’re really looking at all of our investment opportunities that we have in the company and seeing that our lowest expected returns on capital investment in the business are really associated with our regulated rate base investments, principally through our emissions reduction program, which we’ve talked about being at that 11%, 12% return range. Obviously, this year, since the beginning of the year, we’ve seen a pretty sharp decline in our valuation as natural gas prices dropped. And we saw our dividend yield expand to 6%, even while we continue to have a lot of confidence in our long-term 5% to 7% growth rate. So that looked like a pretty attractive investment opportunity relative to all of our options. So we took action to utilize some of that financial flexibility for share repurchase. And I think going forward, it will be a similar approach. We will just monitor conditions and weigh that investment opportunity up against the other investment opportunities that we have.
Alan Armstrong: Yes, Gabe, this is Alan. The only thing I would add to that is we are not capped at $75 million kind of number in that there. So that just happened to be how much we could buy at the price targets that we had set based on our dividend yield and our expected growth up against our rate base returns, as we mentioned.
Gabe Moreen: Got it. Thanks, Alan. Thanks, John. And maybe I could just ask a two-parter on growth projects. One is on the MountainWest opportunities that I think you alluded to, to the extent you can describe maybe some of those that are coming to fruition? And then second is low gas prices at all impacting, discussions with potential leg customers on that expansion or new projects?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, sure. First of all, I’d say on regional energy access. Obviously, there is a big spread between the eastern end of the MountainWest and the Opal basis. And so obviously, that drives need for any kind of expansion that can be built there. And that has certainly shown up in – as we’ve gone out to the market. testing for support on that. So we’re really excited about that and more to come in pretty short order on that particular front. In addition to that, though, there is things like in the Uinta, particularly in the [indiscernible] area over there. A lot – that area is kind of getting cap right now based on lack of gas takeaway capacity out of the area. And so some opportunities on that front. And then as well some pretty significant conversions from coal to gas on some of the big western coal plants out there. And so we will be – we’re extremely well positioned to capture those expansions as well. So I would say we were pretty conservative in our approach to that acquisition and really thrilled with the work that, that team has been doing in terms of identifying opportunities and I think Williams strategy that we bring to those efforts will maximize the value of those opportunities in and around our assets there. So that’s what I have to offer on that. And Mike, why don’t you take the Louisiana Energy Gateway question [indiscernible]?
Michael Dunn: Yes. The LEG project in regard to the opportunity there, I think we still see an opportunity to have that project online later this fall. We are in the permitting process for the project today. And I don’t see any obstacles to being able to achieve in service that as we have expected to come online in the 2024 timeframe. Right away acquisitions occurring there as well, and we are seeing a lot of expectations there with our producer customers and bring that online and those are take-or-pay type contracts. And so very comfortable with where we are sitting today on that project.
Gabe Moreen: Thanks everyone.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann from Truist Securities. Your line is open.
Jake Nivasch: Hi. This is Jake Nivasch on for Neal. Thanks for the question. Just a question on your G&P fee-based contracts, given where commodity prices are today, I just wanted to get a sense of what those contracts are looking like. Have – are the contracts at a fee floor, and if so, any way to quantify that? Thank you.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. So, was that on our gathering contracts?
Jake Nivasch: Yes. I am sorry, on the G&P. Yes, correct.
Michael Dunn: Yes. So, we have a number of contracts that do have exposure to natural gas pricing. We have talked about those in the past, where some of those have direct NYMEX exposure like in the Barnett, some like more about midstream at the floor underneath those. And then we have some of the Haynesville wells that have exposure as natural gas prices ratchet up, where we have peers that we haven’t publicly stated what they are. But as natural gas prices do escalate, we have an opportunity to increase our fees on those gathering rates. So, I would say, for the most part, we are very comfortable with where we stand in regard to our guidance this year and the expectation for what those triggers are in regard to our gathering rates. And I will just also remind you that we do have a lot of fee escalation in those based on inflation in disease. And so many of those have kicked in over the last several years as well. And our team has done a really good job controlling our costs, and we feel really good about where those escalators are in relation to our cost escalation being able to cover those – any cost increases that we see. And a lot of those cost increases that we are seeing are in power generation, for example, and a lot of those are pass-throughs to our customers as well. So, we don’t have exposure to that. But all-in-all, we are very comfortable with where our G&P rates are today in regard to the low natural gas prices.
Alan Armstrong: And I would just add to that, many of the structures for these expansions that we are doing, and you heard me mention several expansions in our – in my prepared remarks. And those expansions tend to be backed by either MDCs, which are pretty simple, obviously, or they are backed by rate increases on the base volumes. And therefore, we are not all that exposed to the volume increases as much in terms of recovering the capital for our expansion. So, the majority of those contracts are set up that way for the expansions that I referenced.
Jake Nivasch: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Joe from Scotiabank. Your line is open.
Tristan Richardson: Hey guys. This is Tristan with Scotiabank. Can you hear me okay?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Thanks. Thanks Tristan.
Tristan Richardson: Appreciate it. Appreciate your comments, Alan, on Gulf of Mexico and bringing Taggart online, but maybe kind of curious just a general update on the progress of sort of the big five coming online in ‘24, just general progress and an update there would be great.
Alan Armstrong: Mike, do you want to take that?
Michael Dunn: Yes, sure, I will take that. No real change from what you have seen in our published materials in regarding our projects. We have made really good progress on the Whale projects, in the Western Gulf of Mexico, we have the offshore pipeline that was installed last fall, and we just recently installed the deck modifications on the platform that brings the gas and oil to shore there, and that was just done last week. So, that work is progressing with an outage there as we speak. And all-in-all, we feel very good about that work. The Markham processing plant modifications are underway as well. So, we will be well in front of when the producers are expected to come online in 2024 for that project. The Shenandoah project in our Discovery system is also going very well. A lot of the offshore work by the producers is underway. And our onshore work has been fully permitted and that we are working under the construction projects also. And so nothing has changed on the timing of those. We hope that producers will accelerate those, and we will be ready for that if they choose to do so. It’s really up to their schedules right now as to when they bring those online. But like for the Whale project, they have wanted us done well in advance of their offshore activities. And so we are prepared to go early if they choose to do so. And that’s where we stand today on those. But really good progress on the non-CapEx tie-backs and the opportunities that we have had out there also.
Alan Armstrong: And we also – Tristan, as you know on the Chevron Ballymore project, we finalized contracts with the producers on vale more this quarter as well. Of course, that doesn’t require you need capital on our part, but a significant accomplishment to finalize that deal, particularly with the other producer working interest producer on that platform. So, things have gone – as Michael said, things have gone very well out there and great to have the primary risk for us was that offshore installation on well, and the majority of that risk has been put behind us, so really great work by the team. It’s nice and the team is doing such a great job that you don’t hear anything mentioned by it because things have been going so smoothly on that front.
Tristan Richardson: Okay. Thanks Alan. And then maybe just on LEG. I appreciate the updates there. But maybe curious on how things are progressing on the carbon side of that project. Do we need to be in sort of a primacy in Class 6 world for that component of LEG to go forward, or maybe just an update on what you are seeing on that?
Chad Zamarin: Yes, sure. Thanks. This is Chad again. That’s also progressing well alongside the gathering project. And what we see today is an interest in the ability to move CO2 along that pipe and then remove the CO2 and sequester it. It is not dependent upon primacy. I mean we are prepared to work likely with third-parties for the sequestration, but the timing of the project, we think can work full based on kind of the existing permitting process, but also I think primacy just makes things that much more efficient in Louisiana. I think there has been some recent progress in Louisiana that looks like primacy is likely to be near-term. But we don’t think the project is dependent upon achieving that. And right now, the project is on track and looking positive.
Tristan Richardson: Great. Thanks Chad. Appreciate it guys. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis from Citi. Your line is open.
Spiro Dounis: Thanks operator. Good morning team. First question, going to upstream actually, it sounds like not an urgent need to monetize those assets, of course. But as I recall, you have been pretty close to an asset sales in the last year. So, just curious where does that process sit right now? And is that forward curve strong enough to maybe incent some buyers to come in here at attractive levels for you?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Spiro, I would just say, no, obviously, we haven’t kept that any secret that we are interested in monetizing those. I would say, certainly Haynesville because it’s proven up its capabilities here in short order with great work by the Southern team there of developing that acreage so fast. But really the way that deal is structured, our capital has been required has fallen off dramatically on that as that reversion continues out there on those interests. And so I would just say that the – we have been pretty clear with the market that if somebody wants to put an attractive offer on the table, we are very interested in those discussions, and we certainly have been and we will continue to entertain offers on that. But we are not in a passive sell mode. And so we are not going to sell at the bottom of the market. On the Wamsutter piece, obviously, we have got a lot more development out there to prove up to really, I think get the volumes where we need that to be for the benefit of our midstream business. So, I would still say there is still some execution to be done on the Wamsutter development out there and again, the right party came along that could convince us that they could develop that aggressively and that would be great. But I think there is probably better value right now and improving up the opportunity out there and getting the volumes up for the benefit of all of our downstream business. If you realize, if you think about how much margin we make off the Wamsutter area that is clearly our highest unit margin area for us because not only do we obviously have interest in the production, but we also have the condensate gathering. We have the gas gathering. We have the gas processing. We have the NGL takeaway. We are soon that likely have the gas take away via the MountainWest acquisition. So, a lot of coupons to clip off of the production out there that makes that a very valuable area for us to get developed, and we want to make sure that, that occurs. So anyway, that’s the way we are thinking about it for sale signs out I would say, but we are not selling that at the bottom of the market.
Spiro Dounis: Got it. That’s helpful color. Thanks for that Alan. Second one, just wanted to come back to the guidance quickly for a second. I think back at the Investor Day, you have mentioned that the guidance contemplated a producer slowdown just given where you saw the natural gas price at the time and it looks like, to some degree, that’s been proving out. We have seen a handful of announcements now on some slowing of activity, I guess I am just curious, compared to what you were thinking in February, how does that kind of track to your expectations?
John Porter: Yes. I can take that, Spiro and others can chime in. But I think as we went into Analyst Day, establishing our guidance, we went in with a pretty sober outlook for the year and embedded some pretty conservative estimates for what we thought would be happening with our producer customers. Since then, we have ran another bottoms-up forecast and continue to feel good about the guidance.
Spiro Dounis: Perfect. Helpful color guys. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sunil Sibal from Seaport Global. Your line is open.
Sunil Sibal: Yes. Hi. Good morning everybody. So, my first question was related to some recent comments from the administration, especially with regard to gas infrastructure. I was just curious, is that something that you also picked up on based on your discussions with the administration. And then is there a specific opportunity for Williams to capitalize on that note?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. No, great point, and we were thrilled to see Secretary Granholm’s letter in support of Mountain Valley Pipeline and recognizing the critical role that natural gas plays and particularly the more we want to electrify and the faster we go at electrification, more dependent we are going to be on natural gas to help support that. And so I was really pleased to see Secretary Granholm’s acknowledgment of that. I will tell you, we certainly have been close to that, but the credit, I think there is due to a few things. One, the utility industry has become pretty clear in this last quarter that to try to deliver on electrification and the inflation reduction at goals that we are going to have to have more natural gas capacity to help support that and help support backup of electrification. So, the utility industry and a lot of the utility leadership, Lynn Good as I think a prime example from Duke have been pretty clear about the importance of natural gas. And I think their messages have hit the mark with the administration on that front. But as well, I would tell you that, folks like Senator Manchin, who certainly understands energy very well, has been very vocal about the need for getting the permitting reform done as well. And so there are a lot of people that are starting to kind of move beyond what is just politically correct and what is popular to say and getting down to the cold hard facts of physics and science and realizing that we are going to have natural gas to be able to carry out our goals around emission reduction and support aggressive electrification of our grid. So, we are really thrilled to see that. I am glad you picked up on that as well. And I think that bodes very well for the natural gas industry here domestically and abroad.
Sunil Sibal: Got it. And then on the LNG marketing strategy, so we will kind of stay tuned to updates coming up on that. But I was just curious, is that marketing strategy more driven by supply push currently, or is it more of a demand pull in the international markets?
Chad Zamarin: Yes. Thanks. This is Chad. I would say it’s both. I mean one of the things that we offer and that’s unique today, if an international LNG buyer wants to buy U.S. LNG and if you think about we are the low-cost, most reliable producer of natural gas in the world. And there is a great interest in sourcing gas supplies in the United States, but the international buyer has to primarily buy LNG at domestic Henry Hub prices, indexed prices. And we have producers that we are connected to that are interested in selling a portion of their production into international markets and gain exposure to international prices. So, what we are offering is the ability for international LNG buyers that buy U.S. supplied natural gas, but to be able to buy that at an international price because our producers are interested in gaining access to international prices. So, we can be a unique bridge between domestic producers and international buyers for a product that really isn’t available broadly today because the international buyer has to buy U.S. gas at a Henry Hub index. And so that’s why we are seeing, I think really strong interest from both domestic producers that do want to gain exposure to additional markets and additional price opportunities, but also international buyers that would like to source U.S. supplies, but do so in a more native price index that they could buy again. So, it’s really a combination of both.
Michael Dunn: Yes. If I could add to that, this is Michael. The opportunities that we are looking at also involve some pretty significant FERC regulated fee-based pipeline opportunities for the infrastructure to be built there well beyond what we are thinking about with the LEG project. So, we are certainly looking at the opportunities to build FERC regulated transmission projects associated with this wellhead water strategy.
Sunil Sibal: Got it. And just one clarification on that, I think in the past, duration of contracts between – the duration of contracts at the international parties were looking for and what the domestic parties were looking for, there was a bit of a mismatch in that. And based on the recent discussions, do you think there is – those two are kind of closer to where they were say, a few months back?
Chad Zamarin: Yes. I would say that we are not going to take large open mismatch positions. There may be some modest mismatch across the portfolio of LNG transactions. But our goal is going to be to not have a lot of speculative open positions, again kind of offer a unique product to the market and our goal would be to, for the most part, de-risk the term of those commitments. And if we do take any lesser term on a commitment to make sure that the margin that we are capturing is more than adequate to support that. But for the most part, we are targeting significant coverage and matching of the terms across the portfolio.
Sunil Sibal: Got it. Thanks for all the color.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Jean Ann Salisbury from Bernstein. Your line is open.
Jean Ann Salisbury: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just have one. You have several Mid-Atlantic demand pull projects, Commonwealth Energy connector, sell-side reliability enhancement in Carolina MarketLink. Do these also create more capacity out of Transco 165 than exists today if MVP starts up, or are those kind of low CapEx, high return opportunities that you have referenced in the past, like completely, like they are not even on the board yet?
Michael Dunn: Yes. Jean Ann, this is Michael. I would say those are more of the latter right now. These are fairly low CapEx compression with some small lubing opportunities with really healthy returns on those projects. Anything that would be associated with NBP completion would be a much more substantial capital-intensive project opportunity that we are certainly looking at with customers. But at this time, we haven’t announced anything in that regard. But there definitely are opportunities that NBP is successful and the takeaway from Transco will ultimately be built.
Alan Armstrong: Jean Ann, this is Alan. I would just add, I think that Michael hit that nail on the head. But we do have decision to make around NBP, because obviously, NBP is critical and that gas that would come in there is going to be searching for new market and we have got decisions to make on how to really optimize that southbound capacity if NBP gets built. If it doesn’t get built, then we have got some decisions to make around expanding southbound capacity from the Pennsylvania area on Transco along the mainline in terms of brownfield expansion along the mainline as well. So, those – that’s really what we are kind of waiting to see is how big those projects might be and it’s somewhat dependent on whether or not NBP gets built. Certainly, we think it should get finished, but it’s just getting harder and harder to predict that given the time it passed. So anyway, we are standing ready with alternatives there, but NBP, I think it is the right sensible solution for our nation, and hopefully, we see that completed.
Jean Ann Salisbury: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Alan Armstrong, President and Chief Executive Officer, I will turn the call back over to you.
Alan Armstrong: Great. Thank you. Well, we are really as a team, I tell you, we are really excited to deliver the quarter that we just delivered, particularly within commodity cycle that we are in and really excited about how we are set up for the future and some of the great accomplishments that team delivered this quarter as well. So, we look forward to rewarding our shareholders with more growth in the future and are very well positioned for that. So, thank you for joining us today and look forward to talking to you in the future.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-11-01 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Williams Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Danilo Juvane, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Danilo Juvane: Thanks, Gina, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in The Williams Company. Yesterday afternoon, we released our earnings press release and the presentation that are President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and our Chief Financial Officer, John Porter, will speak to you this morning. Also joining us on the call today are Micheal Dunn, our Chief Operating Officer; Lane Wilson, our General Counsel; and Chad Zamarin, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development. In our presentation materials, you'll find a disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to generally accepted accounting, and these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong: Great. Thanks, Danilo, and thank you all for joining us today. Williams reported another great quarter, and John will walk through the details in a moment, but the punchline is that Williams delivered exceptional results in the third quarter with adjusted EBITDA up 15% compared to the same period last year, driven by strong performance across all of our core businesses and our JV upstream operations. Our natural gas strategy has proven that it can capture upside margins and weather commodity price cycles as we work to serve growing demand for clean, secure and affordable energy. These results really speak to the strength of our assets and our long-term approaches business. Williams is the most natural gas-centric large-scale midstream company around today, and there's a reason we've stuck with our natural gas-focused strategy for as long as we have. Not only is this strategy delivering in the current environment, but the signals coming from the market show that it is going to continue to deliver substantial growth for the long term as well. We expect strong fundamentals to drive attractive growth opportunities for Williams, including higher demand for U.S. LNG exports and a faster pace of coal to gas conversion with the lion's share of these projects residing along the Transco corridor. Natural gas demand across various sectors continues to increase in the face of higher natural gas prices. This speaks to the continued inelastic demand for natural gas, both here and abroad and the fact that domestic natural gas remains a bargain versus alternative fuels. We continue to see strong growth in the quarter as our quarterly natural gas gathering volumes and our contracted transmission capacity. And we're seeing progress on important projects like our Regional Energy Access project, the Louisiana Energy Gateway and other Transco projects that are currently in execution. And speaking of execution, our attractive high-return growth backlog in the Gulf of Mexico remains intact, with the six previously announced deepwater projects set to increase EBITDA by over $300 million beginning in '25. And we recently began pipelay operations on the well projects here just recently. Our business continues to fire on all cylinders, driving our financial strength and stability. And despite the current inflationary environment, we will actually see a lift in margins as many of our contracts allow for adjustments that exceed the impact of expenses. For instance, in our G&P business, our contracts are built with inflation escalators that bolster our margins in the current environment. And within our transmission business, we are able to recover cost via rate cases, which minimizes the impacts of inflation over time. I'll note that Northwest Pipeline recently reached a settlement on its rate case, and we remain on track to follow a Transco rate case in '24. The benefits of our long-term approach to business also extends to the current interest rate environment and in fact, all of our debt is fixed rate. John is going to provide some more detail on this in his section. -- but we are extremely well positioned in this current environment. Also worth noting, our business is well positioned for a recessionary environment. Recall that in 2020, Williams faced a host challenges, including rapidly declining commodity prices, major producer customer bankruptcies and impactful hurricanes in our Gulf of Mexico business. In the face of these challenges, the company still exceeded the mid of the guidance we set well before COVID raised its ugly head. Our business today remains positioned to thrive even in the face of potential recession.  In fact, we announced that we expect to be near the high end of our previously raised guidance putting us on track to achieve four-year earnings per share CAGR of 22% and an EBITDA CAGR of 8%. This, again, underscores just how well our natural gas strategy is translating into solid financial results for our shareholders. And while we will not be providing our '23 guidance until the next quarterly call, there are some drivers that you should think about for '23. So let me go through those here. First of all, in the Northeast G&P business, we expect higher volume growth and higher cash flows from expansion projects that are currently underway, and many of those are nearing completion. And we do provide some details of those in the appendix. In the West G&P segment, we expect continued contributions from the large number of Haynesville expansion projects that are nearing completion and as well the Trace Midstream acquisition. But equally important are the expected contributions from our upstream JVs, which should provide incremental volume grew growth in both the Haynesville and in the Wamsutter area, proving that our strategy to fill up weight and midstream capacity is working. We expect modest growth in other basins as well, for instance, in the Eagle Ford, which has been under the radar recently. We also see a very bright spot here next year as we expect increased activity in the rich gas part of the basin to drive volumes well above the minimum volume commitment level for this segment of the business, which will be the welcome rebound and extend our earnings above that MVC level. The Eagle work should represent upside longer term as well as new capital will likely be deployed to further develop both the acreage that is already dedicated and some undedicated acreage that we are well positioned to serve. In the Transmission & Gulf of Mexico business, the growth drivers here include the incremental earnings from our recent production that has been connected along our existing deepwater assets. So this is new production that's been recently connected and it'll start to show up here in the fourth quarter, it does not include those projects that will start coming on towards the end of 2024. The NorTex acquisition is also will be included in our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico business, and the continued expansion of our fee-based services on our interstate gas pipeline systems that continue to grow. Within our upstream JVs, volume growth will remain the story in the Haynesville, we've stated that we expect an ownership reversion in the first half of '23, where Williams will own 25% of the PUDs, but we will retain a 75% interest in the PDPs. I want to be clear about this. Our interest in the existing flowing production does not get reduced, only our interest in the undeveloped acreage will be reduced. We designed this structure to minimize significant volatility in earnings. And to this end, we expect the Haynesville to remain a source of growth. In the Wamsutter where we have a much larger acreage footprint, our JV is just now beginning to complete wells from the 2022 drilling program, and these will begin to contribute this volume growth next year. And this, we believe, is going to prove up the benefits of the contiguous acreage in this basin, and we're excited about the Crowheart operations out there and what we're seeing from those recent drilling and completion operations. Our primary goal of getting the volumes and cash flows up on these late and midstream assets will be more than met. But the icing on the cake has been the higher-than-expected pricing for these producing reserves. Over the longer term, we see a steady increase in net cash flows as the drilling capital obligations revert more and more to the JV operator and the benefits of the growing volumes build our midstream cash flows. Ultimately, we expect to find a long-term owner for these upstream properties that we can rely on to further grow production, which will translate into even higher midstream cash -- free cash flows for Williams. Looking beyond 2023, we believe that our projects are supportive of a 5% to 7% long-term EBITDA CAGR. The annual growth rate may fluctuate a bit given the timing of new large projects like Regional Energy Access and our big deepwater projects coming on at the end of '24 and into '25, but the bottom line is that we see a clear trajectory to continued earnings growth based on the opportunity set of our footprint today.  Finally, as we think about value chain integration, we are further advancing our integrated clean energy value chain strategy. Our acquisition of the NorTex storage facility and last week's approval from the FERC for Transco's Washington storage facility in Louisiana enables us to offer competitive market-based rates to LNG, power generation and other customers in the Gulf Coast area. This will be a critical element of our wellhead-to-water strategy as this combined 110 Bcf of working gas storage and our expansive Transco network are fortified with low emissions Haynesville production from the LEG project. We are also making strides in advancing our wellhead to end-user strategy with our agreement with PennEnergy Resources to support the marketing and delivery of certified low emissions, gas that we refer to as next-gen natural gas. This agreement includes an independent third-party certification process that verifies best practices are being followed to minimize emissions and produce natural gas in the most environmentally responsible manner. This is another exciting step to grow the delivery of next-gen gas to markets across the U.S. as well as overseas.  So with that, I'll pause and turn it over to John to walk through the quarter and our year-to-date results, and then we'll open it up for your questions. John?
John Porter : Thanks, Alan. Starting here on Slide 2 with a summary of our year-over-year financial performance. Overall, 2022 financial performance continues to be quite strong. Beginning with adjusted EBITDA, we saw a 15% year-over-year increase for the third quarter and a 12% increase for the first nine months of '22 versus '21. As we'll see on the next couple of slides, our adjusted EBITDA growth has been led by our core large-scale Natural Gas Transmission, and Gathering and Processing businesses, complemented nicely by growth in our upstream joint ventures. Our adjusted EPS increased just over 37% for the quarter and 34% year-to-date. Available funds from operations, AFFO, which is basically our cash flow from operations less working capital fluctuation, the non-controlling interest cash flows grew in line or better than adjusted EBITDA at 15% year-over-year for the quarter or 18% for the nine-month period. Also, you see our dividend coverage on this page based on AFFO was 2.4x for third quarter and 2.29x year-to-date. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA metric continues to improve based on our strong growth in adjusted EBITDA and our capital investment discipline, now reaching 3.68x versus last year's 4.04x.  So now let's move to the next slide and dig a little deeper into our adjusted EBITDA results for the quarter. Again, the third quarter built nicely on the strong start we've seen this year with 15% growth reflecting the combined effect of the performance of our core business and upside from our upstream joint ventures. Walking now from last year's $1.420 billion to this year's $1.637 billion, we start with our upstream joint venture operations that are included in our Other segment, which were up $60 million. Since our first new production in the Haynesville came online in April of this year, we've seen a rapid ramp in volumes that will continue through the remainder of the year. As Alan mentioned, the strategic purpose of our upstream joint ventures is to fuel growth in our core related gathering assets, and that's certainly what we see happening in 2022.  Shifting now to our core business performance. Our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico business improved $41 million or 6% due to improved contributions from both Transco and our Gulf of Mexico businesses. Transco saw higher revenues, largely from the Leidy South expansion project, which came online in phases last year. Gulf of Mexico was significantly higher in '22, due in part to the lack of hurricane-related impacts that occurred in 2021. Operating and maintenance costs were higher, driven in part by higher maintenance activities but we are tracking very close to plan through the first nine months of the year. Our Northeast G&P business increased $22 million or 5%, driven by top line Gathering and Processing revenue growth on slightly lower volumes. Gathering and Processing rate growth was supported by a combination of factors, including higher commodity-based rates, annual fee escalations and other expansion-related fee increases that more than offset the lower cost of service rates at our Bradford franchise. Overall, Northeast volumes were 10.8 Bcf per day and roughly in line with our current forecast for total 3Q volumes. We continue to expect an increase from this volume level for the fourth quarter. But as we've mentioned in past calls, our '22 plan for the Northeast has always been higher EBITDA versus 2021 on pretty flat volume growth. However, as Alan mentioned, we remain well positioned to resume stronger volume and EBITDA growth in the Northeast in 2023, driven by several expansion and optimization projects.  Shifting now to the West, which saw another impressive quarter of year-over-year growth, up $80 million or 31% over 2021. I should mention that $27 million of the $80 million was attributed to our Trace Midstream acquisition, which closed on April 29 this year. So even without Trace, the West still increased $53 million or 21%. In the West, we continue to see upside from our commodity price exposed rates, especially in the Barnett and Haynesville as well as substantially higher volumes in the Haynesville that drove a 12% overall increase in volumes for the West and that's excluding the Trace acquisition.  Next, we saw a $4 million or 12% increase for our Gas & NGL Marketing Services business. This increase was despite taking a $54 million lower of cost or market adjustment to our gas and NGL inventories in September of this year. Generally speaking, most of this adjustment, which was associated with our gas and storage will result in higher margins when those products are sold out of inventory late this year or early next year. So again, another strong quarter with 15% growth in EBITDA, driven by core business performance and upside in our upstream joint venture operations. Let's move to Slide 4 and look at the year-to-date comparison. Through the first nine months of '22, we've now generated 12% growth in adjusted EBITDA over 2021, three strong consecutive quarters for this year. So stepping now from last year's $4.152 billion to this year's $4.644 billion, starting with the $77 million of first quarter 2021 winter storm benefits that we're showing here in gray, and then moving to the $182 million contribution from our Midstream operations which were Wamsutter related in the first quarter of '22, and then begin to have a more significant Haynesville component in the second and third quarters. Our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico business has seen 4% growth year-to-date, driven by Transco's Leidy South expansion project and strong first quarter '22 seasonal revenues and also higher Gulf of Mexico results due to less hurricane-related impacts in '22 versus '21, partially offset by higher operating and maintenance costs. The Northeast G&P business has now seen 6% growth year-to-date, driven by higher rates on overall flat volumes, as previously discussed. The West has seen an impressive 27% growth year-to-date, driven by higher commodity base rates, but also a strong 11% overall volume growth, excluding the Trace acquisition.  Finally, our Gas & NGL Marketing Services segment is up $32 million, driven by favorable commodity margins as well as the new contributions from the Sequent acquisition that closed on July 1, 2021, and the year-to-date comparison was also unfavorably impacted by lower cost or market adjustments on inventories as discussed in the third quarter comparison, which as we discussed, should result in higher margins in the future. So an impressive $491 million or 12% increase to land us with over $4.6 billion of adjusted EBITDA through the first nine months of the year. Before I turn it back over to Alan, I'll offer a few thoughts for full year 2022 financial guidance. As we previously announced, based on strong third quarter performance and expectations for the fourth quarter, we anticipate full year adjusted EBITDA will be near the high end of our previously announced guidance range of $6.1 billion to $6.4 billion, which implies a strong fourth quarter. We see multiple contributors to this expected strong finish to the year, including continued growth in our upstream joint ventures, but also growth across our other business segments versus our third quarter results. One other note regarding the third quarter, you probably noticed in our 10-Q that we did initiate share repurchases in September. As we discussed on our second quarter call, we stand ready to take action on share repurchases, and we see a pullback in our valuation, and that's what we did in September. Our share buyback principles center around a returns-based approach considering our current equity yield plus a level of expected growth in the business. We are more confident than ever in the long-term growth of our business, and so we remain ready to purchase additional shares as an important element of our capital allocation strategy. Debt financing costs have also been topical lately with the sharp rise we've seen in borrowing costs. We've included some helpful information on our well-positioned debt portfolio in the appendix, but I'll briefly touch on a few key facts. First off, we have an entirely fixed rate debt portfolio with an average rate of 4.78%, and a weighted average maturity of 12.2 years. Second, following our well-timed August debt issuance and subsequent call of $850 million of 2023 notes recently in October, we now only have $600 million of maturities in 2023. And finally, we will continue to enjoy excellent financial flexibility with our $3.75 billion credit facility. So again, with our expectations to finish 2022 near the high end of our adjusted EBITDA guidance, this would amount to over 13.5% growth versus 2021 and a four-year CAGR of about 8%, driven by continued growth in our core business as well as contributions from our Trace acquisition and upstream JV operations. So with that, I'll pass it back to Alan for closing remarks. Alan?
Alan Armstrong: Okay. Well, great. Thanks, John. And I'll close by reiterating my remarks at the top of the call that quarter after quarter, we continue to demonstrate that we have built a core business that has steady predictable growth and is resilient in the face of multiple macroeconomic conditions. In fact, this makes the 27th quarter in a row that we've either met or exceeded the Street consensus. A careful allocation of capital has delivered improving returns on capital employed. And in fact, this is a 21.7% return on invested capital as we've showed in recent presentations. We delivered a very strong balance sheet and we have a growing dividend with best-in-class coverage. Our long-haul pipes are in the right places, serving the right markets, our formidable gathering assets are in the low-cost basins that will be called on to meet gas demand as it continues to grow for decades, and our Sequent platform is providing infrastructure optimization services that create value for Williams and our customers while mitigating downside risk in these volatile and fast-growing markets. You've heard me say before that we are bullish on natural gas because of the critical role it plays and will continue to play in both our countries and the world's pursuit of a clean energy future. But even more so, we are also bullish on America's ability to lead on all fronts when it comes to clean, reliable and affordable energy. The United States is positioned better than any other country to solve the energy crisis and the climate crisis we're facing around the world. But I'll stand on my soapbox again and remind you that access to our abundant and low-cost natural gas reserves here in the U.S. is dependent on having the appropriate infrastructure to move energy where it is needed. We're seeing and feeling today the impact of inadequate infrastructure both here at home and especially in Europe, with consumers bearing the brunt of these actions in the form of high energy prices high utility bills and energy-driven inflation. The good news is that we have a solution that is readily available, a solution that will support global emissions reductions keep energy costs affordable and grow our nation's competitiveness, enabling the efficient unobstructive build-out of our nation's energy infrastructure to ensure delivery of natural gas is foundational to the U.S.' leadership on greenhouse gas emissions reductions and energy security. And we at Williams will proudly continue our efforts to strongly advocate for actionable energy policy solutions and permitting reform in the days, months and years ahead. And with that, I'll open it up for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
Jeremy Tonet : Just want to kind of start off with the Haynesville here and this new project that you talked about in the slides regarding carbon capture. I was just wondering if you could touch base what moved that forward at this point was that the higher 45Qs coming from IRA here that get over the finish line? And also, I guess, how big could the scope of this project be over time?
Chad Zamarin : Yes. Thanks, Jeremy. This is Chad. Yes, the IRA and the increase in 45Q credit is certainly a benefit that helps that project move forward. The scope of that project is alongside our Louisiana Energy Gateway project as we're gathering large volumes in the Haynesville. We'll be taking the CO2 that today is invented in the basin into the pipeline, and we'll also be gathering CO2 from third parties and moving that CO2 to the Southern end of the Louisiana Energy Gateway gathering project. And at that location, we're going to install treating facilities that will remove the CO2 and transport it to a sequestration site so that it can be permanently stored underground. We see somewhere around the potential for 2 million tons of annual CO2 to be captured and sequestered. And we think that could increase over time as we continue to further develop that project. So we feel really good about it, and we're focused on bringing that online alongside our Lake project, which could be in service as early as Q4 of '24.
Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Very helpful there. And just wanted to pivot, if I could, to the producing assets in the Haynesville. It seems like the ramp in production there is quite strong, and I think it might kind of reach what you guys were hoping for when you attain the assets, getting into a growth trajectory that fill your pipes to serve that purpose there? And if it's on that trajectory, does that kind of make you guys think about potential time line to divest those assets if they are delivering the volume utilization that you're looking for?
Alan Armstrong : Yes, Jeremy, I just -- let me be clear on that. First of all, I think there's been a lot of confusion out there in the market on the forms of those contracts. We expect production net -- our net interest production to continue to grow in '23. And so we have been very pleased with GeoSouthern's efforts out there. They've been a great operator and they've really been hitting it out of the park, so to speak, in their efforts and the performance on wells, both on the cost side as well as delivery side. So we're really excited about their activities out there.  So we do -- just to be clear, we do expect our net interest production to continue to grow into '23. And so the people have been talking about a decline relative to the reversion. Our interest in the undeveloped acreage declines, but not our interest in the existing flow of production. And in fact, the nice thing about that is our capital obligations really fall back really hard in '23 after that reversion occurred because we won't be continuing to have to invest in drilling operations there. So -- but in terms of looking for -- to sell the asset, we certainly -- that is our long-term objective and continues to be. And we think the acreage is certainly proving itself up to exceed it. I would tell you, though, it's got a long ways to go from where it is today in terms of total volume growth in that area. In fact, really just starting to scratch the surface of that inventory in the area. So yes, we certainly have our eyes and ears open, but no, we are not getting near the peak of the volumes out there at all.  And so it's really playing out on its exact we like we intended accept that we've had this nice, big upside of pricing here in the current environment. And the volumes this year have been -- are outperforming where we thought they would be. So great news really kind of all the way around there in terms of upside, and it's going to drive a lot of free cash flow into '23 and '24.
Jeremy Tonet : Got it. And just a quick follow-up on that. Is there a certain production level you are looking for before you would entertain divesting those assets?
Alan Armstrong : No. I would just say, we've got -- there's a lot more room to grow out there than what people are expecting, I think. I think we continue to be impressed by other is informing us on in terms of kind of well beyond the current reduction level. So I would just say we're not waiting, if you will, necessarily. We just want to be assured that the production growth will continue on the pace kind of if we're not the owner. And I think certainly, the alignment we've had with GeoSouthern out there has been productive for both of us. But no, we're not waiting on any particular volume number. We think the evidence is pretty clear in terms of the performance out there at this point. So we think the viability of that acreage has been pretty well proven up already just in terms of the performance of GeoSouthern channel already.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Praneeth Satish with Wells Fargo.
Praneeth Satish : In light of the NorTex acquisition, I was just wondering if you could elaborate on the benefits of gas storage right now. Do you think storage has become more valuable? Do you think spreads could widen out? How does this fit with Sequent? And then finally, do you envision building out more gas storage assets organically or doing more acquisitions in this space?
Alan Armstrong : Yes. Thanks for the question. And first of all, we were -- Sequent was a sizable customer there to NorTex, and we were looking at their process as they were going through that to and realizing what they could charge for that storage. And frankly, we were pretty impressed and from our perspective, what they could have charged for storage in that area and recognize that we thought that rates could probably be driven up there just because of the value of that storage in these more volatile markets. And we continue to believe that today the load from the variability of power generation, gas-fired power generation as well as LNG, we think is going to continue to drive value for natural gas storage. We're certainly seeing that as Sequent was a buyer of storage, and used to be a large buyer of storage. We understand that market very well, and we think there's a lot of value there. That's first thing. Second thing, one thing that I commented on in my opening comments that we're excited about as well is we did get an order from the FERC last week to be able to put market-based rates in place on our Washington Gas storage. We still have a lot of work to do on that. So we have to go through the process of filing those rates, but we did get a very important order out of FERC last week to be able to go to market-based rates for our Washington Gas storage. And so that is a very large deal for us. That's about 75 Bcf a day of working gas storage. And so that's -- that gives us about 110 Bcf a day of storage in the Gulf Coast area between NorTex and Washington Gas storage. So yes, we are pretty committed to this concept. We think there's a lot of value there and finding ways to extract the real value out of our current assets and out of NorTex is certainly going to be a mission for us in the years looking forward.
Praneeth Satish : Great. And just switching gears. If we -- if I look at the financial metrics this year, the leverage is good and EBITDA is on pace to grow 13% or 14%. But on the capital return side, the dividend is only up 4%, and there's been some buybacks, but it's been fairly modest. So I guess my question is, is the strong performance this year influence how you look at capital return heading into 2023?
Alan Armstrong : Well, that's a great question. And the answer is yes. It certainly does influence how we look, and we recognize we're outpacing both our AFFO and our EBITDA have been outpacing our dividend growth, and we certainly recognize that. And so I would just say, we're going to make sure that our dividend is durable, but we also -- we've also said that we're going to continue to grow our dividend along with our cash flow. So it's a great question. The Board level decision that we made later this year and into next year, that decision will get made. But we certainly have the coverage and the cash flow growth to be able to increase the growth rate in our dividend at this point.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America.
Chase Mulvehill : I guess just a quick question and kind of want to follow-up. You mentioned a little bit of this during the prepared remarks, but just kind of looking forward to 2023, thinking about some of the puts and takes. I mean, obviously, when we look at '23 versus '22, you've got full year of some of the M&A you did. You got the Springridge gathering, expansion and some Northeast gathering, expansion. And then you've got some Gulf of Mexico stuff that starts up and you probably have some higher E&P volumes. So I guess just -- am I missing anything there when we think about growth opportunities? And then kind of offsets, how should we think about the offsets for '23? I mean the curve is backward dated, but the curve is not always right, but just kind of how should we think about the offsets in '23?
Alan Armstrong : Yes, great question. I think you've laid that out pretty well actually. I would say the other thing that we didn't enjoy this year that we will enjoy next year is the investments that we've been putting into the Wamsutter JV this year. I mentioned, we have -- we're continuing the drilling program, but we are just now starting the completions effort out there. And so the benefit of that those drilling capital we've been spending up there this year will really start to play out in '23 as well. So that's a key issue. As I mentioned, the Eagle Ford, we're seeing some pretty rapid development going on in the rich gas that will see the MVC out there. So that's attractive. In terms of the headwinds, I certainly think pricing is a consideration, but I think it's also important to realize the amount of hedges that we had on this year that kept us from enjoying extremely high gas prices this year. And so I think if you look year-to-year, they're probably not likely going to be that big a spread. I would say we're strip. So that's probably the primary headwind. But from what we're seeing right now, that is going to be dramatically overcome by volumes in the E&P space. And so yes, we could see lower price, but our volumes, I think, will surprise people to the upside next year.
Chase Mulvehill : That makes sense. As a kind of -- I guess, maybe a somewhat related follow-up. On Slide 24, you show an 8% increase in power demand year-to-date. I obviously don't do too much on the power side, but could you kind of explain kind of what's happening there? And how sustainable do you think that, that growth is in power demand as we kind of look forward?
Alan Armstrong : Yes. I would just say we continue to be surprised. I would say that was probably, as we mentioned earlier in the year, probably our biggest surprise has been the resilience of gas demand in the face of higher price. And I think what we learned was that the utilities and the power generators are not really able to flip back to coal for a number of reasons. One, they don't have the long-term contracts, a lot of those expired. And two, obviously, the price of coal has come up right alongside gas. And so we just did not see the flip back to coal-fired generation, we would have expected at this kind of pricing environment. Obviously, I think it's -- what you're seeing is a result of the utilities. And I don't think this is going to end anytime soon, where as renewables come on, the backup for that is going to be natural gas, and it's going to continue to take coal-fired generation out of the space and we're going to continue to see increases. So if you're listening to the rhetoric in the market and in the media, you would think that gas volumes were going to decline dramatically, if you saw the RFPs for new services coming in our door, you would think otherwise. And so I think what we are seeing is continued strong demand from gas-fired generation from the utilities, particularly in the Mid-Atlantic and the Southeast. So we're -- we remain bullish not because of rhetoric, but because of what we're seeing for request for long-term services coming in the door.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Gabriel Moreen with Mizuho.
Gabriel Moreen : Maybe if I could ask another question about '23 and just talking about how to frame CapEx. There's clearly some projects finishing up some bigger ones like Regional Energy Access and legs that are out there where maybe the spend gets spread over '23, '24. So I'm just wondering how to think about growth CapEx within the context of what it was this year and some of these longer-term projects?
Micheal Dunn : Gabe, it's Micheal. Yes. I would expect, as we talked about in previous calls, to see some lumpiness in our growth CapEx. As you indicated, we've got regional NG access that we'll be ramping up construction next year, the whale project, although we started construction on that will be ongoing as well in 2023. So -- and obviously, LEG will be ramping up as well. So those are some pretty large capital outlays that will be ramping up next year. But as we've indicated in the past, we're working real hard to keep our growth CapEx in line with previous years.  And so you think about where we're at this year to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion level, that's what we're targeting on typical years going forward, but you will see some lumpiness when these big projects start construction. So you can anticipate that being a 2023 story with these big projects coming on. But we're still very focused on managing that growth CapEx to a level that's about $1.2 billion on average per year.
Gabriel Moreen : And this might be another one for you. But in the NWP rate case, it seems like you achieved sort of a modernization rider or there's some language about that. Can you talk about that and whether that's going to be significant and also whether that can be a precedent for Transco in the upcoming rate case?
Micheal Dunn : Yes. Great question. We do have our uncontested settlement in front of the FERC right now for approval. We would expect to receive that before the end of the year, but those rates into effect next year and a great outcome by the team there achieving an emissions reduction program rider, as you indicated. And I would say is that certainly a good framework or pattern for us to go into the Transco rate case with that same thought process in front of us where we have a lot of compression on both Northwest Pipeline and the Transco system that we can replace that make sense to replace in many of these areas where we're in non-attainment or being challenged by some of the regulators like in the Pacific Northwest to improve the emissions profile our units. And it's just a great opportunity for us to make an investment in our regulated business. And I would say the Northwest pipeline opportunity is certainly not as great as the Transco opportunity for capital deployment there just with the number of units that we have on the Northwest Pipeline system versus Transco. The horsepower on Transco was a significant order of magnitude higher than Northwest, but certainly, a great opportunity there and very well received by our customers on Northwest pipeline for us to go and implement these emissions reductions.
Gabriel Moreen : Great. And maybe if I could squeeze just a quick last one. It seems like you got a ruling in the energy transfer litigation, they're appealing. Is there any timing as far as how long that appeal may take to play out? 
Lane Wilson: Yes. This is Lane Wilson. We would anticipate sometime probably late second quarter, early third quarter, maybe even early fourth quarter, depending upon how quickly the Delaware’s work moves. Yes, 2023.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Brian Reynolds with UBS.
Brian Reynolds : Maybe just talk a little bit about a follow-up on capital allocation and the growth CapEx. With the acquisitions of Trace and NorTex, -- could you just maybe talk about what the base business kind of growth CapEx run rate is going forward now?
Micheal Dunn : Yes. Sure, this is Micheal. As I indicated, we think it's going to be about $1.2 billion, very similar to what we see this year on average going forward. But as I've talked about on previous calls, we do have some lumpiness anticipated there when these larger projects start to ramp up construction, retail energy access. We'll be ramping up construction next year. The Lake project will also be starting construction next year and then the Whale project in the Gulf of Mexico, will be in some pretty significant construction activities as well next year, although that has started this year. So as always, it will be lumpy, but we're very focused on being efficient in regard to our growth capital. So I would expect you would see a $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion average CapEx on our growth side for the foreseeable future.
Brian Reynolds : Great. And then maybe as a follow-up on some of the upstream business. You guys outlaid some of the hedging profile that you have into 2023. Kind of curious if you can just give an update about where you're comfortable like hedging as a percentage of the overall volumes expected just given some weakness in recent nat gas pricing just given some record U.S. nat gas production and some constraints on the LNG side?
Alan Armstrong : Yes. Thank you. Well, we do have some favorable hedges on right now for '23. I think we've got around 15% or so for the year that's on right now. And we'll continue to look at that opportunistically. I would tell you that it's really nice having our Sequent team that is joined at the hip when it comes to making those decisions and having a real vantage point on the market. And what they're seeing as well. So I would just say we will continue to be somewhat opportunistic about that, but we certainly will continue -- just like we did this year, we'll continue to take on hedges as we see fit. But I would say we don't have any particular formula or a requirement for that. It's simply a way of when we see opportunities in the market and we see things flare up in the market, we'll hedge into that. So I would say it's fairly opportunistic, but with no particular requirement for a minimum level of hedges to be put on.
Brian Reynolds : Right. Would second half '22 be a good kind of parameter of where we should expect it going forward, or I guess, remains to be seen.
Alan Armstrong : I'm sorry, I didn't quite follow that last part.
Brian Reynolds : Whether the 50% hedging profile that you kind of had outlaid for the second half of '22, is that kind of a fair estimate for '23 or more to…?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I mean, I would just say it's very dependent on what the markets do versus how we're seeing the fundamentals looking forward. The good news is we have such a good read on both what's going on in production because we gather in 15 different basins. So we have a very good read about what's going on in production as well as we see a good read from the markets as well that we use that to inform our fundamentals. And if we see the pricing obviously get fair relative to those fundamentals, then we will hedge. So again, I don't -- I wouldn't put a particular percentage on it as much as it is us looking at the fundamentals versus the pricing in the forward market.
Chad Zamarin : Alan, may be worth mentioning that '23, we'll have less to prove up as far as volumes. In '22, we did have the growth in the Haynesville that outperformed our expectations, which was great. But in '23, we've really proven up volumes. And so we've got much less volume risk coming into '23 as a result of the success we've seen in '22.
Alan Armstrong : Yes, that's a really good point that some of our reluctance to hedge at the beginning of '22 was based on us not wanting to hedge until we actually saw that reduction flowing given the volatility in the markets and certainly didn't want to get caught short in an upswing in the market. So next year, we'll have less of that. In the Haynesville, we'll have less of that volume growth risk, not so much in the Wamsutter.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global.
Sunil Sibal : I just wanted to go back to the opening comments regarding 5% to 7% EBITDA growth. So is that kind of the run rate we can assume based on your asset base now for the next few years?
Alan Armstrong : Yes. That is correct. Obviously, as we mentioned, we've been overachieving on that a bit. We've had that 5% to 7% growth rate out there for quite some time, and that was assuming a $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion capital program back when we first established that level of growth rate.  And I would just say we've got some efficiencies coming into like '25, where we've got some very large growth on a limited amount of capital in the deepwater, that gives us some very high return investments because, in some cases, we're being reimbursed for the capital or the producer is providing the capital upfront on some of those big deepwater projects. So obviously, those returns are kind of outsized there and will provide better growth. But in general, as Micheal said, we're expecting this $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion capital, and we believe that kind of investment will continue to propel the 5% to 7% growth rate.
Sunil Sibal : Okay. And then regards to the Eagle Ford, I think you mentioned you're seeing some activity pick up there. I was curious what kind of gas or NGL prices kind of support this uptick in activity? And do you anticipate this activity uptick to kind of go into 2023 and further out?
Chad Zamarin : Yes. I would just say that the Eagle Ford is highly economic right now. Chesapeake has been allocating more of their capital to their gas-focused areas and they have been out in the market talking about the potential to to settle their Eagle Ford position. But we see both on the rich gas side and on the oil side of that system. We have really two different systems there in oil driven system and a rich gas gathering system. And as Alan mentioned, the rich gas gathering system has already been ramping up in activity and is now exceeding the MVCs. And we're seeing, I think, very strong economics behind the oil the oil side of that asset as well. And so we would expect that you'll continue to see increased activity on the oil side as well. So that's a very highly economic asset and really has just been not the #1 priority for kind of the current producer there. 
Operator: Our final question will come from the line of John Mackay with Goldman Sachs.
John Mackay : I wanted to pick up on the Haynesville again. You guys are obviously adding a lot of your own volumes. You're talking about adding a lot of gathering capacity over the next 12 months. Can you maybe just share some of your thoughts on how we're thinking about takeaway out of the basin and maybe differential impacts on your upstream business, particularly on the next nine months until we -- or next while until we get LEG on.
Micheal Dunn : Sure. Thanks for the question. This is Micheal again. I would say we're very well positioned there with our gathering systems being connected to about nine different outlet pipelines out of the basin and having Sequent alongside us evaluating those takeaway opportunities has been very helpful. I believe they were well in front of the -- any anticipated constraints out there in front of the market and really went out and acquired some capacity out of the basin that made sure that not only our customers' volumes could blow, but our partnership upstream volumes could flow as well. So we feel very comfortable about our position in getting our gas out of the basin as well as our customers' gas out of there. We helped a lot of our customers make sure that they had opportunities to move their gas out of the basin based on what we were seeing with Sequent. So we feel really good about that. We're certainly working to get the Lake project up and running as fast as possible to help make sure that none of those constraints arise for our customers or our partnership.
John Mackay : Maybe one last one for me. you just walk us through, again, final steps on Regional Energy Access? I know we're kind of looking for a few things from the FERC, but more importantly, a couple of things on the state side, maybe just a refresh there would be helpful. 
Micheal Dunn : Yes, Micheal once again answering this question. We are awaiting the FERC 7(c) certificate. We would expect to have that before the end of the year. The final EIS was issued in July, just as a reminder, that was a very favorable EIS for the project. The other remaining outstanding permits are the air permit. This is a Title V modification for Section 505 in New Jersey. Went through the whole public comment process, and this is a great opportunity for us to once again deploy our emissions reduction program here. We take off some existing compression and replace it with a much better emissions profile. So very favorably received by the state. And certainly, we saw some very positive comments there in the public comment meetings, overwhelming support for that. So we expect that air permit by the end of this year as well. And then finally, the core engineers will issue a 404 permit. This is a water quality permit. We would expect that probably in the first quarter of '23, but it could come as early as the fourth quarter here in '22. We've already had our 401 water certification in the State of Pennsylvania that's been in hand for a number of months now, and no technical issues remaining on the 404 permit just waiting for the process to play out. So those are the 3 outstanding things we're waiting on Regional Energy Access for right now. And just as a reminder, we positioned this project very well to avoid any controversial permits and certainly position that air permit in New Jersey to be favorably received with deployment of new compression there to take off some old vintage reciprocating compression.
Operator: At this time, I'll turn the call over to Alan Armstrong for closing remarks.
Alan Armstrong : Okay. Well, thank you all very much for the great questions and appreciate your continued interest in the company. We're very excited about the way the business is running right now, and we're extremely well positioned for growth in '23 as we discussed, and we look forward to talking to you at our 4Q earnings call and laying out in more detail what '23 looks like. So thanks again for joining us this morning. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-08-02 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.  At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Danilo Juvane, Vice President of Investor Relations and ESG. Please go ahead.
Danilo Juvane: Thanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in the Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon, we released our earnings press release and the presentation that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and our Chief Financial Officer, John Porter, will speak to this morning. Also joining us on the call are Micheal Dunn, our Chief Operating Officer; Lane Wilson, our General Counsel; and Chad Zamarin, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development.  In our presentation materials, you'll find a disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. And these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation material. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong: Great. Thanks, Danilo, and thank you all for joining us today. While we're here today to talk about another quarter of steady, predictable growth, thanks to a long-term commitment to our natural gas-focused strategy and continued crisp execution against that strategy. We saw strong earnings growth in our core businesses and our upstream operations. And the health of our businesses was also demonstrated by equally strong gathering and transportation volumes during the quarter. Importantly, we expect continued earnings growth in our core G&P and gas transmission businesses as our teams are delivering great execution on our expansion projects. We're also staying laser focused on doing what's right to ensure sustainable operational performance. We're pleased to share our progress in our 2021 sustainability report that was published just last week. I hope you'll take some time to read the report as it really is a testament to the hard work of our entire organization and their passion for doing things the right way.  I'll highlight a few things from the report in our key investor focus areas segment. But for now, let me turn things over to John for a review of our second quarter and our year-to-date results. John?
John Porter: Thanks, Alan. Starting here on Slide 1 with a summary of our year-over-year financial performance. Overall, 2022 financial performance continues to be quite strong. Beginning with EBITDA, we saw a 14% year-over-year increase for the second quarter and a 10% increase for the first half of '22 versus the first half of '21. As we'll see on the next couple of slides, our EBITDA growth has been led by our core large-scale natural gas Transmission, and Gathering and Processing businesses complemented nicely by growth in our upstream joint ventures. Our adjusted EPS increased 48% for the quarter and 29% year-to-date.  Available funds from operations, AFFO, grew more than EBITDA, continuing the trend of strong growth in this measure, up 23% year-over-year for the quarter or 19% year-to-date. Also, you see our dividend coverage on this page based on AFFO was 2.19x for second quarter and slightly better at 2.24x year-to-date. Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA metric continues to improve based on our strong growth in EBITDA and our capital investment discipline now reaching 3.82x versus last year's 4.13x. So now let's move to the next slide and dig a little deeper into our EBITDA results for the quarter. Again, the second quarter built nicely on the strong start we've seen this year with 14% growth, reflecting the combined effect of the performance of our core business and upside from our upstream joint ventures. Walking now from last year's $1.317 billion to this year's $1.496 billion, we start with our upstream joint venture operations included in our Other segment, which were up $66 million. I will point out that we've added a new page to our analyst package for this segment. And in that supplemental information, we've included our net upstream sales volumes, which were just under 200 million cubic feet a day for the Haynesville and Wamsutter properties for the second quarter of '22. Since our first new production in the Haynesville came online in April of this year, we've seen a rapid ramp in volumes that will continue through the remainder of the year. Shifting now to our core business performance. Our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico business improved $4 million, primarily at Transco and largely from the Leidy South expansion project, which came online in phases last year. Operating and maintenance costs were higher, driven in part by an acceleration in maintenance work during the second quarter of this year. Overall, Transmission & Gulf of Mexico's $652 million of adjusted EBITDA was just over our business plan for this segment for the second quarter. Our Northeast G&P business increased $41 million or 10%, driven by top line Gathering and Processing revenue growth on slightly higher volumes. G&P rate growth was supported by a combination of factors, including higher commodity-based rates, annual fee escalations and other expansion-related fee increases that more than offset the lower cost of service rates that we have in our Bradford franchise. We saw an expected sequential increase in Northeast volumes for the second quarter of 2022 versus the first quarter, and we expect continued quarterly increases for volumes for the remainder of the year. But ultimately, our plan for the Northeast in '22 continues to see higher EBITDA versus 2021 on pretty flat volume growth. However, we remain well positioned to resume stronger volume and EBITDA growth in the Northeast in 2023, driven by several expansion and optimization projects underway that Alan will discuss in more detail.  Shifting now to the West, which saw an impressive $73 million or 33% improvement over 2021 and I'll mention that $20 million of that $73 million was attributed to our Trace Midstream acquisition, which closed on April 29. So even without Trace, the West still increased $53 million or 24%. In the West, we continue to see upside from our commodity price exposed rates, especially in the Barnett and Haynesville, as well as substantially higher volumes in the Haynesville that drove an 11% overall increase in volumes for the West, excluding the Trace acquisition. Also in the West, we see a strong quarter-over-quarter volume growth trajectory throughout the second half of the year, driven primarily by the Haynesville.  Next, we saw a slight decrease for our Gas & NGL Marketing Services business as was expected in our business plan. And as a reminder, the first quarter of each year is typically when this segment will create the majority of its EBITDA. Overall, our Marketing Services business is extremely well positioned to take advantage of the recent natural gas price and location volatility we've seen in July. And so we expect them to exceed the high end of the $50 million to $70 million annual adjusted EBITDA contribution we discussed last quarter. So again, another strong quarter with 14% growth in EBITDA, driven by core business performance and upside in our upstream joint venture operations. Let's move to Slide 3 and take a look at the year-to-date comparison. So through the first six months of 2022, we've now generated 10% growth in adjusted EBITDA over '21 or 13% if you exclude the unusual first quarter 2021 winter storm benefits. So that's two strong quarters to start the year, so stepping now from last year's $2.732 billion to this year's just over $3 billion. And you start with the $77 million of those first quarter '21 winter storm benefits, which we've isolated here in gray, and then moving to the $122 million contribution from our upstream operations which, again, were Wamsutter related in the first quarter of '22 and then began to have a more significant Haynesville component in the second quarter, as discussed on Slide 2. Our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico business has seen 3% growth year-to-date, driven by Transco's Leidy South expansion project and strong first quarter '22 seasonal revenues with again some acceleration of maintenance costs into the second quarter of '22. The Northeast G&P business has now seen 7% growth year-to-date driven by higher rates on overall flat volumes as discussed on the previous slide. The West has seen an impressive 25% growth year-to-date, driven by higher commodity base rates but also a strong 11% overall volume growth, excluding the Trace acquisition.  Finally, our Gas & NGL Marketing Services segment is up $28 million, driven by favorable commodity margins as well as the new contributions from the Sequent acquisition that closed on July 1 of last year. So an impressive $275 million or 10% increase to land us with just over $3 billion of adjusted EBITDA through the first six months of the year, and we expect things to improve from here for the remainder of the year.  So let's turn the page and take a look at our current thoughts for full year 2022 financial guidance. We are once again pleased to share a substantial improvement in our 2022 financial guidance, making this the second increase since our initial guidance in February of this year. I won't go through each of these metrics, but will offer some commentary on the most pivotal numbers. So let's start with adjusted EBITDA, where our midpoint is increasing another $200 million from our last guidance increase moving from $6.05 billion to $6.25 billion. This second substantial raise in EBITDA guidance is grounded in our continued confidence in the growth of our core business and represents a nearly 8% increase from our initial guidance given in February. As we look to the second half of the year, we expect higher EBITDA than the first half for all of our segments, except perhaps the marketing business, and with an overall pick-up in sequential EBITDA growth for the fourth quarter over the third quarter. Although it's less certain, our Gas & NGL Marketing business could also match or exceed their first half performance during the last six months of the year, which is a bit unusual for this business. Their storage and transportation assets and trading capabilities are very well suited for the volatility we are seeing in this natural gas markets.  Continuing on with the other segments, we expect Transmission & Gulf of Mexico should finish the year strong with fourth quarter numbers more like their first quarter numbers. And we continue to expect growing quarterly EBITDA and volumes from our West and Northeast segments with some level of acceleration through the latter part of the year. With respect to our upstream operations, we are encouraged by the results we've seen thus far in 2022. In the appendix, you'll see that we're guiding to fourth quarter '22 gross production of approximately 250 million cubic feet per day for the Wamsutter operation and we have increased our expectations for Haynesville to an estimated fourth quarter '22 gross production rate of about 400 million cubic feet per day. Our appendix slides also provide information about the specific hedges we've currently placed against our forecasted net production volumes. No change to our CapEx assumptions from our previous guidance update in May on our first quarter earnings call, which had increase from the February guidance only to reflect the Trace acquisition capital spending. You see that our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be about 3.6x at midpoint. The remainder of the guidance items either changed in relation to the change in EBITDA just discussed or remain unchanged.  So again, a second substantial increase in EBITDA guidance representing an almost 8% increase in our midpoint from our initial guidance provided in February of this year, driven by continued growth in our core business as well as contributions from our Trace acquisition and improved expectations for our upstream JV operations. So with that, I'll pass it back to Alan to review our key investor focus areas. Alan?
Alan Armstrong: Okay. Well, thanks, John. I'm going to move on here on Slide 5 to the key investor focus areas. So I know this may sound a little bit like a broken record, but on this first bullet. But without a doubt, we are the most natural gas-centric of the large-scale midstream companies. And there's a reason we've stuck with our natural gas focused strategy for as long as we have. Not only is this strategy delivering in the current environment, but the signals coming from the market show that it's going to continue to deliver substantial growth for the long term as well. We continue to see strong fundamentals driving a great pipeline of growth opportunities, particularly increasing demand for U.S. LNG exports and power generation along the Transco corridor. Importantly, we continue to see strong demand for our services domestically as well, evidenced by a three-day peak summer delivery that we achieved on the Transco pipeline in early July this year as we continue to see weather-driven demand for cooling. So really seeing a lot of big pools, you're seeing some strong basis differentials setting up in these areas where we've got some strong peak demands during the heat wave that the Southeast experienced. And notably, we continue to see these record levels of demand for natural gas even with the Freeport LNG facility being out. So we see these as good indicators of the long-term health of our business, but I'll remind you that business on our Transco system is actually driven by contracted capacity and not the actual transported volumes. But obviously, when we see peaks like that, our customers are seeing those as well and know that the demand on our systems and the growth in demand on our system is needed and the contracts come with that. This demand growth continues to increase in the face of higher natural gas prices, which speaks to the continued inelastic demand for natural gas, both here and abroad, and the fact that natural gas remains a bargain versus alternative fuels. Our G&P business also continues to thrive in the current environment, allowing us to capture the upside benefit of pricing and inflation adjusters in our rates that have been sitting on their floor for many years. And recently, volumes on our systems have finally begun to respond to the higher prices that we've seen in the gas space. So moving on to financial strength and stability. As John just detailed, we increased our guidance midpoint beyond the high end of the previous range for the second time this year to $6.25 billion, and this was driven by the following items: first of all, strong base business performance with volumes in the Northeast G&P business expected to rebound for the balance of the year; increased volume outlook for our upstream JVs, especially in the Haynesville; the benefit of higher commodity prices in our upstream JVs; and finally, commodity volatility and strong pools for power generation that are currently driving our Gas & NGL Marketing business upside. With our recent updated guidance, we expect to achieve a five-year EBITDA CAGR of 7% and an impressive EPS CAGR of 22% at the midpoint of this recent guidance. Our business continues to fire on all cylinders, given our -- driving our financial strength and to bill impact from inflation to our business. So worth noting our business is well positioned given the strong fundamentals today, and we don't expect much to change should a recession come to fruition. As you may recall, in 2020, Williams exceeded our pre-COVID guidance for that year despite facing challenges like key producer bankruptcies, declining commodity prices and major hurricanes in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. So now looking over our position of growth. We recently announced that we reached a final investment decision on our Louisiana Energy Gateway project, a 1.8 Bcf per day gathering system that will help us advance our wellhead and water strategy while also positioning our customers with access to favorable pricing markets along Transco. Within our transmission business, the Gulfstream [Phase 4] expansion is in service more than three months early, and I'm also pleased to announce that Williams has reached a rate case settlement in principle on our Northwest Pipeline system. And this provides a win-win outcome for both ourselves and our long-term customers on the system. So we continue to execute as well on an attractive high-return backlog of growth projects, including six projects now in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico; five Transco projects totaling 1.9 Bcf a day; four expansion projects in our Northeast G&P business that will really unlock some high-margin business for us in that area; and four in the Haynesville, which continues to grow at a pace well beyond our initial expectations. And as well on the Transco projects, just last week, the FERC issued the final EIS on our Regional Energy Access project, expanding takeaway from the Northeast PA area, which obviously helps us as well on our gathering systems up there and the volumes up there and serving growth in the New Jersey area as well. So really excited to see the progress with the FERC on bringing that project to fruition. And as well in the Haynesville, just another note here, we are really seeing that paying a lot of long-term dividends, not just because of the growth in the business but because the Trace acquisition, along with the LEG project, is going to allow us to bring integrated services and bring -- and connect them to key markets for our customers. So the better markets those customers are connected to, the better margins and the more activity in drilling we see up there. And in fact, we're seeing significant well outperformance in our upstream JV operations with GeoSouthern, which continue to improve our upstream margins. And as well, recall that the reasoning behind our upstream JVs was to drive utilization of latent midstream capacity. And this is exactly what's happening in the Haynesville right now, and we expect the same capture of Midstream value in the Wamsutter as our JV drilling program ramps in the coming months there as well. So now moving on to sustainable strategy. I'll cover a few updates here for you on what's been going on our sustainable strategy. First of all, as I mentioned at the top of the call, we published our 2021 Sustainability Report last week as well as we filed our Carbon Emissions Disclosure with the Carbon Disclosure Project. As both of these reports detail, we are continuing to successfully leverage our natural gas-focused strategy and today's technology to deliver on immediate opportunities to reduce emissions. In fact, we have reduced our company-wide Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 47% since 2005, and we're on our way to meeting our 2030 goal of a 56% reduction below -- again, below these 2005 levels.  I'm certainly proud of the progress that we've made to date and that we'll continue to make as our 2022 all employee annual incentive program now includes a total methane emissions reduction of 5% from our three-year average, which personally connects every employee to our long-term commitment to safe, reliable and environmentally friendly operations. Of course, our efforts go beyond what we see as the right here right now opportunities. We're also focusing on enabling the next generation of clean energy technologies. I mentioned our LEG project a few minutes ago, which is a key component of our low-carbon wellhead-to-water strategy, and this project is actually very integrated and supports our partnerships with Context Labs, Encino Environmental and Satlantis, whose technology solutions will be integrated into the project and will enable the measurement of end-to-end verifiable and transparent emissions data to demonstrate the low carbon benefits of produced and delivered Haynesville natural gas. We are really happy with the progress we're making on this project in the Haynesville and having -- we recently completed implementation of the on-site monitoring and certification capabilities in our systems up there. So really a lot of things coming together for us in the Haynesville in terms of great growth in the area as well as us demonstrating some of the new technology that we intend to deploy for that area. We're also advancing our wellhead to burner tip strategy in the Northeast with anchor customers to be announced later this year in that area. So lots of tangible solutions we will be delivering in the space. And all of these are positioned around supporting and enhancing our strong natural gas focused strategy. So let me move on to closing here. I'll reiterate that we have built a business that is steady and predictable with continued growth, improving returns and free cash flows. Our best-in-class long-haul pipes are in the right place, serving the right markets. Our formidable gathering assets are in the low-cost basins that will be called on to meet gas demand as it continues to grow for decades. And our Sequent platform is providing infrastructure optimization services that create value for Williams and our customers while mitigating downside risk in these volatile and fast-growing markets. You've heard me say before that we are bullish on natural gas because of the critical role it plays and will continue to play in both our countries and the world's pursuit of a clean energy future. But I'll go a step further here to say that we're also bullish on America's ability to lead on all fronts when it comes to clean, reliable and affordable energy. The United States is positioned better than any other country to solve the energy crisis and the climate crisis that we're facing around the world. But access to our abundant and low-cost natural gas reserves is dependent on having the appropriate infrastructure to move energy where it is needed. The efforts to build out all forms of key infrastructure have been blocked by obstructionists who don't offer practical and sustainable solutions to serve these growing energy demands. The impacts of inadequate infrastructure are now finally front and center with consumers bearing the brunt of these actions in the form of high energy prices, high utility bills and energy-driven inflation both here and around the world. The good news is that this is exactly the kind of catalyst that it takes to bring public awareness to these matters and the European prices is even highlighting the matter further. That is why we are strongly advocating for actionable energy policy solutions and permitting reform that will support global emissions reductions, keep energy costs affordable and grow our nation's competitiveness. Enabling the efficient unobstructed build-out of our nation's energy infrastructure is foundational to the U.S.' leadership on greenhouse gas emissions and energy security. And we believe that support is building out for just doing that. So with that, I'll open it up for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chase Mulvehill from Bank of America.
Chase Mulvehill : So I guess first thing, I just wanted to ask is really about the permitting legislation that is being proposed by Manchin. I guess a question specific for you guys is, are there any projects that maybe you took off the Board previously that could come back if this legislation actually passes? And then as a follow-up to that, if this legislation does get passed, could you maybe talk about the puts and takes as we think about gas being sourced between the Permian, Marcellus and Haynesville if this does get passed?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Thank you. Great question. Well, first of all, the actual language for that proposed bill is not out. So it's kind of hard to comment on. But I would say that we've been working hard on our government affairs front and really the whole executive team in trying to influence the policy and the legislation that would come out on that. So we're hopeful that, that will be very meaningful. And if it does, I would think that it would try to address the situation where we've had states abusing the 401 water quality certificate that are blocked projects. And that certainly would open up some opportunities for us as we've had some projects blocked on that basis. So I would say we're optimistic, but a lot can happen in the world of politics and we're just not really certain exactly how that bill will come out at this point. But relative to the Haynesville, the Permian and the Marcellus, certainly, the Marcellus has been the basin that has been has decades of low-cost gas as well. But really, if we're going to get up on planes, and be a large exporter of natural gas, we're going to need the Marcellus for the long term because that is where a lot of our very low cost reserves are impacted basin by that will be the Marcellus because things like in Louisiana, for instance, that infrastructure, a lot of that is being expanded within the state. And it is up against some of those same challenges and certainly more supported politics in those areas. So we are very helpful. We think the Marcellus and the Utica both would benefit significantly from the kind of permitting reform that we're looking for.
Chase Mulvehill : All right. It makes sense. I appreciate that, Alan. As a quick follow-up, your Northeast G&P volumes were a [tap right] in 2Q. I guess, kind of wondering if there's anything specific going on there. And also in the press release, you talked about advancing multiple gas fathering projects in the Northeast. So maybe could you talk about the timing of kind of bringing some of those gas gathering projects online and whether this is kind of targeting more rich gas areas?
Alan Armstrong : Yes. We do have some pretty exciting projects. I'll let Micheal Dunn talk about some of those that will unlock some of that capacity in the area.
Micheal Dunn : Sure. Thanks, Alan. Our gathering volumes were up slightly in the second quarter compared to last year. That's really meeting our expectations. Most of our producers are in maintenance mode there and expecting some growth to occur in '23. But also in the latter half of '22, as we've been talking about in the previous call, we would expect to see some volume increases there coming online before the end of the year. So stay tuned, we do expect to see some additional volumes coming our way. In regard to our expansion projects, we do have a number that we've outlined in the presentation materials, that are going on in the Northeast, some in the Northeast PA area. But all -- and that's targeted dry gas there in the Northeast PA area. That one would come online in the second half of '23. Then we've got several in the rich gas areas in Southwest PA and West Virginia wild areas. And the bulk of those will come online in '23 as well, as outlined in the material. But we do have an interconnect that we're working between our West Virginia processing areas and the Blue Racer system that would come online this year. That would unlock some additional processing capacity access for our West Virginia properties where we are currently at capacity in West Virginia on processing. And so it would help alleviate some of that constraint there by moving that volume over to the Blue Racer system. That will be online within the next several months. But we'll unlock some additional opportunity there. But all in all, the bulk of the expansion will come online in '23 and our producers are gearing up for that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Marc Solecitto from Barclays.
Marc Solecitto : So maybe just to start on the upward guidance revision, could you frame up the puts and takes at the upper and lower end of the revised range? Any kind of just tying on to that, for the unhedged portion of remaining 2022 production volumes, had your pricing assumptions around Henry Hub changed at all from your Analyst Day or if the current strip holds, would that be upside?
Alan Armstrong : Yes, we're not going to provide a whole lot of detail on that, just because it kind of becomes an endless thread to pull on from a pricing standpoint. But I would just say that there is upside at the current strip, there is upside in our -- against our midpoint, and that would push us up closer to the high end of the range if we were to see the current strip hold on natural gas. Not -- we don’t update our oil side so much. So there is little bit of impact to both NGLs and oil that obviously would be down a little bit from previous expectations.
Marc Solecitto : Got it. Appreciate the color there. And then costs generally ticked up on a sequential basis, particularly in the Northeast and Transmission segments. Wondering if you could give a little more color on the drivers there? Was that just a factor of timing or general cost inflation that you're seeing? Or were there any discrete factors that we should be thinking about as we think about the trajectory through the remainder of the year?
Micheal Dunn : Sure. This is Michael. I'll take that. So in the Transmission Gulf of Mexico business, we did see some cost increases there, and this was primarily driven by maintenance activities that we accelerated into the second quarter. We did anticipate some significant volume demand on the Transco system and seeing that expectation out there, we did accelerate some work to get that out of the way before the summer air conditioning loads on the power generation side. And so we accelerated that work. We also had some unforeseen integrity work that we undertook in the second quarter and we obviously didn't anticipate that, but that impacted our expenses there. I would just say, in rounding that out, though, we did exceed our EBITDA expectations and our plan for the Transmission Gulf of Mexico business in the quarter and year-to-date. So those expenses didn't impact our planned numbers and our expectations there. And in the Northeast, a very similar story there. We're just working on various maintenance overhauls and things of that nature in the second quarter. So costs are up slightly there, some of that’s driven by activity that we've expected to do in the second quarter. Really nothing unforeseen there against our budget though, I would say.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury from Bernstein.
Jean Ann Salisbury: It seems like Mountain Valley Pipeline could actually happen. There's been soft start before, but it may actually happen this time. Would that starting up have any material impact on your EBITDA?
Alan Armstrong : Yes, it would. There's quite a bit of gas supply back in the gathering systems upstream of that. So recall that EQT bought out Chevron's acreage, which is a lot around our West Virginia assets. So some of our high-margin business in that area from that original dedication from Chevron, which actually came originally from Atlas. And so some pretty nice pull on our gathering systems and as well on a longer-term basis that will enable us to be able to continue to provide lower, call it, less capital investment in expansions on our Transco system with bringing supplies into that area, which is becoming more and more in demand. So yes, we would see Mountain Valley Pipeline is very positive to us in the immediate term around increased gathering flows on our system and processing and fractionation but as well provides lower cost, lower capital expansion opportunities on Transco that, of course, allow us to make higher returns and better margin on our Transco business. So we're certainly pulling for Mountain Valley Pipeline to get built.
Jean Ann Salisbury: And then how large of an operational impact, if any, could this EPA turbine emissions will create for Williams? Can you give some color on how you see the way forward from here?
Micheal Dunn : Yes, Jean Ann, I'll take this. This is Micheal. We don't anticipate that having any impact on our business and the requirements to go out and do the testing is underway, and we're seeing the results such that it will have no impact on our business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Praneeth Satish from Wells Fargo.
Praneeth Satish : So leverage is down to 3.6% this year and EBITDA is growing at a double-digit rate. So I'm just wondering with the strong backdrop, how you think about capital return for the balance of the year and into 2023? And it feels like you've raised guidance twice this year. So maybe you have some more flexibility to return capital? So curious on your thoughts.
John Porter : Thanks, Puneet. This is John Porter, I will take that. Yes, so relative to capital allocation, I might just sort of restate our current priorities and guidelines remain unchanged with the focus on our balance sheet strength and our growing dividend with very strong coverage, our strategic organic investments, including investments in modernizing our regulated assets and making disciplined new energy investments. And beyond these priorities, we maintain excellent financial flexibility to manage debt refinancing through the volatile debt capital markets we've been seeing lately, pursuing bolt-on transactions that can add scale to our core natural gas-based strategy like the Trace acquisition or to pursue stock repurchases. And I might just say a little more on the stock repurchases since I know it's an important topic out there. As you'll recall, we previously discussed initiating share repurchases based on reaching an undisclosed spread between our equity yield and our 10-year debt cost. Now obviously, since then, we've seen significant increases in our 10-year debt cost, which really would have made it increasingly unlikely that share repurchases would be triggered. So we did recently revisit those principles, and we're not only considering the current equity yield now, but we're also considering a level of expected growth in the business given the solid growth we've seen in the business now for many, many years. And the effect of this change will provide us more flexibility to be opportunistic around share repurchases, should we see a significant pullback from current valuation levels. And this might be the case if a recession gains strength and energy macro conditions were to deteriorate. And we have more confidence than ever in our ability to perform very well even through a severe recession, and we feel like our performance in 2020 during the heart of the pandemic really proved this to be true. So our current share buyback principles will allow us to act opportunistically if we see a valuation dislocation. And by the way, the strong free cash flows coming off our upstream JVs would be a great source of capital to affect share repurchases under these circumstances. So I hope that provides an overview on the capital allocation question. I think relative to the leverage, in particular, the 3.6 that we're guiding to now is obviously well below the 4.2 metric, which we believe is more of the ceiling for maintaining our strong BBB credit rating. We do continue to believe a BBB credit rating remains optimal for our business, and we are also mindful that our current metrics are benefiting from a pretty strong commodity price backdrop. But in any case, we are pleased with the financial flexibility we have had under the present circumstances and excited about our future prospects really no matter where the synergy cycle goes next.
Praneeth Satish : And then switching gears, can you talk about what you're seeing in the Eagle Ford? I think, drilling activity has been picking up. And I know you have some MVCs there. Do you think volumes could move above MVCs at some point in the coming years? Or do you think they'll kind of stay below MVCs?
Alan Armstrong : Yes. I would say just -- I would just add to that, one contract with Chesapeake, we obviously have other customers out there, and we're picking up new business out there as a result of some of that returned activity. So we're excited to see that. But relative to the one contract that has the MVCs in it, it kind of -- there's ways to go, I would just say, to get over and above the MVC out there, and it would take pretty active responses from the producers. But we are excited to see the activity, and we are picking up business from other producers out there as well that's helping us out.
Operator: Our next question comes from [Regina Devon] from JPMorgan. My apologies, Jeremy Tonet.
Jeremy Tonet: Just want to come back to the Inflation Reduction Act a little bit, if I could. Just wanted to see, I guess, what are some of the things you're watching there that could positively influence your business specifically as it relates to the tax credits? If some of those do come to fruition, how that might that impact your view of CCS, hydrogen or other?
Alan Armstrong : Yes. Let me have Chad Zamarin address that, Chad?
Chad Zamarin : Sure. Yes. Thanks. I'd say we have announced potential projects in the CCUS arena. We're very active in exploring the hydrogen potential. We've been publicly discussing the fact that we're participating in four potential hydrogen hubs that were a part of the Infrastructure Act, the funding through DOE was part of the Infrastructure Act. So we've been actively pursuing multiple opportunities to prove out those areas. The proposed tax credit would be supportive of our strategy. Certainly the 45Q credits would be very supportive of our CCUS project in the Haynesville, which would be a project that will be built alongside our lake system that would decarbonize that project and production in Hayesville. So we're very excited to see that forward. And hydrogen still got a long ways to go. The projects that we think are being discussed are primarily in support of green hydrogen, and we've got great opportunities across our footprint to complement our infrastructure with green hydrogen production, but also seeing the CCUS credits and the hydrogen credits. Together, it would be the most impactful for supporting kind of natural gas production [to happen]. So we're encouraged with those. As we spoke on previous earnings calls, those projects are in line with our expectations, and we would see projects that will move forward based on those credits. And so I'd say stay tuned.
Jeremy Tonet : That's helpful. And just want to pivot towards Haynesville a little bit here. You gave some good color, but wondering if you could provide a little bit more with regards to Trace performance versus expectations? And specifically, incremental expansion projects there. Just wondering how you see the cadence of Haynesville growth on your systems and how long is the runway?
Micheal Dunn : Thanks, Jeremy, this is Michael. Yes, Trace is performing as we expected. So, so far, so good. We've integrated the team there very well. And really taking hold of what the culture is here at Williams. So very pleased with what we're seeing there so far. On the rest of the Haynesville, we are seeing some great improvements year-over-year in regard to our gathering volumes there. So very pleased with that and across a great array of different producer customers -- we do have a number of expansions underway in the North part of the system. Some of that will come online later this fall, but we also have some in our South in Haynesville system that we are anticipating bringing on as well. So a lot of activity and associated expansion opportunities. We’re at a number of different producers there, both public and private and we've outlined that in the presentation materials, but these expansions are pretty reasonable costs as well from a capital investment standpoint just because of the backbone nature of the systems that we have built out there. We've talked about GeoSouthern driving a lot of new capacity through our systems that we had already built out a long time ago, and we're seeing the benefits of that now with these low capital investment opportunities that are driving very significant volume growth out of the Haynesville.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Reynolds from UBS.
Brian Reynolds : First question, I really want to just follow up on some of the capital allocation commentary previously. I appreciate the color. But as a follow-up, you talked about the spread between the equity yield and credit. I'm just kind of curious, just given Williams is heading towards a sub 3.5 leverage. Just wondering if there’s a point where Williams will consider sub-optimal leverage as another consideration in terms of the capital allocation framework in case Williams does not see that potential equity pullback alluded to?
John Porter : Yes. I think we are really just focused in on maintaining our BBB credit rating as really being optimal for the business. And we've got to stay mindful of the amount of tailwind that's coming from the very strong commodity prices right now. So we're taking a long-term view of the business cycles and the commodity price cycles and continue to think about leverage, what leverage target makes the most sense. But really, we're focused on the strong BBB credit ratings and being durable through many different business cycle iterations as well as having dry powder along the way too for bolt-on transactions that might really help our natural gas scale.
Brian Reynolds : Great. And then as a follow up -- appreciate the commentary on the tax credits. Maybe to talk a little bit more about the corporate minimum tax proposals. Any initial comments that you could have on the impacts to Williams? And then as it relates to NOLs, I know there's a difference between book hitting what you guys impact. So any initial takes on potential impacts to Williams there? 
John Porter : Yes. Thanks, Brian. Yes, my response will be pretty general given that we're still tracking the continued development of the legislation and a lot of the more important specifics will probably be a result of work getting done by the IRS or the treasury department down the road. But based on what we know today, we'd offer the following comments. Under the current tax code, we resumed paying some cash taxes in '25, but with a more significant step-up in '26. So this policy change would really just mean that we start paying cash taxes in '23, however this appears to just be a timing issue and not a permanent increase in tax. In other words, we would be able to claim a credit for the book minimum taxes paid against our future regular corporate tax. So from a valuation perspective, it's pretty immaterial versus the status quo scenario. In other words, the impact is really just the equivalent of advancing the government a fairly immaterial noninterest-bearing loan that might grow for three to four years and then start to decline as we utilize the credit against our regular taxes, which again become more significant in the 2026 timeframe. Now additionally, as Chad mentioned, we would also be able to use green energy credits against the book minimum tax, but not until those projects are placed into service. As you know, Williams is enjoying a lot of financial strength and flexibility right now with our 2.29x dividend coverage. So we feel like we remain very well positioned to absorb the impact of this minimum book tax which, in our case, again, is just essentially in advance to the government of the taxes that were likely coming due in a few years anyway.  And one last comment, we don't expect to book minimum tax to affect our regulated rate based assets either.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gabriel Moreen from Mizuho.
Gabriel Moreen : A couple of ones. I just want to maybe ask about the backlog and the projects in development slide. It shifted a little bit since 1Q. It seems like maybe some projects have dropped off from LNG, but also been added to the industrial backlog. Just wondering if there's any larger reads there from that as far as either competition or just demand for more infrastructure?
Alan Armstrong : Yes, Gabe, I'm looking at Micheal here to see if he had any insight on that. I don't know what would have dropped off of there, other than maybe we pulled the LNG, the LEG project off and moved that into execution. So that probably occurred is that the only thing because that was slated as an LNG project. So I expect that move. But other than that, I would tell you that we just continue to be impressed with the amount of demand for increased services on our Transco system, particularly in kind of the traditional parts of our market as well as a lot of opportunities for serving LNG in the Gulf. But I don't think there's been any shift in our business other than LEG project getting pulled from pipeline into execution.
Gabriel Moreen : And then I know it's not a huge driver for Williams, but clearly a full time in the Conway NGL markets over the last couple of weeks. I was wondering if you can just maybe speak how your assets are positioned there and whether there's been any, I guess, upside to Williams, given some...?
Micheal Dunn : Gabe, this is Micheal. Yes, I think we'll see some opportunity there to work that issue for the benefit of both ourselves and the third party there, one of them that had the issue. But right now, we are working to make sure we can accommodate volumes into our systems, but it looks like we'll be able to accomplish that and certainly helping industry out in that regard. But there will be some upside in Williams for the business that we'll take on there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.
Michael Lapides : Thank you for taking my question, as I have two of them. First one, you've gotten a lot of questions today on capital allocation. Just curious, you've made a lot of progress in moving forward with some new projects. Congrats on Regional Energy Access and EIS, by the way. Congrats on LEG as well. Just curious how you're thinking about growth CapEx for next year and the year after? And I know you're not going to give the actual number, but just directionally on -- you've got a lot of projects in the hopper. Should we think that growth CapEx in the coming years is a little bit above kind of where you're expecting this year to be?
Alan Armstrong : Yes, Michael. Not really. I mean, a lot of that's been in forecast and a lot of that money has been -- being spent already. So things like oil, a lot of that money we spend already on the pipe, a lot of the prefab work, a lot of those very expensive deepwater specialty products that we use for the interconnect, and a lot of that money was spent. The late portion of that project will start this year, and that's already in that capital budget. So I would say, while it may appear that way, there's actually -- if you look at the timing of some of the spend on these projects, it's actually pretty levelized over the period. So not really seeing any big increase and beyond kind of the normal run rate right now on capital. So excited about the projects. I would tell you, the one thing we didn't mention maybe -- and I think it's very, very unique to Williams is our ability to turn the dial up and down on modernization capital and emission reduction work on the Transco system. And so that's an attractive alternative that we have that's pretty unique. And so when it comes to capital allocation question, that's an interesting dial that we have. And obviously, share buybacks or anything else really has to compete with those returns on investing and updating our regulated transmission system. So that's probably a variable that sits out there over the longer term. But here for the next couple of years, I think our capital will be pretty ratable to where we've been seeing that barring and I'm accepting obviously things like Trace, the Trace acquisition and kind of pulling the Trace acquisition off of that and thinking about it from a growth capital for organic development.
Michael Lapides : And then one follow up and this one is a little bit granular and I apologise. But just curious -- when you're thinking about your gas production assets in Wamsutter and in the Haynesville, just curious do you have like a hedging philosophy you want to stick to or the company and the Board in more general stick to? Meaning how much of like next year, do you want to have hedged going into the year relative to your production levels?
Alan Armstrong : Yes. No, not really, Michael. It's a good question. I would say that when we see opportunity and we see market volatility that crops prices up, we tend to take advantage of that. But we're not really having to -- obviously, we're not meeting the hedge for cash just for security of cash flow, so it's really a value proposition question. And when we think that there's good upside in capturing some of those hedges or we think it's -- where the market is overheated a little bit from time to time, we'll try to pick that up. So not really any clear corporate policy on that other than to be opportunistic when we see opportunities in the market that we think are a good value for the cash flows we have.
Micheal Dunn : To add to that, in the Wamsutter, we want to be careful. We have a situation where we have a physical flow issue to three knobs. We will be pretty careful in Wyoming as well as to what we hedge up there going into the winter months.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers.
Craig Shere : First, John mentioned prospective, more accretive bolt-on opportunities in terms of potential uses of free cash flow. Can you opine on where you still see low-hanging fruit there, specifically with opportunities in the Northeast G&P as well as across the West?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. As far as strategic or bolt-on acquisitions that expand natural gas scale in Northeast and Haynesville, I don't know, Chad, do you want to talk about the landscape that you're seeing there?
Chad Zamarin : Yes. I would just say that we remain very disciplined when it comes to bolt-on transactions. We are always looking for places where we can leverage our footprint, our scale. And we do see bolt-on transaction opportunities in the Northeast and continued consolidation in the Haynesville, and virtually across kind of our footprint, including some potential opportunities that complement our transmission and storage businesses. So we'll continue to evaluate those. But I would say, I think you'll see more of the same where we've been very disciplined in making sure that anything that we do has real synergies and leverages our strength. And so we continue to feel like there may be opportunities there.
Craig Shere : And the increased guidance was not unexpected, but I think a little more than The Street was anticipating. Some of that clearly driven by some volumes that are very attractive and you all mentioned are ramping into the end of the year. So if I just annualize the implied second half, I get very close to a $6.5 billion EBITDA run rate. But The Street is under $6.4 billion and volumes are ramping. I mean I realize there's issues of commodity pricing year-over-year. But would it be fair to say that you all are pretty comfortable that you're looking good relative to Street expectations heading into next year?
Alan Armstrong : Yes, Craig, I think you described that actually very well. We do have continued growth in the next year, but I would say that that's offset by kind of the current strip obviously in terms of pricing on the E&P space, but we do have growth in that as well. So yes, we're positioned for an attractive '23. But obviously, we don't have guidance out there, and that will be somewhat dependent on how prices actually realize next year on the E&P business. But certainly, a lot of volume growth to be coming on the E&P business through the balance of the year that will extend itself into '23. And the gathering volumes in the Northeast are going to be very durable. And the growth that we're seeing in the Haynesville will continue. So a lot of very positive tailwinds, I would say, right now for the balance of '22 as well as setting up for a very attractive '23. And then even as we get into '24 and '25, a lot of the transmission projects that we're executing on right now and the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico really pile on to what's a great base of growth. So we're pretty -- I would say we're pretty bullish right now about the way the next three years are stacking up in terms of very visible growth across the business right now.
Operator: Our last question comes from Neal Dingmann from Truist Securities.
Neal Dingmann : Alan, you've touched a lot about this, but maybe a little more details on that, specifically your thoughts on maybe spending or specifically, could you talk about -- a bit of an update on your CapEx guide. I am just wondering -- you talked around that a little bit today comparatively in Q&A. I'm just wondering any more color you can give on that updated guide.
Alan Armstrong : Yes on sort of '22 or beyond '22 on CapEx?
Neal Dingmann : Yes, more for beyond, again, I kind of obviously get what you're doing this year and so more is expectations and kind of you've got a lot of exciting projects. So I'm just trying to get an idea of maybe sort of organic versus these other projects and as you said more in the sort of beyond?
Alan Armstrong : Yes. Okay. Sorry, I understand your question a little better now. Well, I would just say kind of as you lay out kind of the puts and takes right now, a lot of money being spent right now in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, as I mentioned, particularly on the well prospect and for the balance of the year. That will kind of wane off as we get into '23 as well a lot of expansion projects in our Gathering and Processing areas that will also start to wane off as we get into '23, and those will be somewhat replaced by executing on some of our transmission projects. And that group of five that we're executing on right now for 1.9 Bcf a day of new capacity. So that's kind of how I would stack that up as Deepwater, and Gathering and Processing, driving that quite a bit through the balance of this year and into the first part of next year, and then that starts to be replaced with execution around our transmission projects. So I think that's a good set up. I would say we continue to see these demand pulls on the gathering systems, while we're not building that growth in right now. Certainly potential for some of that to continue. But again, pretty efficient capital investment projects in our gathering systems relative to the growth, as Micheal pointed out earlier.
Neal Dingmann: Great. Great. And then lastly, just a quick follow-up. You've seen -- continue to see some great commodity price upside around those upstream JVs in years. I'm just wondering, can you help me a bit what -- I don't know if you can frame this a little bit, but what type of price sensitivity do you have? It appears to me that prices are going to stay higher, maybe even go higher. So I'm just trying to get a sense of sensitivity around some of those upstream JVs.
Alan Armstrong : Sure. Mike or…?
John Porter : Yes, I think it's a little bit of a moving target. We have given some good volume information in the appendix of the presentation. Those volumes are ramping pretty quickly quarter-by-quarter right now, and we'll continue to do so into '23. So we'll continue to try to provide clarity around the volumes. We've also kind of laid out what hedges we put against those. So it's a bit of a moving target, and it will change each quarter as our net production volumes continue to increase and as the overall hedge portfolio changes. But we're going to continue to provide that information in the appendix every quarter so that you can keep up with how that's changing.
Operator: We have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Alan Armstrong for closing remarks.
Alan Armstrong : Okay. Well, thank you all very much. Thanks for the great questions. Another really terrific quarter and great setup for both the balance of the year and into '23. So we're really excited about where we're positioned today and really hopeful that some of the permitting issues are going to be dealt with in light of a lot of concern over the energy crisis that is beginning to be felt here even in the U.S. And so we think that's going to bring some attention to needed permitting reform, and we intend to be front and center in trying to make that good for both our country and from Williams as well. So we thank you for joining us today, and have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-05-03 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone. And welcome to the Williams First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Danilo Juvane, Vice President of Investor Relations and ESG. Please go ahead.
Danilo Juvane: Thanks Sara, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in the Williams Company. Yesterday afternoon, we released our earnings press release, and the presentation that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong and our Chief Financial Officer, John Porter, will speak to this morning. Also joining us on the call today, Micheal Dunn, our Chief Operating Officer, Lane Wilson, our General Counsel, and Chad Zamarin, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development. In our presentation materials, you'll find a disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to our remark and you should review it. Also included in the presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconciled to generally accepted accounting principles and these reconciliation scheduled appeared at the back the base presentation materials. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong: Thank you, Danilo. Our natural gas focused strategy continued to deliver steady, predictable growth and this past quarter was certainly no exception. In fact, we posted yet another quarter of record EBITDA driven by growth across all four of our core business segments as well as our Upstream JV operations. We continue to set new records for contracted transmission capacity, and expect this record breaking performance to continue for many years to come as we execute on the six unique transmission expansion projects totaling 1.9 Bcf per day, and our GMP business remain strong with modest growth during the quarter expected to ramp up over the balance of the year. We continue to further advance our clean energy strategy through tightly aligned deals announced this quarter, including our acquisition of the Trace Midstream assets in the fast growing Haynesville region, which just closed this past Friday, and through our partnership with Context Labs, that I'll detail more when we get to our key investor focus areas. Overall, we expect strong natural gas market fundamentals and steadfast project execution to drive additional growth for our business in ‘22. And as a result, we are raising financial guidance with expectations of another remarkable year of growth. Importantly, the midpoint of this new guidance is beyond the top of our previous range. So an impressive start to the year with a number of clear catalysts for growth for the balance of the year and into ‘23. And now I'll turn it over to John to go through the results for the quarter and our raised guidance. John?
John Porter: Thanks Alan. So starting here on slide 1 with a summary of our year-over-year financial performance. Overall, ‘22 is off to a strong start. We've seen 7% growth in EBITDA or 13% if you adjust last year to remove the favorable effects of last year’s severe winter weather, including winter storm Uri. And as we'll see on the next slide, our core natural gas focus transmission and gathering and processing businesses have fueled this EBITDA growth. Although, we have also enjoyed continued strength in our Upstream and marketing businesses. Our adjusted EPS increased 17% continuing the strong trend of double digit growth we've seen now for many years. Available Funds from Operations, AFFO grew a bit more than EBITDA continuing the trend of strong growth in this measure, up 16% year-over-year. As a reminder, AFFO is cash from operations including JV cash flows, but excluding working capital fluctuations. If you compare AFFO to our capital investments of $316 million, and our dividends of $518 million, you see that we generated over $350 million in excess cash for the quarter. Also, you see our dividend coverage on this page based on AFFO continues to be very strong at 2.3x. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA metric continues to improve based on our strong growth and EBITDA and cash generation and our capital investment discipline. You see a nearly four tenths or 9% improvement in this measure in only a year. So now let's move to the next slide and dig a little deeper into our EBITDA results for the quarter. Again, another strong start this year with 7% growth reflecting the combined effect of the performance of our core business, and upside in our upstream operation. Walking now from last year's $1.415 billion to this year's $1.511 billion we start by isolating those favorable effects from last year’s severe winter weather which were $77 million, and are shown here in gray. Maybe just a quick opening comment regarding expense trends since inflation has been such a big topic lately, we've actually continued to see very solid cost control in our business. You may have noticed the $34 million increase in operating and maintenance expense on the face of our income statement. But this is really driven by a combination of higher reimbursable expenses that are offset in other fee revenue, new lease payments that were just the plan part of Transco’s Leidy South expansion project, and finally operating expenses associated with our new upstream operations. And related to the $31 million increase in SG&A on the face of the income statement, you should know that this is pretty much entirely related to the addition of the Sequent business. That also includes their bonus accrual and also an $8 million credit reserve related to a small customer bankruptcy. Moving next to our upstream operations on the waterfall chart here included in our other segment, upstream operations were at $56 million, excluding the $22 million of winter weather benefits from last year. Importantly, our first new Haynesville production only began in April so really no contribution in this $54 million yet from Haynesville. So the full amount of the growth is attributable to our Wamsutter properties. And it's a bit of an apples to oranges comparison at that. As a reminder, last year, we owned 100% of the acreage we acquired from BP only for February and March. But in the first quarter of this year, we owned 75% of the Wamsutter upstream JV which now includes the combined BP, Southland and Crowheart acreage. Shifting now to our core business performance. Our Transmission and Gulf of Mexico business improved $37 million, or 6%, primarily at Transco and largely from the Leidy South Expansion Project, which came online in phases last year. Overall, our average daily transmission volumes for Transco increased over 6% versus the prior year as we once again saw record winter natural gas demand. And Transco’s revenues are driven by reserve capacity, not actual throughput, but continued growth in actual throughput does highlight the criticality of Transco’s service. We also saw higher margins in our Gulf of Mexico business. Our Northeast G&P business increased $16 million, or 4%, driven by top line gathering and processing revenue growth on slightly lower volumes. G&P rate growth was supported by a combination of factors including higher commodity base rate, annual fee escalation and other expansion related fee increases that more than offset lower cost to service rate at our Bradford franchise. The slightly lower year-over-year Northeast volumes in the first quarter were anticipated in our initial guidance, and we expect a continued quarterly increase for the remainder of the year compared to the first quarter of ‘22 levels. We continue to expect a gradual increase in overall Northeast volumes throughout the remainder of the year. But ultimately, our plan for the Northeast in ‘22 continues to see higher EBITDA versus ‘21 on pretty flat volumes. However, we are well positioned to resume stronger volume and EBITDA growth in the Northeast in ’23 driven by several expansion and optimization projects underway that Alan will discuss in more detail. Shifting out to the West, which saw an impressive $35 million or 17% improvement over ‘21. In the West, we continue to see upside from our commodity price expose rates in the Barnett, Piceance and Haynesville as well as substantially higher volumes in the Haynesville that drove an 11% overall increase in volumes for the West. In the West, we see a strong quarter-over-quarter growth trajectory throughout the rest of the year, and especially in the second half of the year, driven primarily by strong drilling activity in the Haynesville. Next, you see a $30 million increase in our Gas and NGL marketing services business, which includes both our legacy gas and NGL marketing business as well as Sequent. This improvement was primarily caused by the addition of Sequent in July of last year. Overall, this segment produced $65 million of EBITDA. As a reminder, the first quarter of each year is typically when Sequent creates the majority of its EBITDA. And this was a strong performance for the team. While we expect to see $50 million to $70 million of annual adjusted EBITDA contribution for this combined segment, Sequent plus our legacy marketing business, this year we've gotten off to a stronger start than expected. And with the strong commodity price expectation for ‘22, we expect to exceed this $50 million to $70 million range. So again, another strong start to the year with 7% growth in EBITDA at over $1.5 billion, driven by core business performance and upside in our upstream and marketing operations. Let's move to slide 3 to look at our latest financial guidance thoughts for full year ‘22. We are pleased to share a substantial improvement in our ‘22 financial guidance versus what we provided in February of this year. I won't go through each of these metrics, but we'll offer some commentary on the most pivotal numbers. Let's start with adjusted EBITDA where our midpoint is increasing $250 million, moving from $5.8 billion to $6.05 billion with the [tightened] (ph) range of plus or minus $150 million versus the original plus or minus $200 million. This substantial raise in EBITDA guidance is grounded in our confidence and the continued growth in our core business before considering the Trace acquisition. Specifically, we expect steady quarterly EBITDA in our Transmission and Gulf of Mexico business through the remainder of the year. The continued quarterly EBITDA and volume growth from our West and Northeast segments, with some level of acceleration through the second half of the year. Additionally, for the remainder of ‘22, we expect a growing contribution from the Trace acquisition, which closed last week as it moves towards the targeted approximately 6x acquisition multiple based on its ‘23 EBITDA. And finally, with respect to our upstream operations, we are encouraged by the results we've seen thus far in ‘22 and remain confident in the fourth quarter exit rates we quoted at our Analyst Day. Shifting down the page now to growth CapEx you'll note a $1 billion increase in guidance from a combination of the $950 million Trace acquisition value and other Trace related CapEx. Note that we've closed the Trace acquisition using a combination of cash on hand and other sources of liquidity including our revolver and commercial paper. You see that our debt to adjusted EBITDA remained steady at 3.8x reflecting the balancing of our increase EBITDA with our increased growth capex portray. The remainders of the guidance items either changed in relation to the change in EBITDA that I just discussed or remain unchanged as in the case of maintenance CapEx. So again, a substantial increase in EBITDA dollars at the midpoint driven by continued growth in our core business as well as contributions from Trace acquisition and sustained expectations for our Upstream JV operations. So with that, I'll pass it back to Alan to review our key investor focus areas. Alan?
Alan Armstrong: Okay. Well, thanks John. I am going to move on to key investor focus here on slide 4. Our natural gas focused strategy continues to play out with strong fundamentals that are driving incremental growth opportunities particularly as we continue to see increasing demand for US LNG exports along the Transco corridor, as well we’ve seen domestic demand for power and industrial sectors continue to grow despite much higher natural gas prices, admittedly, it has been somewhat surprising to us how inelastic the challenge ahead to meet this higher cost of supply is the infrastructure to connect some of the world's lowest cost supplies to this burgeoning demand. I'll point out that Transco delivered a record breaking 17.15 million dekatherms on January 3rd and while extreme winter day deliveries this volume record. It was due to growing demand in the Transco markets. And we expect this natural growth in demand to continue as we continue to see loads within our existing footprint. Our G&P business continues to thrive in the current environment, allowing us to capture the upside benefit of pricing and inflation adjusters in our rate that have been sitting on their floor for many years and we continue to execute our upstream JV strategy by realizing the near term benefits of its commodity price exposure while setting the stage for continued use of our latent midstream capacity in the longer term as these volumes grow. And now I'm going to move on to our financial strength and stability. And as detailed earlier by John we increased our guidance midpoint to $6.05 billion driven by the following. First of all strong base business performance with volumes in the Northeast G&P business expected to rebound for the balance of the year. And of course this along with the higher rates that we're seeing in some of our consolidated assets is got to set up for a very strong performance for the balance of the year. Strong performance of our Gas and NGL marketing business in first quarter, and the growing volumes and our Upstream JV, which are enjoying higher than planned pricing is another driver. And finally, incremental volume and earnings from the Trace acquisition as we've mentioned earlier, with our recent updated guidance, we expect to achieve a four year EBITDA CAGR now at 7% and an impressive EPS CAGR of 19% at our midpoint. On the whole, our business continues to fire on all cylinders, driving our financial strength and stability. And the picture actually just keeps improving, as we have been well positioned to capture the upside in this environment. Looking now at our exposure to growth, given the current strength of natural gas fundamentals in the US and abroad, we see a significant runway of growth opportunities for Williams. First of all, we now have 1.9 Bcf per day of high return Transco projects that have now moved into execution. This has been raised since our Analyst Day due to recently secured customer commitments to advance the Texas Louisiana Energy Pathway Project, which moved out of the development bucket index accusation and this project connects low cost South Texas gas supplies with LNG markets in Louisiana. Second, in the Gulf of Mexico, we secured another customer agreement at Salamanca further building on growth momentum in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, which continued to deliver more and more opportunities in response to these higher oil prices. In the Northeast, we've reached agreements with our producing customers for significant gathering expansions in both the rich Utica and the rich Marcellus. And we now have four significant expansion projects under execution that will drive growth showing up later this year and in 2023. And our strategic bolt-on acquisition of assets from Trace Midstream close last week, and this now positions Williams as the second largest gas gather in the fast growing Haynesville. This is consistent with our long held strategy to seek a number one or number two position in the key basins in which we operate. With our Haynesville gas gathering capacity now about4 Bcf per day, we continue to crisply execute on our wellhead to water strategy. In fact, we are close to commercializing the Louisiana Energy Gateway project. And given significant interest by its various shippers, we do expect to announce a final investment decision on that project soon. Our growth prospects don't stop with these projects however, we see more opportunities on the horizon even as we navigate in evolving regulatory environment. Importantly, we saw that FERC respond to concerns from both industry and legislators in a constructive manner this past quarter, and we are optimistic that regulators recognize the need for reliable permitting process to support natural gas infrastructure. Importantly, key legislative leaders have renewed their focus on streamlining permitting in our country to ensure we've got the necessary midstream infrastructure to support our country's LNG build out goals. And finally, let's look at the developments related to our new energy ventures. Obviously, as we think about de-carbonization, there are a lot of opportunities to invest in energy innovation and new technologies. As part of our strategy to accelerate the next generation energy marketplace, Williams has established a Corporate Venture Capital Fund that is set up in a way to support direct investments in startups that leverage Williams’ assets for de-carbonization solutions, as well as limited partnership funds that specifically invest in low carbon technologies. A great example of how we're utilizing this VC fund is our recently announced partnership with Context Labs on a technology solution to support the gathering, marketing and transportation of responsibly sourced natural gas from wellhead to end user. And by leveraging the Context Labs technology, we will enable supply and delivery decisions that connect the cleanest energy sources to meet real time energy needs across the country. Also supporting our work in the space we just announced a collaboration with Cheniere Energy to implement a QMRV pilot that will further the development of advanced monitoring technologies to enhance clean energy supply and delivery for Williams and its customers. So lots of exciting things happening in this space and all positioned around supporting and enhancing our natural gas focus strategy. So in closing, I'll reiterate that our intense focus on our natural gas focus strategy has built a business that is steady and predictable with continued growth, improving returns and free cash flow. Our best-in-class long haul pipes are in the right place serving the very best markets and by design our formidable gathering assets are in the low cost basins that will be called on to meet gas demand as it continues to grow. These gathering assets are irreplaceable and critical infrastructure within the natural gas value chain. And our Sequent platform that extends across the natural gas pipeline and storage industry is providing infrastructure optimization services that create value for Williams and our customers while mitigating downside risk. You've heard me say it before, but we remain bullish on natural gas because we recognize the critical role it plays and will continue to play in both our countries and the world's pursuit of a clean energy future. Natural gas is an important component of today's fuel mix, and should be priorities as one of the most important tools to aggressively displace more carbon intensive fuels around the world. Our networks are critical to serving both domestic and global energy demand in a lower carbon and economically viable manner. And finally, as we look overseas to the energy crisis in Europe, and its ripple effects on energy security, the importance of affordable and reliable energy supplies on a global scale has now taken center stage. Williams is excited about the important role we will play in meeting the dual challenge of delivering increasing amounts of reliable affordable energy, while also continuing to decrease greenhouse gas emissions around the world. Utilizing our critical infrastructure that is connected to the best natural gas basins in the US to increasingly serve LNG export facilities. And growing US demand for clean affordable energy is a great place for our organization to start And with that, I'll open it up for your questions.
Danilo Juvane: Operator, please open the Q&A line.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Reynolds of UBS.
Brian Reynolds: Hi, good morning, everyone. Maybe to talk on the EBITA guidance a little bit, I was curious if you could provide a little bit more colors, the upside and downside of the EBITDA range. First look at apples-to-apples comparison seems like commodity exposure is really the main driver of guidance in addition to the Trace acquisition. I am just wondering if you have anything to add to that, in addition to that, if there are any volumetric assumption changes to the guidance update. Thanks.
Alan Armstrong: Yes, actually, the drivers are kind of primarily as you stated that the driver absolutely are based business. If you look at first quarter volumes in the Northeast, and you consider the rebound that we're seeing from very active drilling operations, a lot of that in the third and fourth quarter just due to infrastructure issues, but on our part, but that is the primary driver is just seeing a nice rebound in the Northeast. Actually, we're, I would say we're being pretty modest in our expectation of pricing. And in fact, if you look at this quarter, Haynesville really didn't even produce this quarter, other than the base level it's been producing at and certainly didn't contribute to EBITDA. So the upside that we have is really just from volumetrics, those with a pretty modest assumption on pricing for the balance of the year. So really the drivers, the primary driver for growth is first, our base business and second, the E&P in the Haynesville and that ramp up that is going very well at this point but did not contribute in the first quarter. And then finally, is the Trace acquisition in that order in terms of the value.
Brian Reynolds: Great, appreciate that color. And then maybe as a follow up on just the evolving regulatory environment, it appears that there's some near-term tailwinds and support natural gas and LNG infrastructure permitting. I was curious if you could comment on this evolving environment and curious if Williams is considering adding new Transco growth projects for FERC approval for the docket that may not have been pursued in the last year, the beginning of this year? Thanks.
Alan Armstrong: Well, I would just say, first of all, we have a long list within that six projects that are under execution. And we are encouraged in our discussion with the FERC. And their clear desire to see good projects that reduce emissions in the markets they serve. And so I would say we're very fortunate to have a number of projects that actually reduce emissions in the markets they serve. And so we certainly are seeing support out of the FERC and obviously, they've been moving projects through pretty quickly. On the increment, I would say nothing really changed that much for us, it's just kind of a steady beat, right now of continued demand from customers and RFPs that we're responding to and working with customers on. So I will say that, I think on the one hand, you kind of have this popular notion that gas demand is not increasing. And on the other hand, the reality is it is increasing. And we're certainly seeing that through RFPs coming from our various customers on the demand side. So we're pretty excited about the way the future is shaping up on that front. And we do think particularly at FERC level, that they are being supportive, particularly of projects that we can demonstrate reduce emissions in the markets we serve. And we have a great track record of working with the FERC in a constructive manner. And we expect that to continue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chase Mulvehill from Bank of America.
Chase Mulvehill: Hey, good morning. I guess the first question is just really on LEG. It sounds like that you guys are getting close to FID in that. Could you talk about I guess how much contracting that you still have left that you need to accomplish and how much capacity that you expect like to be in maybe the total cost there as well. And I'm going to follow up after that.
Chad Zamarin: Sure, hey, this is Chad. So LEG is at full capacity to 1.8 Bcf a day project, we have over half of that contracted today, we would expect to achieve sufficient level of commercial contracts over the next couple of months to FID the project. We see a pretty significant need for volumes that are growing in Haynesville to get to Gulf Coast markets. And so I would feel pretty good about that getting done. Mike Dunn is going to talk about the capital project.
Micheal Dunn: Yes, I would say so the capital cost estimates are really pretty much in line with the other projects that we've been executing on the large diameter type activities. We're not ready to disclose the actual capital investment opportunity there. But I mean suffice to say that the returns are very nice. And the fact that we also have options on the pipe right now really tells us that we are locking in on what we think the cost will be, just because the volatility of steel prices right now are pretty uncertain. And that's been going on for quite some time now. And we were able to acquire some options on some surplus pipe from cancelled projects, you can apply that towards the LEG project. So we feel good about the material costs right now that we have the budget and certainly feel pretty good about the capital costs that will take to construct it, based on what we know today.
Chad Zamarin: Yes, and important to just remember that when we executed on the Trace acquisition Quantum did, and we announced the Quantum will be an equity partner in the project. So that'll reduce our capital load a bit. And it could be that we bring in an additional equity partner in the project. So we will I think de-risk a portion of the capital budget and benefit of creating that full value chain from truly wellhead to water across our infrastructure and we'll work with our partners on the project to optimize the entire value chain.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay, all right, perfect. The quick follow up is just directly on that strategy of wellhead to water. We do get questions from investors about midstream and if they would ever consider LNG export facilities, obviously, we've got one of your peers out there that obviously considering this. So I guess my question to you is, would you ever consider building an LNG export facility?
Chad Zamarin: Yes, I'll start and then Alan follow up. I'd say for the Haynesville strategy, the wellhead to water, there's a pretty good existing footprint of LNG export facilities that we're focused on connecting to. We are the largest infrastructure provider to the LNG terminals across the entire footprint. So for the near term, our focus is on making sure that our customers can access those LNG terminals. And also we can connect our customers to the very best markets, whether those are domestic or international. So I think our strategy of building that full value chain is not dependent upon us building and operating LNG terminals. And so our strategy today is to serve as a reliable supplier to LNG export terminal and then increasingly provide access to our customers to those LNG markets. I don’t know, Alan, if --
Alan Armstrong: Yes, no, I think you said that very well, Chad, I think, obviously, there's a lot of project debt that's utilized in that space today that gets those down to some pretty low cash on cash returns that we think is a great way to make sure there's plenty of capacity to get out if we determined that there wasn't going to be plenty of capacity to get out. And we might consider that but as it sits today, looks like there's plenty of new capacity that is trying to get built and at low costs. And fairly low returns given the project financing things like this project. So we see better places that we can put our capital to use better today than they are. So that keeps us focused on the areas we have very strong competitive advantages, as Chad pointed out.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Praneeth Satish from Wells Fargo.
Praneeth Satish: Thanks. Good morning, just staying on the Haynesville. There's a lot of midstream companies now that are evaluating takeaway projects, including you guys. I guess my question is, how competitive is it to secure contracts for a new pipeline? I mean I know you have a head start on LEG because of the Trace deal. But do you think you can generate the same return on LEG as you would on Transco projects? Just trying to get a sense of competitiveness.
Alan Armstrong: Yes, that's a great question, I would say generally, probably not is because our returns on Transco have gotten to be very much higher than then the normal projects. And thanks to the efforts of the environmental opposition and making pipeline permitting so difficult in the areas that we operate, it's allowed us much higher returns in that space than would normally be allowed. So yes, it's definitely more competitive. We like it. Because we've got follow on business upstream and downstream with Transco. So it makes the kind of total incremental return on those projects attractive, but it is not as high as kind of bolt-on expansions that we see on Transco today just because of our strong competitive position in those areas.
Praneeth Satish: Got it. And then maybe if you could just give us an update on producer activity in the Northeast, sounds like you're positive given the gathering expansions you've announced, but do you see the potential for a more meaningful volume increase in 2023? And then maybe tied to that where do you stand in terms of NGL volumes versus frac capacity? Do you see the need to expand frac capacity at any point over the coming years? Thanks.
Micheal Dunn: Good morning, this is Michael, I’ll take the Northeast question. We saw in the first quarter of this year, really a convergence of several things that impacted volume in the Northeast, really across the entire basin. And a lot of that was driven by reduction increases that occurred in the fourth quarter of ‘21, where a lot of producers accelerated their well path connections early in order to hit great exit rates for the end of 2021, which was great for our systems. And we saw a lot of peaks on our systems in 2021. But that obviously hurt ‘22 performance in the first quarter with all of that really execution and then the decline that occurs from those new wells. So we saw that and we saw really significant winter weather in the Northeast this year, something that we haven't seen in several years of this magnitude and that did impact a lot of the production from the producer freeze off. And not only just on our systems and the producers on our systems, but the production that was gathered by others that would be brought to our processing facilities. We also saw some impacts there. So we did see inlet plant volume declined because of that. And then finally, we had a producer that had the well path that came online that had significant levels of condensate, which is good for them from a production standpoint, and it overwhelms their facilities. And so they weren't able to bring those volumes to us until they rectify that situation. And so that's been fixed. But that did impact some significant volumes from that producer in the quarter. So we had several big items that impacted that and developed and we expect an acceleration of volume coming on between now and the end of the year. And we have talked about volumes in the Northeast being somewhat flat this year, from some of the producers talking about being in maintenance mode, but we do see 2023 shaping up pretty well with the four expansions that we have underway across all of the dry and rich basin in the Northeast.
Alan Armstrong: And just to be clear, when we say we're talking about flat volumes that we're saying flat to ‘21. So it'd be a growth point from where we are here in the first quarter for sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gabriel Moreen from Mizuho.
Gabriel Moreen: Hey, good morning, everyone, with some of the gathering contracts now it sounds like being off the minimums from I guess commodity price standpoint, I was wondering if there's a possibility for getting enterprise rise rules some for sensitivity to net gas prices overall. And I'm also just curious, what gas price forecasts are using in your guidance now?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, thanks for your question. I don't think we've released that sensitivity on price. We have said the contracts that we have, there are around our Laurel Mountain midstream business with EQT in the Marcellus has that feature as well as the Barnett gathering contracts in total and with total in the Barnett Shale, so those are kind of the two primary areas of exposure to those. There's a lot of areas of smaller ones, but in terms of any significance, those are bigger ones. But we have not provided that. In terms of the pricing that's in there, I would just tell you, it's, we're not counting on the kind of current pricing that we have, obviously for the balance of the year. And so we're being I would say a bit conservative about what we expect for the balance of the year, because we do think given the kind of growth that we're seeing in both the Haynesville and it's gearing up in the Marcellus and Utica that the workflows do, we can't very well on one hand, see the kind of prices to remain at these levels. And so I would say that those two things have to be considered jointly.
Gabriel Moreen: Got it. And maybe if I can just ask one follow up on the Haynesville. After, hopefully, like FIDs in a not too distant future just how you're feeling about your current footprint there relative to kind of where you want to be, clear there's some other assets, I think that are out there on the market. So maybe you could just kind of speak to that as your balance sheets kind of giving you more room here, I think to play some more offense.
Alan Armstrong: Yes, I would just say, we're as usual, we're going to be patient and picky and we've done that, and that served us well. In the case of Trace, we kind of caught that at from a timing standpoint. I think we caught that at a great timing, and we had unique considerations that we had to offer Quantum and Rockcliff they're both in terms of access to LNG markets via our LEG and Transco systems as well as an interest in LEG with Quantum which was valuable to them so we will continue to look for those kind of unique opportunities as they pop up where we've got significant value that we can add between us and environs, so I wouldn't say we're not going to look at everything because probably will, but I think we'll remain fairly patient and picky about how we choose our points of growth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from J.P. Morgan.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to touch on Appalachia a bit more and I guess the production outlook there and given how egress constraints impacts up production, just wondering now they have Mariner East online, you have the shell cracker coming here. With higher I guess egress or demand for NGLs? Are you starting to see any more pivot towards liquids rich areas? Or is it really focused still on dry gas more given the higher prices? Just wondering how your conversations with producers are going now when do you think -- how do you think that shape through could growth materialize this year or next year do you think, seems like it's --
Micheal Dunn: Hey, Jeremy, it’s Michael. We are seeing growth expectations increasing for ’23 in both sides of the rich and the dry. We've got an expansion in Northeast PA underway that comes on line in 2023, unlocking additional volumes through our gathering system and the expansion that we spoke of are really done in the rich areas so we're working with [Ancino] who is the producer of [Indiscernible] acreage from Chesapeake years ago. They have access to both rich and dry and the Flint Cardinal gathering systems that we have and they can found those -- both between the dry and the rich so they have that benefit of being in close proximity there. And so they're just taking advantage of capacity when it becomes available. And we have some interconnect that we're increasing capacity to be honest, well, to put digital volumes and execution at Grover from those systems and so those will come online next year but in fact just been locked our capability to move gas out of the system and then taking advantage of latent capacity so they'll [Indiscernible] pipeline so I would say we are seeing pretty excited growth coming into ’23 from definitely the rich side with the support of NGL and condensate prices that are tied to WTI. And right now we are seeing our processing complex in the OEM as [Indiscernible] where we had some impact as I said earlier from the winter weather with production being hit into those systems. We are back full now and we're working on our interconnect between our OEM systems and the Blue Racer system so that we can utilize link capacity there when it’s available and vice versa, ultimately, and so that will certainly unlock some additional opportunities there to continue to grow rich volume.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Thanks for that and just wanted to touch on higher net gas prices a little bit more, if I could. And whether these higher prices impacts you thoughts on monetizing William Center, Haynesville, ENP assets given the strong price in gas here. And at the same time, higher prices, more volatility leading to wider basis differentials. Do you see this kind of maybe driving more upside in through the Sequent operations in the near term given this backdrop?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, great question, Jeremy. And I will tell you, I've been really impressed with the way our commercial teams have been working together on Sequent, so I'm going to go into the back -- to the end of your question for really, if you think about Sequent and the way that they run the business of optimization, being in a basin that is starting to get crowded from the transport standpoint and start to have volatility in the bases and allows to capture an aggregate supplies into then turning that into an infrastructure solution is exactly what we bought Sequent for. And that's turning in to be a pretty powerful tool for us and probably while I've certainly expected over time for us to get there, I've been very impressed how quickly the teams have come together to materialize some opportunities on that front. So really excited about that. And I think not just the nice performance that we got out of Sequent here in the first quarter, but as well, just seeing strategically what it's doing for us in terms of intelligence in the basin, and dealing with volatility in basin, as markets grow. And optimization of capacity becomes critical as you get up near the limits of the basins, capacity to export. Again, that allows us then to aggregate those supplies that need optimization, and then that of course, gives us a front seat as it relates to infrastructure solutions for that, so really that has gone according to plan and then some I would say. On the question of monetization of the EMP business, remember that first on the long starter, our primary goal and the real value there is for us to build getting those volumes built up and so the structure that we have today there with Crowheart which incense them to, in very powerful incentive to dramatically grow volumes. And then that cash margin of that kind of regardless of pricing environment that cash margin that flows back to us through the midstream asset is exactly what we're looking for, which is obviously a much more durable solution than depending on high prices here in the current environment. So that strategy remains intact. And we remain very focused on getting the volumes built up in that basin before we would think about the next step of monetization, which may very welcome there. On the angel side, somewhat similar, except that in that structure, the undeveloped not existing producing reserves, but the undeveloped acreage does transfer over as that -- as the development is done by GeoSouthern and they are just doing an incredible job, I want to give them a lot of credit here on the way they've been managing as an operator out there on the drilling operations. And we're really excited to see what that's going to mean for us both in terms of responding to this very strong pricing environment we have on gas and here in the near term, but as well the volumes and the cash margin that we'll get from the downstream assets in the longer term. So both of those are going extremely well. But the Haynesville obviously is going to be a much more near term catalyst for growth just given the ability to very quickly attack and drill out the acreage there in the Haynesville, but some of that value will be transferred in the undeveloped acreage not in the producing acreage, but in the undeveloped acreage will transfer over to GeoSouthern over time. Isn't that Chad?
Chad Zamarin: Just that is the pace there. Currently, there are three -- at GeoSouthern is running in the Haynesville on our position and at that pace, we would see that reversion of interest on the undeveloped occur sometime in early 2023. So it's a kind of self-fulfilling in the Haynesville. So that'll happen naturally.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.
Michael Lapides: Hey, guys, thank you for taking my question. One modeling one and one kind of citing and permitting longer term one, just on the modeling one, can you remind us I want to make sure I caught this correctly, what was the Sequent contribution in the first quarter? And what do you expect for the full year?
John Porter: We are speaking to a run rate in our overall combined marketing business of Sequent and our legacy NGL and Gas marketing at $50 million to $70 million for -- on a normal run rate. What we said though, is that the $65 million that segment produced in the first quarter, given the strong start that we've seen, and the price outlook for the rest of the ‘22 means that we'll likely exceed that range for ‘22. But $50 million to $70 million is what we're targeting is sort of a normal run rate for our overall marketing business, which is now combined Sequent and our legacy gas and NGL business.
Michael Lapides: Got it. And then on the permitting front, I know there's lots of discussion in DC about doing things that can make development of gas infrastructure asset easier over time, but we just saw the administration in the couple of weeks, revised the some of the NEPA related requirements for gas infrastructure, which strikes me that would actually make it a little more onerous in the citing and permitting process. And we just saw yesterday, a challenge to a license amendment for a Louisiana LNG project that already has an EIS. I'm just curious kind of from your thinking longer term, what do you think the messages that are coming out across the board or in terms of either from policymakers, environmental groups or others in terms of the desire but more importantly, the process for citing and permitting the asset infrastructure?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, Michael, great question, that model that we study a lot. And I would just say, first of all, that is not a well-oiled machine we're talking about there and I'm not sure if sometimes the right hand knows what left hand doing in that regard and certainly the FERC got some very clear instruction from the Energy and Natural Resource Committee. So I think that was very helpful in terms of getting the FERC lined out. The CEQ activity that you spoke about was certainly a step backwards, but frankly, really the previous path that the Trump administration set on CEQ was helpful, but it really hadn't -- had that much impact yet on but it definitely was a step backwards. I wonder if that was a little better communication within the administration, I kind of wonder if that would have come out, given the need for that and the desire for natural gas infrastructure to get permitted, but it certainly was a step in the wrong direction. I don't really have a comment yet on that EIS and re-licensing issue that you mentioned, I am not familiar enough with that I'd like comment on that. So we have to just say, yes, we think there's a desire from the administration, and certainly from some of the key Senate committees to streamline permitting. But I'm not sure that everybody's moving in lockstep with that amongst the various agencies just yet, but I'm very hopeful, given the direction that FERC responded to. I'm very hopeful that we'll see that -- to see some work.
Michael Lapides: Here just following the changes to the policy statement, making a draft and taking comments, et cetera, or something else along those lines?
Alan Armstrong: Well, I would say a couple of things there. I mean, yes, certainly, that's positive. But as well, we saw a lot of certificates get issued that have been pending for some time there pretty quickly as well post the hearing that the Senate Committee held. And so we thought that was very constructive. And frankly, our discussion with various commissioners indicate that they really are serious about trying to get good projects that have the ability to reduce emissions that are being done within permitted responsibly, including very intense stakeholder engagement. They're serious about getting those permit and we think that’s very thoughtful --.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Jean Salisbury from Bernstein.
Jean Salisbury: Hi, good morning. And how close do you think the Haynesville is turning out of capacity today? Do you think that it will actually run out [Indiscernible] before the next wave of projects come on? Beginning with go front or it's like not that close, but maybe next year?
Chad Zamarin: Yes, this is Chad, Jean. Good question. I think that the Haynesville, it does have takeaway capacity that we see providing relief through probably the next couple of years. I would just note though, that the traditional angel capacity wasn't necessarily built to the markets that need the gas today. So it's not the most efficient path for getting gas to the growing markets, which is why our Louisiana Gateway project, we think makes a lot of sense, we are targeting that project moved directly from the Haynesville south to grow in LNG in industrial markets on the Gulf Coast. So we do see the capacity that will allow the Haynesville growth to continue over the next couple of years. But we see a need for projects to come online in the 2023-2024, sorry 1.4x timeframe.
Jean Salisbury: Great. That makes a lot of sense. And then sort of a related follow up. We're obviously kind of getting tight on gas takeaway from all of the major tier one databases. Are you starting to see any increase in interest or planned activity from the so called tier two basins like the Barnett or the Flint set the current gas strip?
Micheal Dunn: Yes, Jean this is Michael, we are at capacity. We've got a lot of capacity available at the Rockies, for example. So I would say you'll see some uptick in activity out of the Rockies to move gas out of there with those pipes that were built historically to move that Rockies gas. So there's definitely opportunity to continue to increase from those basins that you called tier two. And we have a large footprint there, certainly in the Rockies. So we're pretty optimistic about that. We're seeing some drilling activity in the Barnett as well. But most of that is keeping production flat to slightly growing on our systems there, a lot of that's been drilled out and it’s more tough environment to drill in with mostly being urban there. But we are seeing some activity that's very pleasing to us with the rate structure that we have there in the Barnett. So I think for us, the producers with takeaway capability and available, you're going to see some increased activity if these prices continue as they happen.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sunil Sibal from Seaport Global.
Sunil Sibal: Yes. Hi, good morning, folks. And thanks for all the clarity on the call. So I just wanted to go back to the venture capital fund, which was mentioned for clean energy and greenhouse gas monitoring. I was curious, if you could talk about the investment opportunity in there in terms of the size and threshold on returns on that?
Alan Armstrong: Sure, yes, I would just say, we're being pretty modest in those investments, we have a pretty tight screening process in that regard. And we're not putting large amounts of capital to work right now on that, but it is important capital, because we do think it has a long term be a differentiator, and we've been very clear with ourselves that we want to think about where the buck is going in that regard. And we do think that reducing methane emissions, and overall greenhouse gas emissions from our natural gas value chain is absolutely essential for natural gas to be the powerful tool and be considered the most powerful tool at reducing an impact and positively climate change. So we are dead serious about making sure that on QMRV front, and our ability to in an unassailable way certify responsibly sourced gas, we think that's going to be very important in the long run. And so that's not super expensive because it's not big capital. But we are certainly engaging our organization and making sure that we don't sit around and wait for really good solutions to be developed, we think there's a lot of efforts going on that front. But we think at the end of the day, those are going to have to be really strong unassailable solutions that people can trust. And whether they're an NGO, or they're a gas producer, that it can be trusted. And so we're very focused on that. And we want to be there on the front lines of that, but it is not big capital, that we're investing in that space right now. In terms of the return component, the areas that we're we are investing more sizable amounts of capital, like in our solar business, we are targeting mid-teens returns on those projects. Obviously, that's not available in the merchant space around renewables today, and we're well aware of that, but given the fact that we've got our own load to serve there, and we've got a lot of the essential facilities already in place. That reduced the capital load on that that's what drives the higher returns here. So Chad, again, if you anything to add?
Chad Zamarin: Yes, if you look at that on the venture capital fund, we have been smart investing alongside proven venture capital investors that's not our core business, and is couple of existing funds. On the Context Labs investment we're actually investing alongside -- Energy Partners they are the largest investor in that platform which again we really like a highly credible investor who and are relatively small minority investment so does allow us to have significant impact over and how that technology will get develop in deployment and we want to make sure that we can help bring to market the very best de-carbonization solution and so I think the strategy of finding really promising technologies partnering with investment platforms that understand these markets and know how to put good money to work and then having RC at the table to influence the direction of the technology so that it achieves the goal that we are all trying to achieve and so that’s how we're approaching the investment strategy.
Sunil Sibal: Got it. Thanks for that. And just one follow up I think you mentioned about the gas prices and I was curious how is that -- production that you have ex player to hedged thought end of 2022 or for 2023.
Micheal Dunn: Yes, So, Sunil thank for the question. As we discussed in Analyst Day our upstream hedging program we've been pretty much focused on supporting our original street guidance and the underlying capital investments that we're making in those upstream businesses protect the plan, upstream gross margin, and those have been at favorable prices versus the original guidance. Couple points, though, because a good portion of our production volumes is really dependent on future production. We generally don't hedge more than about 70% of our expected exposure for the year. Also in this environment with the strong current pricing that we're seeing, we do expect that operators will push for volumes beyond what those original plans were, but until we see those volumes really materialized, we don't intend to hedge more than really 70% of those originally expected volumes. We do as we've already discussed, we do have significant contracts that direct exposure to prices as well above a floor, especially at the Barnett and in the Marcellus. So those contracts also provide us with exposure to gas prices beyond the Upstream JVs.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kania from Wolfe.
Alex Kania: Great, thanks. Maybe just a follow up from earlier discussions on policy, but from the administration, you've talked about the agencies, but also do you think that there's a chance that we may be able to see some sort of kind of legislative kind of work being done that maybe kind of is kind of sort of an all of the above sort of strategy coupling clean energy incentives with kind of more focus on natural gas. And then maybe on a related question, on policy, are you seeing kind of this department of commerce review on solar kind of impacting your, I guess, the $100 million or so a placeholder that you've got for solar this year, or kind of whether it's impacting any thoughts for future years?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, I'll take the first part of that, and I'll hand the solar question off to Chad. First of all, I would just say on the policy question, normally, my immediate response to that would be void to a crowded field of issues, and would be hard to get any movement on energy policy. But Senator Manchin has been very well seated and very well positioned to drive to the solutions, and he has been putting forth some thoughts on energy policy, and I'm very, very thankful for that. Because I think the timing is right, to get some attention to that, and to actually come up with an energy policy. People would I think all of us would question whether we've actually had an energy policy or not. And so I think the timing is right for that. And I think getting some clarification on that would really benefit our country and hopefully, set legislation in place that puts aside some of the ways that we continue to stand in our own way as a country and using our natural gas resource as both a powerful economic driver for us which, I think in the next year or so, we're going to wish we had as well as a powerful geopolitical tool, obviously. And so I think the timing is right. And I think we've got a really good advocate for that in Senator Manchin. So I would just say, we're very hopeful on that front. I'll turn the solar question over to Chad.
Chad Zamarin: Yes, I would just say that we are watching proposed tariffs, we're watching the discussions regarding incentive structures for solar. And I will remind you that our solar program is primarily focused on installing solar and facilities where we utilize power that in many cases is more expensive than standalone solar that we can install. And so we are -- the economics of our investments are primarily driven by our ability to install solar projects that, frankly, compete even without incentives, and almost irrespective of some of the cost pressures that we're seeing. So as it relates to the $100 million that we've talked about this year, I'd say not so much affected by the policy issues. But I will say that we have, we're keeping a close eye on supply chain issues, we are under no time demand to install our solar facilities, by date certain and so we are going to make sure that we time those projects appropriately. We don't get caught subjected to higher prices than we need to pay for materials because of kind of supply constrained issues. And so we're keeping a close eye on the supply chain side of things, which has a much bigger impact, we think, at least for the projects that are currently underway, then kind of the policy issues that we're keeping an eye on.
Operator: And I would like to turn the call over to your President and CEO, Mr. Alan Armstrong. Please go ahead.
Alan Armstrong: Thank you very much, and appreciate everybody tuning in today and appreciate great questions. I just want to reiterate here on the backhand that the drivers for the growth for the balance of the year are really powerful and really across our base business, the Marcellus and Utica as we discussed, obviously, the Haynesville growth is powerful. And I think people are starting to see strong evidence of that. Deepwater business, we've got a couple of really nice tie in projects this year that will add to value towards the end of this year. And one set or later this year as our drilling operations pick up out there towards the very end of this year, we'll see volumes in the long side or that of course, will be driving the base business as well out there. And then finally, as I mentioned earlier, the Haynesville, we really haven't even seen the power of that yet on the E&P side. So first quarter was definitely not driven by that, because that's really a balance of the year and into ‘23. And really attractive earnings coming out of that area as well. So a lot of great quarter, but a whole lot of firepower left here to drive growth for balance of the year and into ‘23. And with that, I thank you for your attention today and look forward to talking to you soon.
Operator: And, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-11-02 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Williams Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Danilo Juvane, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Danilo Juvane : Thanks [Indiscernible] Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in the Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon, we released our earnings press release and the presentation that our president and CEO, Allan Armstrong and our Chief Financial Officer, John Chandler will speak to this morning. Also joining us on the call are Micheal Dunn, our Chief Operating Officer, Lane Wilson, our General Counsel, and Chad Zamarin, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development.  In our presentation materials, you'll find a disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to our remarks and should review it. Also included in the presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that reconcile to generally accepted accounting principles, and these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong: Great. And thanks, Danilo and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We do have a lot of good news to share with you today, but let me just start by saying that our long-term strategy of connecting the fastest-growing natural gas markets with the best supply areas continues to deliver exceptional financial results as demonstrated by these higher-than-expected third quarter financials. As John walk through just a moment, we achieved all-time record results in the third quarter with our adjusted EBITDA of 12% compared to the same period last year driven by growth across all 3 of our major business segments.  Given our robust performance today and continued strong fundamentals, we are raising our 2021 EBITDA guidance midpoint for the second time this year to a level that is now 8% above our realized 2020 result which, I'll remind you, came in above expectations last year in a very challenging backdrop. Not only did we deliver more on our financial performance this quarter than we expected, but we continue to make strides in executing on key projects and transactions that give us a clear line of sight to sustain growth for many years to come. We'll talk a little bit about that today, but -- so for right now let me turn it over to John to provide you some insight into the drivers of this all-time record quarter for Williams. John?
John Chandler: Thanks, Alan. First of all, just what an incredible quarter we had, and a very high-level summary. The quarter benefited from nice increases in profitability from our Northeast Gathering systems and EPF lift in revenues on our Transco pipeline from new projects have been put into service over the last year. Significant contributions from our upstream operations in the Wamsutter and the benefit of higher commodity prices in our West segment. The positives were offset somewhat by slightly higher operating expenses resulting from increased incentive compensation expenses, reflective of the strong performances unfolding for the year.  And you can see that strong performance in our statistics on this page. In fact, once again, we saw improvements in all of our key financial metrics. First, our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up $153 million or 12%, setting a new record. And we've seen a 10% increase in EBITDA year-to-date. We'll discuss EBITDA variances in more depth in a moment. Adjusted EPS for the quarter increased $0.07 a share or 26%. AFFO also grew significantly for the quarter, up $217 million or 25%. And AFFO, I'll remind you, is essentially cash from operations, including JV cash flows and excluding working capital fluctuations.  If you put our year-to-date AFFO of $3 billion up against capital investments year-to-date of $1.2 billion and dividends year-to-date of $1.5 billion, you can see that we generated over $300 million of excess cash year-to-date. Included in those capital investments I just mentioned with $307 million of maintenance capital. Also, you can see our dividend coverage based on AFFO divided by dividends is a healthy 2.17x for the quarter. This strong cash generation and strong EBITDA for the quarter, along with continued capital discipline, has led to our exceeding our leverage metric goal, where we currently set at 4.04x net debt to EBITDA.  You'll see later in our guidance update in the deck that we've moved our guidance for the year from where we were at less than 4.2x for the year now to around 4x at year-end. So really strong performance for the quarter and the year, and the fundamentals are set up for a good fourth quarter and a very good 2022. So now let's go to the next slide and dig in a little deeper into our EBITDA results for the quarter. Again, Williams performed very well, realizing a -- 153 million or 12% higher EBITDA. Our upstream operations added $55 million to adjusted EBITDA this quarter.  This is almost entirely from the Wamsutter upstream acreage production from the combined assets, mostly from Wamsutter totaled 232 million CFEs a day for the quarter net to our ownership. Again, the Haynesville upstream acreage, but is very little EBITDA given it has only a small amount of existing PDP reserves. And therefore it will take a little time before we see new production and therefore EBITDA, coming from those assets. Our transmission Gulf of Mexico assets produced results that were 8 million more than the same period last year.  New transmission pipeline projects added 24 million in revenue versus the third quarter of 2020, including the Southeastern trails project that went into service in the fourth quarter of last year. And a portion of aligning South project that also went into service in the fourth quarter of last year. And you can see this evidenced in the growth in our firmed reserve capacity, which is up 4% from the Third Quarter of last year. Offsetting this somewhat was Gulf of Mexico revenues that were down due to incremental impacts from hurricane shut-ins during the quarter from Hurricane Ida in comparison to the hurricane impacts from the Third Quarter of last year.  Just so you have a number there, the incremental impact this year was a negative 5 million versus the Q3 of last year on hurricane impacts. In addition, the transportation revenue increases were offset somewhat by a slight increase in operating expenses, mostly due to employee related expenses. A large part of which can be attributed to higher incentive compensation accruals. The Northeast G&P segment continues to come on strong to attributing $46 million of additional EBITDA this quarter.  Collectively, total Northeast gathering volumes grew 470 million a day for 5% this quarter versus the third quarter of 2020, while processing volumes grew 20%. The volume growth was predominantly at our joint ventures in the Bradford supply hub where we benefited from a gathering system expansion on that system in late 2019. And at our Marcellus South supply base and where we benefited from more productive wells at larger pads. And just to be clear, because we do not operate Blue Racer Midstream, those volumes are not included in the volume statistics I just quoted.  As a result of these increased JV volumes, our EBITDA from equity method investments improved by $45 million, which also included the benefit of additional profits from blue -- blue ratio midstream, again, due to our additional ownership, we acquired in mid-November of last year. Otherwise, in the Northeast, higher revenues from higher processing volumes were offset by higher expenses. Again, with a significant portion of those expenses being related to higher incentive compensation accruals. You go to the West that segment improved by $48 million compared to prior year.  35 million of this increase is related to higher commodity margins due to higher natural gas and higher NGL prices. Otherwise, the remainder of the [Indiscernible] lift in EBITDA comes from lower operating cost due to lower maintenance fees and due to the absence of legal costs and small asset write-offs that occurred in the third quarter of last year. And revenues for the West were only up slightly compared to the same period last year. Now they're a number of big items that go opposite directions in revenues that I'd like to point out.  First of all, for example, remember that we've lowered our gathering rates in the Haynesville this year in return for undeveloped upstream acreage from Chesapeake in the South Banfield area in Haynesville. The resulting gathering revenue decreased from this during this quarter was more than offset by rate increases in the Barnett and the [Indiscernible] where our gathering contracts allow us to participate in the upside when prices are higher. Also last year, our partner on Overland Pass Pipeline was paying us a deficiency fee to allow them to pull volume off of OPPL. Those deficiency fees do not exist this year.  However, the assets of those fees are being offset by fees from prior gathering volumes otherwise. And to that point, overall gathering volumes in the West were up 1% with higher volumes in the Haynesville and the Piceance being offset somewhat by lower volumes in the Wamsutter in the Barnett. And then finally the Sequent segment produced near flat adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Sequent traditionally makes a significant portion of its profit in the first couple of quarters of the year in the heart of the winter season. And therefore, did not realize profit for the quarter.  Sequent does have significant portion of their transportation capacity hedged with basis swaps, as well as our storage inventory hedged with nymex positions, which of course led to the large $277 million unrealized mark-to-market loss on those hedges this quarter, as prices increased and as basis differentials widen in some markets. This, of course, means that the intrinsic value of our storage and transportation positions have gone up significantly as well. And again, you will see a significant portion of that value realized in the first half of 2022.  Now to go to the year-to-date results. Again, our year-to-date results showed strong growth of $383 million or 10% and adjusted EBITDA. Many profitable things that are happening across all of our segments. First, I'd point to Winter Storm Uri, which added $55 million in profits to the West. And it contributed $22 million of income -- profit store upstream results. In addition, our upstream operations otherwise have added an additional $83 million year-to-date, almost entirely from the Wamsutter properties.  Our transmission in Gulf of Mexico assets is up 30 million or 2% better, with the increase is being driven largely by additional transmission revenues from new projects that have been put into service and incremental revenues from Gulf of Mexico assets, largely due to lower downtime this year versus last year. These positives were partially offset by lower revenues due to a Transco rate place decline following the rate case final settlement in mid-2020 related to just a few markets. And as a reminder, a majority of our Transco rates actually increased in 2019. In addition, expenses are higher this year, year-to-date due to higher incentive compensation expenses resulting, again, from our strong performance. The Northeast [indiscernible] is up $124 million for the year, almost entirely driven by profits from our JV investments, again, mainly from the Bradford supply hub gathering systems and our Marcellus South gathering systems. In addition, we've benefited from increased ownership and Blue Racer Midstream. In total, gathering volumes for the Northeast are up 8% over the third quarter of last year, while processing volumes are up 22%. And then in the West, our West [indiscernible] is up $71 million, and this is on top of the $55 million that we earned from Winter Storm Uri.  The $71 million increase is driven by higher commodity margins, higher gathering rates in the [indiscernible] offs where we participate in the commodity upside, and lower operating costs. These positives were offset somewhat by lower deferred revenue in the Barnett, Lower Haynesville gathering rates, which again, were exchanged for upstream acreage and lower Overland Pass Pipeline profits from lower actual volumes shipped and the elimination of the deficiency payments that we were receiving in 2020. And while we did see a 4% gathering volume decline year-to-date in the West, that was mostly offset set by minimum volume commitment payments.  Again, this is stacking up to be an incredible year for us. In one of the thing I do want to point out we did pickup in some of the narratives from some of the analysts last night, the view that our operating costs increased and we did ourselves a bit of a disservice by not providing more information on our other operating segment where our E and P upstream operations reside. Actually, if you look on the face of our financial statements, our operating expenses went up $73 million. $12 million of that came from Sequent who, by the way covered most of that with their profits. E&P went up $51 million on costs, but of course, they're making significant EBITDA, so they're covering that with their revenues.  And then the rest was related to bonus expenses. So our expenses actually doing -- when you extract Sequent and E&P and the bonus costs are actually down otherwise, so we actually are not seeing a significant -- or are seeing expense increases in pack with the contracts through other than the bonus-related expenses. So I thought I'd clear that up. I will now turn the call back over to Alan to cover a number of key investor focus areas. Alan.
Alan Armstrong: Great. Well, thanks John. And we'll move on here to slide 4 covering key investor focus areas. Our natural gas focused strategy is delivering even better results than we expected in this high commodity price environment. Demand for natural gas in the third quarter was surprisingly inelastic against this higher-than-expected pricing environment. And while we would prefer more moderate natural gas prices for our business over the long haul, the recent demand resilience highlights the near and long-term role that natural gas will play as a complement to growing demand for renewable energy and emission reduction in general.  The past 18 months have demonstrated the benefits of our high-quality portfolio of contracts through which we've thoughtfully built a business that is durable in the down cycles, but exposed to upside potential when it is available. This quarter's results show how meaningful that upside can be even after excluding our upstream results. Along these lines, we also have contracted our business over the years to be protected from inflationary environment, and we see additional upside potential in our G&P businesses due to contract terms that adjust our rate for inflation. In short, our business and its contractual portfolios are set up with the long-term investor in mind, and are positioned to thrive through these cycles.  So looking at our financial strength and focus on long-term shareholder value here, we are increasing our '21 financial guidance for the second time this year as we've mentioned with our EBITDA midpoint now residing at $5.525 billion. And that is 8% higher than last year's strong $5.105 billion of EBITDA, and of course that was a feat by itself in the environment that we're in. So we're really excited to show our durability in the down-cycle and our exposure here on the positive side is well coming through. And while the past few years have been characterized by lower commodity prices and reduced producer customer activity, among other challenges, our updated '21 EBITDA and EPS guidance, the midpoint translate into a three-year [indiscernible] of 6% on the EBITDA and 17% on the EPS.  So a three-year [indiscernible] on our EPS now it's 17% at that midpoint. And of course, this is proving up our ability to produce reliable and growing earnings under a variety of market conditions. Our financial results in '21 continue to de -risk our Balance Sheet, which is now at about 4.0 leverage. And also of note, we recently issued $1.25 billion of 10-year and 30-year bonds at the most attractive interest rates ever issued here at Williams. This is significant because we are now positioned to allocate capital to a variety of options that will provide compounding value to our long-term shareholder. To this end, we've continued to grow our stable quarterly dividend through our investors and remain steadfast in maintaining the long-term security of the dividend.  And most recently, we unveiled our long-term capital allocation priorities, including a $1.5 billion opportunistic share repurchase program that has the potential to enhance shareholder returns beyond the dividend. And perhaps most unique to Williams as we think about capital allocation, is the option we have to grow dependable earnings by investing in the modernization of our regulated transmission systems, which will both grow earnings and as well as reduced emissions across our footprint. Next here, looking at growth, from a project execution point, we continue to deliver on multiple fronts, including bringing online key projects such as lighting South, which we are targeting to bring into full-service earlier than projected and importantly, before the winter heating season.  While projects, such as REA, remain in the execution phase, we've continued to receive first in demand full projects on the Transco system. Our 2 recently announced Mid-Atlantic expansions will add a little more than 500 million a day of capacity on the system. And in the coming weeks, we expect to secure precedent agreements for another system expansion, bringing a total of 3 incremental expansion projects on Transco just during the last half of '21. Our natural gas fundamentals are not only supportive of our transmission assets, but also our G&P business and our gathering volumes continue to grow at a rate of nearly 10 times the Lower 48 U.S. gas production volumes.  This supports were led by the Marcellus growth where we are also growing a rate that is almost double that of our competitors, and you can see the layout of that in some slides we put in the index. With projects like Leidy South and REA providing takeaway out of the basin, we expect our gathering volumes in the Northwest -- Northeast, sorry, to remain resilient. In fact, we expect to announce a system expansion in the basin soon, underscoring that we don't see takeaway constraints of the near-term deterrent to volume growth in our systems there in our Northeast gathering area. And finally on sustainability. As we think about sustainability both today and into the future, our highly reliable natural gas infrastructure is extremely well-positioned to continue replacing higher carbon fuels while supporting the growth of renewable energy and responsibly-sourced natural gas for LNG export.  Looking forward and anticipating future innovations and technologies that we can use on our key energy networks to deliver on our country's clean energy future. And to this end, we are pursuing emerging opportunities like a hydrogen hub near assets in Southwestern Wyoming and are evaluating a large-scale co-development of wind energy, electrolysis, and synthetic gas via [Indiscernible] in the, state of Wyoming as part of our recently announced in MOU with Orsted. Our solar initiative continues to move forward as we now advance the execution of now 12 projects on our systems, and those are as we've mentioned before, large solar arrays that will provide power for our fairly large loads on our compressing and processing. So now, looking at our renewable natural gas efforts, we set a 2021 goal of adding an incremental 5 million a day of renewable natural gas. And we now expect to exceed that goal. We recently signed an interconnect that should enable up to 10 million cubic feet per day of the new source of [indiscernible] supply, bringing our entire already [indiscernible] portfolio close to 25 million cubic feet per day with in-service [Indiscernible], in the '22 through '23 time-frame. A lot going on on that front, seems doing a great job of making sure that we're capturing opportunities in and around our assets there. We do remain steadfast in the view that natural gas will play a role in the world's clean energy future.  And our latest efforts to advance responsibly [indiscernible] through the value chain will provide transparency on the sustainability of our operations and help to solidify the role of natural gas and reducing emissions. We're also pursuing sustainable investment opportunities and are pleased to be partnering on 2 strategies with energy impact partners and investment firm that makes venture and growth investments in companies that are optimizing energy consumption and improving sustainable energy. Williams is among the first Midstream investors in the platform, and we're expecting to facilitate diverse investment opportunities that reduce emissions and advance our ESG goals.  Finally, our ongoing focus on sustainable operations continue to deliver strong results that are being recognized by our key rating agencies in this state. Williams sits in the top quartile for our industry with rankings that reflect the dedication of our team towards doing the right thing from an ESG perspective. So here in closing, a lot of really positive things to report on this quarter, demonstrating that our intense focus on natural gas-based strategy has built a business that is steady and predictable with continued growth, improving returns, and significant free cash flows. This has translated into a strong balance sheet and a well-covered and growing dividend. And our best-in-class long-haul pipes, like, Transco and Northwest Pipeline, and Gulfstream, are in the right place and in the right markets.  And by design, our formidable gathering assets are in the low-cost basins that will be called on to meet gas demand as it continues to grow. The triple-punch of benefits provided by American source natural gas must not be understated as we work to accelerate our clean energy future around the world. As we work to balance sustainability and climate goals with growing energy demand, natural gas will remain a key component of the fuel mix and should be prioritized as renewables complement the more aggressively displaced more carbon-intensive fuels around the world. Natural gas does provide right here, right now, emissions reduction solution that is economically viable and can keep industry and manufacturing here at home. William’s transmission and storage networks are extremely well-positioned to aggregate and bring to scale to multiple mission reduction opportunities, taking out higher carbon fuels while supporting renewable energy and emerging opportunities like hydrogen and carbon capture. So in closing we produced tremendous 3Q results. But more importantly, we have an unmatched platform to continue to deliver growth and lower emissions at the same time. We look forward to helping our customers and stakeholders meet their goals in an environmentally and financially sustainable manner. And with that, I'll open it up for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please stand-by while we compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.
Alan Armstrong: Good morning, Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet: I just wanted to touch on these strong results this quarter and how we should think about that going forward. If I look at the guidance raise, it doesn't necessarily seem that all -- the benefits that materialized in 3Q fully translate into 4Q. And so just wondering how much of this is sustainable, how much growth -- is this a level that could be built off of into 2022 EBITDA. Just trying to get a sense for what's recurring here in the strength this quarter.
John Chandler: Yes. We did take an accrual for bonuses for the year, and both on our long-term incentive comp as well. I see a lot of [Indiscernible] adjusting that out of their EBITDA. We don't adjust that out of our EBITDA. So our long-term incentive comp did take some accruals for that as well as our annual bonus, which obviously with this [indiscernible] And so those -- that was a hit to the quarter that would be negative -- on the other side of that, we had about $24 million, I believe, of pricing increase on our NGLs and inventory, and so to the degree that that doesn't increase again, that would offset against that positive that shows up in the quarter.  So that's a non-operational issue, if you will, we have to price that inventory up, but to the degree that NGL prices don't move again and that wouldn't show up. So that's just a couple of 1 positive, 1 negative. I will just say we pay attention to the forward strip when we think about our forecast and our guidance, and obviously, those are backward dated, as we sit here, and so our expectations would be the same moving forward as it relates to the E and P business. I will say that's not a huge driver of our business obviously it’s pretty [Indiscernible]. As you can see, it will become larger in '22 as we start to -- the Haynesville starts to get developed.  That will be a net positive that where we will build larger sensitivity to gas prices in '22 as the Haynesville starts to, be developed. I would just say we know this was a good quarter in terms of pricing and we're not going to build our business in a way that's just sustained off of high commodity prices, and that's hopefully evident in how we forecast our business as well. Nice to take the winnings when they come to us, but we're not going to build -- we're not going to forecast our business around that. Obviously prices do stay high, then we'll certainly see the rewards.
Alan Armstrong: And Jeremy, just as it relates to this year's guidance, obviously, I think by our mainstream probably now we're somewhat conservative on how we do things. That's probably a bit of that embedded there. But also we left ourselves some flexibility that relates to the fourth quarter if we wanted to accelerate, for example, gifts to our foundation, we've dealt things like that, that would be expenses from otherwise [Indiscernible] after and so we do have some flexibility and some capacity to do things like that.
Jeremy Tonet: Moving along here, I guess next question I have is in the build back better build here. Just wondering what implications do you see for your business here it seems like it could be different things that 45 [Indiscernible] some other energy transition initiatives in a bill and at the same time, 15% minimum tax. Just wondering if you could walk us through some of the pluses and minuses that you see. The bill, if passed as written, how would it impact the [indiscernible]
Alan Armstrong: Well, certainly we would keep our eyes on the alternative minimum tax, and I'll let John speak here in a minute to that. I think as it relates to things like the increasing to 45Q amount, obviously, that would be positive for us, particularly as we think about utilizing our infrastructure for carbon capture and in places like the Gulf Coast where we have a pretty sizable footprint that extends out to some of those water drive reservoirs that the key targets for carbon sequestration. So lots of positives I think in that area on the methane emissions issue. We are really encouraging that to be done in a way that rewards those who reduce methane emissions.  We think it's smart to continue to put focus on methane emissions reductions, and we're extremely well-positioned for that. But we would much prefer one that rewards the good actors, here and that, and not just a pure [Indiscernible], but one that does [Indiscernible] those that have been working to reduce their emissions. And we think we stand out in that regard and we think that would be a net positive for us if it's positioned that way. Obviously, we think that makes sense when you're talking about the lowest, carbon content hydrocarbon. It seemed a little bit odd that you would just put a pure tax on that when it has such an ability to help reduce emissions around the world.  So we're hopeful that we'll get to a wide place on that, but we think that actually could be positioned in the way that could be somewhat of a positive force. So we will look forward to that. So I think that's, I don't know, Chad or...
Chad Zamarin: Yeah, Jerry. This is Chad, just on the last note on the hydrogen front. The hydrogen incentives as currently drafted would be I think a good complement to our current strategy. And so we've been working closely on that front because that would be supportive as well as our -- supportive of our goals on that front.
Alan Armstrong: Just as it relates to the alternative minimum tax. There's still a lot left to be discovered there. I would tell you on balance, obviously, we prefer a lower corporate tax rate and an alternative minimum tax than the inverse. A&P is just timing of pipe tax payments, higher tax rates forever and permanent. If that's where we land, the question is going to really be around that NOL usage against under the old tax scheme while we had an alternative minimum tax before. You could take up the 80% of your NOL's against your income, for an alternative minimum tax calculation. That's not clear in the current legislation.  As we've thought about it, we've seen -- let's say we could take 50% of our income out, usage of our NOL's. That alternative minimum tax would be not that size before us. We'd probably be able to cover it with excess cash flow. So that's how we look at it now. But just to be clear, there's still a lot of questions around the usage of its [indiscernible] going forward. Can you use 50%, 80% or use them at all? And so that's still yet to be understood. And just you know is an additional factor. We're carrying forward $4 billion [indiscernible]
Jeremy Tonet: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christine Cho with Barclays. Your line is open.
Christine Cho: Thank you. Good morning. Maybe with the out-performance this year and [indiscernible] tracking below your target, how should we think about the execution of the buyback that you announced a couple of months ago?
Alan Armstrong: Yeah, Christine, thank you for your question. I kind of expected we would get that. And I would just say that we've been pretty clear about how we're thinking about that, and it is a multiple of the cost of our 10-year debt costs of the market per 10-year debt costs, and so you can see that -- that spread with price actually kind of wide -- or did widen. And so that yields continued to go down and there was way from that multiples earned a period since we announced buyback. But I would say as we don't make investment in that or if we continue to invest in earnings, either one of those will continue to drive our credit metrics to more positive place, which will drive down the 10-year debt, which then will improve the price on [Indiscernible] would lower the yield, which we would invest in.  I think it's pretty natural in terms of how that will occur if money is flowing in a way that is improving our credit metrics, you would expect our 10-year rate to continue to improve, which we continue to lower the yields and eventually, we would hit a point at which you would be buying back, but we certainly stand ready. And if that price moves to that zone, will be anxious to be taking advantage of that, if that occurs. nothing's really changed from our perspective on that other than the fact that our amount of free cash flow continues to expand and accelerate. But other than that, nothing's really changed here this quarter since we announced that.
Christine Cho: And you would be okay with just having your leverage trend below 4x if the opportunity to buy back factored in presents itself.
Alan Armstrong: That's right. And I will just say though, as we've mentioned before, obviously the one kind of unique option we have is continued investment in the right base in a way that modernize this and reduces emissions on our system. And so that's not a hair-trigger, so to speak, because we have to plan for that and that permitting process that we don't snap the fingers at. That's something that takes time, but that's obviously another place that money will flow through our capital allocation costs.
Christine Cho: That actually was my follow-up question around the modernization program. Can you just remind us how this works? How much you spend per year, the return how quickly you can earn on the spend and then I guess as you mentioned, what regulatory process we're looking at?
Micheal Dunn: [Indiscernible] Hi Christine it's Micheal, we're we're working on both fronts with Northwest Pipeline customers, as well as Transco customers and working to enact a tracker. If we can get to a position with them. And if we can't, we would go through our normal rate case process to seek recovery of those emissions reduction projects. And we believe we've got a worth of about $2 billion or so that we could invest between both Northwest and Transco. On those projects that could be a very long-term program, over maybe six years or so. So would you start doing the math on that, that's $3 to $500 million a year potentially that we could deploy there. Depending on the spend profile and how many projects we want to take on at a time.
Christine Cho: If you don't come to an agreement with your customers, would you have to recover it through a rate case or is there something quicker?
Micheal Dunn: No, we would have to go through the rate case process and that's obviously one of the reasons why we would like to have a tracker to accelerate that recovery and not have to go through the thrush and the rate case and the disruption that occurs with the customer base there. But we're prepared to do that if we need to, but we would certainly like to do it through a tracker mechanism. Very similar to what many of our customers are doing in their jurisdictions.
Christine Cho: And the returns?
Micheal Dunn: Returns would be very similar to what our regulated returns would be on either Transco and Northwest Pipeline once those rate case outcomes are known.
Christine Cho: Great. Thank you.
Alan Armstrong: And Christine, I'll just add there just to remind folks on -- when we do file those rate case, we still -- we do go ahead and raise our rates. We don't have to wait for the settlement in rate case once we file those rates. So that is your call that -- we hold that in reserve sometimes pending that. So -- but we do have the authorities go ahead and charge higher rates.
Christine Cho: Right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Your line is open.
Shneur Gershuni: Hi, good morning, guys. I wanted to start off a little bit here. You've had a strong performance last year, strong performance this year, or heading into the end of the year, you should be based on your guidance, you've had a growth target in the 5% to 7% range. The question I have is, does any of the performance in this year, takeaway from next year? But at the same time, you've announced several Mid Atlantic projects. You intimated that there's another one potentially coming in your prepared remarks. I was just wondering if you can share some detail about the return expectations of these new projects, and are they high enough to help drive growth forward. Is there a backlog of more of these projects that we can see more announced overtime?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, Shneur, thank you. First to the projects, I would just say our returns generally continue to improve. One of -- it's been, as we've said many times, it's a double-edged sword about the difficulty off building projects. It certainly has been detrimental to the country and the industry overall. But to the degree that you're the incumbent with pipe in place and you could expand those in brownfield. It effectively expands your return opportunity in that regard. So I would just say that the returns in general, not saying that they always will be that way, but in general, these returns that for these mid-Atlantic projects that we're mentioning are at least as good as Atlantic Sunrise or better. And so that's kind of the way to think about that REA 's and attractive return projects as well.  And the question of how many we have, we keep the slide updated in there about the number of projects in development in our appendix. And it always looks like it's the same old slide, but in reality, that we are moving projects from development into execution. And we have new projects flowing in there that are keeping that pipeline very full. So I will just tell you, we don't see much backing off in the way of opportunity for expansions of our transmission systems. And with that obviously will flow gas from the low costs, reducing areas. And we're well-positioned to capture that on the gathering side as well.  So despite what you might think, when you listen to the media and the rhetoric, it's certainly not showing up in people's reluctance to make long-term commitments to our transmission systems for supplies that they know they're going to need. Whether that's the backup renewables or whether it is a base load people, and our customers certainly understand that it takes time to build these projects and that it takes long term commitments to be built. that's what we'll continue to see.
Shneur Gershuni: Really appreciate the color there. Maybe if we can return to the return of capital priorities. In your response to Christine's question, I think you were fairly clear in terms of you were looking for the opportunities to execute, but at the same time, your balance sheet is obviously doing better than expected. There's a priority over growth, how we discussed in the last question here. Just curious if one of the other arrows in the quiver shall we say, would be around the dividend. Are there any thoughts around a dividend step-up, or specials, or is there a different payout ratio that we should be thinking about as part of your return of capital strategies?
John Chandler: Yes, I would say never say never, but I would say right now, we just continue to maintain that steady growth and continue to maintain the growth in our business that's commensurate with our cash flow growth and obviously to continue to maintain that high level of coverage of the dividend there. So don't expect -- we don't expect anything special if we did some asset sale and, by the way, don't run off with that one, because there's no
Alan Armstrong: intent behind that was something special or some structure that delivered a bunch of cash then we would consider that. But right now, there's -- I think you should expect steady growth in our dividend that's well covered and very durable. And we think this is the business we've built, the long-term durable business as I think we've proven out. And we think that our yield on our dividend audit continued to trade down plus the durability and the growth in our dividend. And I think it's a pretty hard. Dividend to compete but frankly, given its security and the growth in it by both utility sector and within our peer group. And we think eventually we'll be rewarded for that.
Shneur Gershuni: So all else equal buybacks are probably the preferred [Indiscernible] at this point, if you hit investor returns section?
Alan Armstrong: Well again, I mean we've laid out the options. The market will tell us whether we need to buy back shares because it's presenting an opportunity or not. And if it presents itself. We'll be all over it. And if it does, the value will continue to generate through these other notes.
Shneur Gershuni: Perfect. Thank you very much, really appreciate the color today.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Praneeth Satish with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Praneeth Satish: Thanks. Good morning. You touched on this earlier, but if we assume that the Biden administration passes for [Indiscernible] on admission, what exactly could that mean for your business? I guess, how further ahead are you than peers, and do you think this helps you win new customers or pull volumes from competitors?
John Chandler: Yes. I don't know exactly where we stand up against peers. I know where we stand on the One Future measures, and we're almost orders of magnitude lower than what's required for our elements of the sector. So again, that One Future is a 1% all the way from the E&P space, all the way through the [indiscernible] or to the delivery to burner tips. so we're excited to be a part of that, but there's a certain percentage of that 1% that's allocated to our sectors of the business. And in those cases, we are way below and as I said, orders of magnitude below back. So we think we stand well, but we really don't know exactly where other competitors might stand on that.  And therefore, what kind of advantage might [indiscernible] But I do believe that we need good, honest, reliable operators in this space that are going to be focused on methane emissions reductions. Ernest Moniz, back when he was Secretary of Energy, really made it clear to the gas industry that, hey, I love this industry, I think it has a lot to offer from an emissions reduction standpoint. But you guys have got to get your methane emissions. That's going to be your Achilles' heel if you don't go after this. And so we've been on a mission to reduce that. I think we're extremely well-positioned if the methane emissions are positioned right.  And frankly, I think it's a real positive to make sure that we're reducing flaring, we're reducing emissions and VOC s from tanks in the field. I think all these things are very positive for our industry, and we certainly intend to continue to be a leader in that space.
Praneeth Satish: Got it. And I'm wondering if you could just give us a sense of how large the projects are that you're working on with Orsted as part of that JV or MOU [Indiscernible] returns per day basis or absolute dollar cost basis, just trying to get a sense of how big the projects are. And then just tied to that. it's the hydrogen subsidies that are part of the reconciliation bill passed. Would that accelerate your hydrogen development plans?
Micheal Dunn: Yes, it is in Chad, thanks for the question. Maybe starting with your last question. Yes, the incentives will be supportive in accelerating project opportunity. I mean, as we've discussed, hydrogen has been -- without an incentive structure and really needs an incentive structure to help support being projects jumpstarted. And I would also say that it's still early days on the hydrogen front. We're at the pilot stage. I would characterize project opportunities, but as far as our ambition goes, and if things prove out, if costs continue to come down, which we expect they would incentives get passed in Wyoming, for example, Alan talked about the potential to develop an energy hub in Wyoming in partnership with watershed and others. You could envision a very large
Danilo Juvane : wind power production facility, 3 to 500 megawatts, if not larger, there's tremendous wind resource in Wyoming that hasn't been fully developed because it's not easy to build electric infrastructure to deliver that power to markets outside Wyoming. We have pipeline infrastructure that can deliver that energy at other parts of the country. We can build a very substantial wind power generation platform tied to several 100 megawatts of hydrogen production that we can move through we believe we could move through our existing infrastructure to customers across our footprint. Those are big ambitions.
Micheal Dunn: And I will tell you again, its very early innings, but the pieces are coming together and we're very hopeful, we're going to start by crawling before we walk and put some projects online that I think will demonstrate the feasibility, but that gives you just one example and they are looking at others across our footprint, but that's one example of where we think we can get to scale.
Praneeth Satish: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Spiro Dounis: Good morning [indiscernible] (ph). First question, just on inflation from 2 different angles. First, just curious if you guys are seeing or do you expect to see any sort of impact on the cost side? And then alternatively, imagine a lot of your contracts, such on the G&P side, probably had some sort of escalators in there tied to CPI or PPI. So curious, how should we think about any sort of upward pressure on fees as we head into next year in this environment?
Micheal Dunn: Good morning. This is Micheal. We are watching with supply chain issues and the inflation issues very closely. We got in front of the supply chain concerns early on with treating chemicals and lube and things of that nature to make sure that we had what we need to operate the business. And I do would expect, we are seeing price increases, fuel, diesel, gasoline, prices are up through this small component of what our overall expenses are in business. And we could likely to be managed appropriately. As you mentioned, the bulk of our gathering and processing agreements do have escalators in them, so we are protected there on the gathering and processing side and on the transmission side, we could obviously take advantage of rate cases if we need to.  But we've done a really good job managing our costs for several years now. And so we've been in very good shape for a number of years and managing that. And I suspect our teams will continue to do a great job at that. Going forward to year and take advantage of opportunities where we can to control our costs, but we will see some increased costs and there's no doubt about that. And the escalators that we have, there's various escalators that we use in the gathering and processing agreements. And I believe that would definitely cover the expense increases that we'll see.
Spiro Dounis: Got it. Thanks for that color, Mike. Second question just switching gears slightly to the Permian. I know you are all focused on gas basins and that's certainly served you well. But I know at one you had considered Blue Barnett as a pipeline out of the basin. And obviously, I think we're seeing that basin tighten a lot faster than we all are expected with some of your peers talking about another pipeline, potentially as early as 2024. Just curious on any interest levels in the Permian in general and how you're thinking about Blue Barnett and your competitive nature there?
Alan Armstrong: Yeah. We've certainly positioned ourselves where well there to take part in projects that come up. And I would just tell you, so far, we like the risk mitigation that we get out of the kind of projects that we do with 2 or more market or unit and not 7 and 10-year kind of contracts that are just basis differential pipeline, that once that basis differential slides, they come out of the mining. And with a number of pipelines in the market today that fit that bill, every yard getting written down or struggling for re-subscription. Not yet in the Permian, but you say it's always an issue of risk-adjusted return and those are big risks on the back end of pipeline that are easy to use more on the front end, but hard to ignore on the back end. And we think about our business on a very long-term sustainable basis.  And so tends to drive us towards longer-term contracts, and ones that we know that the value will be in there for the transportation for the long haul. I'm not telling you that we will be looking to take part, but with the returns would certainly have to be better than our other projects that we see within our capital stack.
John Chandler: And it's jagging and we have been expanding the capabilities of Transco, received volumes from the Permian. You think about our project strategy. If you look at the projects that and then approved projects we focused on, we connect directly to demand. And that is a very strong, sustainable, I think strategy. And as Alan mentioned, typically the demand contracts are very long tenured and we'll keep an eye on Permian [Indiscernible] as you mentioned, unless we can tie those projects to long-term contracts or to demand that we know will be sustainable. Then, we will probably fit that bill.
Spiro Dounis: Got it. Appreciate the color guys, and John, congrats on the upcoming retirement.
John Chandler: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Colton Bean with Tudor Pickering Holt. Your line is open.
Colton Bean: Morning. So just circling back briefly on the Wyoming energy hub, is that an area we're willing to look to own a stake in the wind and electronic facilities? Would you prefer to lease the surface acreage or set and then participate further downstream on the transportation side?
Micheal Dunn: I think -- we're valuing a lot of different possibilities. And clearly, we're going to focus on whether we have strength and capabilities. The strategy there is to -- [Indiscernible] could be a part of the energy systems for, not just the next 10 to 20 years, but for the next 100 years -- what we're good at. We're going to partner
Colton Bean: with really strong, capable partners like Orsted and others. And so I think will certainly set of skills and infrastructure to make these projects possible. We're going to want to make sure that we participate where it makes sense, but I'd say it's a little bit early on to understand exactly where we're going to be putting our investments. And so, clearly after the Orsted announced we're not going to -- we're not a wind power Company. We're not a technology providers to work with us whether or not we invest in those parts of the value chain. I think we will stay unprepared to do that, if it is a smart place to invest, and what we're doing on the solar front, it's what we're doing in certain R and G opportunities. But, it's still pretty early on to figure out how all those pieces come together. But, we're constantly
Micheal Dunn: evaluating that.
Colton Bean: And then just briefly in the West, it looks like NGL transportation volumes stepped up a bit more than NGL production. Are you seeing a rebound in volumes coming into Overland Pass from the north, is there anything else to point to you there?
Micheal Dunn: Yes. Well, we're already seeing some production increases from our assets out. I'm not going to talk too much about the third-parties coming in there, but we are seeing some really good uplift from a processing plants. And I think recovery, there has been off and on throughout the summer in -- coming into the fall here is that we're seeing an opportunity to bring in additional ethane into the systems as well.
John Chandler: And we were able in the Wyoming area, even though this should have showed up in production volumes coming out on the C3. I think it's always a good thing to pay attention to the C3+ volumes as obviously the ethane comes in and out based on pricing. And C3+ is kind of a better indicator of what's available on a regular basis. But I would say that the Patrick Draw Facility in Wyoming that we picked up earlier in the year, which was an adjacent plant to Echo Springs, shows up and those volumes came directly in to our system as well. And so we also picked up some volumes off the competitor pipeline there during the bankruptcy process from South Glynn. And so those volumes flowed into this as well.  So there at [indiscernible] springs are Wamsutter facility really been able to pick up the equity volumes that are coming to us. So some of that equity would've gotten produced some of it would've gotten on a competitor pipeline. All of that is not coming into our pipeline. And so that's some of that pickup you see.
Colton Bean: Okay. I appreciate that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chase Mulvehill with B of A. Your line is open.
Chase Mulvehill: Good morning, everybody. I guess you spoke briefly about responsibly sourced natural gas during the [Indiscernible] remarks, but just a quick follow-up here. And I'd like to ask if you're seeing more interest from LNG liquefaction operators or really more interest from utility customers. And then I guess if you look at this, responsibly sourced natural gas, what's really the constraint to seeing quicker market adoption of responsibly source natural gas.
Micheal Dunn: Hey, this is Chad. Thanks for the question. What I would say is that we are seeing strong interest from both LNG off-takers and utility customers. We have a wellhead to water and a wellhead to [indiscernible] of strategy with respect to [Indiscernible] been extremely listed on our plans and [indiscernible]because we've been working very hard and walk as Allan mentioned, to have a very credible solution in place. And I would tell you that we're clearly seeing a need within the marketplace to demonstrate not only within our footprint, but the work with our upstream partners and to work with our downstream customers to really track the full life cycle emissions footprint of the gap than flows through our systems.  And so we will be announcing several solutions that we are going to be focused on delivering for our customers. We have been in discussions with several of our customers where we think we can marry the solutions that we're developing with our producing partners efforts as well as our LNG customers and our utility customers. And we want to be able to shine a very credible light on the gap that we move versus drive down as admissions over time and just circling back to Alan's comments. Also, the Transco system is the largest, most flexible pipeline system here in the United States. We had the benefit of having multiple lines and our right of way.  We can do a lot with that system to demonstrate a lower emissions footprint, today. And to show a continually decreasing emissions footprint over time, we'd want to make sure we can do that in a very credible manner. And I do truly believe we're working with the Sequent team to make sure we did market. We'll responsibly sourced products and we are seeing a real intense focus on that front to the point where we've even had meetings with utility customers that have totaled. They are looking at the midstream providers to understand the emissions footprints of their potential gas supply. And they're going to factor that into their decisions with respect to how they source their gas. We think that sets up very well for us, again, because we've got I think the most modern, most efficient system in the United States.
Chase Mulvehill: And some quick follow-up on Sequent, I guess, first on responsibly sourced natural gas, you probably got a better view than most people. Are you seeing responsibly sourced natural gas get a premium out in the market today? And if not, what do you think will be the catalyst where responsibly sourced natural gas will actually start getting a premium out in the market?
Micheal Dunn: I wouldn't think of it in terms of premium. I think in terms of the demand for our space is going to continue to drive, I think, the responsibly sourced gas, whether that -- whether you consider that to be a premium or, at some point, it will become competitive cost to play. I think it will reflect in natural gas prices and in demand for natural gas. There have been a few marketed RSG products out there and they haven't -- they think maybe attractive at a small premium.  I would also say though I don't know that anyone -- no one has yet truly tag an RSG product from wellhead water well hadn't earned it in a way that I think can be credibly marketed. But we don't think of it in terms of premium. We think of it in terms of this is going to be good for us, differentiate for what we can provide to our customers and therefore, support their goals as well as our emission goal.
Alan Armstrong: I think in the current environment, you should think about it in the context of that somebody is going to sign up for a long-term supply. Even that it's an indexed price supply. That's competitive in the market. They're going to want to know that they are -- that's the supply that is not going to have a negative connotation with it. And so I would say when it comes to doing long-term contracts at index pricing, that people are going to be asking those questions and the tight right now would you say the tide is going to go to the runner, so to speak, the responsively [Indiscernible] gap to the degree that somebody can prove that up or demonstrate that they are on a fast available to prove that out.  So I think that's about as far as it's gone at this point, but, I think it's certainly something, and I think it's pretty strong support across the industry for making that more of a determinant in the marketing space. And we certainly want to be a part of that. But it's got to be credible, reliable, and something that's got good strong data behind it that ultimately could perhaps be even trade it. And so that's what we're focused on.
Chase Mulvehill: It all makes sense. Appreciate the color. I'll turn it back over.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global. Your line is open.
Sunil Sibal: [indiscernible] good morning, folks. And thanks for squeezing me in. My first question related to the 1.2 billion of high return growth projects that you've highlighted in your capital allocation framework. I was just curious. I think you talked about some big projects in Gulf of Mexico and then, obviously, on the gas side, about, the Atlantic projects. Are there any other big projects we should be thinking of when we think about that $1.2 billion annual spend?
Alan Armstrong: I think that pretty well got it captured. I think the $1.2 billion on normal capital spend is going to go first to the big projects on Transco, some of which we've mentioned today, our continued gathering system expansions. Even though those are more limited. We're really excited about the dollars we're investing right now in the deep-water Gulf of Mexico to support big client like the Well Prospect. And so the deep-water Gulf of Mexico is going to be a real driver of growth as you look out 3 years. And then beyond that, as we've mentioned, many times, investing in the modernization of our rate base, which will come with emissions reduction along our systems.  And about $400 million of Solar projects that we are moving rapidly through the development stage right now and starting to move towards execution on those projects. Those are the primary drivers that hasn't really changed a whole lot. I would say some of the projects on Transco, are moving up from our development list into execution list. But other than that really not a whole lot has changed since we laid out our capital allocation footprint.
Sunil Sibal: Okay. Got it. And then one thing related to that, so is 3.5 to Forex kind of leverage level the right way to think about the additional debt, which could come with those kind of capital spend?
John Chandler: I would just say our -- depending on what happens with the price of our stock versus the cost of our debt will dictate a little bit of that, but there's another way. If the price of the stock came down or the yield -- yields came up in a way that mix is multiple of our 10-year debt, and money would go towards buying back stock and we would be running at the higher end of that range. If that doesn't occur, you'll see that drift down depending on how much we allocate towards the modernization projects that we talked about. And so those are the immediate variables that we'll be navigating between.  But if we -- I'll just say it's pretty strong, multiplying effect as our EBITDA continues to grow and continuing to invest in earning projects. And our EBITDA continues to grow, that move down on the debt metric. And this starts to move pretty fast. That as you see it's not -- that's not just in forecast, what you're seeing in real-time here as we continue to overperform on our debt metrics, as our EBITDA.
Sunil Sibal: Okay, got it. And then once again related to that. So when I think about your 10-year bonds you use versus the? Obviously, this year, it's kind of come in a fair bit. But [Indiscernible] that metrics [Indiscernible] dividend you were as 10-year bond yields spread. And how does -- what do you think is a normalized kind of metric to look at when you think about your stock buyback decisions. Thanks.
John Chandler: [Indiscernible] from a debt yields standpoint, it feels like we're probably going to be hovering in this 2.5% to maybe 3% range for a while on the one hand feels like treasury rates start to move a little bit now. So we'll have to see what happens on that front. Credit spreads though, I think we're performing obviously very well and I think the sector is performing fairly well as we've seen. Credit spreads tightened a little bit. We just saw that in our recent bond yields, incredible demand for our -- for mid-part papers.  So I don't think we expect long-term rates, 10-year rates with the 2.5% range, but it doesn't feel like probably going to be 3.5 or 4. So that's the first part of your question. How do we see rates, probably 3%. The other part of your question might be getting that what's the multiple? And we're not disclosing that if that's your question on dividend yields relative to that 10-year rate, that's [Indiscernible] feel smart really to signal to the market with that point is.
Sunil Sibal: Got it. I thought I would try anyways. Thanks for all the color.
John Chandler: Fair enough.
Operator: I will now turn the call back over to Alan Armstrong for closing remarks.
Alan Armstrong: Okay. Well, great. Thank you all very much for joining us. Really excited to present for the benefits of all the hard work of our employees around the Company that occult produce such a terrific quarter, both through continued great operations as well as a lot of the transactions that we've executed on this year that are driving some of these. And so it's a real pleasure to get to talk about great performance that the organizations produced. And we look forward to doing that in the future. Many times more so thank you all very much for joining us.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-08-03 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Danilo Juvane, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Danilo Juvane: Thanks, Mishawna, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in the Williams Company. Yesterday afternoon, we released our earnings press release and the presentation that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and our Chief Financial Officer, John Chandler, will speak to this morning. Also joining us on the call today are Micheal Dunn, our Chief Operating Officer; Lane Wilson, our General Counsel; and Chad Zamarin, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development. In our presentation materials, you'll find a disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to our remarks and you should review it. Also included in the presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that reconcile to generally accepted accounting principles, and these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong: Good morning, and thanks, Danilo, and thank you all for joining us today. Our long-term strategy of connecting the fastest-growing natural gas markets with the best supplier continues to deliver solid financial results as demonstrated by our strong second quarter financials across our key metrics. Our stellar results this year were supported by equally strong fundamentals that demonstrate how sticking to this strategy has put us in an enviable position. As evidence, Williams gas gathering volumes grew 6% in the first half of 2021, while the U.S.'s natural gas production volumes actually declined by 0.4%, continuing to prove that our assets are in the low-cost basins. We expect a constructive natural gas macro backdrop to continue to drive significant value for our business. Recent commitments to Transco market area expansions coupled with producer commentary on Transco projects such as our Leidy South and Regional Energy Access projects are clear pathways to growth for our Northeast gathering volumes for years to come. We will walk through more details of our business in just a moment, but I want to first call attention to our 2020 sustainability report, which we just published last week. As this report details, we are making headway on critical ESG-related fronts. For example, becoming the first North American midstream company to set a near-term climate goal based on right here, right now emission reduction opportunities and making steady progress on developing our leaders for the future. We're also looking to the future as our nationwide infrastructure footprint is well suited and adaptable to renewable energy sources like clean hydrogen and RNG blending. Williams' ongoing focus on sustainable operations positions us well to meet clean energy demand for generations to come. In fact, we are now up to 7 renewable natural gas sources flowing into our gas transportation systems, and we have 9 more that are in progress. I hope you can find some time to visit our website and read our new sustainability report. But right now, let me turn things over to John Chandler for a review of our 2Q and year-to-date results. John?
John Chandler: Thanks, Alan. At a very high-level summary, the quarter benefited from nice increases in profitability from our Northeast gathering systems, an uplift in revenues on our Transco pipeline from new projects that have been put into service over the last year and contributions from our upstream operations in the Wamsutter. These positives were offset somewhat by slightly higher operating expenses resulting from increased incentive compensation expenses, reflective of the strong performance that is unfolding this year. And you can see the strong performance in our statistics on this page. In fact, once again, we saw improvements in our key financial metrics. First, our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up $77 million or 6%, and we have seen a 9% increase in EBITDA year-to-date. We will discuss EBITDA variances in more depth in a moment. Adjusted EPS for the quarter increased $0.02 a share or 8% and AFFO grew for the quarter similar to our growth in EBITDA.  AFFO is essentially cash from operations, including JV cash flows and excluding working capital fluctuations. If you put our year-to-date AFFO of $1.948 billion up against our capital investments year-to-date of $737 million and our dividends of $996 million, we have generated about $250 million of excess cash year-to-date. Included, as a side note, included in the capital investments is about $160 million of maintenance capital. Also, you can see our dividend coverage based on AFFO divided by dividends is a healthy 1.96x year-to-date. This strong cash generation and strong EBITDA for the quarter, along with continued capital discipline, has led to our exceeding our leverage metric goal where we're currently set at 4.13x debt-to-EBITDA. You will see later in our guidance update in this deck that we've moved our guidance for the year from being around 4.2x by the end of the year to now less than 4.2x debt-to-EBITDA for the year. So really strong performance for the quarter and the year, and the fundamentals are set up for a good second half of the year. So now let's dig a little deeper into our EBITDA results for the quarter. Again, Williams performed very well this quarter. Our upstream operations added $19 million of incremental EBITDA this quarter. And this EBITDA was entirely from our Wamsutter upstream acreage. Remember that we owned the BP Wamsutter acreage the entire quarter, but only owned the Southland acreage for 1 month during the quarter. Production from the combined Wamsutter assets totaled 6.9 Bcf for the quarter. The Haynesville upstream acreage produced very little EBITDA, given it has only a small amount of PDP reserves. And therefore, it will take some time before we see new production and therefore, new EBITDA coming from these assets. Now moving to our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico assets. They produced results that were $31 million more than the same period last year. New transmission pipeline projects added $25 million in incremental revenues versus the second quarter last year, including the Southeastern Trails project that went into service during the fourth quarter of last year, as well as a portion of the Leidy South project that also went into service in the fourth quarter of last year. And you can see this evidenced in the growth in our firm reserve capacity, which is up 5% from the second quarter of 2020. In addition, our Gulf of Mexico revenues were up somewhat due to less shut-in issues compared to the second quarter of last year. In addition, commodity margins from processing volumes for processing the Gulf of Mexico gas was about $5 million due to higher NGL prices and higher volumes. These revenue increases were offset somewhat by a slight increase in operating expenses, again, mostly due to employee-related expenses, a large part of which can be attributed to higher incentive compensation accruals. The Northeast G&P segment continues to come on strong, contributing $46 million of additional EBITDA this quarter. Collectively, total Northeast gathering volumes grew 750 Mcf a day or 9% this quarter versus the second quarter of last year, while processing volumes grew 33% and set a new record. The volume growth was predominantly at our JVs in the Bradford Supply Hub, where we benefited from a gathering system expansion on that system in late 2019; and at our Marcellus South supply basin, where we benefited from more productive wells of larger pads. And just to be clear, because we do not operate Blue Racer Midstream, those volumes are not included in our volume statistics. As a result of this volume growth, though, our EBITDA from our equity method investments improved by a little over $36 million, which also includes the benefit of additional profits that we do receive from Blue Racer Midstream due to the additional ownership we acquired in mid-November last year. Now moving to the West G&P segment. It was down $21 million compared to the prior year. However, remember that first, we did agree to reduce gathering rates in the Haynesville in return for receiving upstream acreage in the South Mansfield area of the Haynesville. Again, as I mentioned, we are not yet seeing the benefit of those upstream assets but we have just named an operating partner to begin developing that acreage. The impact of the gathering rate reduction was about a negative $15 million for the quarter. In addition, in the quarter, we also saw $9 million less EBITDA due to a deficiency fee that One Oak paid us last year related to OPPL, which allowed them to pull volume that they had otherwise submitted to OPPL last year. One Oak does not have that volume obligation to OPPL this year, and therefore, we did not see the deficiency revenue this year. And finally, we did see a $9 million decline in deferred revenue from our Barnett Shale gathering assets, which is a noncash step-down in revenues. So other than those 3 negatives, namely the lack of efficiency revenue on OPPL, the Haynesville rate decline and the deferred revenue step-down in the Barnett, our West assets were otherwise up $12 million versus the second quarter of last year. And this is in large part due to higher NGL margins, where once again, in our commodity marketing group is realizing more profit from elevated NGL prices. And while our overall gather volumes in the West were down about 3.5% versus the second quarter of last year, this was more than offset by better gathering rates, where in the Piceance and the Barnett, our contracted gathering rates are influenced by commodity prices. So now moving to year-to-date results. Year-to-date, our results show growth of $230 million of EBITDA or roughly a 9% in EBITDA, driven, of course, by the impact of Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter and by many of the same positive factors that I just mentioned affecting second quarter growth. Combined between our marketing activities and our upstream operations in the Wamsutter, winter storm Uri had a combined positive impact of $77 million. In addition, our upstream operations otherwise have added an additional $27 million year-to-date. Our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico assets are up $22 million year-to-date or about 2% better, with this increase being driven largely by additional transmission revenues from new projects that have been put into service and incremental revenues from Gulf of Mexico assets, largely due to lower downtime this year versus last year. These positives were partially offset by lower revenues from 1 less billing day on a regulated transmission pipeline and higher expenses, where, last year, expenses were delayed due -- some due to COVID and because this year's expenses, again, are higher due to higher incentive compensation expenses resulting from our strong performance. Our North G&P assets are up $78 million, almost entirely driven by profits from our JV investments, namely from the Bradford Supply Hub gathering system and our Marcellus South gathering systems. In addition, we benefited from the increased ownership of Blue Racer Midstream. In total, gathering volumes for the Northeast are up 10% versus 2020, while processing volumes year-to-date are up 24%. And then finally, the West, West E&P is up $23 million versus the year-to-date last year, and this is on top of the $55 million that we earned from winter storm Uri. The $23 million increase is driven by higher commodity margins and slightly lower operating costs, offset by lower Barnett deferred revenues, lower Haynesville gathering rates, which were exchanged for upstream acreage, and lower OPPL deficiency revenues that I just mentioned in my 2Q remarks. Otherwise, we did see a 5% gathering volume decline year-to-date, but that again was more than offset by MVCs and higher gathering rates, as again, I mentioned in my second quarter remarks. Again, this is stacking up to be a very good year for us. I'll now turn the call back over to Alan to cover a number of key investor focus areas. Alan?
Alan Armstrong: Great. Well, thanks, John, and we're moving on here to the key investor focus areas here on Slide 4. First of all, regarding our financial expectations, we are on track to generate EBITDA closer to the high end of our guidance range that we just increased at the last earnings call. The resilience of our business has supported our financial results and helped us recently overachieve against our previous leverage metric goal of 4.2x. As a result, we recently received a Moody's upgrade to Baa2 and now have a BBB equivalent credit rating amongst the 3 key rating agencies. Our free cash flow outlook for 2021 remains intact. And in fact, the long-range plan unveiled during our most recent Board strategy session forecasted continued steady growth in EBITDA and continued improvement in our credit metrics. Importantly, our long-range plan also shows that even after funding these many growth opportunities, our business is poised to generate significant excess free cash flows that will support a robust and multifaceted capital allocation approach that will enhance returns for our shareholders, including the potential for opportunistic share buybacks, so stay tuned on this front. Next, looking at our recent transactions and project development. Our -- first of all, the upstream JVs, great effort on the organization here. As we announced last month, we were able to finalize an upstream joint venture with Crowheart in the Wamsutter basin, consolidating our legacy BP Southland and Crowheart upstream assets into 1 contiguous footprint of more than 1.2 million acres. So as we've mentioned before, this acreage was very divided and checker-boarded out here. And so being able to consolidate these assets in a way that it can be developed at a low cost is really critical to the value of the upstream business, important to us to the midstream business and taking advantage of the latent capacity we have out there today. And just recently, we inked a joint venture with GeoSouthern in the Haynesville that provides us with the following benefits: first, it unlocks significant midstream value for Williams through GeoSouthern's obligation to develop the South Mansfield acreage. Under this agreement, GeoSouthern will carry a portion of our drilling cost and will earn increased ownership in the leaseholds as they deliver on agreed-to development milestones. Second, it provides Williams with the opportunity to optimize all of the natural gas production in the area through fixed fee agreements marketed by our Sequent business. And third, with the South Mansfield being in close -- with South Mansfield being in close proximity to Transco, it provides Williams with future development opportunities, including the ability to source and deliver responsibly-sourced natural gas into the growing LNG market.  Importantly, both of these recent JVs improve the value proposition in the Wamsutter and the Haynesville basins as we're partnering with well-positioned, high-performing local operators and the deals require development of the properties driving volumes to our midstream and downstream assets. From a project execution standpoint, we continue to deliver on multiple fronts, including bringing online key projects such as Leidy South, which is on track for an early in-service now before the winter heating season.  And importantly, Transco growth opportunities remain highly visible, and we've recently received customer commitments for 2 new market expansion projects in the Mid-Atlantic region. Transco also has ample runway to provide additional low-risk growth through rate-based modernization projects. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we continue to highlight the great growth it continues to show for us out here, and we've recently reached definitive agreements for both the Shenandoah and the Whale projects, these will contribute to significant EBITDA growth beginning in 2024. And then finally, on sustainability. I mentioned our sustainability report at the top of the call, and we also filed our carbon emissions disclosure with the Carbon Disclosure Project last week. I'll just add that we continue to leverage our natural gas-focused strategy in today's technology to deliver on immediate opportunities to reduce emissions. At the same time, natural gas and our infrastructure are enabling the next generation of clean energy technologies. The next wave of renewable power generation will be up against 2 key constraints: both the transmission and the storage of energy. No other energy infrastructure system integrates a reliable delivery network into critical population centers with a massive storage solution on the scale that natural gas transmission does. We believe our infrastructure can be a critical part of both near- and long-term solutions.  We continue to advance our solar projects that were announced last year, and I'm pleased to share that we have 6 projects now awaiting approval from the grid operator with another 10 ready for the same regulatory approval by the end of 2021. In total, these 16 projects amount to about $250 million in CapEx. It should start to cash flows beginning in 2023, and we have another approximately $150 million of these similar projects that are under development. We are looking forward and anticipating future innovations and technologies that we can use on our key energy networks to deliver on our country's clean energy future. And in fact, in a partnership with the University of Wyoming, we recently awarded a $1 million -- we were recently awarded a $1 million grant from the State of Wyoming to fund a feasibility study that would evaluate the creation of a green hydrogen hub near our operations in Wyoming. And this really is another example of how we continue to leverage our existing assets and footprint to drive clean energy solutions. In the Wamsutter, we now have 1.2 million acres dedicated to our midstream assets through the Crowheart JV. But in addition to that, we have about 200,000 acres where we own or control the surface rights, which we intend to leverage for clean energy development. So in closing, I'll reiterate that our intense focus on our natural gas-based strategy has built a business that is steady and predictable, with continued growth, improving returns and significant free cash flows. This has translated into a strong balance sheet and a well-covered and growing dividend. Our best-in-class long-haul pipelines, Transco, Northwest Pipeline and Gulfstream, are in the right place and the right markets. And by design, our formidable gathering assets are in the low-cost basins that will be called on to meet gas demand as it continues to grow. We remain bullish on natural gas because we've recognized the critical role it plays and will continue to play in both our countries and the world's pursuit of a clean energy future. Natural gas is an important component of today's fuel mix and should be prioritized as one of the most important tools to aggressively displace more carbon-intensive fuels around the world. Our networks are critical to serving both domestic and global energy demand in a lower carbon and economically-viable manner. And with that, I'll open it up for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
Jeremy Tonet: I was just wondering if you could start off a bit expanding on your thoughts on the current gas macro outlook, and whether that backdrop drives the higher end of guide expectation. How does this position your trajectory into 2022 at this point?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Sure. Jeremy, as you know, the pricing run-up that we've had more recently and the continued demand growth is really starting to obviously put pressure and kind of wake up the forward markets a bit. And certainly, we are seeing responses from our producers looking to take advantage of that. The area that, I would say, that will see kind of the quickest response to is probably the Haynesville and tremendous amount of drilling activity that's gearing up in the Haynesville right now.  But as well, you heard -- probably follow the comments from Cabot on their earnings call. Strong response there to price there as well. And of course, in the Southwest, Marcellus and in the Utica as well, we're really seeing pretty strong response across all those areas. So I think it's important to note that this is not just a production issue. Demand continues to grow. And so if you're looking at 2Q comparisons, we've seen against the '19 2Q, we saw demand grow by 9%. And against a 2Q of '20, we saw it grow about 5.6 -- sorry, yes, about 5.6%. So continued really strong growth going on, on the demand front. And we're obviously seeing prices respond to that. But I think, from our perspective, as we said all along, it really is demand that is going to drive our business and price will fluctuate as required to balance that, but it really is this demand -- continued steady demand growth that we're continuing to see. And obviously, as we saw last year, we don't expect the COVID or a resurgence of COVID really to have any impact on that. We're continuing to see a steady, healthy growth coming on the natural gas market. So as we look into '22, kind of hard to predict what gas demand will continue to do. But right now, certainly, the fundamentals are looking strong, and we are seeing a healthy producer response.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. And I realize I'm probably getting a little bit ahead of myself here, but as it relates to buybacks, just wondering whether Williams has authorized a buyback plan. And if not, what would it take to authorize it? And as you think about -- if you were going to pursue buybacks, would something just generally opportunistic in nature make the most sense? Or something systematic where a percentage of cash flow could be applied to that in a given year? Just wondering, at this stage, what your thoughts are on buybacks in those respects?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, Jeremy, thank you. I might as well get this out of the way. I knew that question was coming. So I'll square up on this. So first of all, we did have a really important discussion with the Board last week. And I think probably what was most remarkable about that was the degree of free cash flows that continue to exist on top of funding growth capital, on top of continued deleveraging that comes with that growth in EBITDA and being able to fund both rate base investments and new energy venture investments. Allowing for all of that, we still are showing pretty significant excess amount of free cash flow. And so I think that's probably the biggest takeaway. In terms of a program, we are in the process of detailing that out with our Board and putting some specific parameters around that. But I can tell you that the recommendation will be that it will be somewhat opportunistic, but it will have some framework to it in terms of what appropriate pricing levels and what those drivers will be. And I can tell you from my perspective, that will likely be a multiple of wherever our debt is trading. And if you think about that, our debt has continued to stay very steady while stock price has flipped around. And certainly, there will be those times where the market runs into its scares like we saw in March and April of last year. But in reality, the debt markets have been very steady and yet prices whipped around quite a bit. And so we think that will point to when the right opportunities are to acquire stock. So it will have parameters around it. It won't just be perfect -- it won't be random, and will have parameters around it in both in terms of size and the drivers for that. We likely won't announce those specific multiples on the debt multiples, but that is how we're thinking about it right now. And we will be announcing -- we do intend to, I should say, announce the program once we get the details of that squared away with our Board.
John Chandler: And Jeremy, probably I'm self-evident here, but what Alan is really referring to is our dividend yield in relative comparison to where our debt trades at.
Alan Armstrong: Thank you, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni with UBS.
Shneur Gershuni: Maybe just to follow up on Jeremy's question there a little bit. Alan, in your prepared remarks, you had put a comment out there about how your projections to the Board showed steadily increasing EBITDA and steadily declining leverage. Should we think about this as there's a new leverage target that needs to be achieved? Or should we think about it as this excess cash flow is going to -- a component of it is going to go towards leverage reductions that will continue to decline? And then a portion will be available for the buybacks, whether it's 50-50 or to be opportunistic. Is that the way we should be thinking about this? I'm trying to square those comments together.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Well, I think the easiest way to think about it, Shneur, is that we, with our EBITDA continuing to grow and we hold our debt where it is, obviously, that metric continues to improve. And so really should think about it in that fashion. And so that's the primary driver of that improved credit metric. And I would just say that we will be able to balance that and make decisions on that as we see fit through the process. But there is such a significant amount of excess cash flow coming off that we really feel like we can hit all of those things we'd like to in terms of both continued dividend growth, continued credit metric improvement investment in our rate base and driving earnings assessment in our rate base and new energy ventures. We can do all of that, and we still have pretty significant firepower left for share buybacks when the opportunity is right. So really, the message we -- folks ought to be getting is that the cash flow is very significant, and it allows us to invest in all of those measures to continue to drive shareholder value.
Shneur Gershuni: I appreciate the clarification there. Maybe to pivot a little bit. I was recently reading your sustainability report and you're talking about evaluating hydrogen and you sort of talked about that a little bit here. I'm just wondering where you see Williams' role in the hydrogen value chain. Because you talked about both blue and green in the comments there. Do you sort of see Williams as really just in the transportation aspect of it? And is that where you expect to invest? Will it be on the reformation side? Or do you actually see yourself participating capital-wise on electrolysis? I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about it because as I sort of think about your position in the Haynesville, it kind of seems like a blue hydrogen strategy would be very interesting where you could participate in creation and in the transportation to industrial centers in the Gulf Coast. So just kind of curious of where you feel Williams will be, let's say, in 3 to 5 years from now on the hydrogen strategy.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I would just say, and I'll let Chad Zamarin follow up with some comments here, if he likes. But I would just start and say that what will be most obvious to you is that we're going to invest where we have competitive advantages around our assets. And so obviously, that points to transportation. But we do believe that in places like Wyoming where we've got such big land mass available and we have the transportation, and we have the processing capabilities and the system is already set up. We don't think that's a stretch for us to at least study. So a couple of things. One, it is going to -- we're only going to be doing it where we're making decent returns. And that means that we're going to have to be using competitive advantages to get returns that are over and above kind of what the market is allowing today on that kind of investment. And then secondly, you should think about it in terms of us always making sure that we are not leaving an opportunity where we have a competitive advantage. We're not going to let one pass us by, so we're not letting any -- we're not going to be taking any strikes at the plate and making sure that as we see opportunities, that we're attacking those very quickly. So Chad, I don't know if there's anything you might add to that.
Chad Zamarin: Yes. I think you said it in your remarks, we operate an incredible energy transmission and storage infrastructure, and we're very focused on ensuring that, that infrastructure is part of the solution for the next generation of energy. And so that's our primary focus. I would say it's early in the days of hydrogen and we are working with the hydrogen production side of the equation to ensure that it can be economic and that it can drive volumes to our infrastructure. So I think we will participate in a small way initially to ensure that, that technology develops in a way that complements our infrastructure and then we'll evaluate whether or not we would invest on an ongoing basis. We're working on -- you mentioned the Haynesville. We permitted our Regional Energy Access project in a way that we've defined as compatible with hydrogen blending. And we're working on a hydrogen project, a pilot project on our Regional Energy Access project that will involve us participating in the production of hydrogen. It will be a very small scale, but it will demonstrate that we can leverage our infrastructure and we will earn an attractive return on that kind of investment.  We're looking at that across our entire footprint. And as that scales up, I think it will be exactly what Alan said. It will be, "Do our strategic capabilities and assets provide us with an advantage? And should we leverage that advantage into investing in hydrogen production? Or just be prepared to support that development and drive those volumes to our assets and infrastructure?" But I can tell you, we're looking at it and read the table across our footprint to make sure that we're driving forward the right solutions to support our business.
Operator: You have a question from the line of Praneeth Satish with Wells Fargo.
Praneeth Satish: So now that you've executed on the Wamsutter and Haynesville JVs, I was just wondering if you could help provide some clarity into the incremental midstream EBITDA you could pick up in '22 and '23 versus the upstream cash flow that's lost. Just -- I guess I'm just trying to figure out how accretive these transactions will be.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I would start off with they are surprisingly powerful anytime you start adding volumes to late -- to mostly latent capacity in an area that it obviously comes on fast. So there's not any midstream permitting facilities are sitting there ready to go. So it is very powerful, and that's why we've been so focused on this. So I think we're all very excited about that. I'll let Chad speak to kind of the metrics on what we look like for growth in those areas on the...
Chad Zamarin: Sure. And I'll give a little more color on the Haynesville structure that I think will help folks derive how much value that's going to contribute. But with GeoSouthern, we're thrilled to announce that partnership, they're a well-proven operator with a long track record of development. And with GeoSouthern, there is a drilling commitment of over 400,000 lateral feet that they will be pursuing. And you think about our acreage, it's highly contiguous and you see a map, there's a map in our appendix that shows how it's complementary with GeoSouthern's footprint. So there's a lot of long lateral inventory at very economic returns. And so we expect them -- they're incentivized. There are penalties if they don't meet those drilling commitments, but beyond that, we expect them to outperform the drilling commitment because it's highly economic opportunities. And as they perform, the initial economic splits have GeoSouthern at 30% of the economics, Williams at 70% of the upstream economics, but they will carry us, our capital for upstream development up to a cap of $50 million. And once that cap is achieved, they will revert to having 75% of the upstream economics and Williams will have 25% of the upstream economics. So they're highly incentivized to continue that development. To give you an idea of how powerful that is for our midstream systems, that development, we would expect to drive somewhere around 400,000 to 500,000 dekatherms a day of volume to our midstream assets. That's incremental volume from what we have today. And that ramp occurs relatively fast over the next 18 to 24 months. And all of that gas is committed to our midstream systems at a fee of $0.32 for gathering and treating. And as Alan mentioned, that is primarily available capacity that will be extremely high margin for us. And on top of that, we then have the ability to market that gas and drive that gas towards downstream opportunities, including integration with Transco. We've talked about marketing through our newly acquired Sequent platform. We're going to be working on a wellhead-to-water responsibly-sourced gas solution that we can offer to customers. And so just the base business alone, there's a lot of value to be driven to our midstream assets in that area. And if you do the math, it will rapidly outpace what we gave up from a fee reduction perspective with Chesapeake. And so that gives you kind of a picture of the Haynesville. In the Wamsutter, similar structure a little bit and it's a very big asset that we were working on. And again, thrilled with Crowheart as our partner. They have been in the basin for several years. If you look at the map in our appendix, you can really see the industrial logic, again, of partnering with Crowheart. And we put together over 1 million acres of now-contiguous acreage. And with Crowheart, there is a drilling commitment of over 500,000 lateral feet. And as we have announced, there's a 75-25% initial split with Crowheart at 75% and Williams at 25%. But as they achieve performance across that 500,000 lateral feet of development, they have the ability to earn up to a 50-50 split. And so they're highly incentivized to drive volume growth. And in the Wamsutter basin, again, we have latent capacity that's very high margin gathering and processing. It's dedicated to us. We gather and process for approximately $0.60 a dekatherm, so very high margin business in that basin. And we have today around 300 million cubic feet a day of volumes. That system has over 700 million cubic feet a day of capacity. So on top of the gas gathering and processing, we are now -- we've dedicated all of the NGLs at Williams at a fixed margin to Mont Belvieu pricing. And so we don't wear commodity price risk, and we cover significant revenues for Overland Pass Pipeline for Bluestem and our downstream partnership with Targa. So that hopefully gives a little bit of color on how those will drive value to our midstream and downstream assets.
John Chandler: But maybe just to give you a couple of numbers here real quick because the Haynesville is different to the Wamsutter. The Wamsutter has very significant PDPs today, and where the Haynesville acreage doesn't. So we'll need to be drilling that up to produce the midstream value and the upstream value. And that will really start coming on in '22 and really into '23. That Wamsutter, on the other hand, with gas prices being quite a bit higher, is significantly paying for itself. And I'm not going to give you exact numbers here, but I can tell you what we paid for the South for the acreage from Southland and for BP will be completely paid for in less than 2 years and with where we see gas prices and just PDP production. And of course, that development will occur and you're going to see meaningful EBITDA uplifts coming in the future beyond 2022 as those new wells are drilled and that production comes on. So in the Wamsutter, you can get a sense of the return there just simply because of the PDP production and the gas prices. We'll return our capital very significantly in a very short time frame. In the Haynesville, as we look at total NPV value, yes, we did give up rates with Chesapeake in the Northern part of our system. They're bringing more rigs to work in that part of the system, but the value of that acreage as it's developed and we look at that -- I won't give you the exact number, but when we look at NPV, the value generation is at least $300 million, actually higher than that, over the life of this. That's the combination of the upstream value and the midstream value uplift from this, from the South Mansfield acreage.
Alan Armstrong: Yes, I think that's well put, John. It's, I think, also a great example of creating a win-win for us and our customer. Chesapeake has been able to increase activity. And we, this time last year, Chesapeake was still not running rigs in the Haynesville. With the fee reduction that we offered, they now have 3 rigs running in their Springridge area. And so the fee reduction has incentivized significant activity that will show up on its own as incremental earnings over time. But also, as John mentioned, through the South Mansfield transaction, we see that as virtually tripling the value of that give back from an NPV perspective. So really, with Chesapeake made the pie much larger, and we're both able to benefit from that transaction.
Praneeth Satish: Great. Super helpful. Just kind of switching gears for a second. I was wondering if you could comment broadly on the RNG business. I know in the past, you've been a little reluctant to invest in the actual RNG facilities. But now some of your peers are moving more aggressively into the space. So I'm just curious whether your views or strategy on RNG have changed at all.
Chad Zamarin: Yes, this is Chad again. I think we've said that we are willing to invest in RNG aggregation and processing if it makes sense from an economic perspective. And again, similar to what we talked about hydrogen, we have a strategic advantage. We have been looking at our footprint. We've been identifying sites that have potentially attractive economics from an RNG capture processing and delivery perspective. We think that, that opportunity set is attractive economically, but relatively small in scale. We've talked about a couple of hundred million dollars of potential investment. We have a few projects that we are evaluating where we could invest in the actual aggregation and processing of those volumes. The project that we've done so far have primarily been just interconnects into our existing infrastructure. But the technology required for those investments is relatively straightforward. I will say it's one of the areas that we look at that is heavily dependent upon LCFS credits and RINs. And that is an area where, again, we're going to be disciplined in our investments. We're not going to develop our entire business strategy around areas that require heavily subsidized economics. And so I think there's a place for it where we can drive significant value because of our strategic footprint. And I think we can invest at a level of modest and will -- and I would tell you because of those LCFS credits and dependency on those credits, we're identifying those opportunities in areas where we would have pretty rapid payback of those investments. So very attractive returns that would provide us with the confidence in those structures.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I would just chime in on and supplement the comment on the subsidies there, and certainly, the LCFS, the low carbon fuel standard, and the RINs are really the big driver in those projects. And if you start looking at the weight on the LCFS program to California, in particular, I think that's something we certainly are going to be paying attention to is the degree of sustainability of some of these credits and subsidies that are out there and making sure that we're not overinvesting against that risk. So it's not to say that we won't find ways to monetize that on the front end or let somebody else take that risk, but I do think that's a risk worth keeping your eye on given the -- if you add up all of the various projects where there's a CO2 carbon capture on ethanol load that that's putting on there and the loaded R&D starts to put them on there. It starts to be a pretty big number. So I think that's an important thing to keep your eye on as an investment.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christine Cho with Barclays.
Christine Cho: Maybe if I could just get a clarification on the leverage. What is the long-term ownership percentages for both Haynesville and the Wamsutter? What sort of timelines are we thinking about? And how should we think about how the upstream contributions are factored into the leverage calculation? Is 4.2x still the right target? And is there any change to how the rating agencies view that?
Alan Armstrong: I don't think there's any change. I would just tell you, Christine, that the metrics are coming down again pretty naturally. And the cash flows start to roll from the upstream to the midstream pretty rapidly over the next 3 years. And so it does take a little bit longer in the Wamsutter. The development in Haynesville is pretty quick. So it rolls over to that pretty quickly. And certainly, the rating agencies are well aware of our strategies and design on how we get there. So John, I don't know if you got anything to add.
John Chandler: No, I think that's right. Again, the Haynesville, both deals are designed -- both structures in the Haynesville and Wamsutter are designed for us to reduce our interest. And as Alan said, the Wamsutter sets us more sizable position, our interest would be bigger for longer there. And so whether that ultimately transfers to our partner or gets bought out in those, we don't have a long-term intent to be in the upstream business and intend just to do this to drive value in the midstream. So not sure exactly how Wamsutter ultimately plays out over long term and the Haynesville is pretty clear that as long as the drilling curves like we expect, as Alan said, in a 2- or 3-year time frame, it converts over to midstream value. In the meantime, our credit metrics are so strong right now and our coverage of our dividend and coverage of cash flows. We've talked to rating agencies about this, and I don't sense a concern at all about it. But again, as Alan pointed out in his opening comments, we do see growth coming in our business from EBITDA, which creates natural deleveraging and allows us to do a lot of incremental things in addition to what we're doing today and still see those metrics improve. And so the rating agency has seen numbers that show that as well.
Alan Armstrong: It is a good question. I think to really understand how that transitions, if you look at the cash margin that we make on the midstream side versus the cash margin on the E&P side, you can see that there's so much value driven to the cash flows on the midstream side. But that's really what makes this work and kind of transition us -- transitions us out of the upstream piece of it and into the midstream cash flows pretty quick. So as we've said all along, our goal is to get those developed rapidly and get the cash flows moving on that. In the Haynesville, that's a shorter-term issue and on Wamsutter, that's a longer-term issue just because it's such an enormous deal that will -- is going to be providing -- has such a tremendous amount of inventory in that area, so -- but it really is the cash margin of the midstream business that is really powerful for us. Our cost side of that doesn't move very much at all on the midstream side, but cash flows go up pretty dramatically.
Christine Cho: Okay. Got it. And then if I could just move over to the Northeast. Your processing volumes jumped quite a bit there quarter-over-quarter. Do you guys benefit from some short-term volumes with a competitor outage? Or is that a new run rate we should go off of?
Micheal Dunn: No, Christine. This is Micheal. That -- those outages that occurred, they were very short lived. And ironically, we were -- both the big operators up there were having some operator challenges at the same time that were quickly resolved. So we didn't really benefit nor did our competitors at that same time. But I would say if it is a new run rate for us just because our Oak Grove TXP III project came online in the first quarter. And obviously, we have filled that up in the second quarter and are running at full tilt there on our OVM processing for the most part. And so we are looking at opportunities to interconnect with our Blue Racer facilities and take advantage of some potential lease capacity that they may have. But there's an opportunity to round robin a lot of gas there to our own facilities, our UEO that we acquired a couple of years ago as well as the Blue Racer facility now that we are going to take full advantage of. But I would say we're seeing very active producer activity up there from EQT and Southwestern as well as Encino, who's a private operator, and they are chasing those liquid-rich well pad drill outs right now, and that's why we're seeing a lot of activity there and really pleased that our processing capacity is not full.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson with Truist Securities.
Tristan Richardson: I really appreciate all the comments around your level of capital allocation. But just thinking about the cash flow build next year against some of the project opportunities you've talked about, particularly rate-based investment, the new energy projects awaiting approval, Gulf of Mexico FIDs. Should we think CapEx in 2022 could look similar to this year as some of these opportunities kick off and dollars start to be put to work?
Alan Armstrong: Simple answer is yes. One of the things that's driving capital expense this year has been some of the upstream acquisitions as well as the Sequent acquisition. And so we've had some acquisitions that have -- are still included in that range that we've put out, so that's driving this. Next year, Leidy South will be completed. In the fourth quarter of this year, most of the capital spending obviously will occur prior to that. And then as we get into next year, hopefully, we'll start spending towards the end of the year on Regional Energy Access. If we're fortunate on the permitting process, most of that spending will be in '23. But in addition to that, as we get into '23, the spending for Whale will hit as well. So it's looking pretty levelized, frankly, with this year being driven a little bit higher than we would have expected with some of the acquisitions that we've done. But next year, continued expansion in a lot of these projects that we've mentioned. So it's -- looks like a pretty relatively steady run at kind of the current rate and capital spending.
John Chandler: I'd just say that the math is obviously pretty straightforward. If you look at our -- if you just use our guidance midpoint as a starting point, other than capital, we'll be at the higher end of the range on capital. We're generating -- we're spending, let's say, $1.2 billion at the high end on expansion capital, $500 million on maintenance this year, so that's $1.7 million still deleveraging. Next year, we see EBITDA growth. We're not giving explicit guidance on that today. But if you think about it, if we just put a 4x multiple against any EBITDA growth, that still allow us to be leveraging from a 4.13 level today. And so any kind of reasonable amount of EBITDA growth adds substantially on top of that $1.7 billion that we're spending this year. So that's what -- you hear this kind of confidence on our part that we've got -- we see EBITDA growth coming and with that comes an obviously an expansion of that investable capital and still allowing for a deleverage from a ratio standpoint.
Tristan Richardson: I appreciate it, John. That's helpful. And then I guess just a quick follow-up on really on the acquisition opportunity side. You guys have talked about capital allocation across CapEx and the balance sheet and even the potential for repurchase. Curious on asset packages out there. We've seen some activity in transmission and storage over the past year. Are there small bolt-on opportunities out there, either in the Northeast or in the West? Are there things that are attractive or even transactable when you look out across the landscape?
Alan Armstrong: I would say we certainly keep our eyes on that. And so far, I think folks that are more dependent on those acquisitions for growth are making those acquisitions. And so from our vantage point, we've got better investment opportunities right now than that. And hopefully, that will continue for a long period of time. It's certainly looking that way right now. But I think that's kind of what's driving that market right now is whether people have growth or not. And for us, we have very substantial growth within our investments that are better return opportunities than what we've seen in the broader M&A market -- at option M&A market produced right now. So we'll certainly keep our eyes open, and -- but it's going to be deals that where we have a tremendous amount of synergies that can make those investment opportunities compete with our other investment opportunities, including share buybacks as well. So all of those go into that calculus. But right as we've demonstrated, we're going to be very patient. And we're going to do deals that are -- where we're competitively advantaged to get a much higher return than the broad market would be able to realize.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse.
Spiro Dounis: Alan, first one for you. In the past, you've expressed interest and a willingness to work with the current administration on energy transition and emissions goals. Curious what receptivity you've had early on in demonstrating natural gas' role in the transition. And what you see is maybe still some of the hurdles or areas where there's a gap of opinion on how you approach reducing emissions over the long term.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I think it's an interesting time right now because there is this big drive to -- everybody is very focused on emissions reduction. There's starting to be a sobering, if you will, and a realization of what that means from a cost standpoint to consumers. And as a result of that, people are kind of pivoting back to, okay, well, what is sensible and what can we do that makes sense. And enter the likes of Senator Manchin with a great focus on natural gas for the benefit of the state of West Virginia and for our country and jobs, I would say, and a strong recognition on his part that we have to do this in a globally sustainable manner. And it has to be economic. Otherwise, we're just shipping jobs and the industry off to other countries. And so I would just say there's kind of a reconciling going on, if you will, between, and no pun intended there, by the way, between the intense focus on carbon reductions and tackling that issue on the one hand and on the other issue doing it in a way that it actually is sustainable and we, as the U.S., can stay in control of our own destiny from an economic perspective. And so I think natural gas is extremely well positioned as those 2 things start to grind against each other and start to look for sensible intelligent solutions that we can really deliver on today. And so I would say I have seen some recognition start to go on as people start to actually think about what the cost of some of these solutions means both in terms of direct cost of consumer and in terms of reliability. And so the issues are starting to sober up a little bit as people really start to describe solutions. And so I think where -- natural gas is even better positioned right now than I kind of thought it would be because I am noticing that people are starting to pay attention to the impact on consumers.
Spiro Dounis: Understood. Helpful. Second question is just a follow-up on Sequent. I know you've talked about EBITDA generation in sort of the $20 million to $30 million range annually. But I don't imagine that contemplates the uplift Sequent could provide to the entire asset network as a whole. So curious, am I right in that assumption? And is there any way you can sort of help us quantify the potential benefit overall as Sequent starts to ramp up and integrate into the system?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Unfortunately, I don't think we're going to be able to provide you any specific numbers on that. But you are correct. That is really the purpose of that acquisition, was to drive further value and benefit. And I would tell you, so far, we are even more excited than when we were looking at the acquisition originally in terms of synergies between what our Williams existing customers want and we can provide services for, and what Sequent has and that team has to offer. So tremendous synergies, really excited to see the team starting to work together, and they're identifying a lot of opportunities here very rapidly. So the honeymoon continues, I guess, I would say, and we continue to be very excited about what we're seeing from the Sequent team and their ability to drive value across our asset base.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Lapides: Two-parter here. One, can you remind us what's the capital investment required for the deepwater projects for the 2 that you're kind of disclosing? What should come online by 2024? That's the first question. Second question is, what's the next step in terms of approval process for Regional Energy Access?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I'll take the first part of that on the capital. We haven't disclosed specifics on that capital, but I would just tell you, it's just south of $0.5 billion. And so we haven't laid out anything in terms of detail on that. But we're really, really excited about the way that project's come together. And the capital team and the projects team has continued to find ways to take cost out of that project as well. And that -- and by the way, that includes an expansion for our gas system and the connection of that and there's some significant expansion for the oil side system of that and which will pay benefit for the future and as well an expansion of our [indiscernible] facility to be able to handle all of this rich gas.  So lots of lines of profits between the gas transportation, the oil transportation and the processing of that gas. And so we're really excited about the returns and the way that area is paying off and I would also add, there's several other large prospects out there that are looking very fruitful as well. And so the story could be even better out there in terms of growth over time. So that has turned in to be a great project. And our deepwater construction team has really done a nice job. We're well into that project at this point. As you know, we had a reimbursable agreement with Shell. So we're well into the details of engineering. And in fact, have already bought and had all delivered -- all of the deepwater pipe for that project is now -- was built in the U.K., but it's now here in the U.S. So great efforts by the team. Mike, do you want to take the Regional Energy Access?
Micheal Dunn: Sure, Alan. Just as a reminder, on Regional Energy Access, we made that FERC filing back in March, where the project initially expected an environmental assessment to be completed for the project, but with the changing atmosphere at FERC, they were basically pushing all of the new projects that come in the door and even some that were already there prior to Chairman Glick becoming the Chairman. To go to an environmentally-backed statement will take a little bit longer for us. It shouldn't have an appreciable impact on the overall project schedule. We would still expect to have a FERC certificate next year in 2022 and then could begin construction later that year. We still plan for a Q4 2023 in-service date for the project as we stand today.
Alan Armstrong: And Micheal, I would just add on the deepwater on the well project. That pipe and a lot of the engineering that's gone into that and a lot of the specialty fabrication is already in this year's capital budget. So a lot of the materials and pipe has already been paid for or is included in this year's budget. So they'll pile it on to the next couple of years' debt.
Operator: At this time, there are no additional questions. I'll turn the call back over to Alan Armstrong from Williams.
Alan Armstrong: Okay. Well, thank you all very much. Continued great success here in '21. Teams continue to hit on all cylinders. And importantly, even though we've got great growth here in '21, what we're really excited about is how we're positioned now for the future with a number of very important drivers for growth here in the future that will show up in '22 and beyond. So really setting a nice platform for growth for our business for years to come. So we thank you for your attention today and the great questions, and we'll speak to you again soon.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-04 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to The Williams First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Danilo Juvane, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Danilo Juvane: Thank you, Amicus and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in The Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon, we released our earnings press release and the presentation that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and our Chief Financial Officer, John Chandler, will speak to this morning. Also joining us on the call today are Michael Dunn, our Chief Operating Officer; Lane Wilson, our General Counsel; and Chad Zamarin, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development. In the presentation materials, you will find a disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to our remarks and you should review it. Also included in the presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to generally accepted accounting principles and these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today’s presentation. So with that, I will turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong: Great. Well, thanks, Danilo and thank you all for joining us today. Our natural gas focused strategy continues to deliver solid financial results and this past quarter was no different. Our base business performance was remarkably strong in the first quarter and the severe winter weather in February boosted marketing margins, but even without these weather benefit or those benefits, as John will detail later, our adjusted EBITDA was up, reflecting strength in our base business. Once again, well-positioned assets and reliable operations came through as we delivered another quarter of growth in almost all of our key operating metrics despite severe weather. In fact, average daily firm contracts of transmission capacity, average daily transported volumes, average daily gathering volumes and average daily plant inlet volumes all increased on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Extreme weather experienced in the first quarter really underscores the importance of having a resilient and reliable energy network. Williams also stood out on this front as no firm service was cut on any of our gas transmission systems during Uri. And in fact, our Northwest pipeline hit another record peak day for throughput during the storm. It demonstrates that affordable and dependable natural gas will be a very critical part of the energy mix as we work to support growing economies and meet the key challenges we face around climate change both in the U.S. and abroad. We truly believe Williams’ existing infrastructure is key to tomorrow’s clean energy economy. I will talk more about how we are planning for the future when we get to the key focus areas. But in the meantime, John is going to go through our financial results. John?
John Chandler: Thanks, Alan. At a very high level summary, the quarter benefited from the impact of winter storm Uri. And to be clear, we have collected all receivables relative to that event. But even beyond the winter storm impact, we saw nice increases in profitability from our Northeast gathering systems, an uplift in revenues on our Transco pipeline from new projects that have been put into service over the last year, and higher profits from our NGL marketing activity in our West segment. These positives were offset somewhat by higher bonus expense accruals, reflecting the solid year that is unfolding and lower Gulf of Mexico revenues due to some downtime issues during the first quarter of this year. And you can see the strong performance in our statistics on this page. In fact, we saw improvements in all of our key financial metrics. First, our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up $153 million or 12%. But even after excluding the impact of winter storm Uri, our adjusted EBITDA was up 6%. We will discuss EBITDA variances in more depth in a moment. Adjusted EPS for the quarter increased 35%, simply reflecting the after-tax impact of the higher EBITDA. AFFO grew for the quarter similarly to our growth in EBITDA. And again, AFFO is essentially cash from operations, including JV cash flows, but excluding working capital fluctuations. If you put AFFO up against our capital investments for the quarter of $277 million, of which we consider roughly $47 million of that to be maintenance capital and you put it up against our dividend of $498 million, you can see that we generated over $250 million in excess cash for the quarter. Also, you see our dividend coverage on this page based on AFFO divided by dividends sets at a very strong 2.07x. This strong cash generation and strong EBITDA for the quarter, along with continued capital discipline, has helped move us towards our leverage metric goal of 4.20x. You will see later in our guidance update in this deck, we have moved our guidance now for the year from around 4.25x at the end of the year now to around 4.20x at the end of the year. I am really proud of our success on this front. So, now let’s go to the next slide. Let’s dig in a little deeper into our EBITDA results for the quarter. Again, Williams performed very well this quarter. But before we dive into each segment, we believe it’s important to isolate a few items that are not part of our core business. The first item is the net impact of winter storm Uri on our operations in the West. That impact produced a $55 million net benefit and included the positive impact on our marketing operations offset somewhat by reduced revenues at our Piceance processing facility, whose rates are impacted by net liquid margins. We also had slightly lower volumes in the Mid-Continent at Haynesville. And collectively, we estimate winter storm Uri impacted our West volumes by about 70 MCF a day during the quarter. In addition, we also realized a $22 million storm Uri uplift in profits from the Wamsutter upstream assets that we acquired from BP in February and that is on top of the $8 million from normal operations from these upstream assets. So, the total winter storm impact was about – was a $77 million benefit. Again, with that benefit, EBITDA was up 12%. And even without the impact of winter storm Uri, EBITDA was up 6%. So, digging into our core operations, our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico assets produced results that are about $9 million less than the same period last year. However, new transmission pipeline projects added $29 million in incremental revenues for the quarter, including the Hillabee Phase 2 project that came into service in the second quarter of last year, the Southeastern Trails project that went into service during the fourth quarter of last year, and a portion of the Leidy South project that went into service in the fourth quarter of last year. You can see this evidenced in the growth in our firm reserve capacity, which is up 5% from the first quarter of 2020. These revenue increases were almost entirely offset by lower Gulf of Mexico revenues due to some production and downtime issues, lower revenues from lower rates in just a few Transco markets that went into effect upon closing the rate case last year and 1 less billing day this year than last year given last year was a Leap Year, which, believe it or not, has a $6 million impact on our transmission revenues. So, the reduced EBITDA results for this segment really have nothing to do with revenues and are largely due to higher operating expenses, which, interestingly enough are being impacted by higher bonus accruals and equity compensation accruals given that we are off to such a strong start to the year. We traditionally do not increase those accruals until later in the year. In addition, we did see slightly higher compression expenses for this segment. Now, moving to the Northeast, the G&P segment continues to come on strong, contributing $32 million of additional EBITDA this quarter. Collectively, total Northeast gathering volumes grew 920 MCF a day or about 11% this quarter versus the first quarter of last year, while processing volumes grew 15%. The volume growth was predominantly at our JVs in the Bradford Supply Hub, where we benefited from a gathering system expansion on that system in late 2019 and at our Marcellus South Supply Basin, where we benefited from more productive wells at larger pads. As a result, our EBITDA from equity method investments improved by little over $33 million, which also includes the benefit of additional profits from Blue Racer due to our increased ownership, which we acquired in mid-November last year. Now, moving to the West G&P segment, it was up $44 million compared to the prior year. And remember, again that this excludes the $55 million net benefit from winter storm Uri. So, of this $44 million improvement, commodity margins from our marketing activities contributed a big part of that improvement and they were up $52 million versus the first quarter of 2020. And again, this excludes the $74 million benefit from winter storm Uri related just only to commodities. These increased commodity margins were the result of a few things, all driven by higher NGL prices during the quarter. The first and most significant is related to inventory in transit. Last year, we saw prices decline and had a small loss, while this year we saw prices increasing during the quarter and realized a gain on that inventory. The second relates to transfers of propane and other NGLs to higher netback markets, where we saw some real market differentials during the quarter and we are able to take advantage of that. For example, the differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu. Offsetting the higher commodity margins were lower profits from our JVs. We did see a $5 million JV benefit from winter storm Uri on our [indiscernible] JV. So if you exclude that, our JVs were down about $8 million and that can be mostly attributed to OPPO, where One Oak has pulled much of their volume and moved it to their solely owned system. Those items, namely higher commodity margins, offset by lower JV profits, again mostly explain the variance in the West. Otherwise, lower revenues were offset by lower expenses. Revenues were down $14 million when you exclude a negative $23 million impact tied to winter storm Uri on West revenues and again, mostly that was in the Piceance related to net liquid margins. Volumes in the West were down 250 MCF a day or if you exclude winter storm Uri, about – they were down about 180 MCF a day, with most of that reduction in the Haynesville and the Eagle Ford, which of course I will remind you in the Eagle Ford, we are protected by MVC, so that doesn’t have a revenue impact. So really, the biggest impact on revenues was the rate reduction in the Haynesville and a slight volume reduction at Haynesville. And I will remind you that we traded that rate reduction in the Haynesville in part for receiving the South Mansfield acreage from Chesapeake earlier this year. Now again, offsetting the lower revenues were lower cost, including lower compression cost and no bad debt expense, where during the first quarter of 2020, we did reserve for the Wamsutter MVC that are now realizing those MVCs as part of the settlement with south [ph]. I will now turn the call back over to Alan to discuss several important investor focus areas and updates to our 2021 guidance. Alan?
Alan Armstrong: Great. Well, thanks John. And here, moving on to the key investor focus areas on Slide 3, we are increasing the midpoint of our ‘21 EBITDA guidance range to $5.3 billion, which is up $100 million. The increase in our guidance goes beyond the gains realized during the winter storm as it also reflects confidence in the strength of our base business. Achieving this new midpoint would produce a 3-year CAGR of about 4.5%, even while we have continued to improve our balance sheet and produced free cash flow after CapEx and dividends. Regarding the balance sheet, our de-leveraging goal is now on an accelerated path as we have hit the target of 4.2 this quarter, which obviously is earlier than we had forecasted earlier and we are currently on positive watch at Moody’s and hope to see a credit upgrade soon. Given the accelerated achievement of key milestones on our balance sheet, we will begin to evaluate various capital allocation alternatives. As you know, debt reduction has been our top capital priority and now we will begin to evaluate the best use of free cash flow in ‘22 and beyond. So, next on the list here is a few thoughts about the Sequent acquisition. As we announced last night, we recently reached an agreement to purchase Sequent Energy Management and Sequent Energy Canada from Southern Company Gas for a purchase price of $50 million, plus working capital at close. And for several years, we have been evaluating the best way to enhance our marketing capabilities at Williams in a way that it could be well integrated, culturally aligned and focused on driving fee-based revenues across our network for several years. So, this is something we have had in our strategic capabilities and something we needed to build for several years. And so we are really excited to be taking this step to fulfill what’s been a strategic capability gap. The addition of Sequent, including its talented workforce and industry leading platform, complements the current geographic footprint of our core pipeline transportation and storage business. For perspective, we handled 30% of the nation’s natural gas, which is approximately 30 BCF per day. This acquisition increases our natural gas transport and storage optimization capabilities up to 8 BCF per day from 1 BCF per day that we were doing previously here within Williams, so certainly bringing it more in line for a natural gas focused business as large as Williams. The scale of the combined company will not only allow for optimization of our existing assets, but it will also facilitate expansions into new markets with opportunities to reach incremental gas-fired power generation, liquefied natural gas exports and future RNG opportunities. In discussion with both our existing and potential LNG focused customers, we are hearing a clear need to have wellhead to water natural gas supplies that can demonstrate and document responsibly produced low carbon supplies. We see this acquisition as a way to more effectively aggregate, transport and market these in-demand supplies. So, we are really excited to welcome the Sequent team to Williams later this summer. And finally, we don’t expect the acquisition to have any dramatic impact on our current mix of business nor a material impact for our ‘21 EBITDA or CapEx guidance. So, now moving on to project execution here on Slide 3 still, we continued our pace of strong project execution in the first quarter, placing our Southeastern Trail project into full service in early January and making great progress now on the Transco Leidy South project to bring additional gas from Appalachian area, particularly Northeast PA to growing demand centers along the Atlantic seaboard by next winter. We filed our FERC application for the Regional Energy Access project, a low environmental impact project being designed in a manner that is acceptable to future renewable energy sources like clean hydrogen and blend – like clean hydrogen blending and RNG. So in today’s environment, as we are all learning more and more existing infrastructure is more important and more valuable than ever and the Brownfield nature of regional energy access and Leidy South and Southeastern Trails are all great examples to that. With the largest and most flexible gas transmission system in the nation, Williams can serve new demand primarily through Brownfield expansions. This means maximizing the use of established transmission corridors and facilities and resulting in reduced community and environmental impact, while also enabling economic growth and the use of lower carbon fuels in those markets. Next, on to the Gulf of Mexico opportunities here, we remain on track to executing on the 4 key Gulf of Mexico projects, which is Quail, Ballymore, Taggart and Anchor. These projects are progressing very well and we look forward to these projects coming online here now over the next few years. We also have a number of other smaller projects, but those are the ones that we continue to focus your attention on. So, next on the Northeast G&P project execution, certainly, some of the producers in the Northeast remain in production maintenance mode, but our project execution team is busy trying to keep up with the increased demand for processing and fractionation services for the growing rich gas volumes in the Southwest Marcellus area. And as we have stated before, the rich gas volumes provide us with a much higher service fee and margin capture. So, we are thrilled to see continued expansion in that area. And finally, on sustainability here, we continue to focus on sustainable operations. And I will remind you that last year, Williams became the first North American midstream company to issue a climate commitment, focusing on ready now solutions to address climate change. And by setting a near-term goal of a 56% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 as a part of our climate commitment, we are well in line with the Biden administration’s recently announced nationally determined contribution target of a 50% to 52% reduction by 2030. So, we are really excited that we are actually ahead of that here in what’s been said as an aggressive goal for the country. We will continue to leverage our natural gas focused strategy and today’s technology to focus on immediate opportunity to reduce emissions. At the same time, natural gas and our infrastructure are enabling the next generation of clean energy technology. There really is not another energy infrastructure system that integrates a reliable delivery network with a massive storage solution on the scale that the natural gas infrastructure across our nation does. We believe our infrastructure can be a critical part of both near and long-term solutions. And on our near-term efforts, we are focused on renewable natural gas, solar energy. And our footprint is ideal for bringing in renewable natural gas to markets and solar projects in a supply mix. On the solar front, we have currently identified 3 additional projects and now have a total of 16 solar project opportunities that should start operating beginning in 2023. On the emerging fuels front, such as green hydrogen and renewable natural gas, we certainly expect that to play an increasing role in the clean energy future and both as a storage vehicle for excess renewable energy in the form of green hydrogen and as a net zero emitting form of natural gas in the renewable natural gas. So, we continue to make sure that we are on the front edges of those opportunities. We are looking forward and anticipating future innovations and technologies that we can use on our key energy network to deliver on this next phase of the energy transition. In fact, in a partnership with the University of Wyoming, we are currently pursuing a grant from the state of Wyoming to fund a feasibility study to pursue a pilot program that would evaluate the creation of a green hydrogen hub near our operations in Wyoming. The study will be presented to the Wyoming Energy Authority and it could be an initial step for Williams to better understand the working of the hydrogen economy. I certainly want to keep that in context for you. That simply is us filing for a study there to determine if we want to pursue a pilot there. So that is perhaps something I don’t want to see people getting out over our skis on here. This is a step, and we certainly are going to make sure that we stay in front of these kind of opportunities, but we are a long way from making any kind of big investment decisions on that. We also recently joined the Clean Hydrogen Future Coalition that was launched for advanced clean hydrogen as a key pathway to achieving global de-carbonization and U.S. energy competitiveness. And finally, we are proud to be a founding sponsor of Houston’s Greentown Labs, a green technology incubator to support climate tech start-ups. So in closing, I will reiterate that our intense focus on our natural gas based strategy has built a business that is steady and predictable with continued moderate growth, improving returns and an increasing amount of free cash flows. Our best-in-class long-haul pipes, Transco, Northwest pipeline and Gulfstream, are in the right place and right markets. And by design, our formable gathering assets are in the low cost basins that will be called on to meet gas demand as it continues to grow. As evidence, on a year-over-year basis, the Lower 48 natural gas production here, of course, in the United States has declined by 5% here in the first quarter. At the same time, Williams Natural Gas gathering volumes were up by 5%, indicating that our strategy of focusing on key low-cost natural gas basins is working. These gathering assets are irreplaceable and critical infrastructure within the natural gas value chain, and the importance of this infrastructure was proven in our recent ability to navigate two substantial customer bankruptcies in a way that actually improve the value proposition in the Wamsutter and the Haynesville basin. This is a crystal clear example that even in the most dire circumstances, our long-term approach and careful contracting allows us to turn negative such as producer bankruptcies into net positives for Williams. We remain bullish on natural gas because we have recognized the critical role it plays and will continue to play in both our countries and the world’s pursuit of a clean energy future. Natural gas is an important component of today’s fuel mix and should be prioritized as one of the most important tools to aggressively displace more carbon-intensive fuels around the world. Our networks are critical to serving both domestic and global energy demand in a lower carbon and economically viable manner. So with that, we thank you very much for joining us today, and I will open it up for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Praneeth Satish with Wells Fargo.
Praneeth Satish: Thanks. Good morning. I guess just first question on regional energy access. You mentioned that it’s being designed to accept hydrogen or RNG blending. Just curious, what does that mean exactly? Are you taking any – are you doing any different steps on this project? Can it take more hydrogen and other pipes? Just curious if you could elaborate on those comments?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Mike, can you take that one, please?
Michael Dunn: Yes. Good morning. We are looking at this asset and the footprint that it encompasses on our exiting right away and talking to our customers about opportunities that they have to either bring renewable natural gas into that pipeline system or utilization of solar facilities that they are contemplating and expect can possibly produce hydrogen and close proximity to the pipeline. And so that’s really the comment that you are seeing there. It’s no exotic metals or anything of that nature in the pipeline system. It will be typical of any existing pipeline system that’s in the country to be able to accommodate a hydrogen blend, but it’s accommodating the ability of our customers that are participating in that project to bring forward in partnership with us potentially hydrogen sources into that pipeline system.
Praneeth Satish: Great. And then just turning to the Northeast, you have got your new Oak Grove processing plant expansion up and running. How long do you think it will take to still that expansion up? And maybe tied to that, where do you stand in terms of NGL volumes now versus frac capacity in the Northeast? Do you see the need to add any frac capacity? Maybe just one more to tie on to that, is there any opportunity to kind of integrate the Blue Racer and your other systems in the Northeast to give yourselves some synergies there?
Michael Dunn: Yes. This is Michael. I will take that one again. So basically, the processing capacity is virtually full today. The production that came on the line behind that processing facility was very robust. The pads were developed by our customers there, primarily EQT and Southwestern, and very prolific pad developments they have there, exceeding their expectations. And so we did an offload agreement with our customers there to make sure that we didn’t impact any of their volumes in the first quarter, while we were finishing our TXP3 and our growth. That’s now online, and like I said earlier, virtually full. So, we are seeing full processing there for the most part. And our fractionation facility at Harrison is also approaching the limits of capacity. And I suspect through the summer months, we will be at capacity on those facilities. And so we are contemplating opportunities with our Blue Racer ownership there and where we can create crossover pipeline systems to be able to transport some of those volumes over to them when they potentially have spare capacity. And that system can be utilized bi-directionally in the future to where either one of us potentially have a capacity situation and we can offload to the other. And so that’s a longer term prospect project. But it’s something we feel like we could have online potentially this year, and it’s a very low cost project in comparison to building it either a new fractionation or processing facility.
Praneeth Satish: Great. Thank you.
Michael Dunn: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christine Cho with Barclays.
Christine Cho: I would like to start off with the guidance. If we adjust first quarter to take out the storm impact, it would imply some degradation in the future quarters to get to the midpoint of guidance. So, just wanted to see if there is anything that we should be thinking about later in the year that would bring numbers down from here or is the guidance just somewhat conservative?
John Chandler: Yes, this is John Chandler. I will take that. First of all, I would say there are a couple of other items in the first quarter beyond Winter Storm Uri I think you should think about. So, let’s start with the 1 4, 1 5, which is what we made. Winter storm had a $77 million impact. We did make, I would call it, outsized NGL margins during the first quarter relative to some of this inventory valuation. And just to put a number on that, I think we made probably $30 million more than we would normally make in a quarter. So if you remember in my commentary, I said we made $52 million more in NGL marketing activity outside of Winter Storm Uri. We usually make $20 million to $30 million a quarter. And so if you back $77 million out, you back $30 million out for some outside NGL margins and then also, we did book an $11 million MVC accrual relative to Wamsutter. That once we close in the southern properties, we will be our own customer and we will be charging ourselves an MVC, and you take that out as well. If you take those 3 numbers out, we are under $1.3 billion for the quarter. And if you normal – if you take that times 4, add those items back, you will get really close to our kind of 5.3 midpoint. Now of course, you might say, the upstream will come in a little bit stronger, too. We made out – without Winter Storm Uri, we made $8 million on the upstream; times 4, that’s $32 million, and we have guided to around 1% of our EBITDA for the year. So there is certainly some uplift on the upstream, too. So, I would say there is probably a little bit of conservatism in our number. I am not going to try to say there isn’t to that. But I think we obviously want to be sensitive to – if we have a tough hurricane season or other things. But I think you have got to take those 3 things out, you are going to get really close to guidance. Our forecast remains very strong, and our business performance remains really strong for the remainder of the year.
Christine Cho: Okay. Got it. That’s helpful. And then I wanted to kind of touch on the purchase of Sequent. Your commentary to source responsible gas is notable. So, wondering if you could talk about what this exactly entails, what you are thinking here. And then natural gas marketing was a business that was much bigger pre shale, and it’s gotten much smaller over the last decade. But with utility – I know that you guys mentioned LNG customers. But with the utilities coming out with net zero requirements as well and maybe more volatility to materialize in natural gas flows on a daily basis rather than what has historically been a seasonal basis, could you talk about what this might mean for pipeline be contracting and how Sequent may or may not play a role?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Christine, great question and very thoughtful. I would just say, first of all, we – as I mentioned earlier, we have been, for the last couple of years, really and thinking, boy, this is a big business. We touched a lot of gas, have a lot of customers that could use services like gas marketing, but we have been very limited in our approach to that. And so the Sequent opportunity basically gave us an opportunity to buy a platform and a set of contracts and asset management contracts and a great team that really knows this business and has controlled risk extremely well. And so really allowed us to fulfill a strategic gap. However – so I would just say that was out there as the need before the thought of low-carbon fuels and the volatility and the value of volatility that just got exposed in this last quarter even came along. But I will tell you that we entered this with even greater confidence in both the need and the value associated with because we do believe that the benefit of capacity management and risk management as it relate – for utilities as it relates to what happened during a Winter Storm Uri certainly has – make sure the space is wide weight relative to the risk around this issue. And we think this – the team at Sequent has done a great job of managing that risk, by the way, through this. And so we think there is value in managing in a new value associated with managing that kind of risk. But we also just think just generally, we have a lot of customers that could really use the service. And as you say, it’s really kind of faded away as the capability in a lot of companies, but we think it’s really going to be an important tool for us and being able to bring together low carbon supplies all the way from the wellhead and being able to document that and put that value chain together all the way to the water and to our utilities is clearly on the list right now as the new opportunity for us to market to. And we certainly have the assets, but we really don’t have all of those contacts with people. We talk to customers about long-term capacity on a regular basis. We are not out readily talking to them about how we manage the volatility in their business. And so this really gives us a great opportunity to do that and look forward. So thanks for the question, and I would just say e are – it’s become more and more evident to us that this is something we needed to add to our capabilities at some of the changes that you pointed out has occurred.
Michael Dunn: Alan, if I could add to that as well. The upstream properties that we now own were potentially loan once were bankruptcy court approved to Southland transaction in the Wamsutter. The BP acreage in the Wamsutter and the Haynesville acreage now gives us the ability to market that natural gas that’s coming from those properties. And so we are going to by the way to work with our new Sequent ownership, ultimately, when that closes, to find a way to take those supplies, brand them as low carbon or net zero and then market those to utilities and LNG facilities that Alan mentioned.
Christine Cho: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.
Alan Armstrong: Thanks, Christine
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.
Alan Armstrong: Good morning.
Jeremy Tonet: Just want to see, I might have missed it here. But as far as the E&P acreage sale process is concerned, would you be able to update us there, I guess, as far as timing? Is it still kind of July or has anything kind of changed in your thought process there?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Jeremy, thank you for the question. Yes, we are in the process of working through – and I would say we are well into negotiations with two different parties, one in the Wamsutter, one in the Haynesville. And they are both local producers with adjacent acreage and very skilled operators in the area. And so we are moving along on that. And probably the form of those transactions will be a situation where we retain an interest, and part of that is for credit protection, as you can imagine, make sure that we haven’t handed the keys over to that until the cash has been invested to increase the drilling acreage. So you should think about that as over time, those cash flows being reinvested in the drilling and building up of the business and then a dilution of our interest over time as that converts from upstream cash flows into midstream – long life midstream cash flows. So, that’s exactly what we are looking to accomplish. And I will tell you our team and Chad Zamarin, who has been leading that for us, has just done a fantastic job of really coming up with win-win solutions with parties. And we are really excited about the way that’s going to turn out for much – I would tell you, much bigger value to us than even at very modest conditions, much bigger value coming to us than we had ever kind of expected when we were preparing in the bankruptcy processes for that. So Chad, I don’t know if you have anything to add on that.
Chad Zamarin: Just on timing, I would expect that we finalized those transactions over the next 30 days to 60 days. We are pretty far along with – in both scenarios. And I think just to put an emphasis on what Alan said, I mean, those will be structures that bring in a strong, well capitalized operator, and the ownership structure that they will be acquiring will be structured in a way that will require development of the asset and drive volumes to our midstream and downstream efforts. And as Michael said, we will, as part of both of those transactions, have a marketing capability and the ability to aggregate supply for the benefit of our gathering systems, our downstream pipeline systems, and now with Sequent, our marketing and optimization takeaway. So we think a really great outcome for us and our partners, but I would expect to see something in both the Wamsutter and Haynesville over the next 30 days to 60 days.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. Thanks for that. And then on the topic of energy transition, I was just wondering if carbon capture is on your radar. If you think that the current 45Q is sufficient to make projects economic, specifically such as on processing plants given the purity of the – to stream there or anywhere else, do you see that as a possibility for Williams here or do you see the potential for more, I guess, changes of support coming out of D.C. that could enhance economics and make these projects more viable for Williams?
Alan Armstrong: Chad, do you want to take that?
Chad Zamarin: Yes. I would tell you that we are looking at every opportunity to leverage our capabilities and infrastructure, and carbon capture is one of those. We do have assets in both pipelines and storage facilities in areas where there may be the opportunity to aggregate significant carbon emissions and provide capture and storage. It’s early days. Much like with hydrogen, I would say we are trying to set the table for us to be able to participate in those opportunities as they mature. I wouldn’t expect to see something material with on hydrogen in Wyoming. I wouldn’t expect to see something material from an investment perspective in the near-term. But I would tell you that if it’s a viable opportunity, which we think is very well may be, we are looking at some actual projects today, but they are long-term in nature. And we require, I would say, a year plus of just evaluation before we even think about what an investment might look like. But we have multiple different opportunities that we are looking at across the carbon storage – capture and storage opportunity set.
Jeremy Tonet: Great, that’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni with UBS.
Shneur Gershuni: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Alan, thank you today for the uptick on capital allocation, I have two follow-up questions. First, just to go back to the upstream related assets, in terms of the JV structure that you are going to be setting up, are you seeing any of the learnings from the executing process that you just went through in terms of restructuring, gathering contracts with these new assets sort of protect Williams in the future? And as part of that, do you see it – do you see yourself retaining the assets on a very long-term basis or do you sort of see eventually selling it down the road?
John Chandler: Shneur, we vaguely heard your question. You are cutting out quite a bit. Can you please repeat that?
Shneur Gershuni: Sure. Just to repeat. So with the upstream assets and the JVs that you are looking to pursue at this point right now, are you going to be designing the midstream contracts to take advantage of the learnings that you had through the bankruptcy process to make sure that you are protected in a long-term basis? And do you plan to hold the assets for a very long-term or is the whole period more of a medium-term?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Great question, and especially with some of the outcomes from the Delaware bankruptcy courts as it relates to gathering and whether those contracts on land or not. So, we certainly are doing everything we can to improve our position on those. As we’ve said many times before, and it kind of proved out in these cases, it’s not just the law or – I mean, certainly, your contracts need to be good and supportive. But importantly, it is the physical nature of the asset, and being all the way back to the wellhead, it gives you a lot of economic protection in that situation. Having said all that, the one thing that we are really depending on in these transactions is the fact that the other party is going to invest the dollars to develop the acreage, and we’re cutting the bargain on that basis. And so to get right to the point, we’re going to retain those interests until that – until those capital dollars have been invested to prove to ourselves that, that money is going to be spent. If it doesn’t get spent, we still own the acreage. And whether money they spent in developing we retain and increase interest in a more developed property. So I would say, we certainly don’t expect that. We know the partners that we’re talking to here pretty well, and they both have a very strong financial position. So in this case, we feel really good about the situation. But I would say that we’ve got belt and suspenders on in terms of the form of the structure that we’re seeing. That is if effectively bankruptcy proved given our continued holdings until the dollars have been invested to develop the acreage.
Michael Dunn: Yes. I think it’s important to emphasize Alan that we didn’t have a meaningful contract projection through all of the bankruptcies that occurred last year. We have been very deliberate in investing in infrastructure that is absolutely critical to the upstream asset and so both in Haynesville and Wamsutter. At the end of the day, the bankruptcy process really wasn’t all that relevant. What was relevant was that our infrastructure is absolutely critical. And without it, the upstream asset can’t deliver value. You can’t deliver volume. And so we have a very strong position across our footprint. I think we proved it last year, not a single bankruptcy proceeding led to a rejection of one of our contracts because we’ve invested in critical infrastructure that just, by its nature, protects against that risk. And then on the long-term investment, I think Alan may want to add is, we are again very focused on structuring these transactions in a way that brings development back to high-quality acreage, upstream of areas where we have existing available midstream capacity. And so we’re going to see in these structures a near-term investment in these properties that will deliver the ownership from a long-term perspective, primarily to our JV partner. We may have a small ownership interest that we retain from a long-term perspective, but we will likely only hold the ownership interest as long as it takes to make sure that development gets back into the properties and drive the volume to our midstream assets. So that’s – we are laser-focused on that as our strategy, not to just own upstream properties forever. It’s to own them in a way that drives the development that we think will drive value to our midstream assets.
Shneur Gershuni: Well, very thoughtful. Thank you for that. And maybe just as a follow-up to the Sequent acquisition. Appreciate everything that you’ve already laid out with respect to today. I’m trying to understand the capabilities that come with the acquisition. Are you basically buying a team that is laser-focused on capacity management and so forth? Or does it come with – are they data scientists and come with algorithms and technology that can do something that is well beyond your current capabilities just given the fact that you’ve been in this business in the past?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. No. I would just say, and I’ll let Chad – I would say this is kind of a team that’s really skilled at blocking, tackling and risk control. And the positions they’re taking are nothing exotic. It is simply looking to manage basis differential, manage contracts, reimburse contracts through asset management agreements with utilities. So this is a very low-risk approach, but it does involve a lot of customer contact and a lot of opportunity to serve customers in space. But it’s basically basis and time value on storage versus physical inventory. So it’s nothing exotic and market-leading or market-making kind of activities.
Chad Zamarin: And Shneur, we – and Alan said this earlier, we have intentionally been focused on expanding our capabilities on that for the last couple of years. And our team has done a great job. They’ve been growing their capabilities. So we grew from a very, very small level to still a very small level, but it’s still been a lot of work on the team. This gets us much quicker to a larger scale capability on the back of more sophisticated systems. They have a more – we have a quality risk control process internally within Williams. They have a very high-quality risk control system. And so we picked up the benefits of a very well thought out structure from risk control, accounting systems, trade, marketing systems. We just – it helps move us forward that much quicker and something that we would have probably spent the next 4 or 5 years trying to build, we get there more quickly.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. And I would just say, in addition to that, we look at a lot of different opportunities in this space. And the reason we got so comfortable with this transaction is Southern companies have done a fantastic job of really keeping the screws turn down from a risk control standpoint and really building a culture around that. And so this is a very well controlled business, and we’ve been very impressed with the time and effort that Southern companies has invested in making this a heavily controlled business. But at the end of the day, Southern companies doesn’t have all the big long-term external customers on both the upstream and the downstream the way we do. And so this is a great fit for us. I totally understand where they’re coming from in terms of their sale. But for us, this is really an important capability for a company that handles 30% of the nation’s natural gas, really complementary. And I think we’ve got a lot to offer to that team as well in terms of new opportunities to work around our customers and assets as well off of those services. So it really – this is really, I think, attractive transaction between two companies that know each other well and done a lot of business together, and we’re really excited about bringing this team.
Michael Dunn: Yes. I think you got it, really simply it was a pipeline and storage optimization platform owned by a utility. We are a pipeline and storage company. And we’ll now own a pipeline and storage optimization platform. This is not speculative marketing and trading. This is taking – understanding pipeline and storage fundamentals and optimizing infrastructure. And when you think about the areas that we’ve just left an era of expansion in construction, and we move into an era of realizing the value of existing infrastructure, a platform focused on optimization of the existing infrastructure is going to be really valuable. And so we see it as an accelerator of capabilities across our core business. And we’re going to be exploring a lot of different ways, I think, to create opportunity with the addition of Sequent team.
Shneur Gershuni: Perfect. Thank you very much for that. Appreciate the color and have a great day.
Alan Armstrong: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson with Truist Securities.
Tristan Richardson: Hi, good morning guys. Just a question on capital in 2022, I think in prior calls, Alan emphasized that once the leverage is at the long-term target priorities like further investing in the rate base and emissions reduction projects or the initiatives are the priorities for capital allocation. Just wanted to get your views on that versus further de-levering or, as you suggested in prepared comments, thinking about returning cash to shareholders.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Thank you very much. I would just say, we are – we remain – look – and we’ll look at all those options as we enter into next year. Obviously, once we’ve committed to capital projects, then that option has been eliminated when you start down that road, obviously. But we certainly up until the time that we take a look at those investment opportunities against the whatever price of our stock is and where we think the best value is. But the good news is we’re sitting here in ‘22 with a modest amount of free cash flow that gives us flexibility, but as we get into ‘22, the – take rocket science to run math and realize that, that starts to build on us. And so we will have quite a bit of opportunity there. And I wouldn’t say that we’re committed to making those emission reduction projects happen yet until we get down to seeing what stock price is, what returns look like, but that is certainly one of the options. And I think on the further debt reduction, obviously, if we become convinced that further – debt reduction would add value to our shareholders, then that’s a lever we could continue to pull on as well. And so I would just say, it’s hard to predict what the markets will look like 9 months from now, but we certainly are, to the point now as we continue to engage with the Board on this discussion, this is becoming a more prevalent topic, if you will, at Board meetings in terms of what’s the best use of the extra free cash flow as we get into ‘22 and beyond.
Tristan Richardson: It’s helpful. And then just a quick follow-up, just with the activity you’re seeing on both G&P segments, possibly looking stronger in the second half and combined with some of the Northeast projects like Oak Grove, should we be optimistic for growth in 2022 in both of the G&P businesses, where we sit today?
Alan Armstrong: Well, I would say things are looking pretty favorable right now. I mean look the gas prices, NGL prices here through the summer months and starting to look out into the four markets. Certainly, the market is starting to put a call on gas in these areas, whether it’s the Northeast PA, the Southwest PA, the Utica or the Haynesville, they’re all well positioned to make pretty good margin in this kind of pricing environment that you’re seeing now almost $3 summer gas price. So yes, if that continues, that will drive activity on those assets and will drive growth. So I like our setup for the balance of the year. Obviously, as John said, we’re being reserved in how we’re putting that into guidance, but that looks good. And I would say, obviously, if you think about really what drives some of those decisions, a lot of times, it is the forward market for a lot of our customers that drives those decisions. And so they will start to look at what the forward strip looks like and start to lay in hedges. And that’s going to drive the activity, frankly, in terms of how much – how many drilling commitments they make in an area. So I would just say, keep your eyes focused on kind of the forward markets for both gas and NGLs, and that’ll be a pretty good indicator of what kind of activity we should expect across those areas.
Tristan Richardson: Appreciate. Thank you, Alan.
Alan Armstrong: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kania with Wolfe Research.
Alex Kania: Hi. Good morning. Maybe just a follow-up on the Sequent questions, just looking back on Southern’s comments on their call, they did talk about it having a significant amount of balance sheet or parental guarantee support required as well as maybe some volatility in terms of the results there. I guess maybe my questions are just, are there going to be any synergies that maybe the company has that might try to minimize some of the parental guarantees that might be required maybe relative to Southern? And the other one that’s just talking about overall, the volatility there, on average, about maybe $40 million of net income, I think, is what they said. But is there a – maybe a sense that you may be able to kind of make that more kind of stable and predictable under the kind of the broader platform that you have?
John Chandler: Well, yes, this is John Chandler. First on the guarantees, I think you need to understand we guarantee a lot of our subsidiaries, too, and a big part of that number, they were talking about is just simply the guarantees they make for monthly transactions at Sequent. I think if you look at Sequent, their revenues are somewhere in the $7 billion range. And if you divide that by 12 – I mean, all that’s happening is the parent was guaranteeing its subsidiary who was doing purchase transactions under the AMA or just general marketing activities with very low risk. They have a very tight risk control process. So there’s not risk on those trades. So there was a guarantee in their subsidiary, just like we guaranteed one of our subsidiaries. That’s $400 million to $500 million of guarantees. And so that number was a little bit flashy, but it’s not anything of substance. It’s not like guaranteeing some risk asset. Hopefully, that makes sense. And so beyond that, really, the transport fees, most regulated pipelines have maximum of 90 days requirements if you fall below invest grade. If you’re investment grade, you don’t have any requirements. But if you fall below investment grade, you have obligations, but they’re only 90 days. So that’s a much smaller part of that guarantee. So again, I would just say, really, $600 million to $700 million of that guarantee number that you may have heard Southern talk about, we are just simple monthly or quarterly guarantees – for monthly guarantees of their rate with very little risk, because there is really no changes to that. That’s just the normal course business activity. One thing we haven’t talked much about EBITDA generation. I mean we see a pretty consistent in their history – a pretty consistent, I think, Southern talked about this, EBITDA generation of $20 million to $30 million from this business, and we expect it to stay somewhere under our – there will be an occasional market dislocation like we just saw, but generally, $20 million to $30 million of EBITDA generation. That doesn’t mean the earnings will be consistently that way. We will be doing adjustments to our EBITDA, where some quarters, it may be quite a bit bigger; some quarters, less. But over a year, it would average out to that $20 million to $30 million. So hopefully, that answers your question. But there’s not huge credit exposure for us as a company other than the just normal ongoing business activities of Sequent.
Alex Kania: Great. That was helpful. Thanks. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gabriel Moreen with Mizuho.
Gabriel Moreen: Hey, good morning everyone. Most of my questions have been asked or answered. I’m just curious on the additional solar projects that were identified, just kind of where you think you are in the $400 million, I think, bogey that you put out there during the ESG Day? Does that – how much closer that takes you to that?
Chad Zamarin: Yes. Yes. This is Chad. We’ve got pretty in line of sight to what we showed in our ESG Investor Day and potentially even more than that. Of the 13 projects that had what we consider advance beyond day 1, over half of those are now filed with utility regulators in order for us to advance those projects, which means we’ve locked in scope. We’ve locked in land. We have a commercial construct that we are comfortable with and those will go beyond what we call Gate 2 in the near-term, which is effectively in FID stage. So of the 16 now projects that we have, it’s over $250 million of investment opportunities. We would expect and we have a goal for at least half of those projects to achieve what we’re considering FID this year. That – I’m pretty confident that all those projects will get where we need to be. But the primary initial gating item is making sure we’ve got sufficient land, and that’s really what drives the ultimate size and scope of the project. And so that’s what we’re spending the most time on, on the front end here. But I’d say we still have pretty strong line of sight to the kind of scale that we identified during our Investor Day.
Gabriel Moreen: Thanks, Chad. And then maybe just a quick follow-up, I noticed that – I think Northeast Supply enhancement filed for an extension at the FERC. Is that project still being worked? I mean I’m just quite curious kind of how that project fits in the portfolio now if at all considering regional energy access?
Michael Dunn: Hi, Gabe, it’s Michael. Yes. We had a – an expiration of that certificate that was upcoming. And so through just the normal course, requested an extension on that. We still have a proceeding agreement, basically a contract with our customer there. They have not canceled the project as yet. And obviously, they are still struggling, getting their other projects off the ground from a permitting standpoint that we’re going to supplement in the near-term, their ability to serve their customers, increased usage of natural gas. So we thought it was prudent to go ahead that extension. And other than that, we’re not working with projects with the exception of having conversations with our customers at this time. We still think there is a great need for natural gas in that market. There is still a great opportunity to take fuel oil out of that market and improve the emissions profile in the Northeast. And we’re still ready to serve that market when the customer and or the regulatory jurisdictions see fit to allow us to do that.
Gabriel Moreen: Thanks, Michael.
Michael Dunn: But we have no capital allocated to the project at this time, just to be clear.
Gabriel Moreen: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our final question for the day comes from the line of Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.
Becca Followill: Just following up on Tristan’s question, you talked at the beginning that you’re beginning to review how to allocate capital given that you’ve reached your leverage target. Will you make that the capital allocation decisions or some type plan public maybe in 2022 when you finish that review?
Alan Armstrong: Becca, I think it will probably just come out in, for instance, if we commit to emission reduction projects that drive our capital budget for ‘22 higher, then that’s kind of where we would announce that. And if we haven’t done that, then it would – then the two options to that would be further debt reduction just naturally or for buybacks of shares as another alternative. So I think as we start to formulate our 2022 CapEx budget and our strategy sessions with the Board, which then rotate into budget meetings towards the end of the year, that’s really when we’ll be making the decisions on whether that money will go to investments in new CapEx or left those other two alternatives. And I would think that by the first of the year, then we would be in a position to say what we would expect to do if it wasn’t going towards further capital investment.
Becca Followill: Great. Thank you, that’s all I had. 
Alan Armstrong: Thanks, Becca.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.
Alan Armstrong: Thank you, Amicus.
Operator: Thank you. Have a nice day.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-23 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to The Williams Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Danilo Juvane Vice President of Investor Relations, please go ahead.
Danilo Juvane: Thanks, Lindsay, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in The Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon, we released our earnings press release and a presentation that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and our Chief Financial Officer, John Chandler, will speak to this morning. Also joining us on the call today are Michael Dunn, our Chief Operating Officer; Lane Wilson, our General Counsel; and Chad Zamarin, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development. In our presentation materials, you'll find a disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to generally accepted accounting principles. These reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the day's presentation materials. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong: Great, and thanks Danilo and thank you all for joining us today. We're pleased to share the results of a very strong fourth quarter, rounding out a year of record business performance for Williams that yet again, illustrates the stability and predictability of our business. So starting here with Slide 1. First of all, I'm thrilled to announce that our EBITDA once again exceeded the midpoint of our original guidance range for the fourth consecutive year and resulted in a 4% CAGR for the same four-year period. And that also during the same period, we dramatically improved our credit metrics through our asset sell program. So, really, a nice steady period here of very predictable growth and balance sheet improvement. This unmatched predictability is important to our value proposition and is further reinforced by this being the 20th consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding Street expectations. We also met or exceeded all of our other key financial metrics allowing us to once again produce positive free cash flow, even after buying the outstanding interest in Cayman 2 that controls Blue Racer Midstream in the fourth quarter. Our focus on continuously improving our project execution, our operating margin ratio, reliability metrics and safety performance delivered strong financial performance again in 2020 and allowed us to yet again achieve record gas gathering volumes and contracted gas transmission capacity. In all of these steady improvements and accomplishments build offers as a clear foundational strategy that allows us to stay focused and aligned across the organization. We demonstrated incredible business resiliency in a year of unprecedented challenges for our industry and our country. Our strong results in 2020 showed just how durable this business can be against several headwinds such as the COVID-19 pandemic and associated oil price collapse, major customer bankruptcies, and an active hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico that exceeded anything from an outage standpoint that we had on record. This tumultuous 2020 market environment allowed us to truly distinguish ourselves. In fact, we were one of the few midstream companies to maintain and in fact deliver on our pre-COVID guidance ranges that we provided to you in 2019. And I'm excited to see what this organization can produce without the large number of headwinds that we navigated through this past year in 2021. Moving on here. In addition to executing on our business in 2020, we accelerated our ESG performance. Last summer, Williams became the first U.S. midstream company to announce a climate commitment, setting an emissions reduction goal for 2030 that is based on real achievable targets and that imposes accountability on the management team that’s setting these goals. We believe that focusing on the right here and right now opportunity sets us on a positive trajectory to achieving net zero target by 2050. In addition, we co-led an industry effort to standardize ESG metrics with the Energy Infrastructure Council. And in January, we hosted the industry's first ever ESG event specifically devoted to sharing the company's direction, goals, aspirations, and tangible accomplishments related to ESG performance. In summary, in 2020, we once again demonstrated the stability and predictability of our business. And importantly, we've also shown the ability to focus and execute our plan without being distracted by the challenging macro backdrop. And with that, I'll turn it over to John to go through the details.
John Chandler: Thanks, Alan. As a very high-level summary for the quarter, our cost reduction efforts, new Transco projects brought into service, incredibly strong results out of our Northeast G&P segment, and a catch-up of minimum volume commitment EBITDA from a favorable Wamsutter/South and bankruptcy settlement helped to offset a decline in profits from deferred revenue step-downs at our Gulfstar Deepwater platform along with shut-ins from hurricane activities early during the fourth quarter of 2020. As you can see, the strong performance in our statistics on this page. In fact, we saw improvement in all of our key financial metrics both for the fourth quarter and for the full year. First, our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up $52 million or 4% for all of the reasons I just mentioned. The same played out on our year-to-date results. Adjusted EBITDA year-to-date was up $90 million or 2%. However, I think it's interesting to point out that if you adjust for non-cash to deferred revenue step-downs at our Gulfstar platform and at our Barnett gathering system, both of which were known and expected, as well as a few other smaller non-cash items our year-to-date adjusted EBITDA without these non-cash comparability items is actually up 4%. Again, much like it was during the fourth quarter. We'll discuss EBITDA variances in more depth in a moment. Adjusted EPS for the quarter increased 29% largely due to increased EBITDA and reduced income taxes where during the fourth quarter of 2019 there was a larger than normal state tax adjustment and also to a certain extent lesser interest expense this year. Our year-to-date EPS is also up 11%, again due to increased EBITDA, lower allocations of income to non-controlling interest owners and again to a lesser extent due to lower interest expense. This quarter representing a new cash flow metric, and we'll continue to present this going forward. The measure is available funds from operations. This measure will replace distributable cash flow and is similar to DCF except it's derived from cash from operations and as before all capital spending including before maintenance capital. Or said differently, AFFO is simply cash from operations adjusting out working capital fluctuations and also adjusting for cash flows from or to our non-controlling interest owners that shows up in the financing section of our cash flow statement. A reconciliation of this measure to cash from operations can be found in the appendix of this presentation and also in our analyst package. You can see the AFFO grew for both the fourth quarter and year-to-date similar to the growth in adjusted EBITDA except some of the EBITDA growth is from our consolidated JVs. And so, some of that growth does belong and does flow to our JV owners. Distributable cash flow increase for the quarter did a higher EBITDA and also due to a $42 million alternative minimum tax refund we received during the quarter that was not present in the 2019 period. DCF for the year is also up again due to higher EBITDA and lower maintenance capital, offset somewhat by increased EBITDA paid to our non-controlling interest owners and due to a lower alternative minimum tax cash refunds that we received for overall in 2020 versus 2019. On the capital spending front, our intentional capital discipline drove capital spending down this year and free cash flow up. And to that point, our total capital spending for the year was 40% less than last year and that our spending this year included the acquisition of most of the remaining interest in the Cayman 2 Blue Racer ownership for about $160 million in mid-November. As a result of that acquisition, we are now at 50% owner of Blue Racer with first reserve owning the other 50% interest. And we're excited to see what synergies we can bring to that business now that we have a larger stake and we're the operator. Included in this capital spending number is also maintenance capital, which for the year was $393 million, about $107 million less than it was in 2019. Finally, if you put our AFFO in 2020 of $3.6 million, up against our total capital spending including maintenance of $1.5 billion and our dividends of $1.9 billion, you can see that we were free cash flow positive in 2020. This strong cash generation and capital discipline has helped move us towards our goal to improve our leverage metrics for the year. And this year, our debt-to-EBITDA metrics ended at 4.35 times down from 4.39 times at the end of 2019. So now let's go to the next slide and dig in a little deeper into our EBITDA results for the quarter. Again, Williams performed very well this quarter. As you'll hear throughout each segment, cost control has been a big benefit this year. Before we dive in each segment, we believe it's important to isolate a few unusual items to make the numbers more comparable and reflective of the ongoing performance of the business. We've identified those unusual items which are shown on this chart as non-cash comparability items. Interestingly for the quarter, they net only $2 million dollars and they consist primarily of two things. The first is a $24 million reduction in non-cash deferred revenue step-down and our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico segment on our Deepwater Gulfstar platform. As a reminder of deferred revenue, we received significant upfront cash payments several years ago from the Deepwater producer but did not recognize revenue at that time. We have an amortizing the payments we previously received in the income over the last several years and that amortization has been shrinking. The second unusual item is a $20 million minimum volume commitment through-up that we made in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to our settlement with South who agreed to pay us the MVCs they owed us for the year. This adjustment is for the first through the third quarter that we recorded in the fourth quarter. We had stopped recording those MVCs at the beginning of 2020 when South originally filed for bankruptcy. So with or without those non-cash items, our EBITDA was at over 4%. Our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico segment produced results that were $25 million better than the same period last year. New transmission pipeline projects added $17 million in revenues for the quarter including the Gateway project that came into service in the fourth quarter of 2019. The Hillabee Phase 2 project that came into service in the second quarter of 2020 and the Southeastern Trails project that went into service during the fourth quarter of 2020. We also did have a little over $20 million in lower costs during the fourth quarter of 2020 due to lower maintenance and lower cost during the fourth quarter of 2020 due to lower maintenance and lower labor expenses. Offsetting these positives was $10 million in lower Gulf of Mexico profits due to shut-ins resulting from hurricane activity occurring in October which is unusual for hurricane activity this late in the year. The impact of the shut-ins can be further seen in reduced deepwater gathering volumes which were down about 13% quarter-over-quarter. The Northeast G&P segment continues to come on very strong producing record results and contributing $29 million of additional EBITDA this quarter. Collectively, total Northeast gathering volumes grew 7% in the quarter and processing volumes were up 9%. The volume growth was predominately at our joint ventures in the Bradford Supply Hub where we benefited from a gathering system expansion on that system in late 2019 and at our Marcellus South supply basin where we benefited from more productive wells at larger pads. As a result, our EBITDA from equity method investments improved by a little over $20 million in the Northeast which also includes the additional benefit of additional profits from Blue Racer, again, due to our increased ownership which again was acquired in mid-November. The Northeast also benefited from cost reduction efforts of about $9 million, much of which came from reduced labor cost. And then finally on the West. Our West segment was down about $8 million compared to 2019. But within that, revenues overall improved a little less than $10 million dollars in the West with increases coming from higher rates in net MVCs in the Eagle Ford supply basin due to the contract renegotiations that we completed with Chesapeake in late 2019 and due to special payments received from our partner on OPPL for allowing them to pull volumes off of the system. These revenue increases were offset somewhat by lower deferred revenues in the Barnett Shale, lower Haynesville revenues due to lower volumes and rate, and slightly lower volumes in the Mid-Continent and Rockies. Despite revenues being up, in total, gathered volumes for the West were down 8%. Interestingly though, roughly 90% of that volume decline occurred in the Haynesville, Eagle Ford and Wamsutter. And of note each of these basins were impacted by customer bankruptcy with the South reemergence filing bank reemergence filing a couple of weeks ago, all those bankruptcy should be resolved soon. Also of note, in two of those three basins where we saw a majority of our volumes decline, specifically in the Wamsutter and Eagle Ford, our revenues are protected by MVC’s so overall the reduced volumes only had a small impact on revenues. And just as with our other segments, the West experienced lower costs with about $3 million as we keep a relentless focus on efficiencies and cost controls. Now offsetting the higher revenues and lower costs in the West where commodity margins which declined about $8 million due in part to lower volumes and due to a contract commitment there. We also had the absence of a favorable property tax reimbursement that we received in the fourth quarter of 2019. That was $6 million and it was something that we'd received from a third-party compression provider. And we also had lower JV EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2020 of $4 million with most of that coming from lower OPPL profits and again though our partner going OPPL whole as I mentioned a minute ago reflected in our revenues. Now moving to year-to-date results. You know, our year-to-date results showed growth of 1.8% of adjusted EBITDA driven by many of the same factors affecting our fourth quarter growth. The Barnett and Gulfstar noncash deferred revenue step downs totaled $109 million in 2020 versus 2019. While the net impact of commodity price fluctuations on our inventory line proposition created an $8 million noncash reduction in EBITDA. So, without those noncash comparability items, full year adjusted EBITDA results were actually up more like 4% much like our fourth quarter results. And then looking at that by segment the Transmission and Gulf of Mexico assets delivered $41 million of growth with an uplift coming from expansion projects and expense reductions being offset somewhat by lower Gulf of Mexico volumes and the impact that has had on commodity margins in the TGOM area. In the Gulf of Mexico, the total impact of shut-ins from COVID, hurricanes and the price collapse earlier in 2020 had about a negative $49 million impact to our EBITDA. The Northeast is obviously a huge part of our growth this year, adding $194 million in EBITDA in 2020 versus the prior year with the overall gathering volumes up 7% and incremental revenues being realized from processing, transportation of fractionation of gas and NGLs while at the same time we have been reducing costs. And finally, in the West, it’s off by $33 million largely because of the Barnett MVC payment that ended in June of 2019 and lower Haynesville profits due to lower realized rates, being offset somewhat by reduced operating expenses in the West. Otherwise in the West, our gather volumes were down about 4%, but they were largely offset by higher rates in the MVCs and Eagle Ford the renegotiated contract with Chesapeake in December of 2019. So, again, all in all, despite a tough market and a tough hurricane season, we've had a really good year on the backs of cost reductions, Northeast performance and new pipeline projects coming into service on Transco. I'll now turn the call back over to Alan to discuss our 2021 guidance. Alan?
Alan Armstrong: Okay. Well, thanks, John. And now, we're going to turn to our 2021 EBITDA guidance metrics. So, I want to emphasize that we continue to expect the same level of supportive fundamentals underpinning our base business for 2021. However, we do have more upside potential than we had in 2020 in this plan due in part to upstream transactions that have the potential to drive incremental cash flows across our midstream assets in 2021 and beyond, plus an emerging gas storage imbalance caused by the recent higher demand that will likely we put a call on gas-directed drilling here in 2021 as well. So, we're providing our initial EBITDA guidance range of $5.05 billion to $5.35 billion with the midpoint up 2% over last year. And we'll get to EBITDA drivers here in just a second on what those specifics are. But let's go through the rest of the guidance here. Our available funds from operations or AFFO as John described which will now replace DCF are expected to be within a range of $3.55 billion to $3.85 billion, which translates to a per share range of $2.92 up to $3.16 per share. And importantly, even with the 2.5% increase in the dividend announced earlier in the year, we are still maintaining similar coverage on our dividend whether we're looking at DCF metric or AFFO metric. And this continues to really underscore the continued safety of our dividend. Our growth CapEx of $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion is expected to remain in line with 2020. And this includes known opportunistic upstream acquisitions in Wamsutter Basin that will be immediately accretive to both credit metrics and earnings. And notably, we still expect to generate free cash flow after CapEx and dividends which provide us financial flexibility. And speaking of financial flexibility, we estimate ending the year with a leverage ratio of 4.25 with the line of sight that we have currently to a targeted 4.2 objective as we have consistently over achieved on this metric, and I know a lot of you all follow that very closely. We’ll continue to perform very well on that and we think we've got a lot of things that could help drive us towards that 4.2 or getting to that 4.2 here in 2021. So looking at drivers of our 2021 EBITDA guidance, we expect continued Northeast G&P growth from the base business and to a lesser extent, the bolt-on Blue Racer acquisition. In our Transmission and Gulf of Mexico business, we see Transco growth continuing to add stable EBITDA via the Southeastern Trails Project that was just placed in service ahead of schedule at the end of the year. And we expect late year contributions to come from our Leidy South expansion which is now under construction. And additionally, we expect a nice recovery in our Gulf of Mexico earnings this year due to less production outages from hurricanes and the COVID-19 pandemic impacts. Offsets to our EBITDA growth are driven primarily from lower NGL throughput on the jointly-owned Overland Pass pipeline, lower earnings on our jointly-owned Rocky Mountain Midstream business in the DJ basin, and lower gathering rates from our global resolution in the Haynesville with Chesapeake Energy. So, these are partial offsets that we do already have built into our guidance. And of course, on that last note, a lot of potential upside too is coming in the Haynesville, both from a much healthier Chesapeake, well-positioned to develop the Haynesville which is very well-positioned in this gas market as well as our ability to drive volumes on the upstream properties that we now control. Our takeaway here is that our EBITDA is primarily driven by growth in the base business with upstream EBITDA accounting for less than 1% of this forecast. We purposely did not include a full year of the upstream EBITDA from these existing producing reserves because we fully intend to transact during the year in a way that allows us to enjoy midstream cash flow growth in 2022 and beyond as we find the right partner to fully exploit the growth available in these high-value properties that we were able to pick up this past year. So, we are in a very strong position now to ensure that this acreage is developed quickly and gets turned into fee-based growth on our existing midstream capacity. So, we really are excited about the upside potential that we positioned ourselves for around that business. So in closing, I'll reiterate that intense focus on her natural gas-based strategy has built a business that is steady and predictable with continued moderate growth, improving returns, and free cash flows. Our best-in-class long-haul pipes are in the right place and our formidable gathering assets are in low-cost bases that will be called on to meet gas demands that continue to grow. We remain bullish on natural gas because we recognize the critical role it plays and will continue to play in both our countries and the world pursuit of a clean energy future. Natural gas is an important component of today's fuel mix and should be prioritized as one of the most important tools to aggressively displace more carbon intensive fuels around the world. Williams is focused on sustainable operations including ready now solutions to address climate change and by setting a near-term goal for 2030, we will leverage our natural gas-focused strategy and today's technologies to focus on immediate opportunities to reduce emissions in and around our business. We also are looking forward and anticipating future innovations and technologies that we can use on our key energy network to deliver on this next phase of energy transition. I also think it is important in light of last week's severe cold weather event to talk about the resiliency and reliability of our natural gas infrastructure. Despite historic coal that envelope much of the country, Williams did not have to curtail any services to our gas transmission customers and in fact operated above designed capacity on our Northwest pipeline system for a period and delivered flawlessly on a new record three-day peak on the Northwest Pipeline system. Our customers expect this from us based on our long history of performance and we are certainly glad that they do. However, last week's weather demonstrated the importance of a comprehensive energy strategy of the need for a comprehensive energy strategy for the US, one that doesn't demonize one energy source over the other but that includes a mix of energy that does not drive towards singular dependency because of labels imposed by the environmental opposition. And there are important and complex decisions that need to be balanced to address the things that we all want from our energy sources, reliability, affordability and balancing the issues of carbon intensity. And when we think about carbon intensity, we really have to consider that from a global perspective. And we believe that when all of these factors are accurately weighed and balanced, natural gas will be a very critical part of the energy mix for many more decades to come. So, finally, I want to recognize the tremendous efforts of our entire workforce in ensuring the safe and reliable delivery of natural gas to America's cities and communities not only this last week in the face of severe weather challenges but amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Many of those who benefit from our services may never realize the work needed to ensure that continued access to safe and reliable energy. Our employees are critical infrastructure workers on the frontlines of keeping our country's natural gas system operating and flowing, doing so while also enduring power outages and lack of water at their own homes. I am extremely proud of our employees for their efforts to keep our operations running smoothly during these extreme circumstances while also going the extra mile to keep themselves and their co-workers safe and healthy. And with that, I'll open it up for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan Securities. Your line is now open.
Jeremy Tonet: Just want to touch based on the CapEx outlook, as you talked about it there, the $1 billion to $1.2 billion, and just wanted to see what's, the drivers behind that? Could there potentially be CapEx creep or do you see this as kind of a steady level? And then, just - if you could expand a bit more on the opportunistic upstream acquisitions in the Wamsutter, what that is exactly, that would be very helpful? Thanks.
Alan Armstrong: You bet, Jeremy thank you. Well first of all, I would say we - in our base business, we have about $900 million of capital in what would be our normal base business. It is a little bit lower than what we've had historically. And that is about - half of that is in TGOM. So, that includes [indiscernible], it includes building out Leidy South, kind of the final dollars on Southeastern Trail’s and clean-up and so forth on Southeastern Trail’s and some money on the front-end of the REA project. So, that’s kind of the primary drivers there in TGOM that's about half of that $900 million. And then, on the balance of that, about two-thirds of that is in the Northeast both finishing up projects, as well as getting some new project started that are driving higher margins for us in the new Northeast and some of that growth. A lot of that investment actually will drive growth in 2022, there in the Northeast as well. And then, finally the balance of that is in the West. Some of that is in the Permian, pretty good expansion going on in the Permian as well as in the Haynesville area. As we're really going to be having to work hard to keep out front of a lot of drilling activity that's emerging there in the Haynesville. So, that pretty well rounds that up. The second part of your question around the opportunistic upstream involves us taking advantage of the strong position we had with our midstream assets out there, particularly around the Southland bankruptcy. And we will be in the position of acquiring both the BP acreage out there that's adjacent and intermingled with that as well as the Southland acreage. And we're able - given our position in the bankruptcy there. We were able to pick that up for some very attractive pricing. And as a result now, we're going to be working to gain the right person, the right party to rapidly develop those reserves and take advantage of the late and midstream capacity that we have out there. So, we are really excited about that both in the Wamsutter, because there's a tremendous amount of value to be driven across our midstream assets. By using the PDP cash flows to drive that as well as in the Haynesville where we're already seeing Chesapeake get very focused on developing the remaining - the northern part of the Haynesville that they hang on to. And as well as some very attractive interest coming from parties that we're in the process to find the right party to develop the Haynesville acreage. So, I want to make it clear we have no intention of hanging on to that. We're not going to become an E&P business. There is no ifs, ands or buts on that front. But this does allow us to put the right parties in place and assure ourselves that we have the right parties in place to take the cash flows off of these assets and put it back into the drill bit to drive midstream cash flows. So, really has turned into something actually a lot more positive than we were expecting. And we really feel like there's a lot of upside from this both in 2021 and as well though into 2022 and beyond as we attracted the capital to develop those reserves. So really what is normally an area that might have been a problem for us with all these bankruptcies. We really were able to find a way to really turn some lemons into lemonade there. And we're really excited about the kind of value that's going to be driven out there over the next several years.
John Chandler: And Jeremy just to be clear there and I think it was, but just to reiterate. In our midpoint guidance for growth capital of $1.1 billion that included those acquisitions of that upstream acreage in the Wamsutter. And so Alan mentioned - a run rate for everything other than that of $900 million maybe a little bit more than $900 million. So, we paid less than $200 million for those assets actually significantly less than $200 million, not more than $150 million to $160 million for that acreage. Then we have very little EBITDA on our guidance for that, because we're not sure exactly what kind of partnership structure we'll have if somebody else just buy a part of that acreage where we partner and we'll see EBITDA uplift. So, there's a lot of big upside I think that we can see out of that.
Chad Zamarin: Yes, and one thing, and this is Chad to note, one of the reasons why I think we were uniquely positioned to step-in in this transitional role in Wamsutter and BP asset, the Southend asset are checkerboard of acreage in Wamsutter. And so, we were uniquely positioned to acquire those properties put them together as one continuous package and then move that, that asset to producer that can now develop it to its full potential. It was really locked in a situation where we couldn't have a producer get the full potential out of that acreage because of the checkerboard nature of Wamsutter. So, we're able to clean that up and now we're going to focus on moving that, that now contiguous position to a producer that can fully develop it - really reach its full potential.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it, that's very helpful color. Thanks. And just to recap on the CapEx side. It sounds like it's a very disciplined approach there, not really expecting any kind of creep over the course of the year from what you guys can see. Is that fair to take away there?
Alan Armstrong: Yes I think, just as we've demonstrated, in the last several years we continue to impose a lot of capital discipline around our decisions. Even last year, lowering as you recall the only thing we did move in our guidance last year was lowering our CapEx during the year. And then we wound up even including the Blue Racer acquisition coming in under that so, yes. And I'll tell you our project execution teams have really been knocking it out of the park in terms of managing cost very tightly even, even in a difficult environment like COVID continue to deliver our projects under budget. So, we feel very good about the capital budget range that we have.
John Chandler: And the two key points there. We are free cash flow positive in 2021. So we'll generate more than enough cash to cover our dividends and capital and it allow us to de-leverage a little bit. That's the first important point. The second thing I'd say, we did give you maintenance capital guidance of I think at the midpoint, $450 million. Obviously, we spent under $400 million this year - in 2020. It was just artificially low just due to COVID and some issues getting some step-down in the field. So, I wouldn't call that creep. It is going back up from sub $400 million to about $450 million, but that's kind of what we believe kind of run rate to be our maintenance capital.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it, that's very helpful. And just one more, if I could post the election here, it seems like there's new energy policy coming out of D.C. and could impact federal lands production. Just wondering, any thoughts you could share with us on - higher level thoughts on energy policy coming out of D.C. and specifically, federal lands, how you think about that? Thanks.
Alan Armstrong: Yes, I would just say - I'm going to - yes Mike will give you some detail here on the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, because obviously, that's the area that would most impact us of all of our areas; otherwise, we're not too terribly impacted by it. But we've seen, maybe, a different story than has been - that you're hearing in media in terms of the actual actions going on out there. And most of the acreage is ready to develop. But Michael, if you would kind of share some of the detail that we're seeing there on the Deepwater.
Micheal Dunn: Good morning, Jeremy. We are seeing continued permitting activity coming from the current administration. Since the executive order came out, we've seen four applications for permits to drill. Already 60 of those have been issued in the Gulf of Mexico, 13 of those being on properties that are delivering to us. And then, when you talk about permits for modifications such as workovers, things of that nature on existing wells. 163 of those have been approved by the current administration and just under 30 of those are on our asset footprint. So, we're seeing a lot of activity for permit approvals out there. And in fact, we received our gas pipeline permit after the executive order for the Whale project. And they're continuing to process permits. And we had our Whale permit as we rolling for pipeline already last year. And so, we're continuing to work with our producer customers out there. And as you probably know, there is a lot of leases that they've locked up and a lot of permits that they already had in hand. And so, there's a long runway of activity that will continue to occur in the Gulf of Mexico, we believe.
Operator: Your next question comes from Praneeth Satish with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Praneeth Satish: So now that you're the operator Blue Racer, can you just elaborate on any of the steps you could take there to increase utilization on the system or capture any of the low-hanging cost synergies?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Sure. Michael, you want to take that?
Micheal Dunn: There's definitely an opportunity to capture some synergies there just like we did with the UEO interim acquisition that we became the operator on that asset. We rolled that into our Northeast JV. And we are having those conversations very similar with Blue Racer where we can consolidate some of the operations up there, utilize latent capacity in either one of our systems to the benefit of the other. There's a lot of activity currently on our northeast JV systems up there where our processing is full today and our fractionation facilities are full as well. And so, we would be looking to possibly use some of the Blue Racer capacity should it become available to move some of those volumes over to them and vice versa ultimately. So, we think there's a lot of definite commercial synergy to there ultimately and certainly some operational synergies with the teams that are there.
Praneeth Satish: And then, can you provide any more details on the producing assets that you received from Chesapeake in the Haynesville? Specifically, what is the production at right now on those assets? And any more clarity in terms of when you plan to monetize that?
Chad Zamarin: This is Chad. Relatively small amount of existing production around 30 million a day kind of pre last week's poll. It’s recovering. That had dropped a bit but is recovering. So not a lot of existing production around 130 existing wells. But I will first say we were really encouraged to see Chesapeake emerging from bankruptcy as a really healthy customer. So, I'll touch on Southland in a second but just know that they're very active up in the Spring Ridge area where they remain the owner/operator with two rigs and we think likely go into three rigs. So, that was good to see. And in Southland field, we view that as an additional opportunity where we have 350 million to 550 million a day of capacity available from a midstream perspective for development in that area. We closed on that transaction prior to 2021, and we've been out now talking to potential partners and we've seen incredibly plus interest in this asset. It is a contiguous locked-up position in some really top-tier both Haynesville and Mid-Bossier area and, again, has available midstream capacity. I would say that we're likely to finalize our partnership strategy over the next couple of months. I expect that we will have a very strong well-capitalized partner that will operate that asset and will dedicate one to two rigs at any given time to really fill up and utilize that capacity. So, we've seen an incredible amount of interest and I think we're really confident that we're going to find a great partner there and unlock the potential of that asset.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. And I would just add to that we are well into that process in terms of finding the right partner on that and we've been very encouraged by the strong level of interest from a number of parties. But we're not waiting around on that. We move very quickly. Chad and his team move very quickly to find the right partner.
Operator: Your next question comes from Christine Cho of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Christine Cho: Thank you. If I could maybe just talk about the high end of the EBITDA range that you gave for 2021, Alan, it sounds like you said it's mostly driven by your expectations for a call on gas especially with what went on last week. So, is this really driven by G&P volumes and is it mostly in the Northeast? I just wasn't sure if Haynesville and Wamsutter was included in that or if that was more of a post 2021 impact. And have the producers behind the system in the Northeast started to talk to you about these plants, if that is the case?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Thank you. Well, Christine, you're targeting right on the correct issue there. We really developed that plan before we've seen this recent call. And I think this week, we're going to see a huge pull on natural gas from storage this week and likely take us down below the five-year average. And meanwhile, production, we really haven't seen the activity in production to stabilize that decline in storage and the places that are going to be able to respond to that quickly are going to be Haynesville and the Marcellus and Utica. And so we didn't have any of that in our plans when we laid this plan out so certainly that is upside to this. In fact, most of the growth in the Northeast was really just margin expansion. It wasn't really a lot of volume, expected volume growth. The growth that we've had there is really just been margin expansion. So that is certainly an attractive upside for us there. It is not based on the upstream at all. In fact, we basically assumed - we'd just got the PDP’s flowing in here for Haynesville and Wamsutter assuming a July kind of finality to finding the right owner, so we only have cash flows in here on the Wamsutter area through about July. And in the Haynesville, we do have the PDPs in there, but we also have development capital that likely would be coming out of there if that gets done. So, I wouldn’t be the first to admit that we've been very conservative on the upstream side of this because we really wanted to leave ourselves full flexibility, and we didn't to be able to either fully dispose of the asset if the right price was there, but at the end of the day we just wanted to have full flexibility, so we were very conservative in how we included the value of those upstream positions. And you're right. I think, the upsides are probably mostly related to volumes in the Northeast, but I would also say we remain pretty conservative in the forecast that we have for the Deepwater and any other area frankly that can contribute from the gas side. So, and then I would say the other area that we've included - we've assumed rising cost versus 2020. We did a great job in 2020 on cost. And our 2021 does assume that we've got some comeback on cost that frankly the team has been doing a terrific job of managing. And so with that, that's another area of opportunity for us as well.
John Chandler: And just a couple of things maybe to play on that a little bit with Alan on Transco. We were successful in 2020 selling short-term firm both in Transco and Northwest pipe, and we don't have a repeat of that really in any meaningful way in 2021. That possibility still exists. We had all that hurricane activity in 2020, and our team reversed most of that in the forecast, but not all of that. We do expect that to be a little bit more active in 2021. And so, if that doesn't happen I think there is upside of just some additional EBITDA we just didn't put in that was left and is just conservative for hurricane activity. And then Alan pointed on the expenses. So, some of this is down.
Christine Cho: Okay. That's helpful. And then actually if we can move on to the weather impacts that we've seen in Texas and to a lesser extent in Macon. Is all of your natural gas storage in Texas contracted to third parties or do you have some for your own use? And how should we think last week's weather impacted you guys? It sounded like it was pretty neutral from a financial perspective in your prepared remarks, but any color there would be helpful?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Thanks, Christine. First of all, we actually don't have any gas storage in Texas. So, the storage on Transco is at Washington which is kind of the middle part of the state by Opelousas and so, that’s where the storage facilities are. So, there really wasn't a whole lot of impact there. And obviously, Transco is designed to flow from that area, designed to flow to the North and East, not back into Texas. In terms of the impact to us, I would say it was pretty small in terms of the impact to our gathering volumes just because we have such a dispersed business and the vast majority of our gathering is either Northeast or in the Rockies which were not directly impacted. But I would just say as well, our team did a great job of doing things like selling fuel and shrink that we had bought at first of the month, turning down our processing recoveries and then selling that fuel and shrink back into the market. And so, I would tell you that I think net-net, it's going to be a little bit of a positive for us in terms of the way we manage things. But we certainly saw a lot of outage in the Oklahoma, Texas, and Louisiana area on our gathering system that’s just a pretty small piece of our overall percentage of the business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gabriel Moreen with Mizuho. Your line is open.
Gabriel Moreen: I just had one in terms of bases in Appalachia and just how you're thinking about that within your forecast and kind of the cadence of the Northeast. Is there anything in your forecast for producers toggling gas on and off particularly during the shoulder seasons?
Alan Armstrong: Gabe, no. I would just say we pretty well just stick with the producers’ forecast that they've given us, and obviously they take that into consideration. And if the prices come up, they'll turn some volumes on, but a lot of the producers have their own takeaway capacity and certainly that amount that they're selling into that spot basis is pretty small, but it does impact their ability to sell incremental volumes if they have that. But we're not - that isn't driven a lot into our calculation. We basically just take what the producers are saying they're going to do. And to the degree that we have a line of sight for how that's going to happen and that's how we included. And so far, they've been pretty accurate, consistently pretty accurate in the way that they've been forecasting that. They know their reserves and they know the market. I will say that obviously we’re excited about Leidy South coming on and opening up additional capacity. That's about 580 million a day of additional takeaway capacity out of the Northeast. And our team has got a really good head start on Leidy South on the projects there. And so, again, great execution going on by that team. And then ultimately, REA will be additional takeaway out of that area as well. So, we're really - those projects are very important from a synergy standpoint because, not only do we get nice returns on the transmission, we get together and volume uplift - upstream of that as well.
John Chandler: And now to the question on shut-ins in response to price where we certainly could still see producers respond to market dynamics. But I do think 2021 is going to look different than 2020. We're coming into out of the winter at a much different storage inventory level. We're seeing natural gas prices stronger than they were a year ago. We do think that there will be A - John acreage that will continue to represent the value of our existing infrastructure. We're going to see more LNG demand come online this year, and we're going to continue to see the need for growth and supply out of the northeast. So, I'm not sure we'll see bases that will drive shut-in activity, but I think it will continue to reinforce the value of having infrastructure to move from Appalachia to growing markets. But we'll certainly keep an eye on it.
Gabriel Moreen: Thank you. And then maybe if I can just ask just kind of interesting a lot more time has been spent on the upstream assets sales and midstream asset sales, but maybe if I can ask kind of where the latest thinking is on additional midstream asset sales and whether I guess some of the impairments on assets like Rocky Mountain Midstream kind of change your thinking and evaluation about how those assets might fit with the portfolio longer term?
John Chandler: Yes. I don't really think so, Gabe. I think we were as to the RMM impairment that we took that's an equity level investment. So, obviously, it's very different than along the way you value a consolidated asset where you take the total cash flows on the asset over time. But in those, you actually have to market to market effectively. And we've given some of the sales that we've seen in the space. We've seen some lower markings on the value of assets. And that's what drives those kind of considerations. And in fact, as a result of that, it would probably drive us in the other direction because it's basically saying there's a weak market right now for GDP assets. And if that's true then this probably wouldn't be the right time to be liquidating assets. So not to say we don't constantly have our eyes open to structure and things that can add value from that but I think, you know, we're in a position of getting to our leverage metrics in a pretty straightforward manner and particularly these upstream assets which could be a really nice tool for that as well. And so right now, I would tell you I'm not sure it's the very best time to be trying to liquidate those assets.
Alan Armstrong: So, Gabe, one thing I think that is interesting, you know, when we were thinking about this early 2020, it was actually in January of 2020, I think we were heavy in the middle of thinking about trying to market some of our assets in the West. And there were a lot of question marks at the time around and around Chesapeake, what was going to happen at Chesapeake, what was going to happen in the West in general. And I think now a lot of those questions are cleared up and you can see through our performance I think we demonstrated the resiliency through diversification not that we didn't have issues in certain basins but we had good performance in other basins and it kind of washes itself out. And so, what I would say is while the market's probably a little bit weaker, I think our demonstrated performance on the business is a little bit stronger, a little bit clearer now a year later. So, I'm not sure what all that means but I think there's still opportunity still out there. And I think we've demonstrated strong performance which should help any if we ever wanted to pursue that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Spiro Dounis: First question is just on how you're thinking about sustainable EBITDA growth in the current environment. You guys once again highlighted about in the current environment. You guys once again he has once again highlighted about a $12 billion backlog on transmission projects. And so, simplistically the way I thought about it was kind of reflects about 10 years of growth and current CapEx level which I guess was enough to grow EBITDA about 2% this year in 2021. So just curious if based on that backlog of projects in front of you, you think sustaining 2% annual growth for next decade or so is maybe a floor or something you deem sort of easily achievable?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I'm going to have Michael speak to that backlog on projects, but I think you have to be careful about drawing that kind of conclusion. Most of the projects that we've been doing have been 6%. We still were rolling off a lot of deferred revenue this last year and a little bit into 2021. So I think you have to be careful about making those kind of broad assumptions. So, for instance, when the Deepwater business comes on, that's going to be a very high growth rate on a fairly low amount of capital. And in the northeast sometimes we get nice surges of margin based on very high incremental return opportunities as they come to us. And on the other hand we have a decline bill that's just part of the gathering business if there's an area that's not growing. There's a decline that's working against it all the time. But I would tell you that it's more complex than taking $1 billion and saying that that produces 2%. On the other hand, I would say I think we feel very comfortable with the 2% growth rate if we are investing $1 billion we feel very comfortable with achieving a 2% growth rate. But given some of the upsides that we've got in some of these areas I think that probably would be kind of considered a floor from my perspective on that. So, Mike, we might talk about the Transco project..
Micheal Dunn: Yes. We look at that backlog and it's really dynamic because we have a lot of projects that come into that backlog and then, we execute on a lot of those projects. And Southeastern Trail is one that came out of the backlog, Leidy South came out with that backlog and it became an execution project, and Regional Energy Access will be the same once we get that filing underway and get our permitting underway. And so, you'll continue to see projects come out of our backlog and move into the execution phase over the next several years. There is a plethora of opportunities along the Transco corridor to take advantage of coal-fired generation that's going to come offline and ultimately be converted to gas and to renewables. And I think from the activities we've seen in Texas and Oklahoma over the last week, there definitely needs to be a mixture of energy generation resources in the mix in order to diversify across fuel sources. And so, I'm a true believer in that our company is definitely a natural gas-focused company now adding in some renewable mix into the play there to take advantage of some opportunities we have. But ultimately, on the Transco system, we're going to be able to drive a lot of new capital investment there on the backs of coal-fired generation going away. And then lastly, our emissions reduction program projects. We have upwards of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion of investment opportunity there on Transco system and likely replacing a large component of our reciprocating compression to new modern either electric drives or gas turbines to reduce our emissions footprint there along the Transco corridor. So, there is definitely a lot of investment opportunity that we envision coming in the future for Transco’s asset footprint.
Spiro Dounis: Got it. Appreciate the color on that. Second one, just briefly going back to Blue Racer. Can you just talk about some of the circumstances that led up to you increasing your interest there and how you're thinking about the remaining stake you still don't own?
Micheal Dunn: Yes. So, just to remind people the ownership there, Blue Racer is - and Cayman 2 by the way, is no longer an entity. It'll now be Blue Racer
Alan Armstrong: Midstream Holdings.
Micheal Dunn: Midstream Holdings. Thank you. And so, now, that is owned effectively 50% by Williams and 50% percent by First Reserve, the parties that got out were primarily driven a consortium by Encap Flatrock Midstream. And so, that group has been an investor in that for a long time along with some of the management from Cayman 2. And obviously, they had held on to that much longer than a typical private equity shop likes to. And we've worked with them to liquidate them at the appropriate time. We think we bought it right at the right time and particularly given the large amount of synergies that we have available to extract from that business. And so, we're excited about the transaction. I can tell you we were super patient. We've been wanting to gain control of that asset and exploit the synergies between both our UEOM system and our Ohio Valley River. We've been wanting to take advantage of those. And it's been hard to not, but we've been patient. And I think our patience paid off and we're able to pick that up at a very attractive value. So that's kind of how I would offer that. But I think at the end of the day, it was a private equity held investment that was needing to get out the last investment they had and one of the funds they were wanting to get that look today.
Alan Armstrong: And it was a pretty complicated structure. So not only do we get it, we got some really good value but we cleaned up. We were the majority owner who came in which was half of the owner in Blue Racer. And there were two different boards that managed the joint venture and there was a lot of governance complexity. And so, we really cleaned up that asset governance. And when you think about the two large joint ventures in that part of the system now you have our OBM system which is 65% Williams, 35% [indiscernible] and you have Blue Racer which is now 50% Williams, and 50% first reserve. It's a much cleaner landscape for us to try to work on just creating value and optimizing value.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tristan Richardson with Truist Securities. Your line is now open.
Tristan Richardson: Appreciate all the comments on the Gulf of Mexico and around the outsized impact in 2020. I think you noted in the slides $49 million of downtime impact, question just on 2021. What a normalized season looks like or sort of just a regular storm season that maybe what you have baked in or generally your assumptions for 2021?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, Michael, you want to take that?
Micheal Dunn: Yes. What's normally our team does put some hurricane impacts in there and it's usually between $5 million and $10 million of EBITDA impact based on what a non-hurricane year would look like. So, it's not a huge reduction that we would typically see there on a normal year that we built into our forecast.
John Chandler: And I think I alluded to a minute ago I think when Christine was asking questions, we - of that $49 million negative impact we had in 2020 versus 2019. We've got all but about $10 million of that reversing itself in 2021. So if we still held $10 million of even maybe a little bit more than normal outsized negatives into 2021 as well because the $49 million was comparison to 2019.
Micheal Dunn: That's right. Yes.
Tristan Richardson: That's helpful. Appreciate it, John. And then just thinking about where your commodity exposure lies in the G&P businesses, could you maybe just give us a quick high level of maybe where the most POP lies versus people where we should think about those exposures regionally just at a high level?
John Chandler: Yes. We have very little to start off with it compared to the way the business used to be structured we just had very little and it's getting harder and harder to see frankly. But the areas that we do have the most exposure are primarily keep all agreements in our Opal area and we do have some exposure in the Gulf Coast as well. So you'll see that listed as Southwest Wyoming when I'd say Opal, I think our EBITDA breakout, I mean it shows you to the Southwest Wyoming. So that's the majority of that exposure. And again, though, we do have some margin in places like our discovery asset in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. But I think the total and plan on gross margin basis were down to well under 2% now so it's a really, really small amount.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. And one of the benefits of Wamsutter, we have a small amount in Wamsutter, but we’ll actually modernize those contracts to be fee-based as part of our cleanup of the Wamsutter basins. So, we’ll further reduce a little bit our existing POL and keep those contracts.
Micheal Dunn: I might just add so we don't skip over one thing. We do have areas like in the Barnett where our gathering contracts are exposed. They have a floor, but then they're exposed to gas prices above that. Similarly in Laurel Mountain Midstream, we have - those contracts basically are base level, but then they have exposure to gas prices above that. So, we do have some contracts that have direct gas price exposure and the Barnett and Laurel Mountain are the two areas that really have those.
Operator: Our next question comes from Derek Walker with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Derek Walker: I know we're over the hour here, so just two quick ones for me. Alan I think in your former remarks you talked about line of sight on the leverage side with potential to have that $1.2 billion target achieved in 2021. Can you just talk about some of the drivers that could get you to that? I know that your guidance is 4.25, but how are thinking about some of the drivers that could get you to that 4.2 in 2021?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Well, I would say there is really two areas there. One is, obviously, the obvious and when I talked with Christine earlier about some of the upsides drivers for 2021 and our EBITDA, obviously, that's the simple way for us and probably, I would say that most profitable. But as well, I think capital reductions that would come to us associated with the transactions on the upstream as well where we would lay off some of that capital responsibility to third-party. So, those are the two kind of easy ways to get there, I would say. And obviously, the EBITDA upside is one that probably has a clearest line of sight to.
Derek Walker: Got it, and then maybe just a quick one? Just on the - are you seeing much - I know there’s lot of commentary around kind of the upstream side of things. But are you seeing much difference in the behavior ex-kind of bankruptcies from public E&Ps versus private E&Ps and what areas are you seeing some of those big differences, if any?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, I've noticed that a lot of analysts are starting to pick up on that. And clearly, the public markets are just - have been sour about spending on anything. And I think the private markets have been seeing the opportunity and taking advantage of that pullback. We certainly are seeing that Haynesville is the poster child for that for sure where there’s so much private capital that's going to work there. And it's an attractive place because you don't have a lot of the basis risk that you have to manage in the long haul capacity risk that you have to manage coming out of the Marcellus. So, it's an easy place to go in, in a fairly de-risk manner. And that's what's attracting - as Chad mentioned, that's also what's attracting a lot of capital to our opportunity there in the Haynesville. So, that's definitely - the money that can come in and get out pretty quickly by turning a bit. And turning it into cash up against the current - forward strip which is what a lot of the private parties are doing is what we're seeing. So it's a fairly de-risk model and they're just looking around the various basins for opportunities to do that. But clearly in our line of sight, Haynesville is the area that's getting the most attention in that regard.
Operator: Our next question will be from Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering & Holt. Your line is now open.
Colton Bean: So, just wanted to follow-up on some of the comments there around volumes. It sounded like for G&P, the guidance assumes something close to maintenance in the Northeast. Is that a fair characterization? And then just any high level comments on what you're looking for in the West would be appreciated?
Alan Armstrong: Mike, we’ll take that?
Michael Dunn: Yes, fairly gathering side. We are looking at most likely maintenance-type activities on the gathering side. But on the processing side - it's highly dependent on the producer and the basin in the Northeast just to be clear. There are some upsides and downsides. But on the processing side, we are seeing a large influx of volumes year-over-year that we will continue to enjoy nice margins there. Our processing at Oak Grove is at capacity and we're finishing up our DXB 3 there. It should be online next month. And our fractionation facility as I said earlier, are at capacity level as well. So we're seeing a lot of activity continuing in the West Virginia, Ohio Southwest [indiscernible] area that will drive a lot of volumes to our processing facilities where we see the upside occurring to our 2020 performance in 2021.
Alan Armstrong: One thing that you'll see in the Northeast is even though our volumes don't look like they're going up that much in the Northeast, Laurel Mountain Midstream, Chevron pullback, EQT is taken that production over. We have an NBC so it really doesn't have a meaningful revenue impact to us, but they - no that volume is declining there. And so, that's muting maybe a little bit of the volume growth you otherwise never seen in Northeast especially around Marcellus South.
Michael Dunn: And just to be clear there, it’s a little bit confusing sometimes in the Southwest Marcellus in West Virginia area there, because we gather some of that gas and then we spin it off to third-parties to other third-party processors because we've been full. And so once we have that capacity built we get that business back. And so that's not obvious sometimes that we don't process everything we gathered, and we don't gather everything we process. And so, those two numbers don't go hand-in-hand necessarily.
Alan Armstrong: And the West where we're seeing the least activity in the Eagle Ford which has NBC protection so though you might see some additional volume decline and NBC protected in the Eagle Ford. And we should see activity though increasing in the Haynesville and those gas-directed - the majority of our West beyond Eagle Ford is gas-directed activity and - with a relatively robust gas price. And we should see good activity on the gas side of that.
Michael Dunn: And I'd say also as it relates to the West, in 2021 you're seeing the back end - not as much production activity in the Haynesville as we've seen now with Chesapeake back recapitalized and new producers in the South Mansfield that we're working with. And on the Wamsutter, the same is happening in the Wamsutter, BP wasn't really active nor with Southland obviously, because they're in bankruptcy. And so, we're not going to see that in 2021, but in 2022 I think you'll see those volumes start to turn back around.
Colton Bean: And appreciate that detail and just a final one from me. I think you all highlighted a couple of times how you will - be either near or at the long-term leverage target to exit this year. So as you look forward, can you just update us on where you stand on capital allocation whether that be further debt reduction looking at a buyback authorization or supplementing the existing backlog with some renewables investments, appreciate it?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, I would just say - that question obviously is something that we've been saying for quite some time - will be coming to us. And I think as we get to this end of this year obviously that will be. But make no mistake about it the first thing and we've been very clear on this is debt reduction - is the first place to go with that. Once we get beyond that, things like investing in our rate base on Transco, on things like the emission reduction projects will be put up against other alternatives for that capital reduction whether that's further debt reduction or share buyback. And those are the things that would be in competition for that further capital allocation as we get into that year. But it's an interesting dilemma, because not very many people. In fact, I don't know if I could describe to you, too many other pipelines that are in the position of being able to invest in the rate base. And for us the cost of capital it just hasn't met that return hurdle internally. So, in the past it really hadn't been thought of as an opportunity. But as we think about the emission reduction project, that's some very sizable capital investment opportunity that will make a decision on that versus other alternatives from a cost of capital standpoint. So, I think that's the best color I can give you on that at this point.
Operator: Our last question will come from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Michael Lapides: Thank you for taking my questions. One easy one which is OpEx and G&A in 2021 over 2020, up down flattish, just trying to look for a little direction. And then second, can you remind us, what's the expected CapEx for Regional Energy Access and what are the key permitting milestones we need to look for?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, Mike, why don’t you take both of those, if you don’t mind?
Michael Dunn: Yes, on Regional Energy Access, we have publicly stated in our pre-filing it was $760 million a day project. I think by the time we filed here in a few weeks, we'll be at or above that level. And what we’ve said in the past is it's between $800 million and $1 billion of investment. And we're probably at the lower end of that right now based on we’re filing activity looks…
Alan Armstrong: So yes, John is going to take the first part of your question.
John Chandler: Yes, on operating cost and I'll drag at these numbers here real quick. But if you look in our analyst package and if you look at the operating cost in each of our segments and you compare 2019 to 2020, you'll see a number of $223 million reduction in operating expense. But I want to be clear on that. 2019 had incremental expenses because we did a voluntary severance program and we're cutting costs. So 2019 costs were elevated, 2020 costs were low because we changed the benefit’s program around with the days off and anyway, resulted in $40 million benefit to 2020 expenses. I’m dragging through all that to say that $223 million reduction and expenses on a normalized adjusted EBITDA basis is only $100 million reduction, $103 million reduction in expenses between 2019 and 2020. And that includes an $11 million increase in property - in operating taxes, add-on taxes. And so, we saved about $114 million between 2019 and 2020. We think about 70% of that will stick going into 2021, so 30% of that will revert. And so, we'll see cost go up by about $30 million just due to operating cost kind of - that’s not retaining all that savings. And then operating taxes probably go up another $20 million to $25 million. So, you're looking at probably $50 million of total expense increases in 2021. So a great job, we're retaining 70% of our cost savings that we got in 2020.
Operator: So, now I'll turn the call over to Alan Armstrong for closing comments.
Alan Armstrong: Great well, thank you all very much for joining us today. We really are excited to continue to produce such predictable cash flows from the business and we're really excited about some of the catalysts for growth that really will drive and beyond 2021 and as well give us some upside here for 2021. So, thank you for your interest and stay safe and healthy.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-11-03 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Williams Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Danilo Juvane, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Danilo Juvane: Thank you, Cheryl, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in The Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon, we released our earnings press release and the presentation that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and our Chief Financial Officer, John Chandler, will speak to this morning. Also joining us on the call today are Michael Dunn, our Chief Operating Officer; Lane Wilson, our General Counsel; and Chad Zamarin, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development. In our presentation materials, you'll find a disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in the presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconciled to generally accepted accounting principles. And these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan.
Alan Armstrong: Great. Well, thanks, Danilo, and thank you all for joining us today. We are pleased to share the results of another strong third quarter. Williams once again exceeded its internal plans and investor expectations and showed just how durable this business can be against several headwinds, including a very active hurricane season in the Gulf. As you know, Louisiana bore the brunt of two significant hurricanes in Laura and Delta. And our operating teams in the area did a great job of staying safe, while minimizing the impact to our operations. As always, I'm impressed, but not surprised by the response effort to the region as Williams volunteers have donated supplies and manned staging areas in critically hit areas and really helped out those in need. Despite the hurricane impact, record Northeast gathering and processing growth allowed us to more than offset the financial impact of those multiple interruptions in the Gulf and produced the 19th consecutive quarter where we met or exceeded Street expectations. Our 2020 results year-to-date illustrate the stability and predictability of our business across a wide range of external factors. Everybody has gotten used to us being able to continue to produce on a normal basis, but this environment has really allowed us to distinguish ourselves in this more difficult market. Additionally, during this busy quarter, Williams announced its commitment and highlighted its ability to help in the reduction of emissions in a right here and right now way by becoming the first U.S. midstream company to set both near-term and long-term emission reduction goals. I'll talk a bit more about our climate goals later. But first, I want to highlight Rex' performance in our Northeast G&P segment, and then I'll turn it over to John to walk through our Q3 results. So looking here on slide 1, we show that our Northeast Gathering and Processing segment handled record volumes in the third quarter of 2020 where our gathering volumes averaged over 9.4 Bcf per day across our operated assets in the Northeast. This was an 8.4% growth versus the 3Q of 2019 comparison and a 7% sequential growth over the second quarter of 2020. Strong growth in the rich gas areas drove even more impressive growth in our processing volumes and our NGL production. And you can see here the processing for the Southwest Marcellus and Utica areas was up over 17%, and NGL production was up nearly 24%. Each of these was a record performance for our Northeast gathering and processing segment. This strong performance is evidence of the attractive position of the Northeast business as gas market fundamentals begin to call on U.S. dry gas supplies. We are the largest gatherer in the most important and prolific gas-producing area, the Appalachian Basin. And within the Appalachian Basin, our dedications include the most attractive acreage operated by resilient producers that continue to demonstrate their ability to continuously improve on their cost structures. You can see this playing out as our Northeast gathering volumes grew faster than the total Northeast supply. So overall, if you looked at the information from point logic, you would see that the Northeast wellhead natural gas production for all of the area, even including outside of Williams, was up by 2.2% on a 3Q 2020 to 3Q 2019 comparison. And ours, as we've shown, was up by 8.4% in gathered volume. So we really are not only in the right basin, but we're also in the right parts of the basin in the Appalachian area. We expect this trend to continue in response to very favorable forward strip pricing for 2021 and a very well-positioned group of customers in both the Marcellus and the Utica. We'll talk more about our G&P business when we get to our investor focus area segment. But for now, let me turn it over to John to highlight our Q3 results.
John Chandler: Thanks, Alan. We're going to go to slide 2 here. And once again, we're very pleased with our results this quarter. And as an overall theme, our cost reduction efforts, our new Transco projects brought into service and our incredibly strong results out of our Northeast gathering and processing segment helped to offset some challenging conditions in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico from heightened hurricane activity. You can see the strong performance in our statistics. First, looking at adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, it was down $7 million or 1%. However, this is very misleading, given that we expected and realized a $33 million step down in deferred revenue at our Gulfstar deepwater platform this quarter. In addition, the third quarter of last year included $28 million of incremental EBITDA from the Transco rate case settlement true-up for periods prior to the third quarter of 2019. So if you adjust for these items, our EBITDA was actually up 4% versus the third quarter of 2019, which is more indicative of the very strong quarter we had. And the same thing is playing out in our year-to-date results; our adjusted EBITDA is up 1%. But adjusting for deferred revenue step-downs and other noncash items, our year-to-date adjusted EBITDA is actually up similarly at 4%. We'll discuss EBITDA in more depth in a moment. Our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter increased largely due to lower depreciation. But again, just like adjusted EBITDA, would have been up much more strongly, had it not been for the noncash items I just mentioned. Distributable cash flow was down for the quarter due to increased dividends and distributions to our non-controlling interest owners, primarily related to our new Northeast JV, which is consolidated in our operating results and probably more so due to the timing of maintenance CapEx, which was higher for the quarter but down on a year-to-date basis. Our distributable cash flow year-to-date is down slightly, but the 2019 period included an $85 million cash tax refund that we've not benefited from this year. Without that cash tax refund, DCF is also up. As we look towards the end of the year, we still see distributable cash flow performance coming in above the midpoint of our guidance and likely above last year's results. On the capital spending front, our intentional capital discipline continues to drive capital spending down and free cash flow up. And to that point, capital spending for the quarter and year-to-date is about one-half of what it was last year. Of that, maintenance capital year-to-date is about $70 million less, and expansion capital spending is over $900 million less. With expansion capital spending expected to come in the $1 billion to $1.2 billion range for the year, and frankly, it's likely going to come in towards the low end of that range. And looking at our EBITDA and DCF forecast, we still predict that we'll produce excess free cash flow for this year above all dividends and all capital expenditures. This strong cash generation and capital discipline has helped us move towards our goal of improving our leverage metrics. And this quarter, our debt to last 12 months EBITDA is at 4.42 times, but we expect to end the year with that leverage metric being inside our guided goal of 4.4 times. And we expect continued improvement on the leverage metric next year, moving towards our goal of 4.2 times. Now going to slide 3, and looking at adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, let's dig a little deeper into that. Again, Williams performed very well this quarter despite an unusually active hurricane season that negatively impacted our Gulf of Mexico operations. As you'll hear throughout each segment, cost control has been a big benefit this year even after realizing higher bonus accruals this quarter in recognition of our strong performance. As I mentioned a moment ago, before we dive into each segment, we believe it's important to isolate a few unusual things to make the numbers more comparable and reflective of our ongoing performance of the business. We've identified those unusual items on this slide, which are shown on this chart as noncash comparability items, and they total $60 million. They consist primarily of two things. The first is the $33 million reduction in noncash deferred revenue step-downs in our transmission in Gulf of Mexico segment on our Gulf East franchise area. As a reminder, on deferred revenue, we received significant upfront cash payments several years ago from a producer, but did not recognize revenue at that time. We have been amortizing those payments we previously received into income over the last several years, and that amortization has been shrinking. The second item I'd point to is the $28 million rate case trip entry made in the third quarter of 2019 that I described earlier. So, if you adjust for those items, again, EBITDA was actually up over 4%. So, looking at our segments, the Transmission & Gulf of Mexico assets without these non-cash items produced results that were $3 million better than the same period last year. New transmission pipeline projects added $14 million in revenues for the quarter, including the Hillabee Phase two project, that came into service in the second quarter of this year and the gateway project that came on into service in the fourth quarter of last year. While we did see lower operating costs during the quarter, they were offset somewhat by increased bonus accruals and higher reinsurance and property taxes. Offsetting the positive revenues was about $15 million of lower Gulf of Mexico profits due to shut-ins, resulting from the heightened hurricane activity. The impact of the shut-ins can be further seen in reduced deepwater gathering volumes, which were down about 15%. Now going to the Northeast G&P segment, it continues to come on strong, producing record results and contributing $53 million of additional EBITDA this quarter. Collectively, total Northeast gathering volumes grew 8% in the quarter, and processing volumes were up 17%. These higher volumes drove revenue growth. And of course, we are realizing more revenue per gathered Mcf due to additional revenues earned from processing, transportation and fractionation of that gas and NGLs on the backs of some investments we've made over the last several years in this infrastructure. Equity method investment also drove EBITDA, where we benefited from higher record volumes, due to gathering expansion on that system in late 2019; the Marcellus South system, where we benefited from several new wells coming online over the last year; and to a lesser extent, higher volumes on Laurel Mountain Midstream. Finally, the Northeast also benefited from cost reduction efforts, much of which began last year, as well as from favorable maintenance expense savings. As a final note, adjusted EBITDA per gathered Mcf for our Northeast operating assets, when you include the proportional volumes from our non-operated assets, averaged $0.52 per Mcf in the third quarter of this year, compared to $0.49 per Mcf the same time last year, which is a 6% increase. Now looking at the West, that segment was flat to last year. Overall, revenues in the West were down slightly versus the third quarter of last year, but those decreases were offset by higher commodity margins and reduced expenses. Revenues declined due to lower gathered volumes, which were down about 7%, and were spread amongst many basins, with the biggest impact coming in the Haynesville, Wamsutter and Piceance. Of course, in two of these three basins, we have a customer dealing with bankruptcies and would expect to increase volumes as those producers move out of their bankruptcy. The volume decline, however, was muted somewhat by higher revenues in the Eagle Ford, where we agreed to a new contract with higher rate than an MVC in December of last year. And just as with our other segments, the West experienced lower cost, again, as we keep a relentless focus on efficiency and cost control. Now going to slide 4 and looking at our year-to-date results. They showed growth of 1% in adjusted EBITDA, again, driven by many of the same factors affecting the third quarter growth. The Barnett and Gulfstar noncash deferred revenue step-downs totaled $85 million, while the net impact of commodity price fluctuations on our inventory linefill position created a $9 million noncash reduction in EBITDA this year. So without those noncash comparability items, year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA was up similarly to the quarter and it was up 4%. Again, looking at segments, our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico segment without those noncash items is delivering $16 million in growth, with an uplift from expansion projects and expense reductions being offset somewhat by lower Gulf of Mexico volumes and the impact that it's had on commodity margins. In the Gulf of Mexico, the total impact of shut-ins from COVID, hurricanes and the price collapse earlier this year has been $38 million. The Northeast is a huge part of our growth this year, adding $165 million in additional EBITDA over last year, with overall volumes up 7% and incremental revenues being realized from processing, transportation and fractionation of gas and NGLs, while at the same time, we've been reducing costs. And finally, the West is off by about $46 million versus last year, largely because of the Barnett, MVC cash payments that ended last year and the four points cost of service true-up payment that we received last year. Otherwise, in the West, gathered volumes were down about 3%, but were offset largely by reduced costs and increased revenues in the Eagle Ford due to the renegotiated contract in December of last year. Again, all in all, despite a tough market and a tough hurricane season, we've had a really good year on the back of cost reductions, Northeast performance and new pipeline projects coming into service on Transco. I'll now turn the call back over to Alan to discuss some of the key investor focus areas. Alan? 
Alan Armstrong: Great. Well, thanks, John, and just starting here again on Slide 5. We have a listing of what we believe are key areas of focus for our investors. And so first, I'll discuss our expectations for the 2021 financial performance. We expect to provide our 2021 financial guidance during our 4Q earnings release in February but we offer the following insights to what we expect for 2021 as follows. First, continued production of reliable and highly predictable cash flow with modest growth and improving returns; second, we expect to again generate discretionary free cash flow comfortably covering both our dividend and our growth CapEx; and third, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to continue showing growth driven by the following: first of all, gas supply demand setup favoring our various strong positions on gas. And so again, we would just tell you that gas demand will be driving our business. And the forward market certainly is driving many of our customers to make plans for growth across a lot of our systems and transmission projects like Southeastern Trail, early in-service of Leidy South as well. And then finally, we're no longer dealing with the downward pressure due to the non-cash deferred revenue step-downs that you just heard John talk about, and we don't expect to have the degree of deepwater shut-ins that we experienced this year from a number of different issues. So lots of nice growth drivers that are very predictable at this point. And we feel very confident about how those will shape up for 2021 at this point. We really expect only a couple of small items that will work to partially offset these growth drivers. First, we expect a small amount of overall cost increases that are really driven by both gathering volume growth and transmission capacity expansions that we've spoken to. But thanks to our operating team's continuous improvement mindset, we do expect our operating margins to expand again for the fifth consecutive year in 2021. And so again, our revenues are going to be outpacing any expansion in expenses. So really tremendous efforts by our teams continuing to focus on the operating margin ratio across our businesses. We also expect modest declines in the West segment from lower short-term NGL services that we enjoyed this last year. So we did have some opportunistic revenues in our NGL services business that we don't expect to enjoy again next year and weaker NGL margins from higher gas prices in next year, of course, with those higher gas prices working against our keep-whole margins. On the capital allocation thoughts. First, our dividend is a key source of value for our investors, and we believe the reliability and predictability of our dividend is key to achieving appropriate valuation relative to other growth in income stocks. But beyond our dividend and planned growth CapEx, we will have discretionary free cash flow to allocate. One of the highest priorities for 2021, of course, will be to complete our deleveraging plan. And I'm proud to say we are on target to reach our 4.2 debt-to-EBITDA towards the goal that we've talked about a lot towards the end of 2021. And this should drive the BBB flat ratings across all three agencies that we've been seeking. Obviously, we think the strong balance sheet and higher credit ratings will continue to bring contraction in our yield, driving stock price appreciation for our investors as we continue to attract value investors outside of the energy sector. Once we reach our leverage target, we will have a variety of options to consider, which the Board will weigh with a focus on generating long-term sustainable value for investors. And of course, you all know these various options. Of course, one would be additional delevering. Another would be stock buyback, if our valuation doesn't improve from where we are today, and incremental investments in our regulated pipeline expansions and rate base. And so plenty of alternatives, plenty of things to utilize those free cash flows to drive additional value for investors. And now turning to look at our longer-term growth outlook. First of all, in the gathering and processing business, the nice growth that we've seen in our volumes versus the broad market is evidence of the strong position across our G&P footprint. You can see on Slide 9 in our appendix slide that the total wellhead production of natural gas is down slightly for 2020 on a year-to-date basis. So that's just looking across all of the domestic gas supplies, while Williams gathered volumes have grown by over 3%. And even in the face of the Gulf of Mexico disruptions that we're exposed to. There really isn't another public company with a comparable gathering and processing footprint. Our business is resilient and produces reliable cash flow, because of our focus on low-cost gas basins, our contracting practices, the wellhead connectivity that we have, and the very broad portfolio of gathering systems that we operate. Single-basin businesses or those with a single customer, or a small number of dominant customers are just not the appropriate comps for our G&P portfolio. Our more diverse asset base is driven by demand for low-cost natural gas, as we've spoken to many times. So, let's look at this driver for a moment. First of all, domestic demand and exports has been resilient this year, down less than 0.5% on a year-to-date basis. And you certainly wouldn't know it from the news, but the biggest single contributor to this decline was a nearly 14% decline in heating degree days from January through March of this year, which was a key driver of the res-com demand weakness this year, not the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, if 2020's winter weather looked like 2019's January through March weather, the total Lower 48 total gas demand would be up, by 2% year-to-date. Exports, both LNG and pipeline exports to Mexico, were up this year, even after dealing with a very warm winter in Europe, resulting in a summer of low LNG exports. And we're now, as you are well aware, I'm sure, are now seeing LNG flows, rebounding near the highs that we saw earlier in the year. As we've said before, demand is truly the key to our business. And this demand picture is driving the price response, we are seeing. Continued price increases, could eat into demand growth. So you should certainly watch closely for, how producers respond to these price signals. However, we have confidence that producers see this as an attractive market. And we'll be able to respond very effectively to the increasing call on gas supplies, particularly in the very best of the Marcellus, Utica and Haynesville Shales, of which we are so fortunate to serve. Looking at the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the competitive advantages of our existing footprint and unique operating expertise is bringing new business to our existing capacity. And we have been fortunate to contract for some very large and exciting new developments. These really begin ramping up as early as 2022, for the Taggart prospect, and this growth will continue for several more years as the more impactful opportunities like well in Ballymore come online. And as we have mentioned in the past, the capital required for this next tranche of large projects is very low, relative to the EBITDA growth. And so, we're really excited to see the kind of incremental returns that we're going to see, and the growth we're going to see in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. And of course, our natural gas transmission systems remain advantaged versus competitors, with a lot of signals for growth in this area as well. The Brownfield nature of the expansions that we have causes less environmental impact. And thus, lower regulatory risk. Capital cost risk is also lower, when expanding across our existing footprint. And because of this, and the great work by our project execution teams, we see projects on or ahead of schedule. So let me just walk through, a few of these. This is really impressive work, by our project execution teams. First of all, Southeastern Trail now has 150 million a day of its total 296 million a day of incremental Transco capacity placed into service, as of November 1. So, this kind of maybe slipped up on people, but we've been working towards an early in-service. And in addition to that, we have 80 million a day possibly in-service by year-end. So 230 million of our 296 million a day will be placed on service by year-end, well ahead of what we had expected. The final 66 million a day will be placed in-service, during Q1 of 2021. So, great work there. On an even more impressive schedule, due to customer demand and great work by our teams of working on the Leidy South Project, we have 125 million a day of the Leidy South, 582 million a day of total capacity that we expect to be on, by -- here online in the next month. So a full year ahead of the original project expectations and of course, this is important because this also provides additional gathering capacity out of our Northeast PA area. The integration of our customer relationships across the gathering and transmission businesses allowed us to recognize and then meet accelerated customer needs, providing unexpected value for both Williams and the customer. Even as we look forward on additional projects that are not yet in execution mode, regional energy access is a project that is going very well on both the commercial and regulatory front and we have 100% survey permission that we've achieved. Obviously, this is a very critical milestone for the regulatory process today and we do expect to file for a FERC application here in the next three months. So, great work going on there as well. That will be another project that will expand capacity out of the Northeast PA area. Expectations of sustained demand growth are truly the drop of our transmission business and we've said before, our expansions are underwritten by 15 years or longer take-or-pay contracts and as you can see, this continues to show the confidence that our customers have in the long-term need for gas and gas transmission to serve growing gas demand and so we really are continuing to see a lot of great expansion opportunities along the Transco system that will be fairly sizable and continue to drive growth on that business for years to come. On the sustainability front, in August, we became the first U.S. midstream company to issue a climate commitment. We announced a near-term goal of a 56% absolute reduction from our 2005 levels in company-wide greenhouse gas emissions, and we would achieve that by 2030, putting the company on a positive trajectory to be net zero carbon emissions by 2050. We will continue to invest in environmental stewardship and reduce our carbon footprint while meeting the clean energy needs of our communities and delivering long-term value to our stakeholders. Our transmission networks are extremely well-positioned to aggregate and bring scale to multiple emission reduction opportunities, including taking out higher carbon fuels, and other near-term efforts while focused on exploring renewable energy opportunities, including renewable natural gas and solar energy. And we've established an internal team to explore and manage emerging opportunities like renewable natural gas, further deployment of solar across our systems, hydrogen and carbon capture across our entire footprint. But to be clear, these opportunities will compete alongside all other investment opportunities in our capital allocation process. So, we are proud to lead the midstream space in meeting the growing demand for American-made energy while outlining clear steps towards a clean energy future. We hope to challenge others to establish similar goals based on what we can reduce right here, right now. So in closing, I'll reiterate that we've intentionally built a business that is steady and predictable. Our natural-gas-focused strategy positions us well to capitalize on continued natural gas growth, our existing transmission infrastructure offers growth advantage, and our low-cost basins that we serve provide predictable cash flow and position us to grow in a wide range of supply and demand scenarios. Second, of course, today is Election Day. And there has been a lot of debate during this political cycle about the future of our industry. I'll just say that at Williams, we remain bullish on natural gas because we recognize the critical role it plays and will continue to play in our countries and our world's pursuit of a clean energy future, irrespective of the political backdrop. Thanks to natural gas, the U.S. continues to see significant reductions in CO2 emissions, lower consumers' utility bills, and enhanced opportunities for investments in renewable energy. And then finally, as we continue to navigate COVID-19 pandemic, I want to once again recognize the tremendous efforts of our entire workforce in ensuring the delivery of natural gas to America's cities and communities. Often, I think we take for granted the great reliability that's provided by the great operating companies of our nation and ours is no exception in that in terms of the reliable service that we provide for our industry. And I'm extremely proud of our employees for their efforts to keep our operations running smoothly while also going the extra mile to keep themselves and their coworkers healthy. And with that, I'll open it up for your questions. 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Jeremy Tonet: Hello. Good morning. 
Alan Armstrong: Good morning, Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet: I just want to start off on capital allocation. I know you touched on it a bit in your prepared remarks there. But just wondering if you had any more clarity on where 2021 CapEx might land given how project timing could potentially move around a bit and how this level of CapEx could approach -- could impact your approach to deleveraging and any potential buybacks. Trying to get a feel for how that interplays within 2021 itself. 
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Great question, Jeremy. Obviously, we haven't laid out that guidance firmly yet, but we do have a pretty good idea. I think one of the things that's helping on that end is these projects are being finished earlier than we expected. So that's a real positive. And obviously, because our capital has come down this year, a lot of that is cost reduction as well. So I would just say, we are seeing really positive signs on the cost as we've gone out for bid. The construction market is a little bit slow right now. And as a result of that, the bids that we've been seeing coming in for our projects are coming in below our budget. So I would say a little too early to call that. But right now, I think we're feeling pretty good about being able to manage to that -- to a capital budget that is somewhere in the same range as what we saw this year. So I don't know, Micheal, if you have anything to add to that on the capital.
Micheal Dunn: I would just say, and I will talk about in the opening remarks, we will cover all of our capital and dividend next year and be free cash flow positive in regard to our overall company performance. As Alan said, we're seeing great bids from our contractors. Our teams are doing an incredible job executing our projects and achieving underbudget performance on all of our major projects this year. And we have high expectations to continue that next year with where the market is in regard to construction activity.
Jeremy Tonet: That's very helpful. And I know you have a number of comments you provided on renewable energy there. And you talked about RNG interconnections and solar installations. Just trying to dig in a little bit more there, if you could expand on how big the CapEx dollar opportunity set for you could be on the renewables front, I figure it's bigger than a bread basket, but trying to figure out how big that is.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Let me have Chad Zamarin, who is leading that -- sorry, that emerging opportunities group. Chad?
Chad Zamarin: Yes. Thanks, Jeremy. And in that space, it's still early days, but we -- I think we announced today that we've just connected our sixth RNG project. We see a pretty good pipeline of opportunities in that space. I'd say in the near term, still modest capital investment over the next couple of years, probably less than $100 million in RNG projects. On the solar front, we have approved 12 projects that have advanced through what we would call our Gate one capital allocation process. Those projects aren't yet to full investment decision, but those projects constitute around $200 million to $300 million of investment in solar installations. And so those projects will continue to move through our process over the next several months. And I would just say, I mean we spent a lot of time building up talent and capabilities. And I think we view ourselves as an energy infrastructure company. And we are very focused on, as you can also see, being a part of the clean and energy solutions for our country and for the rest of the world. And we see natural gas is really the most impactful energy source in that regard. But we're very committed to making sure our infrastructure and capabilities are part of any solution with respect to kind of the future of clean energy. So we've also stood up a team that is now focused on hydrogen and other carbon capture technologies. But I'd say that's very early days, and will probably not be a lot of capital investment in the very near term, but we'll continue to look to be a part of the solution in those areas as well.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. I’ll stop there. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Praneeth Satish from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Praneeth Satish: Thanks. Good morning. Your partner on Overland Pass so that they plan to move their volumes onto their wholly owned pipeline. Just wondering if you would still get paid if they move volumes. And then if not, what's kind of the plan there to try and backfill those volumes. 
Micheal Dunn: Good morning. This is Micheal. I'll take that. In regard to our partner on Overland Pass Pipeline, we've anticipated the movement of those volumes for some time now with their construction of their pipeline from the Bakken. And they've taken the volumes, but continue to pay us this year in partnership with our agreement that we've had in place with them. And so this has been an expectation that we've had. We've built this into our plans for next year, but we've also got our Rocky Mountain Midstream entity in Colorado that we do anticipate having additional volumes coming from that entity. And that's where we've anticipated those volumes coming in and backfilling some of the volumes that are leaving us from our partner on the OPPL pipeline. 
Praneeth Satish: Okay. Great. And then just on the renewables front, I think, so far, most of -- or all of your investments tied to RNG have been consisted of building out laterals. What's the appetite to maybe push further upstream and invest in the actual facilities and landfills or dairy farms that capture and process the methane? 
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I would just say we're going to invest where we think we have the biggest competitive advantage and can generate the highest returns. And some of those projects that are backed by quite a few tax credits and subsidies generally have quite a bit of financing and fairly low returns on them. So we're going to focus on the part of those investments where we can make a return that competes within our capital allocation front. So as I'm sure everyone is aware, the investment and the returns in that space have narrowed considerably with all the popularity around that. So we're going to stick to the areas where we have really strong competitive advantage to create better returns. 
Micheal Dunn: Yes. And I would just add, our footprint does point us towards areas of opportunities. I would just say, an RNG project, a lot of the infrastructure required for bringing RNG to market is the kind of infrastructure that we're very familiar with. It's primarily trading and processing of natural gas and gas by-products. It's relatively small scale. But again, I think to Alan's point, we're very capable of investing further upstream into those facilities but we're going to make sure we focus on where those returns would be most attractive. 
John Chandler: This is John Chandler. The last thing I'd say is, we remain a noncash taxpayer at least through 2024 in our projections. And so therefore, tax credits, it's tough for us to make value of that. So we've got to find partners to co-invest and take advantage of those tax credits in many cases. So some of the things that make the returns more attractive upstream really don't -- aren't that -- are as valuable to us. 
Praneeth Satish: That’s helpful. I will stop there. Thanks.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni from UBS. 
Shneur Gershuni: Hi good morning everyone and Alan congrats on the new role. Just to start off here a little bit here. You sort of intimated in your prepared remarks that you expect EBITDA to be above higher next year versus this year. I was wondering if you can walk us through the pluses and minuses direction yet. Obviously, without giving a specific number as to the support of that view, are you seeing some more activity potentially in the Haynesville? Is that offsetting the earlier question about the Overland Pass volume loss? Just wondering if you can just sort of give us the ledger of pluses and minuses as to, directionally, what underpins the expectations for EBITDA to be higher next year versus this year? 
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Sure, Shneur. And I'll just kind of go back through the notes that I laid out there. First of all, as I mentioned, the gas supply and demand situation is turning out to be a very favorable position for gas-focused basins. Obviously, with associated gas continuing decline and demand hanging in there and starting to grow again. We really feel good about the way we're positioned within our gathering and processing basins. Obviously, those lower-cost basins are best positioned for that. But if you really look at how that's going to get balanced, it's hard for the market to balance itself without drawing on the basins that we serve, and serve in -- with some concentration. Secondly, the transmission projects like Southeastern Trail and early in-service for Leidy South will drive growth as well in 2021. And then, of course, one of the things that we normally have had some downward pressure like we overcame this year from some of the non-cash items, that John talked about, and so we're not having to overcome some of those headwinds this year. And then finally, of course, the $38 million impact in deepwater Gulf of Mexico this year, won't be there. And we've had a number of tie-ins this year in the Gulf of Mexico that will produce higher revenues next year. So, those are some of the primary drivers, but I would just say, we're feeling really good about the way we're seeing volumes in the Northeast right now. And if we didn't see anything, but volumes stay flat from where they are here in the fourth quarter through 2021, we would see a really nice growth in terms of our earnings and EBITDA in the Northeast. So hard to say that we won't see some growth somewhere, because somehow the market is going to have to balance itself, and we certainly are seeing a lot of producers making plans for that. But we're -- it's really early to call a whole lot of growth there, and we have pretty modest growth built in. But very modest growth with keeping our costs relatively flat, really, is pretty powerful for us and our EBITDA growth. So I mean I don't want to get people out ahead of where we are. I certainly mentioned that our growth would be modest. But I would just say, there's just a number of things that make -- that give us quite a bit of confidence and not really anything all that exciting happening across our business to drive growth next year.
Shneur Gershuni: So that makes perfect sense and really do appreciate that color. And maybe as a follow-up question, in the prepared remarks, you sort of talked about being free cash flow positive after dividends next year. Buybacks is one of the arrows in the quiver, and it's certainly becoming a -- all the ranges of late with everybody announcing authorizations. Just wondering, is -- how is the Board thinking about approaching it? Do you have to actually hit the leverage target or exceed the target before you authorize and start buying back stock, or given that you're already on a trajectory, you're close, that it's something that you can start sprinkling in sooner than actually hitting the target? Just kind of wondering your thoughts around the topic?
Alan Armstrong: Yeah. No, I would just say that this is a very deliberate and disciplined Board, and we've been very clear about this goal. And I don't think there's anything that I can foresee right now anyway that would waiver. Obviously, if we saw a stock price collapse or something like that, that might change that mind and be opportunistic. But I would just say, we've been pretty clear, pretty disciplined. And I see us continuing to push forward on that goal as a top priority. So I really don't see much. And if we did do buybacks, it would be a sprinkling in. And while it might be popular, I would just tell you that we're going to focus on what we think fundamental value is. And right now, we think that fundamental value is getting our debt down to those targets and gaining the credit rating across all three agencies.
Shneur Gershuni: Perfect. Thank you very much, and that does it for me, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury from Bernstein. Your line is open.
Jean Ann Salisbury: Good morning. In an aggressive renewables adoption scenario where utilities gas demand goes down dramatically, but utilities still need gas availability to meet peak demand, how would you see contract structures on gas pipelines changing, if at all? And are there currently examples on your pipelines of very high MVCs compared to usage and did they require different types of contracts?
Alan Armstrong: Yeah. Jean Ann, I would just say we haven't seen anything resembling that at all in our markets. The capacity that we have is highly valued. And the last time we had any capacity come up available that got turned back, the only thing that we could distinguish the bid on was on term and that -- and this was last year. And the term was 84 years, was a successful bid on that. So we're not really seeing any need to discount or would see a need to provide any discount in our markets, because our rates are so low compared to what the avoided cost or the alternatives are. So we really don't see. Obviously, we're always working with our customers to provide the very best service. But I think from a pricing standpoint, there's just not any pressure on the pricing within our -- I mean, I always say that's the good news and the bad news about our regulated pipeline. The bad news is the rate's capped. And the rate, we can't expand that rate. But the good news is, that's really hard to compete with in those markets. And so, really don't see it. But I would just tell you, we're not -- despite the talk on this issue, we are not seeing the utilization come down on our system on the gas-fired generation, despite a lot of renewables being interjected into the market. And of course, as long as we still have the high degree of coal-fired generation in a lot of our markets, we're going to continue to see expansions of capacity demand for our services. So Micheal, I don't know if you'd add anything to that. 
Micheal Dunn: No, I think you were right on there, Alan. I would say that, based on the demand that we're continuing to see on the Transco and other transmission pipelines we have, we don't anticipate having to negotiate any kind of peaking agreements. Now if there's an opportunity to provide a peaking service that we can charge a rate for, that is desirable for us, then we'll absolutely pursue that. But at this point in time, our customers are continuing to see demand for long-term year-round contracts, and that's what we'll continue to pursue.
John Chandler: I think an interesting derivation of that question is, when are the utilities going to start charging the independent renewables developers a backup charge for the power that they're backing up, the interruption -- interruptible power coming from the renewables resource. And that's not happening today.
Jean Ann Salisbury: Yes. No, that's really helpful. And then kind of 10-plus years from now, your answer is so extremely helpful and valid. Thank you. And then is it possible to separate out how much of this year's growth CapEx went to well connects, even just roughly? 
John Chandler: Well, I can tell you, in total, from a capital spending standpoint, the Northeast total capital spend for this year is probably going to be a little bit south to $300 million. In the West, it's less than $100 million. So when you -- and that's a combination of maintenance and expansion capital spending. And embedded within that is some processing work. So I don't want to say that's all well connect capital, but it's fairly insignificant now.
Jean Ann Salisbury: Great. John, that’s helpful. Thank you so much.
Alan Armstrong: Jean Ann, it's got to be -- that's got to be a pretty difficult thing in areas like the Northeast, PA, where we're building big pipelines into these well pads and so you might call that a well connect, but it's a 20-inch pipeline a lot of times, sometimes even larger. Because the producers are effectively -- by drilling these laterals out of these single locations, they effectively are providing what used to be a well connect by bringing that all into one location there for us. And so what we see actually -- rather than us having to go connect those individual wells, we're seeing the producers just continue to drill out those pads over time and keep the volumes full on those fairly large lines that we've built to them. So it's gotten really fuzzy, particularly in the Northeast with these very large volume pads. It's gotten pretty fuzzy to think about -- of something being well connect. A lot of these pads are delivering more gas than a single gathering system does in a lot of parts of the country. So it's really gotten kind of fuzzy on that front. But well connects in the West are probably a place that's a little easier to keep track of in that regard. And as John mentioned, we spent less than $100 million this year in the West. 
Jean Ann Salisbury: That’s really helpful. Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Christine Cho from Barclays. Your line is open.
Christine Cho: Good morning. Maybe, if I can ask the 2021 CapEx question a little differently. And I understand this can change in the next couple of months, but I can think of well connects or Northeast and Haynesville, maybe a project on Transco materializing from the cancellation of ACP, some small residual spending on Leidy South and Southeastern Trail and maybe some additional Gulf of Mexico tiebacks. Would you say those are the main pieces of the CapEx program next year as it stands right now? 
Alan Armstrong: The only thing I might add to that, Christine, I'm going to -- Micheal's probably got a little crisper list in his head. But the one thing that is notably missing from your list there would be the build-out for the well prospect in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. And so that's a pretty sizable project. And so that's probably -- and remember, that is reimbursable if they were to cancel that for some reason, but that's getting pretty far along for anybody to think about canceling at this point. So Micheal, I don't know if... 
Micheal Dunn: Yes. I mean, that was the one that was sticking out for me. We ordered the pipe for that project based on the reimbursable agreement that we have with the producer customers there, and that's a pretty substantial order, in order for us to get that pipe on time for the project. And Regional Energy Access will be another one that will ramp up next year as well as, obviously, the Leidy South construction, which we have full notes to proceed now on Leidy South for our restoration construction and so those are underway.  That's the gating item on that project, and we'll start construction on our pipelines for Leidy South in January. Just a pretty small component of that project with some Brownfield moves there. The compressor stations are really the bulk of the work there on Leidy South. 
John Chandler: And maybe just one other thing, and it's not sizable, but we may need to do a little bit of processing work in the Northeast expansion as we're filling the systems up. 
Christine Cho: Got it.
Micheal Dunn: A point as well, we've -- our Oak Grove processing complex, we actually stopped construction on TXP3 there and we've ramped that back up now. So we had a lull there of about six or eight months where we had idled that construction work. And now we're above capacity there on the processing complex, and we've accelerated that work now, and we anticipate that third train at Oak Grove being online sometime in the first quarter of '21. 
Christine Cho : Got it. And just a clarification on the Regional Energy Access. I don't think that project came online until like '23. So is there really going to be that much spending on that next year? 
Micheal Dunn: Well, there won't be Christine. You're right. That's a 2023 in-service, but it is another component of our Transco expansion opportunities, and it will initiate some uptick in spending next year. But we've been pretty careful about spending too much on those projects until we have permits in hand. So you're right, that won't accelerate really until 2022 and 2023. 
Christine Cho : Got it. And then as a follow-up, Alan, you mentioned the different ways to drive additional value, and you mentioned debt pay down, stock buybacks and investing in projects. Assuming you get to the 4.2 times leverage and are comfortably in BBB flat territory, what return thresholds would any transfer of projects need to clear in order for it to be a better use of capital than buybacks at this juncture? 
Alan Armstrong: Yes. That's a good question. I think, obviously, that's going to determine how we see the stock market and how much value we think there is to investor for additional debt reduction. Obviously, that's something that there's not a bright line on and we'll have to use our own best judgment around how much value we think there would be to the shareholder through further debt reduction. So that's the answer to that part of the question.  And then the second piece is what stock price is going to be at that point in time, and that will set effectively what the return threshold would have to be for those incremental projects. And I just tell you, there's all kinds of places that make good and very profit rate-based investment on the Transco systems in terms of modernization of the systems and emission reduction opportunities.  And it really is just going to depend how that those return look. And obviously, we've been in the process of negotiating what that would look like in terms of emission reduction projects. And until we know what that return would be and we know what the value, we would assess at that point in time, the debt reduction and stock price that will determine that.  But there's really -- the good news is we don't have to predetermine that. We'll see what the markets look like when we get to that point at the end of '21. And I'm very confident in our Board's ability to make a great decision for the benefit of the shareholder when we get to that point. 
Christine Cho : Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Gabe Moreen from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is open. 
Gabe Moreen: Hey, guys. I had a two-pronged question on the Northeast. There's been some customer consolidation, I think, in Appalachia. Wondering if there's any impacts or opportunities from that. And then also, assuming the forward curve holds or does even better from here, would there be any significant CapEx increases if your customers decide to go beyond, let's call it, maintenance to modest growth mode? 
Alan Armstrong: Mike. 
Micheal Dunn: Yes, I would say, EQT coming in and buying into the assets in Appalachia that we are a partnership with Chevron on there is only a positive for us. EQT is a great operator. They're certainly getting their cost under control on their drilling and their completions and really doing an admirable job there. We have the opportunity to bring additional volumes in there with not a lot of capital deployment in regard to possibly EQT deploying more money there, be able to drill bit. So I think that's just a great opportunity and upside for us there with Laurel Mountain Midstream. And there'll be a partner with us on the midstream assets there with that acquisition, owning 31% of that entity with us. And so we're looking forward to working that relationship that we've already built with them even more so. 
Gabe Moreen: Great. And then as a follow-up, clearly, there's been a lot of consolidation on the upstream side of things. In the past, you talked about asset sales, done a lot of portfolio shaping yourself. Those discussions still ongoing? Do you think those perhaps happen in 2021? Just curious for your thoughts there? 
Alan Armstrong: Yes, that's a good question. We're certainly -- we'll continue to pursue that. I think we do believe that the cash flows that our West G&P asset and the free cash flow, the tremendous amount of free cash flow they generate is very valuable. And we think the predictability that we've seen this year, along with the way that we've been able to manage through the bankruptcy concerns around these assets, we think that really is going to position this well for -- having them better valued in 2021. And what exactly path that takes is TBD. But we certainly are continuing to look for opportunities to make sure that those are more fairly valued within our stock price, one way or the other. So yes, we're still working on it. And I think some of the clouds that existed over that are certainly lifting pretty rapidly, with the way some of the concerns -- particularly around the Chesapeake bankruptcy and the way those concerns have really eroded as we haven't been listed as any rejection and very confident in our ability to preserve the value in our contracts there. 
Gabe Moreen: Great. Thanks, Alan.
Alan Armstrong: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Kania from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. 
Alex Kania: Thanks. Just a question, maybe to put it a bad pun about the elephant in the room, I guess, the – talk from today. But just are there any elections or statewide races that you're particularly focused on, or any kind of latest comments or thoughts you might have just in terms of maybe any shift in energy policy in the U.S.-based on a Biden or kind of a Trump reelection? 
Alan Armstrong: Yes. As I mentioned in my opening comments, I think we're -- we feel like that natural gas in a sober, less-polarized moment is going to be a really important tool to continue to utilize renewables at a cost-effective -- in a cost-effective manner and to continue to decarbonize energy use here in both the U.S. and around the world for that matter. And we think it's going to be a powerful tool. And so the U.S. is -- the more serious we get about decarbonization, the better it is for our business. And so if the focus is just around eliminating fossil fuels, that's a different story. But if we really get serious about decarbonization, we think our business is extremely well-positioned in that environment. Secondly, I would say, on a more tactical level, I think probably one of the higher near-term probabilities, if there was a Biden administration win would be the -- a corporate tax raise. And actually, that works out to be a positive for us within our regulated assets, because that would allow us to raise the rates back on Northwest pipeline that we had to lower when the corporate tax rate was lower. We do have a rider within those -- within those rates. And as well on Transco, we would -- we had to lower -- or we had to accept an impact to our rate case this last time around because of the lower corporate tax rate, and we would get those back. Now of course, we're not paying those cash taxes, but the way the rate case process actually works, and we get to recover for whatever that corporate tax rate is. So in the near term, we would see -- probably one of the few energy companies that would see kind of a near-term positive coming out of that. And longer-term, we think if we really are constructive and really get serious about going after decarbonization, we think we can play a very important role in that process.
Alex Kania: Great. Thanks very much.
Danilo Juvane: Cheryl, we got time for one more question. Cheryl?
Operator: And our next question comes from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Travis Miller: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, as a follow-up to the hydrogen conversation, what types of projects would you be looking at? And what's the timing on those specific projects? So not the timing in terms of when you'd start, but once you started, what kind of timing would -- when those projects take to be -- to go from first investment to in-service?
Alan Armstrong : Yeah, Travis. Hey, thank you very much for the question, and thanks for joining us this morning. I would just say, first of all, it is long-dated. So we're looking at a number of opportunities, but whatever we do, we're going to be looking to do it in a serious manner. And the scale that we can bring to hydrogen is probably second to none in terms of the utilization. And I think it's important to -- when you think about hydrogen, to the degree that we're burning hydrogen in place of another carbon-based fuel, we do get emissions reduction. And that doesn't make any difference whether it's blended in with the natural gas or if it's separated, the emission reduction opportunity is exactly the same. And so our ability to blend in hydrogen into the existing systems is a really powerful tool here in accelerating the use of hydrogen to reduce carbon emissions. And so our ability to take excess renewable power in markets and both be able to help with the transmission of that energy via tram and via converting the excess renewables power, which I think most people would agree that there's going to be a good chance that we're over-investing in renewables in certain pockets relative to the ability for that generated power to meet demand. So there will be a need to transport that as well as there'll be a need to store that. And if you think about the way our systems are set up, once you've converted that excess power generation, once you've converted that into hydrogen, now we've got the already systems in place, the ability to both transport and store that with the existing systems without incremental capital investment. And we think that's going to be really powerful as we emerge into that. Secondly, I would say, in markets where there is a really big push on reducing emissions and starting to accelerate the use of hydrogen, we're extremely well positioned with our systems in those areas as well to be able to help utilize carbon -- or hydrogen, both as a technical tool and a political tool for the permitting of our assets. And so we're really excited about the role we can play in that. And we can play it in a way that's not just a novelty and not just a pilot project, but one that truly gets us on the road towards utilizing hydrogen more capably and without waiting on long system development and long infrastructure developments in the market. So, that's how we intend right now to go after it. And we'll certainly be looking for opportunities along those lines.
Travis Miller: That's great. I appreciate that. And then, just a real quick follow-up to the capital allocation discussion. What's your thought around if the stock price stays here and the returns -- dividend stays up above 8% or so. What's your thought around foregoing perhaps a dividend increase and instead directing that capital back into some of the options you've talked about, stock buybacks or incremental investment? Just thinking about the dividend growth element of that situation.
Alan Armstrong: Yeah. I think, as we've mentioned before, we intend to keep our dividend growth in line with our cash flow growth. And we think the predictability and the reliability of continuing to do what we say we're going to do is valuable. And we certainly have the capabilities to do that. Ultimately, that's a Board decision in terms of that. But I would say from a policy standpoint in the company, we continue to expect to match that up with our cash flow growth and free cash flow growth. So it's a great question. I would just say that's a Board-level decision. But as we sit here today, we would expect to continue to grow it alongside the degree of cash flow growth that we've got in the business right now, which obviously is modest, and we've talked about that. So that's the kind of the expectation I think should be on.
Travis Miller: Okay, great. Appreciate that.
Alan Armstrong: Thank you.
Danilo Juvane: Cheryl, we're ready to wrap-up the call, please.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our Q&A for today. I'll turn the call back to Alan Armstrong for closing remarks.
Alan Armstrong: Thank you, Cheryl. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us. We really are excited to be able to prove out the way our business is continuing to stand up in -- with a lot of external headwinds, and looking forward to continuing to see these predictable cash flows continue to grow. And I really appreciate all the interest in the company, and the great questions today. So have a nice day. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for joining us, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes our call, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-04 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Brett Krieg, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Brett Krieg: Thanks, Lindsey. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in The Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon, we released our earnings press release and the presentation that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and our Chief Financial Officer, John Chandler, will speak to this morning. Also, joining us on the call today are Micheal Dunn, our Chief Operating Officer; Lane Wilson, our General Counsel; and Chad Zamarin, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development. In our presentation materials, you will find the disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. And these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today’s presentation materials. So with that, I’ll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong: Great. Thanks, Brett, and thank you for all for joining us today. We’re proud to share the results of the strong second quarter that really is a testament to the stability and predictability of our business. As John will share in more detail, Williams exceeded its internal plans and also expectations by the Street and showed just how durable this business can be against a number of headwinds, including shut-ins in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico for a variety of reasons, including a COVID breakout on one of the platform – larger platforms that serves us, Tropical Storm Cristobal and a variety of price-related shut-ins that expanded beyond the Gulf of Mexico to places like the Eagle Ford and the condensate production in the Marcellus. So lots of headwinds for the quarter. But really, the variety that we have and the durability of our business really shown through. It’s not been an easy environment for most companies to navigate, and a lot of people are likely asking you to look past this quarter and focus on the remainder of the year. But for Williams, it is quite the contrary. We want to focus on this quarter’s performance, because Q2 was a real opportunity for us to demonstrate the stability of our business and the long-term benefit of a strategy that has been built on the sound fundamentals of low-cost, clean natural gas. So let me turn it over to John to walk through our results, and then I’ll share some thoughts on the overall natural gas market and compare Williams volumes up against the broader market stats, and then I’ll hit on some of the key investor topics before we get to Q&A. So, John?
John Chandler: Thanks, Alan. We’ll talk to Slide 1 here for a moment. We are obviously very pleased, and frankly, we’re not surprised with the results this quarter. As Alan mentioned, while the energy industry faced a very difficult environment over the last quarter, our volumes and earnings really shine through, and you can see this in our statistics for the quarter. Cash flow from operations improved by 7% year-over-year. And while adjusted earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA looks flat to last year, realize that there are a few unusual items that cloud the comparability, and namely, those relate to the reductions in deferred revenues and the impact of some temporary shut-ins in the Gulf of Mexico. And those two negative items were offset somewhat by the benefit of NGL prices on our inventory in the West. If you exclude these items, our adjusted EBITDA actually was up over 3%. We will discuss EBITDA variances more in a moment. Distributable cash flow was down for the quarter. But importantly, in the second quarter of 2019, it benefited from an $85 million alternative minimum tax refund. We expect a similar refund this year, but that will come later this year. Factoring this out, distributable cash flow also increased $15 million, or about 2%, reflective of the EBITDA increase we saw this quarter. The strong distributable cash flow generated very solid dividend average of 1.64 times, showing that our dividend is very safe. If you expand that for the full-year, distributable cash flow and coverage are on track to achieve the midpoint of our original guidance range, even with our guidance of EBITDA being in the lower-half of our guidance range. This is because of the lower-than-expected level of maintenance capital spending this year versus our original plan, and due to the benefit of tax refund we expect to receive in the second-half of this year. Intentional capital discipline and the shifting of some project spending continues to drive capital spending down, and as a result, our free cash flow up. And to that point, expansion capital spending for the quarter and year-to-date is about one half of what it was last year. With expansion capital spending now expected to come in the $1 billion to $1.2 billion range and looking at our EBITDA and distributable cash flow forecast, we still predict that we’ll produce excess free cash flow this year above all dividends and capital expenditures. The strong cash generation and capital discipline has helped deliver on our goals to improve our leverage metrics. Our net debt divided by our last 12 months EBITDA produces a ratio of 4.31 times and reflects a nice improvement over the metric from the same time last year. And finally, while not on this page, we did end this quarter with $1.1 billion in cash, of which $600 million will be used to retire debt that matures in November. This cash, along with our untapped $4.5 billion revolver, provides significant liquidity to the company. Now, let’s go to Page 2, which is our adjusted EBITDA waterfalls. And let’s dig in a little bit deeper about the variances of our EBITDA results for the quarter. Again, Williams performed very well despite a pretty tough energy market. As I mentioned a moment ago, we believe it’s important to isolate a few unusual things to make the numbers more comparable and reflective of the ongoing performance of the business. We’ve identified those unusual items, which are shown on this chart as comparability item and they totaled $42 million. And they consist of three things. The first is a $32 million reduction in EBITDA tied to non-cash deferred revenue step down in the West around our Barnett Shale franchise area and in the Gulf of Mexico around our Gulf East franchise area. As a reminder, on deferred revenue, we received significant upfront cash payments several years ago, but did not recognize revenue at time. We have been amortizing those payments that we received into income over the last several years. And that amortization has been shrinking year-over-year. The second unusual item is that related to our Deepwater Gulf of Mexico shut-ins that occurred during the quarter, and they had a negative $24 million impact to our results. These shut-ins were due to customer planned maintenance, which was significantly extended because of a COVID outbreak on a platform of one of our producers. It was also impacted due to Tropical Storm Cristobal. And then finally, it was impacted due to some price-related shut-ins that occurred during the second quarter. The third unusual item that benefit – is the benefit of the rebound of the NGL prices that had a positive impact on our inventory value this quarter. You may recall in the first quarter, we highlighted reduced commodity profits due to what was a quick move down in NGL prices, causing a non-cash write-down of operational inventory and accounting losses on inventory sales in the first quarter. That turned around this quarter, driving a $14 million improvement in marketing results, partially recapturing some of the loss we noted in the first quarter. It’s important to note that this is not us building inventory for speculative purposes, it’s just our operational inventory, primarily linefill. It’s also important to note that when you look at our West results, understand that the first quarter commodity results were understated because of this item and the second quarter results were overstated. So this is not really a meaningful variance for commodities year-to-date in comparison to last year. We called out each of these three items, because, again, we feel it’s important to note their impact on the current period. And it allows – by separating those items, it allows for a better understanding of the ongoing performances of our business. With that out of the way, our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico assets produced results that were $28 million better than the same period last year. A big portion of this increase came from new projects put into service on Transco, including Rivervale South and Gateway projects, that were brought into service late last year and the Hillabee Phase II project, which is brought into service this quarter. In addition, this quarter benefited from Transco’s rate case settlement, which we did not reach settlement terms until the third quarter of last year. And finally, this quarter benefited from lower costs, both savings initiatives started last year and additional efforts we’re making this year. While the Gulf of Mexico was not a contributor to the growth in EBITDA this quarter, volumes and revenues have already rebounded from the shut-in issues experienced during the quarter. And as of July 1, all affected production is back online. Now moving to the Northeast segment, it continues to come on strong, contributing $44 million of additional EBITDA this quarter. Collectively, total Northeast gathering volumes grew 7% in the quarter and processing volumes were up 17%. These higher volumes drove revenue growth and, of course, we are realizing more revenues per gathered Mcf due to additional revenues earned from processing, transportation and fractionation of gas and NGLs. Equity method investments also drove EBITDA growth, where we benefited from higher Bradford volumes due to a gathering expansion of that system in late 2019. Higher volumes from our Laurel Mountain Midstream joint venture, where volumes reached their highest peak in over three years in June; and our Marcellus South system, where we benefited from several new wells coming online during the quarter. Finally, the Northeast also benefited from cost reduction efforts, much of which began last year, as well as some favorable maintenance expense savings. As a final note in the Northeast, our adjusted EBITDA per gathered Mcf for our Northeast operated assets, when you include a proportion of items for non-operated assets is now $0.52 per Mcf in the second quarter of 2020, compared to $0.48 per Mcf this same time last year, that’s an 8% increase. Now moving to the West. That segment declined $32 million that was largely – that reduction was largely the result of special revenues realizable last year that were not repeated this year. When looking at the ongoing health of the West segment, it’s really important to dig into the details of these unusual items. Those special revenue items in the second quarter of 2019 that I mentioned were the MVC payments in the Barnett Shale that ended in June of last year and the final cost of service contract true-up in the Mid-Continent, which benefited the second quarter of last year. And, of course, neither of those were repeated this year. Beyond these items, gathering revenues were down, but were offset somewhat by lower cost. Combined gathering volumes for the West declined by 1% for the quarter. However, this was heavily influenced by some shut-in volumes in May in the Eagle Ford. If you exclude the Eagle Ford franchise area, volumes on all of our other systems collectively were up 2%. Now, as it relates to Eagle Ford basin, our gathering agreement there is protected by a minimum volume commitment. And during the quarter, even though volumes were less than the Eagle Ford, we actually realized increased revenues from the minimum volume commitment. Finally, lower costs also benefit this segment as we keep a relentless focus on efficiency and control. One other odd thing you may note in our statistics on the NGL and crude oil transportation line is a meaningful drop in volume, which comes from our Overland Pass Pipeline. This decline did not have an impact on our EBITDA, given that a shipper on the pipeline agreed to pay us a fee and keep us hold on revenues in lieu of shipping dedicated volumes on that line. Now moving to Slide 3, our year-to-date results. You can see that year-to-date results showed growth of nearly 2% in adjusted EBITDA, driven by many of the same factors affecting the second quarter growth. Barnett and Gulfstar non-cash deferred revenue step down accreted a $53 million reduction in EBITDA year-over-year, deepwater shut-ins that we just talked about in the second quarter accreted a negative $21 million reduction in EBITDA, and the net impact of commodity price fluctuations on the first and second quarter collectively accreted a negative $10 million headwind. So if you take those comparability items out of the mix, year-to-date adjusted EBITDA actually results in a 5% increase. The West is off for many of the same reasons we described in the second quarter. The Northeast is a huge part of the growth year-to-date, adding $112 million in EBITDA this year over last year, with overall volumes up 6% and incremental revenues being realized from processing, transportation and fractionation of gas and NGLs. And the Transmission & Gulf of Mexico assets are delivering growth as well with an uplift from expansion projects, the rate case settlement and expense reductions, and those positives are offset somewhat by some – by lower Gulf of Mexico profits. Again, all in all, despite a tough market, we’re off to a really good start for the year. I’ll now turn the call back over to Alan to review some of the key supply and demand fundamentals. Alan?
Alan Armstrong: Great. Well, thanks, John. And now, let’s look at the fundamentals that continue to support our business here on Slide 4. As we’ve consistently stated, our strategy depends on natural gas demand. And many people assume that natural gas demand would be greatly diminished by COVID-19 and a stalled economy. Fortunately, we have not seen that play out at all. In fact, natural gas demand has continued to grow, both broadly across the market and on our systems, in particular. Overall, Lower-48 demand was up 2% from the second quarter of 2019. In fact, the only segment that did not grow was industrial load. And even industrial load was only down slightly about 0.6% and most of that was really early in the 2Q. So we’ve actually seen that rebound back up normal levels. But really at that level, you pretty well call that flat. On the power gen side, loads remain strong with 2Q 2020 tracking 3% higher than the 2019 2Q levels. And the early numbers for the month of July here look like this healthy trend is continuing into the third quarter. This is especially impressive if you consider that over the last 18 months, over 600 projects, representing an additional 20 gigawatts of renewable power generation capacity have been installed in the U.S. And the U.S. continues to show how powerful the combination of wind, solar and gas-fired generation can be when we’re up against meeting the dual challenge of providing low-cost and reliable energy, while at the same time lowering greenhouse gas emissions. So there’s a lot of conflict, a lot of discussion, a lot of political bent that goes into this issue. But at the end of the day, the U.S. is really doing a nice job of combining the benefits of renewable power with gas-fired generation. And we continue to see that show up in the numbers on a fact basis, despite a lot of the media and political bantering that goes around this issue. We really are seeing positive improvement here in the U.S. on both emissions and continuing to provide low-cost power here in the U.S. So we really got a lot of positive things on that front and we expect that to continue. On the residential and commercial side, demand was actually up 5%. And so I think that surprised a lot of people in the quarter as well. And even the export market comprised, primarily of LNG shipping in Mexico pipeline exports was up 11% on a 2Q to 2Q basis. Of course, LNG exports have diminished significantly from the first part of the year, but there are positive signs emerging and the number of cargo cancellations have begun to diminish as you get into looking at the third quarter lifts, and particularly in September now. The Mexico pipeline exports have been on the rise and are expected to continue, as pipeline infrastructure that’s reaching further down into Mexico are now complete and will soon begin to utilize supplies from the U.S. directly by pipeline, even into areas where Altamira LNG was the typical supply there. So a lot of good things going on there as Mexico continues to bring in natural gas to replace more expensive power generation in their markets. On our own gas transmission systems, volumes are up 8% in 2020, on average, compared to the three-year average, so a lot of moving parts there. But we continue to see those volumes and certainly on our – on a 2Q to 2Q basis looking at our contracted capacity, of course, and that’s important to us, because that is actually how we get paid on our transmission systems. Now as we move on to Slide 5 and look at the production update and really pretty simple story here on the supply side. You can see the overall Lower-48 wellhead production in the second quarter of 2020 declined slightly versus 2Q of 2019 to about 0.3%, again, pretty flat. But Williams wellhead gathering actually increased by 3.6%, and that was despite the shut-ins in places like the Eagle Ford and the Gulf of Mexico. So we expect this to continue to be the story in a wide variety of market conditions, as the low-cost supplies will be the last off and the first to be called on to meet growing demand. We have focused our G&P business with this principle in mind and we’re really excited about the way our gathering and processing business is set up for the next several years here. Looking into the third quarter, we are seeing no exception, as gathering volumes continue to grow here in July, and our deepwater volumes, as you heard from John, have fully rebounded. I’m going to move on now to key investor focus areas. And so here on Slide 6, we take a look at these key areas for investors. Our business is durable, because we have the right strategy, the right assets, and we contract our business in a conservative manners that can withstand the kind of commodity upsets that we’ve witnessed here in the second quarter. Looking first on the durability and from a commercial perspective, our premier gas transmission assets serve as critical components of the nation’s natural gas grid and are driven by a long-term demand for capacity by the major utilities in the densely populated areas. Our transmission business has fully contracted cash flows with no commodity or volume exposure. And it is important to remember that when it comes to our pipeline business, it is the available capacity that we sell. Therefore, we are not dependent on throughput or volumes. We contract with high-credit quality customers, primarily utilities and power producers. And by the way, when we speak about credit, we have continually said that we do believe credit is very important for the long-term long haul pipeline contracts, and we have always held this out as a principle of contracting in the long haul business. In the G&P business, we protect our cash flows by providing services that are essential to the monetization of the reserves in the ground and by owning the infrastructure back to the wellhead in most cases. We also have a diverse portfolio of basins and customers within our G&P business that gives us the ability to withstand a lot of change – individual changes that go on amongst our producing customers. Additionally, most of our contracts are fixed fee and do not vary with the price of the commodity or basis differential. And that is why you’re seeing such steady and predictable cash flows continuing, despite a very difficult commodity pricing environment here in 2Q. Producer bankruptcy continues to be a hot topic in the Midstream sector. And, of course, Chesapeake recently filed for bankruptcy. I would note that despite there being a large number of long haul pipeline and processing contracts being listed by Chesapeake for rejection, none of our contracts have been slated for rejection. And that’s primarily due to the fact that we provide this essential service back to the wellhead. In fact, we see opportunity in the Chesapeake bankruptcy process to strengthen our relationship and expect restructuring to give Chesapeake the flexibility to navigate the fast shifting market and put these basins William serves in a healthier position for growth. So Chesapeake has got a great position in both the Bradford County, PA, as well as in the Haynesville, and we are well-positioned to serve the growth coming out of those basins as that dry gas gets called on here over the next couple of years. Looking on the financial side, let me start out by saying that despite an excessively high yield, it’s now over 8%. There is no reason need or intent to reduce our very well covered dividend. We grew it by 5% this year and we still expect our coverage to be 1.7% for the year. In fact, in addition to the coverage on our dividend, we also expect to more than cover our growth capital this year. This free cash flow generation will continue to improve credit metrics. And in the quarter, we saw our net debt to EBITDA actually go down to 4.31 times, really hard to find anyone improving their credit metrics more consistently than we have and especially in this environment. Turning quickly to guidance. Despite the turmoil in the space, we’re holding guidance on the profit side and reducing it on the spending side. On adjusted EBITDA, we still expect to land in the lower-half of the range, but our outlook has improved since our last earnings release. On DCF, we’re still forecasting the midpoint of the original range. But as you will note through the second quarter, we are pacing ahead of the midpoint. On growth CapEx, we’re reducing from the original range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, down to $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion and that, of course, is providing further support for additional free cash flow generation and we have derisked most of the major projects for the year. So great performance by our project execution teams and this is one of the key drivers for the reduction in our CapEx. And with the risk reduction, we’re actually headed towards the lower-end of even this new range. So great job by our teams out there of continuing to control costs and execute on our projects in a difficult environment. Turning to sustainability and how we think about that at Williams. Sustainability grounded in sensibility is nothing new here at Williams. Over long-lived – operating this long-lived infrastructure requires focus on long-term sustainability. Our continued focus on sustainability delivers immense value that is well aligned with the interest of long-term shareholders. Our 2019 Sustainability Report was published on July 27. And this report really provides a very transparent view into the actions we are taking to balance the dual challenge of meeting increasing demand for energy, while reducing emissions and environmental impacts with practical and immediate solutions. More than 41 – and one of the highlights that I would point to you in there that I’m really proud of our operating teams for being so focused on is that, we’ve reduced our reported methane emissions by 41% since 2012. So really nice job by our teams on that and everybody is proud of what we’re doing to continue to do our part to improve the environment. And now turning to look at growth. Lots of concerns expressed about the difficult permitting environment that exists. Of course, for Williams, this is a double-edged sword. Our pipes and right-of-ways are positioned to serve some of the most densely populated areas. And as a result, we have the ability to expand these systems at much lower cost and with much less environmental impact that greenfield projects would present. Of course, this gives us tremendous advantage and provides us with unique growth opportunities at returns that can offset the risk associated with this difficult permitting environment. Looking at the quarter, despite the unfortunate decision that came out from New York on NESE during the quarter, we had terrific execution across the rest of our project portfolio. In fact, we’re now completing the final tie-ins on our 193-mile Bluestem NGL pipeline extending through Kansas and Oklahoma. And our 42-inch pipeline loop on Transco, along our Transco system for the Southeastern Trail project in Virginia, was completed and placed in service as well. So great work by the teams overcoming a lot of restrictions due to COVID. But really learning to work in a different way and continuing to deliver our projects on budget and on time. We also – on the G&P side, our Salem Compressor Station, which is in Ohio, was expanded in the dry Utica to meet a customer’s accelerated schedule needs. So a lot of great drilling success by Encino in the dry Utica and we’ve been working really hard to keep up with their expansion needs out there and really great to see them being successful. And our team is doing a great job of keeping up with that success. We also received a FERC Certificate for our Leidy South project in Pennsylvania. So really excited to see that project moving along. And Regional Energy Access continues to progress, and we are dusting off the plans as well required to help serve the ACP, Atlantic Coast Pipeline load that remains in the Mid-Atlantic. So we’ve always been extremely well-positioned to serve that load. And we’re now dusting off some of the original plans that we had. So we think that presents an opportunity, not – certainly not in the near-term, but over the long-term, presents continued growth opportunities along our transmission system. Taking a look at the growth in our gathering and processing business. First of all, the G&P business is meeting our expectations for the year. And we’ve got great performance out of the Northeast G&P footprint, both on a volume – keeping up with the volume growth out there, as well as cost controlled by our teams out there. So really great operating performance. Our low-cost basins provide predictable cash flow and continue to position us to grow in a wide range of supply and demand scenarios. As I mentioned earlier, we do believe being in the very lowest-cost – the very low – lowest-cost basins and being in the right spots in those basins is going to be a differentiator for us as we’re moving into these low commodity prices, both on the oil side and as we continue to see gas demand continue to increase. The most economic gas supplies, we think, will come out of places like Susquehanna, Bradford Counties in Northeast PA, the Dry Utica, the Southwest Marcellus area and the core Haynesville. Our teams continue to tie-in new production and expand compressor stations just like clockwork in both the Northeast and the Haynesville. So you don’t hear about a lot of those projects, because they don’t hit the major products radar screen, but a tremendous amount of great work going on by our teams out there keeping up with that growth. In the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we have really a unique set of capabilities and very well-positioned infrastructure. And we are continuing to win a lot of new business in the Gulf. Latest that we reported on was the LLOG Taggart tie-back. With Taggart, we now expect four expansions – major expansions to come online in 2022 through 2024. And those projects, we estimate somewhere around $300 million of EBITDA just from those four projects and the majority of that will come on into 2024. But even beyond the big sizable package that you hear about, we continue to build a string of base hits. And now in addition to Taggart, we signed up two other new deepwater packages that will deliver ahead of these larger plays. And in the 2Q, the latest that we’ve contracted four were Fieldwood, [ph] Katmai, Prospect, as well as LLOG Spruance on our discovery system, so really great work going on by our teams out there. So in a move to close here, we’ve intentionally built a business that is steady and predictable. And this quarter was a chance to show just how durable this business can be against a number of headwinds. Our natural gas focus strategy positions us well to capitalize on continued natural gas growth. Our existing transmission infrastructure offers growth advantage, as well as durability of cash flows. And our low-cost basins provide predictable cash flows and position us to grow in a wide range of supply and demand scenarios. We remain bullish on natural gas demand growth, because we recognize the critical role natural gas does and will continue to play in a clean energy economy. Thanks for natural gas. The U.S. continues to see significant reductions in CO2 emissions, along with lower consumer utility bills, and this has enhanced the opportunities for investment in renewable energy. And finally, I’d be remiss if I didn’t close my remarks by acknowledging the tremendous efforts of our entire workforce who continue to do their part to ensure the delivery of natural gas to American city – cities and communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. These efforts are frequently overlooked by the general public, who often take for granted a highly reliable and safe energy infrastructure that enables our everyday lives and jobs across our great country, and I’m extremely proud of our employees for their efforts to keep our operations running smoothly, while also going the extra mile to keep themselves and their coworkers safe and healthy. And with that, I’ll open it up for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning. Just want to start off with, I guess, producer activity across your footprint here. It seems like natural gas has rebounded a bit and commodity prices coming up a bit here. So just wondering if you could give us a flavor of what you’re seeing across your G&P footprint there? Do you think that the West could tick up again quarter-over-quarter that was certainly a better showing there than what we expected? So any color, I guess, on producer activity across your footprint would be helpful?
Micheal Dunn: Hi, good morning, Jeremy. This is Micheal. We are seeing some activity there across all of our dry gas basins, where producer customers are expecting higher prices next year and we’re seeing that in the forward curve as well. You’ve seen probably some of the comments from some of our customers that they’re being cautious, I think, with what they’re saying, but they are prepared to participate in a higher-price environment. And we would expect to see that not only in the Rockies, but in the Northeast PA and in the Haynesville. We’ve even seen some pretty decent activity in the Barnett with some workovers there and some new production coming on just from some wells that had been underperforming. So they are anticipating and taking advantage. It looks like a potential higher-price environment next year.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it. That’s helpful. Thanks. And switching gears, it seems like more of the utilities are kind of running test pilots with regards to hydrogen. And granted, it’s probably pretty later data at this point. But just want to see if you had any thoughts as far as hydrogen blending, if that is something that Williams could play a role in going forward? Or any thoughts on this topic would be helpful? Thanks.
Alan Armstrong: Yes, Jeremy, great question, and thank you. We have several projects right now, where we’re bringing in renewable gas from dairy operations and from waste areas. And so we are working. We’ve got a lot of them already online, and we’re continuing to work on those projects. And I would say, those are – will be obviously ahead of hydrogen in terms of coming on, but we do see a lot of investment opportunity around that. Also, on the hydrogen front, certainly, we’ve heard the message loud and clear from places like New York about the political support for decarbonization, and we think that presents a great opportunity for us at Williams to invest with our customers in projects like that. And so we certainly are interested in doing that and think we’re extremely well-positioned, given our distribution network into those densely populated areas. We think we’re extremely well-positioned to be able to take advantage. And especially as renewable – excess renewable power becomes available and converting that to hydrogen as a form of energy storage, we’re extremely well-positioned to take part in that. And as you’ve seen on the solar front, we’re certainly interested in making investments where they make sense in and around our pipeline systems and to take advantage of investments in renewable opportunities. And so we’re no stranger to it. The team has done a great job of picking up new opportunities like that. And Chad Zamarin and his team have continued to look into opportunities like that. And I think that’s – nobody is better positioned for that than Williams, frankly. So we look forward to continuing to look into those opportunities.
Jeremy Tonet: That’s a very helpful color. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering & Holt. Your line is now open.
Colton Bean: Good morning. So, Alan, maybe just to follow-up on that on the solar initiative. How do you see that playing out over the next five years or so? And what would you need to see to evaluate renewables as a revenue driver versus primarily cost savings?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, I’m going to have Chad Zamarin to address that for you, Colton.
Chad Zamarin: Sure. Yes. No, I think one of the great things about our position is that, we don’t just view renewable investments as a cost savings opportunity. We do see them as good accretive investments and solar is one of those examples. I think we expect to invest somewhere between $200 million to $400 million over the next few years in solar projects that are immediately along our footprint. Now, we will likely have partners in those projects in order to optimize the way that gets installed and optimize the value that Williams can capture. But I would just say, Alan mentioned, we’re – we’ve got a fairly good pipeline of opportunities on the solar front. Alan mentioned, we have existing RNG projects coming into the system. We have a pretty good line of sight towards project, add additional dairy farm, landfill projects to our system, where not only we can invest in that upstream opportunity, but we can build the infrastructure to bring that renewable gas into our main line systems. And then just as a follow-up on the hydrogen front, I think, anywhere where we see, if there will be an opportunity to create value along our pipeline footprint, I think, no one is better positioned than Williams. When you think of our footprint up into the Northwest and our footprint along the Eastern Seaboard and up into the Northeast, I think, we’re very well-positioned to capture project opportunities that add value and do create revenue generation opportunities. And so I think it’s early days. But I will tell you that we are very focused on that part of the business, because we truly believe that natural gas is part of the solution for how we can invest further in renewables in the United States. So I would expect that focus to continue and we’ll continue to find opportunities over the next several years.
Colton Bean: Great. I appreciate the added detail there. And just switching over to the capital front, I think, we’ve seen a few Northeast producers reference a maintenance case for 2021. So I know great preliminary, but any expectations for what WMB’s capital needs might look like in a flattish volume environment?
Alan Armstrong: Well, I would just say we continue to see growth in the Northeast. And I think, as Micheal mentioned, it’s largely dependent on the forward curve, but we do have a lot of producers that are looking to take advantage of that. And so I would just say, the growth is going to have to come from somewhere. If we don’t see an oil price recovery, we’re going to – there’s going to have to be replacement of those volumes, as well as continue to meet demand growth. It’s pretty amazing if we look at how low LNG exports are and yet our demand for the year has still grown. And so if we were enjoying that LNG – a typical LNG demand, we would really have the outstripping right now and the market would be turning the other way pretty quickly, I think. So said another way, I’m not sure I would agree that we’ll see flat volumes and certainly don’t see that coming out of the low-price basins, like the Northeast Marcellus and the Haynesville and the dry Utica. So – but if we did see that, I would just say, our capital has gotten lower and lower and lower in the Northeast, because our systems are very expanded right now. We’ve done a great job of that. We are looking at a couple of expansions, as Micheal mentioned, that are pretty sizable, but that’s in kind of the planning horizon right now. But if we do see flat, there’s just not a whole lot of capital demand for the Northeast. And so just because our systems are already covering such a wide swath of the acreage that’s dedicated to us something.
Colton Bean: Okay. I appreciate it, Alan.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gabe Moreen with Mizuho. Your line is now open.
Gabriel Moreen: Hey, good morning, everyone. Alan, maybe I’ll bite on the dusting off the plans, given the APC’s demise. Can you just talk about kind of future strategy there? Are these smaller bolt-on projects? Is it something that would be more sizeable and larger capacity?
Alan Armstrong: Well, I would say, we’re – those are obviously going to be customer-driven there. And we certainly are well-positioned to work with the customers to help meet those growing demand with the two laterals, both the main line that goes through Virginia there and with sizable capacity to deliver, as well as the two laterals, the Cardinal line and South Virginia laterals that stretch into those markets. Nobody is better positioned than we are to expand that. And originally, I would just say, we – we’re pretty certain that expansion alternatives that we had there were a very low-cost. And the primary reason for going to ACP in that case was the benefits of having another major system in the area for liability purposes. But we think with the pressure on cost and the conflict, we’re confident we can maintain that reliability that we’ve always provided for that area, but at a much lower cost. And so I would just say, we’re working closely with the customers in the area to look at their demand requirements. And we’ve got a great relationship with the customers in those markets, and we’re going to look to tailor our solutions to fit their needs. But in terms of the existing right-of-way, the existing capacity, the ability to expand those debt capacity into those markets. And they goes without saying that nobody is better positioned than we are to help serve that. And we can do it – importantly, we can do it on an incremental basis. And so said another way, we don’t have to build all the capacity all at once. We can do that over time. And, of course, that’s a huge advantage when it comes to cost efficiency and return on capital to be able to expand those systems as the demand needs, of course. So Micheal, anything you would add to that?
Micheal Dunn: I would just say, the other aspect that we have that Alan just commented a bit in regard to our existing systems. Building on those brownfield systems is a much lower environmental footprint and environmental impact. And we think that’s something that will carry today as well in regard to these incremental expansions that we can bring to those customers in that area.
Gabriel Moreen: Thanks. And then maybe if I can ask also, it seems like ethane recovery has ticked up a bit. I’m just wondering what you’re seeing on your systems out there in the West, whether that’s been maybe a source of a little upside and if it continues, whether that could mean improved economics out of Bluestem?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. We certainly are seeing ethane recovery continue out there and that is boosting volumes in the area. So you may have seen in our OPPL volumes, we’re actually down for the quarter. But that’s just because we had a customer that chose to take their volumes off and pay us for that volume efficiency rather than ship. And so that – so said another way, while the volumes were off a little bit there, the revenues were not off from that. And so – but we do see expanded opportunity, as ethane recovery comes in. We’re seeing the Ford market is actually continuing to show margin for most of the rest of the year on ethane. And so, given our limited appetite for commodity price risk, we’re taking advantage of that as we see that forward market present itself for taking advantage of that.
Gabriel Moreen: Great. Thanks, Alan.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Derek Walker with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Derek Walker: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. Maybe just a couple of quick ones for me. Alan, you talked about addressing some of the counterparty risk and you obviously talked about Chesapeake actually presenting some potential opportunities around some of the restructuring potentially benefit in Bradford and Haynesville. Just want to see if you can provide a little bit more color around some of the dynamics there? And then I know Chesapeake has some exposure in Eagle Ford, or you have exposure to test being in Eagle Ford? Can you just talk a little bit more about some of the outcomes you might see in that basin? Thanks.
Micheal Dunn: Yes, this is Micheal. I guess, I’ve walked through the three major basins that we have exposure with Chesapeake and the Bradford. We have a cost of service agreement there with them. It’s a very low-cost rate that they enjoy there. It’s a cost of service agreement, that’s actually working very well for both us and the customer. And I would not expect, obviously, any pressure there with the continued growth that we’re seeing. Haynesville, a very similar situation. We expect continued growth out of the Haynesville. We have been working with a number of customers in the Haynesville to offer incentive rate there where it makes sense to incent some additional drilling whenever the prices were lower, and we think there’s an opportunity to continue that if prices don’t rebound. But right now, the strip looks more favorable for that dry gas basin in there. And in the Eagle Ford, we have a substantial footprint there with Chesapeake as well, and we move a lot of volume. Those volumes are back to where they were a pre-COVID situation for the most part. And that’s the basin that’s obviously exposed to NGL prices, as well as condensate and oil prices. And as those prices are expected to rebound with picked up demand, we would expect the Eagle Ford to be another area that we would continue to see some growth in the future with Chesapeake. So those three major basins, we have Chesapeake. We don’t see a worry on our horizon in regard to continuing to see good economics for the customer there, as well as for our Midstream business.
Derek Walker: And as far as the incentives in the Haynesville, is that – would that be on an incremental production? Would that be – what type of rate would that look like compared to what you’re currently charging in?
Micheal Dunn: Yes. That is on incremental production only. We’re not discounting, obviously, any PDP volumes that we have going on our systems today.
Alan Armstrong: And I would add to that, where we are doing that the only place we would agree to do that is where we don’t have any capital investment. So this would just be incremental drilling, where there’s no capital required on our part. And so we love that business to have the incremental flowing volumes and have that revenue grow without having to spend any well-connect capital out there. And so that’s a great opportunity for both the us and the producer. If prices firm out there a bit, then there won’t be a need to do that and we won’t. But if prices are low enough, that’s a great way for us to keep the cash flows building without spending new capital.
Derek Walker: I appreciate that. Maybe just a follow-up on the deepwater. I want to make sure I heard some of the numbers right. I think from the slide and based on guidance, I think, you’re running around $450 million of EBITDA on deepwater, with $300 million expected from the four major projects. Should we think of that base EBITDA as being fairly flat? Or is there some sort of impact from the actual decline rate? So just trying to get a sense of that $300 million that you referenced is going to be incremental or potentially offsetting some natural decline?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. That’s a great question. I mean, obviously, the deepwater business does decline over time and I’m not confirming the $450 million here. But let’s assume it’s in that range. Normally, you would expect declines. The good news is that we’ve continued to be tying in so many single base hits that I’ve referred to earlier, that that’s tending to offset that normal decline ahead of those bigger projects. So will it stay actually flat? I would say, if we start counting that those projects in, then the answer would be no. We would have some decline underneath that. But so far, the the environment is really positive out there, and infill that’s coming from producers in and around our assets is offsetting those declines. And so this would be incremental, but that is dependent on those continued tie-in. So obviously, there – we don’t have contractual protection from the declines out there. I guess, I would remind you.
John Chandler: One thing – this is John Chandler. One thing I’d add to that, too, is we do have a couple of more quarters of deferred revenue step downs related to a big platform that customer paid for several years ago. That pretty much stabilizes at the end of this year and the step down stopped, but we’ve got another probably ZIP code $50 million of step downs between the next two quarters in deferred revenue in the deepwater.
Alan Armstrong: Thanks, John.
Derek Walker: Got it. Thanks, guys. I really appreciate it. Thanks, Alan. Thanks, John. Thanks, Mike. That’s it from me.
Alan Armstrong: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Your line is now open.
Shneur Gershuni: Hi, good morning, everyone. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. Just two clarification questions, if I may. The first one is just with a lot of focus on the election these days and sort of an expectation out there that tax rates could go up, would you be in a position in from a Transco perspective to be able to increase rates as a result of higher tax rates? Or does the recent settlement that you entered into prevent that from occurring?
John Chandler: No. I mean, we – obviously, as part of our rate settlement exercise, we do build in tax rates. Now we have to wait for our next rate case, obviously, to push that through to our base rates. So yes, clearly, higher tax rates would benefit us in the form of higher rates in the future on the rates that are subject to our rate negotiate or to the rate case. Now again, remember, on our Transco system, about 50% of our rates are negotiated. So obviously, it wouldn’t have an impact on that. But certainly, the rate – part of our rate case and rate base is subject to an assumption on taxes – the tax rates.
Alan Armstrong: Certainly, it’d be beneficial almost in whole the Northwest Pipeline, right? Because we don’t have the negotiated rate element of that in Northwest Pipeline. So about half of Transco and nearly all of Northwest Pipeline would benefit from that.
Shneur Gershuni: So that makes perfect sense. Thanks, guys. And maybe just one clarification with respect to your guidance commentary today. If I sort of think back to when you last updated us formally second quarter was supposed to be the most challenging quarter for 2020. Decent – pretty strong quarter. Officially, your guidance commentary hasn’t changed. But in your prepared remarks, you said that things were looking more promising. So when I sort of see no change to guidance, it sort of implies the second-half might actually be worse than 2Q, or is this just more nuance that you’re just not formally changing your guidance at all, because nothing has changed materially? Is that kind of the way to read it?
Alan Armstrong: I was wondering who was going to raise that, Shneur. Thank you. I would just say that, yes, we had a good quarter. We’ve had a good first-half of the year. You can see our costs are extremely low. I think, we want to make sure that we’ve got room in there for things like we’re going into to a more intense part of the hurricane season. And so we – and we certainly plan on things like that disrupting our business. So, yes, I think we’re extremely well-positioned right now on guidance to outperform on that, but there are always things that can go against you and – in – on both the cost side, as well as disruptions like hurricanes or another price setback on crude oil that might cause shut-ins in the deepwater or in other oil basins as well. So I would just say, we’re wanting to make sure – given the uncertainties in the market, we’re wanting to make sure that we’ve got room here for the balance of the year, as it relates to guidance.
Shneur Gershuni: So to paraphrase, an element of conservatism is basically baked in there. Is that kind of the right way to read it?
Alan Armstrong: Well, yes. But I also would say that, it would be rare that we wouldn’t have some kind of Hurricane impact in 3Q as well, and it’s a question of how big that is obviously? And I would say, I think, it’s not necessarily conservative to think that, that we might have more pricing impact rebound here. So I think, yes, we have room for those kind of things. You can say that’s going to – if you want to claim that’s conservative, then I would say that factor.
John Chandler: And, Shneur, this is John Chandler. I just say one other thing. I think our teams do a fantastic job of forecasting. But I’ve got to tell you in this COVID environment, it’s tough looking at cost, and I’m talking about our field people actually forecasting as well. We’ve done a tremendous job at cost savings year-to-date. I have a suspicion that’s going to continue. It’s hard for our folks to forecast that with any level of accuracy. I mean, we don’t even know when people could come back in the office that – with the COVID. And so if you think about somebody in the field trying to plan for maintenance or just even hiring people, that’s not an easy thing to do. So we’ve been very successful in cost reductions. I suspect that will continue, but I don’t imagine that’s fully baked through our forecast as good as we’re going to do is my guess.
Shneur Gershuni: No, that makes perfect sense, guys. I really appreciate the color and have a safe day.
Alan Armstrong: Thanks, Shneur.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Jean Ann Salisbury: Good morning. Warren Buffett’s purchase from Dominion said a marker in the space, but I’m not sure it was a great one at 10x for mostly demand coal gas assets. Did you compare and contrast how you see Transco and Northwest Pipeline compared to those assets, especially Dominion Gas, which was the bulk of the purchase?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I’ll take that, Jean Ann, and I think Micheal has got some comments on that as well. First of all, I think, it’d be hard to compare the quality of those assets up against ours, both in terms of growth and headroom in the markets and the network benefits that our systems have. But I also would remind you that there were things like on the Cove Point facility. There was a step down coming there, because they were still getting paid for the gasification side of Cove Point. Of course, we used to own that. So, we understand those contracts. And so to not take that into consideration, I think, is something you certainly wouldn’t see the Buffett organization do to not take that into consideration. And so I think anytime you’re looking at price points, you have to get pretty specific, especially when you have major contract shifts like that in a business like that. So Micheal, I don’t know if you have some additions?
Micheal Dunn: Yes. I think I would just add on the amount of debt that was taken on there as part of reflective of the multiple that was paid as well. So I think you have to take that into consideration, as Alan said. And I don’t think there’s a comparable system for the Transco system out there right now, and that’s certainly not a good marker for any of our transmission assets, especially the Transco system today.
Jean Ann Salisbury: Great. That’s helpful. Thank you. And just as a quick follow-up. With the completion of Mountain Valley drive increased potential firm transport opportunities on Transco, it seems like it’s actually getting pretty close?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. We certainly are rooting for MVP and would provide supply at a point, where we could continue to serve market expansions. And so we we certainly would love to see that get completed, because it does bring supply right into a critical point of our system that allows our network to continue to expand and serve expansions along our system.
Jean Ann Salisbury: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
Tristan Richardson: Good morning, guys. I appreciate all the comments today, particularly around the update on 2020 capital plans. As you look out further, as we think about capital towards Bluestem and Southeastern Trail winding down, and Taggart and Leidy South and some of the renewables projects ramping up, is it possible you could see the 2021 capital look very similar to 2020?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I think it’s a little bit early to call that for a number of reasons. But, yes, I – we don’t see right now that being having a whole lot of load against it. Regional Energy Access, obviously, was a little bit later in the cycle and the well investment for shale will probably start more seriously towards the end of 2021 or end of 2022. And both of those projects would drive our capital back up to the $1.5 billion, $2 billion range. But – so I would just say, so it’ll be somewhat timing dependent on those projects as to how quickly we started investing on those projects and drive that capital up further.
Tristan Richardson: That’s great. That’s all I had. Thank you guys very much.
Operator: That’s all the time we have for questions today. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Alan Armstrong for closing comments.
Alan Armstrong: Okay. Well, thank you all very much. I do have one note that I’d like to recognize somebody here at the company. It’s very difficult to do the typical celebrations that we do for retirement. But Ted Timmermans, who has served the Williams Company for over 41 years and – has referred as the – was our Chief Accounting Officer here at Williams for 15 years. This is his last effort for the quarterly call, and John Porter is taking over the Chief Accounting Officer role and have been a great transition that’s gone on there, much in keeping with the way Williams does business, very steady hand on that. But I certainly want to just say a huge thanks to Ted Timmermans for all of his great service to the company and for the the standards of excellence that he has always established in our accounting efforts here at Williams. And we were very fortunate to have his leadership here at Williams for a number of years. So, Ted, thank you very much, and we wish you the very best in retirement. And with that, we thank you very much and we appreciate to continuing to share the good story here at Williams. Have a good day.
Operator: That concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-05 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Williams First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Brett Krieg, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Brett Krieg: Thanks, Simon. Good morning, thank you for joining us and for your interest in The Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon, we released our earnings press release and the presentation that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily. Joining us on the call today are our Chief Operating Officer, Micheal Dunn; our CFO, John Chandler; our General Counsel, Lane Wilson; and our Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development, Chad Zamarin. In our presentation materials, you will find the disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. And these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials. And so with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong: Okay, great. Thanks, Brett, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today as we go through our first quarter 2020 financial performance. While the world around us has changed dramatically, some things have remained remarkably stable, and we should not take for granted the sacrifices and dedication required to keep the most essential of services available to us. But I'd like to start by thanking the frontline employees of The Williams, who have continued to operate our critical natural gas infrastructure during the Coronavirus pandemic. We often take our warm and well lit homes for granted, but it took great dedication, extra effort and resourcefulness to keep our most basic energy needs available during these disruptive times. Thankfully, we have always maintained robust plans to ensure business continuity, and we've been able to successfully execute on these plans while staying aligned with federal and state guidelines to keep our employees healthy and safe. I'm glad to report we have not missed a beat and this is a testament to the efforts of our employees across the country. Of course, the other big related news story that we're closely monitoring is the collapse in oil prices, and the impact this is having on our upstream customers. With that said, let's get to the business at hand and talk about our strong 1Q '20 performance. On Slide 1, we've provided a clear view of our first quarter 2020 financial performance relative to 1Q of '19 and as you can see, this was a really good quarter. We continue to enjoy steady growth across our key measures despite the impact of much lower commodity margins and deferred revenue recognition step down. From the top of the table you'll see we continued a long trend of year-over-year growth in cash flow from operations, our adjusted EBITDA also increased 4%, and while this is attractive growth, this growth rate would be 8% if you peel back some of the non cash items related to step downs and deferred revenue amortization and the impact of declining prices on our carried NGL inventories. I'll discuss the key business drivers and unique issues affecting adjusted EBITDA in more detail on the next slide but DCF was up an impressive 10% on a year-over-year basis. And of course, all this continues to drive impressive growth in our per share metrics adjusted EPS and DCF as well. We also were very pleased to continue growing our strong coverage ratio by 5% on top of the 5.3% dividend growth that we established earlier this year. Our 1.78 times coverage ratio means DCF exceeded dividends paid by $376 million another strong data point driving our cash flow performance in the first quarter was a 45%, or nearly $200 million reduction in growth capital expenditures. Taking all of these items into account, the strong DCF, the growth in the dividend and disciplined growth capital spending, Williams generated real free cash flow of $144 million this quarter alone, a lot of different versions of free cash flow out there but this is after all of our cash expenses, the dividend, and our growth capital expenditures as well. These financial results further reduced our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to 4.36 times for the first quarter. As reminder this ratio stood at 4.8 times at the end of 2018, and since then, we have moved this important ratio nearly 75% of the way to our longer term goal of the 4.2 times leverage that we've reminded you up several times. We are pleased with this performance. And we have intentionally built our business to be resilient through a variety of market cycles and that strategy is certainly helping us navigate today's choppy waters. Our healthy dividend coverage and strong balance sheet leading into 2020 have put us in a very stable financial position and well positioned to navigate the changes that we're experiencing across the industry. So let's move to Slide 2 and discuss the main business drivers of our first quarter 2020 adjusted EBITDA results. Before we dive into the drivers for this quarter, I want to remind you that we have transitioned our business segment disclosures to align with our internal reorganization that took effect in January. Our transmission in Gulf of Mexico operating area now includes all of our regulated natural gas transmission pipelines post Transco, Northwest and Gulf Stream and our deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets that delivers supplies into Transco and Gulf Stream. We will continue to evaluate and disclose the performance of the Northeast GMP and West operating areas separately but those segments are now integrated from the senior leadership and overhead standpoint and that change allows us to improve efficiency, alignment, and cost savings across all of our onshore gathering and processing business. So now looking at the chart on Slide 2, we compare adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2022 to the same period in 2019, and I'll quickly remind you that 1Q '19 represented a great period of growth for us, which was just following the Atlantic Sunrise startup and the associated Northeast gathering volume growth that we said. So a nice strong comp to compare ourselves to but before we get into discussion the key business drivers, I also want to talk about some of the things that affected the EBITDA number that I think obscure the underlying business performance. First is the impact of the lower deferred revenue recognition in the Barnett and our Gulfstar deepwater platform. These are both non-cash items totaling $21 million, and are not reflective of the ongoing cash flow from these assets. We also saw 24 million of impact this quarter related to decreases in inventory values. This was due to decline in the value of NGL line-fill and write-downs of NGL commodities and storage. While NGL price exposure is clearly part of our business, these charges are driven by directional movement of market prices and for this sort of charge to recur, we would have to see a continual drop in NGL prices from the already very low prices that we marked these inventories that on March, 31. So of course this does not include the actual NGLs that we produced and the equity sales that we had in the quarter. This was just the inventories and the repricing of inventories from our line-fill, our storage and our marketing teams inventory. Another way of looking at this is to answer the question of what would the run rate be for the balance of the year with identical operations and pricing that we saw in 1Q '20. The primary adjustment would be to add back to 24 million of inventory valuation right down to the 1.262 billion for the next three quarters, and this would provide us with an annual number above the midpoint of our guidance. To be fair, we had very low repair and maintenance costs this quarter, and we're not assuming that continues through the balance of the year. But I think this analysis highlights how pleased we were and are with our execution here in the first quarter. So after touching on those issues, let's dive into the key drivers. First of all, the primary drivers for the transmission in Gulf of Mexico segment was the decrease in recognized revenues, on our deepwater Gulfstar platform, which was coupled with the end of fixed payments on platform space. And, you know, we've reminded you of that several times that actually that fixed payments ended May of last year. And so this is, you'll hear a little bit about noise on this in second quarter and then we'll have a normal comp past that. Beyond this change on Gulfstar, the transmission in Gulf of Mexico was up $60 million from the first quarter of 2019. This was driven by Transco revenue growth from the Rivervale South to Market and gateway expansion projects and the Northwest pipeline North Seattle project. Additionally, our first quarter 2020 results include increased EBITDA from the Transco rate case settlement, and the benefit of cost saving and cost savings initiatives implemented in late 2019 on our operating teams there. Lastly, total deepwater gas volumes were up 8% year-over-year, mostly from the northwest pipeline and Hudak Gulf East projects that came online in the second half of 2019. And next, in the Northeast GMP adjusted EBITDA, we saw we were up $58 million and this was driven by higher gathering, processing and liquids handling revenue, a lot of new assets put in service in the second half of '19 that drove this, and we're providing additional services to volumes that we are already gathering there. This along with a relentless focus on cost containment and efficiency drove adjusted EBITDA growth of 23% for the Northeast operating area. Total gathered volumes consolidated and non-consolidated grew by 4% with the primary contributors coming from the Marcellus South, Ohio Valley Midstream, I’ll remind you that Ohio Valley Midstream is the Northeast JV that we have with the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board, and then the Susquehanna Supply Hub also contributed to that growth. This EBITDA and gathering volume performance resulted in this segment realizing $0.52 of EBITDA per gathered Mcf. So I’ll remind you that's the measure that we talked about back at our 2017 Analyst Day when we laid out the - our long term aspirations for the area, and so just to remind you, that range that we talked about, then was $0.50 to $0.55, so we wind up now in the middle of that range. So we're really, really thrilled to have achieved that important measure and I think that move from as I recall, I think that was around $0.36 - $0.37 back then. So really impressive move by the team as we've been able to continue to increase our unit costs - lower our unit costs and continue to drive efficiency in that basin. Of course there's a number of factors that have driven that and we're really excited though to have the scale that we do have now in that area. And this is going to allow us to continue using our low costs to drive competitive advantages and further growth in that basin. Moving on the West, the real story here is the steady business. Volume remained relatively flat and setting aside the non-cash Barnett issue in NGL inventory write-down. The West adjusted EBITDA was down about $13 million. The decline is mostly attributable to lower commodity margins driven by substantially lower NGL prices realized on our sold equity barrels during the quarter. So, now I'm going to move on to looking at the natural gas demand picture. We talked a little bit about this on our March 25 call, and I just wanted to update folks a lot of different stories out there in the markets around natural gas demand, and so wanted to give you the direct viewpoint that we have as Williams on this. Overall, we are seeing natural gas demand has remained strong, both broadly across the market and on our systems. In fact, we're seeing evidence that natural gas is not only holding up nicely, but even exceeding recent historical norms. And while it's hard to predict very far into the future right now, we have seen demand for natural gas in the U.S., including the exports to Mexico and LNG exports remaining strong. It's a vastly different picture than what we're seeing in crude oil demand. Demand in the continental U.S. has generally been above the three year historical average in comparable weeks for natural gas. We have strong demand in the power sector, industrial was down slightly, res comm has held in very well despite mild weather, and LNG and Mexico exports have driven demand up over the prior year averages. One thing I do want to make sure you can see in this chart on the left is that the week-over-week behavior demand is a seasonal impact. The sequential declines have been - we've seen in weekly demand since January are the normal behavior we see when we move out of cold winter months and into the shoulder months of more temperate weather before the heat of summer starts to drive electrical load due to air conditioning demand. So we only mentioned that we know a lot of that that is very obvious to most people, but we certainly seen a lot of headlines coming out talking about lower natural gas demand and if you read through the headlines that go with that, you will notice that a lot of that is just normal demand associated with weather. Looking at the right hand side, which reflects flow data right off our gas transmission systems, we continue to see normal behavior with deliveries generally staying within the normal range when compared to last year. And while the EBITDA generated by a regulated gas transmission systems' is not impacted by volume fluctuations, thanks to the fully contracted capacity payments we received. We do monitor these volumes to get a sense for demand in the markets we serve, and the gathering volumes that serve those markets as well. As we have consistently said over the last several years, our business is driven primarily by natural gas demand. Current and near term future demand drives revenue on our gathering and processing systems as the various sources of U.S. production meet this demand and long term demand growth drives the opportunity to expand our gas transmission system. As more and more people see the benefits of consuming low cost abundant clean natural gas, end users will continue to invest in gas consumption and the transportation capacity need to access this reliable energy source. We will keep monitoring demand as we plan for the rest of this year and '21 and beyond, one thing we are seeing right now is extremely low international prices for LNG. European gas storage is very high right now after an even milder winter than what we experienced during the U.S. and while this may affect demand for U.S. gas over the summer, we see this pricing issue as cyclical and not secular. As we look further out, we remain extremely confident in U.S. natural gas production as a low cost supply to world hungry for reliable, abundant clean energy and in our business strategy to provide long term value based on that demand for natural gas. So now let's turn to some of the key areas we believe investors are focused on now, and how our business works through the lens of some of these risks and opportunities we know our investors are trying to assess. I’ll start with the market environment we find ourselves in now. I won't dive into all of the current and extending drivers of the oil price collapse, but we'll lay out the distinctions between the drivers of low natural gas price and the drivers of low oil price. Low natural gas prices have existed here for a few years now driven by supplies growing even faster than the growing demand we have enjoyed. The latest oil price collapse we've seen has been primarily driven by tremendous demand destruction. When you are in the business of moving these commodities, this distinction is everything. Confidence in abundant, clean and low cost natural gas supplies have driven consistent demand growth of 24% over the last three years, and that growth in demand will continue. On the other hand, lower demand for refined products ultimately means lower oil prices and lower volume. So what does that mean for domestic supplies? With the oil price collapse, we expect associated gas from oil producing basins like the Permian, Bakken, Scoop/Stack and Eagle Ford to decline, and we expect gas directed basins to gain market share. As producers began shutting in some flowing oil production to avoid filling storage and selling their production at unacceptable prices, we'll see reductions in associated gas accelerate. This decline will continue as the void in drilling and completions of oil wells begins to show the underlying decline in the large number of new oil well supplying the market. At the same time, as I mentioned earlier, we see natural gas demand has remained strong. And over the long term we expect that strength to continue. So what does this all mean, this rapidly changing market environment, what does this all mean for Williams? We do expect the gas gathering we do in the oil basis to be impacted by the oil price shock both near term shut-ins and longer term, the impact of lower prices for longer that will likely reduce capital available for U.S. shale oil production. The largest impact will be the reduced growth in the Permian and DJ Basins business, including the associated NGL volumes from the DJ. In 2019, the Permian DJ and Mid-continent basins were approximately 2% of our EBITDA just to keep those declines in perspective. The Eagle Ford is our single largest onshore Shell oil facing business at 5% of our 2019 EBITDA. We recently renegotiated the contracts with Chesapeake, our largest customer in Eagle Ford from a cost of service contract with rates that vary by year as volumes vary to a fixed fee contract which has a minimum volume commitment. This contract which was negotiated and executed in late 2019 became effective on January 1, of 2020 and it is designed to insulate us from volume fluctuations in the Eagle Ford. It also includes language which makes it abundantly clear that our contractual rights are linked directly to the minerals in the ground. Our Gulf of Mexico business is driven primarily by oil economics and is not immune to oil price risk. However, it is uniquely positioned versus onshore oil business. The deepwater business requires a very long term view given the multi-year multi-billion dollar investments required by producers to bring on very large scale reserves. The customer base is primarily international integrated oil companies, or large scale independence with significant expertise in the deepwater for whom existing assets provide synergies for future investments. With regards to future project opportunities, our producer customers in the offshore business will clearly be looking at oil prices, but it will be with a long term vision for where prices will be in the next three to four years. Williams will be impacted in the near term by some Gulf of Mexico production shut-in from small producers, but we do not expect that to be a significant volume. Also remember that producers bear significant fixed costs when operating deepwater production, most of which don't go away during the shut-in. So therefore we expect offshore shut-ins if they do occur to be some of the shortest duration, oil production shut-ins that we'll see here in the U.S. Along with the dramatically lower oil and NGL prices has come well deserved concern about our counterparty exposure with our customers, so let's focus for a moment on our customer base and the practical risk of not getting paid for the terms of our contracts. From our perspective it's very important to look beyond a simple credit rating breakdown and really look at the services being provided and the essential nature of the assets that we utilize to serve our customers. We think about our counterparty exposure much differently in the GMP business than we do in the gas transmission business. Counterparty credit quality is extremely important in any long haul business, where there are a number of different ways to get gas to a wide variety of markets, and gas transmission you rely heavily on the ability of your counterparty to pay you for the capacity over a very long term that the assets were designed and built for. We watch our gas transmission counterparty exposure carefully and have built a portfolio of contracts dominated by demand pool investment grade rated counterparties. Customers who need to have capacity is able to meet their peak demands, rather than customers who are trying to find a market for their gas. The gathering and processing business due to the universe of EMP companies includes smaller, less capitalized counterparties. These are very accomplished operators. These are the independent producers who have led the charge in creating energy independence here in the U.S., but often with lower credit ratings or no credit ratings at all. We do value high credit quality amongst all our counterparties and closely monitor the credit quality of our portfolio of GMP customers. But we also mitigate the credit risks we necessarily take on them at GMP business with scale and with wellhead or well pad connectivity. A large scale system that connects directly into producers reserves is difficult to reproduce, and our customers will honor our contracts and utilize our services, even when they're in financial distress. We have a strong track record of seeing the contracts for our wellhead gathering services survive, a wide range of corporate actions or restructuring processes, even bankruptcy and by our producing customers. In fact, we see the real risk of gathering gasp for financially distressed counterparties as a risk to growth rather than a risk to the revenue we earn on the flowing reserves. A distressed customer will not be able to fund the sort of drilling capital necessary to grow their production and our gathering revenues. So we hear a lot of concerns out there about bankruptcy but I would just tell you that the real issue for us is we've got whole lot of great acreage dedicated to us and what we want our adequately capitalized customers being able to drill on the great debt acreage that's dedicated to us and that's the real impact that we see during this financial distress. The picture we have been painting through this discussion so far into our financial performance is one of stability and predictability. That stability and predictability is a bedrock on which we build a conservative financial policy and capital allocation process that drives a return of value to our shareholders. We pay a very attractive dividend based on our $0.40 quarterly dividend which annualizes to $1.60 and yesterday afternoon closed at $19.13. That $1.60 dividend offers an 8.4% yield. This very attractive yield is well covered and WMB is one of the very few large infrastructure players that is also more than covering its growth capital spending as well. We have been reining in our growth capital very tightly over the last couple of years, as we've been working hard to improve our balance sheet. Many of our peers have talked about significant cuts to CapEx budgets, as they are now scrambling to cut this year and we've already travelled much of this road making significant cuts to our capital spending year-over-year for the past several years. In fact, our total capital expenditures growth and maintenance in 2019 was $2.4 billion, which was 40% below the 2018 total capital expenditures of $4.2 billion and with our latest thoughts on growth and maintenance CapEx here for 2020, we are now positioned to see another 40% reduction in total capital here in 2020. Our stable cash flow and disciplined capital spending have driven down our leverage, maintaining a strong flexible balance sheet and investment grade credit metrics is very important to us both financially and operationally. We believe in investment grade credit rating keeps our cost of debt down, but also reduces the risk of the company in the eyes of equity investors, both current and prospective equity investors. And while we focus mostly on the long term positioning of the company on this slide, I do want to reiterate our 2020 guidance ranges remain unchanged but we do expect to come in at the lower end of the range for adjusted EBITDA both on growth and maintenance CapEx as well. Regarding adjusted EBITDA coming in towards the lower end of our guidance range, we see that, being at the lower end of the range is being driven by lower than expected volume from the oil basins that we talked about earlier, primarily the DJ Basin, and the much lower NGL margins we're currently experiencing. We have not assumed prolong shut-ins in our oil basins, nor have we assumed increased dry gas drilling. We also on the other hand, we don't assume that we will continue to enjoy the same degree of low maintenance and repair expenses that we enjoyed in the first quarter of this year. And so as we think about the - here for 2020, a number of variables laying out there as we talked about one pro long shut-ins, I would tell you so far we see those as fairly minimal but we do want to make sure you understand we are not expecting a wide scale or pro long shut-ins, in our guidance right now. We also as we mentioned don't have the uplift that we might see in the last half of the year as well. Moving on to CapEx expectations, we've been able to reduce CapEx due to lower than budget performance on our projects and execution, as well as lower producer activity, which has reduced the need for CapEx in a lot of our gathering operations. As a result, we now could see total capital spending come in below the low-end of our guidance range. However, as previously mentioned, we only had a very small amount of capital in our forecast for our NESE project since we were not going to allocate capital to the project until we received necessary permits. We remain confident that NESE will ultimately be approved and if this happens as soon as June, the other reductions mentioned will allow us to still be at the low end of our CapEx guided range. So just to clarify that, we do expect - we would be still at the low end of the range for CapEx if we are fortunate enough to get NESE moving here as soon as June. On the other hand, if we don't, we actually would come in below the current CapEx guided range that we have out there. In closing, we believe our business is very well positioned to benefit from continued demand growth in natural gas over the long term, and that our strong competitive position and conservative financial model makes us a resilient business that can deal with near term challenges in the market, while positioning us very well for the long term and the strong growth that's ahead. So with that, let's go ahead and transition to our Q&A session, and thank you again for joining us today.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Jeremy Tonet: Thanks for all the detail in the call this morning and just wanted to kind of build on some of those points there. I guess with your producer conversations I mean, it seems like natural gas prices, further out in the curve continues to climb here. And so, I'm just wondering if you could share a bit more on what type of operating leverage you think Williams would enjoy as gas prices improve and producer activity kicks up in response to what we've seen here?
Alan Armstrong: Yes Jeremy, thank you. We know we have a wide variety of rates out there in the market. And so it kind of, obviously depends on where that volume is produced. And so I think, that's very dependent. The good news is I think, as we've demonstrated in the Northeast, we've got a very strong leverage where our costs that we've been able to really keep down even as volumes have grown. And so, if we see a lot of that growth occur in the Northeast, it's going to continue to be limited capital and limited incremental operating costs. So pretty good operating leverage to that. In the Haynesville, that's probably the other area that we would expect to respond here in the near term. And the operating leverage there is pretty similar. We've got, pretty low incremental operating costs, so a lot of revenue will drop to the bottom line there. So as we've said in the past, the rates out there on the dry gas gathering are in the $0.30 to $0.50 range. And so that's kind of what you can pick quite a bit of that from the bottom line in terms of the gas volumes that we have. If we happen to see some of that come through on across rich gas or processable gas, which we are seeing right now occur in the West Virginia, we're seeing volumes going up pretty nicely there. We obviously get a much higher margin on that just because we're offering additional services to that. So I would say that the lower operating leverage that we have is in the dry gas and little bit higher operating leverage against the rich gas or the process.
Jeremy Tonet: That's helpful color thanks. And just want to kind of pivot if I could to Regional Energy Access. Seems like other pipes in the Northeast are continuing to face challenges getting built here. And just wondering what you could share with regard to how that project is developing and what opportunities to do this?
Micheal Dunn: Good morning, Jeremy, this is Michael. Regional Energy Access continues to move toward a first filing early summer. We're still seeing a bit of a slowdown in the commercial execution of our final proceeding agreements and it directly attributable to COVID-19, and our inability to meet directly with the customers. But we are still executing those and we have gained momentum on that project and continue to. And just as a reminder, the majority of those facilities are in Pennsylvania. We think that's why we have a significant benefit and opportunity to get our project permit approvals in a timely fashion. And just as a reminder that we only have one facility that we project to be outside of Pennsylvania, and that's electric driven compressor station in New Jersey, which we feel like we won't have any permitting issues at all. So commercial activity is still underway, but we are in the midst of preparing the pre-filing documents and expect to have those and purchasing in this summer.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is open.
Colton Bean: Alan I think he just noted that you're seeing some decent trends there across the rich gas exposure in West Virginia and thinking about the system more broadly can you update us on what you're seeing across some of your more NGL exposed areas and condensate particularly?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, Michael will take that.
Micheal Dunn: Yes, good morning Colton. We are seeing some concerns early on in regard to condensate production where the producers were chasing condensate earlier this year. I think if you go back and look at the Southwestern call occurred a few days ago, they feel like they're not going to have any shut-ins due to any condensate issues for the month of May. And that's obviously good for us. We're large customer of theirs - they are large customer of ours there in West Virginia. So we're pleased to see that announcement from them. There are definitely challenges in some of the areas that Eagle Ford certainly has some condensate challenges there. We are working with our customers there to find opportunities. We've had a team working on condensate opportunities to store condensate for customers. And we have opportunities to be able to do that for them, if they so choose to do that at our facilities around the country. And so, we've given a lot of options to our customers if they want to continue to produce and move those condensate volumes into our potential storage opportunities for them. On the NGL side, we aren't seeing as much pressure on the producers from a production standpoint as you would on the condensate side. So, we are seeing some increase. I think prices are actually moving higher and NGL prices are continuing to move stronger from where they were over the last several weeks. And so we’re not seeing as much pressure there as we are going to condensate that.
Colton Bean: Got it, appreciate that. And then just on the National Grid, so I think you all commented that you think you could see approval there for Northeast supply as early as June? So I guess in terms of key hurdles to watch, what exactly is it that you guys are evaluating and then if we weren't to see approval by June, is the in-service, potential step change into 2022 or what sort of impacts would you expect there?
Micheal Dunn: Yes, I'll take that as well. So National Grid concluded their public comment meetings. They went virtual on the majority of those and had a two week extension in the deadline. So those concluded on May 1. And I think the resounding thing became very clear there is NESE project is the only opportunity for them to meet their long-term solutions. We recall the settlement agreement that they had with the state requires them to provide a long-term solution to the state by June and that long-term solution had to be in service by fall of 2021. And it's abundantly clear that NESE is the only opportunity to be able to do that. But the one thing I do want to mention, we watched the demand very closely across the U.S. and we certainly watched it very closely in the New York metropolitan area for natural gas. And we've seen virtually no impact due to the COVID-19 situation and if you weather normalize the demand up there and looks like a normal year. It's been a very warm year in January, February and March in the Northeast, April was about normal. And so when you weather normalize those demand picture across those four months, it looks just like a normal year for gas demand. So we see no impact there. It certainly wouldn't factor into any decisions that our customers would be making there. And you could make the argument that maybe commercial construction possibly could slowdown. But we do think from a long-term standpoint, natural gas demand is going to be increasing in the New York metropolitan area, just because of the amount of conversions of fuel oil still need to occur there, as well as the growth in infrastructure that's been built in New York City. We'll also say that, through this public comment process where we're prosecuting our permit, we've seen over 16,000 positive public comments come in to note both New York and New Jersey to support our project. There's more than 80 elected officials and community organizations that also support the NESE project that didn't make these public comments on the record. The upcoming deadlines on the 401 certifications that we have are May 16 in New York and June 5 in New Jersey. And so that's really the key markers that you should be watching out for here. And to answer the last part of your question, if we do not get those approvals in May and June for both New York and New Jersey, we'll have to go back and reevaluate with our customer what the expectation is there. But we certainly could refile those permits as we've had in the past and have those turned around fairly quickly in New York and New Jersey choose to do so.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gabe Moreen with Mizuho. Your line is open.
Gabe Moreen: Alan if I could just ask it seems like also producers are taking a different approach to their outlook for Nat gas prices next year and how much they've been willing to head to the 21 strip yet. Can you talk about maybe the insight you've got in terms of some of the private producers, whether it's Encino and the Utica or some of the producers are under Haynesville acreage and how they're treating 21 and whether they're - and what their outlook might be for having rigs and how soon that might happen?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, I would say, there's a lot of people kind of still licking their wounds a little bit from the low price environment that we seen here in the first quarter and that's not forgotten easily. And I think they want to make sure that they're going to be very disciplined around the capital and allowing themselves to make decent returns. And so, I'm not speaking to anyone producer here, just to be clear, but I do think that the very low prices that they've had to endure on both the gas and the NGL prices in some of these locations, has got them really thinking hard about how to move forward. And frankly, I think they see the fundamentals perhaps being even stronger with that kind of cost discipline to the degree that takes hold across space, which it seems to be frankly, that with the fundamentals will drive even higher prices. And so you look this morning, I think the January 2021 prices were up to 320 for January 2021. So they may be exactly right on that and thinking that the fundamentals will continue to drive those prices up. So I think they're really going to make sure that they're not just doing this to turn bits, but to make really good value for their shareholders and their owners and - they're going to be patient make sure that the price really allows them to make some decent returns. And frankly, that's the kind of discipline I think that'll make the space healthy over time.
Gabe Moreen: Understood, thanks Alan. And then maybe John if I could get sort of updated thoughts from you and where you're thinking about debt markets now clearly things have improved quite a bit since a couple of weeks ago and the update call. And I guess just your thoughts around taking some of off the revolver when you put those earlier maturities on the revolver?
John Chandler: Yes, no those rates have as significantly improved. And a little painful from where they were in February. It is incredibly low, right, but as we look today, the rates are very attractive for Williams and for Transco. And so it's, we'll watch the markets and we feel like there's a good opportunity. We'll certainly take advantage of that and try to get some off of our revolver. We still have 1.7 billion on a revolver, but I'd say we also have $700 million in cash. So we've got a very strong liquidity position our revolver again is $4.5 billion and doesn't mature until 2023. So we could be patient, but just to be clear, rates are attractive and our bond spreads that really traded in the last couple of weeks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kania with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Alex Kania: Just a question, I guess just on Gulf of Mexico. First, I guess just thinking about making sure that we understand how the sensitivities and volumes work, it sounds like again, you feel like from large producers, there's not going to be a big move. But again, just wondering if volumes do move does that directly impact your bottom line or is there some protection within Teva contracts work on the cost base basis? And then related to that maybe, if there's any impact on capital related to I guess the Whale delay that Shell announced a couple days ago. And second question is just thoughts on the NWP 12 permit? Do you use that typically for your construction activities, is that going to cause any complications for any planning that you plan on gathering or transmission over the next few months until we get some resolution on that? Thanks.
Alan Armstrong: Yes, I'll take the first question there broadly on the deepwater and then have Michael answer the Whale and NWP 12 questions. On the deepwater for the most part, there are some MVCs and some fixed payments out there, but for the most part, because a lot of MVCs are so much below the actual volumes that people are sitting at today. You should consider our deepwater business to be pretty well driven by volume so both on the oil and the gas side. So I would - it's not that complicated out there for the most part, it's saying that there are places like the Northwood and places like that, that were true up on an annual basis, but you wouldn't see that in a quarterly basis. So anyway, so newer assets like Northwood tend to have those and the older assets those MVCs have, we've gotten our capital back in those MVCs or those fixed payments have gone away, just like Gulfstar. As we mentioned the fixed payments on that terminated the majority of the fixed payments terminated in May of last. So Mike if you take the Whale and NWP.
Micheal Dunn: Sure Alan thanks. On Whale, we actually before all of the oil price shock occurred. We had actually placed some orders for some equipment and we've got more favorable timing terms on those orders and so our capital would actually be reduced to this year. It's just the timing issue for the most part, though prior to any announcements came from the Whale customers. Since the Whale customers have made their announcements, we've had conversations with them. They've not asked us to change course in any fashion with regard to our current undertaking of engineering, and procurement of materials to support their project, although they have announced the NESE delay. So right now it's a steady issue goes in regard to our performance under our reimbursement agreement with those Whale customers. And on the Nationwide 12 question, as you all probably are well aware of the Keystone XL pipeline in Montana, has suspended authorization of the Nationwide toll permit for that project, and it certainly is something that we're all looking at across the industry. The core engineers has stated they're not authorizing any new projects right now under the Nationwide 12, but they've not shutdown any projects that we know and certainly none of ours that were being performed under the nationwide 12. We don't think this is going to be a significant issue to Williams and for example in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, they don't even use the Nationwide 12 Permits, they're certainly not an impact at all. There anywhere that we were going to use those this year on new optimizations. It was just small pad connections and our gathering systems for the most part, and we could pivot to a different permitting team for those and achieve our permitting goals for those projects. And so as of now, we've got no project shutdown. And every core engineer's office that has jurisdiction over our permits, each one of those jurisdictions, we've had conversations with them and they said they have no intention of shutting down any projects that are currently underway with Nationwide 12 Permit.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson with SunTrust. Your line is open.
Tristan Richardson: Really appreciate all the commentary this morning. Just a follow-up question on the Northeast G&P I mean, with the volumes we've seen in 1Q and your commentary, perhaps suggesting even the rich gas volumes remain resilient. We think about the 1.4 billion in EBITDA number you've talked about in the past, should we think about is still a relevant number in the current environment in Northeast G&P?
Micheal Dunn: This is Michael I’ll take that. I think we had temporary expectations on growth. They're coming into this year last year that's why you saw significant reduction in our capital. But if you do a run rate on the Northeast I think we were at 370 EBITDA this quarter. And we would expect to see some continued flat performance if you will through the majority of the Northeast PA production areas, as everyone knows Cabot's talk about going into maintenance mode with flat production for the year. We're seeing some growth in the Bradford still our cost of service agreements up there. And we do think some of the areas in West Virginia will be a more of a bright spot in the coming several quarters probably towards the end of the year and next year. And so, I think we do have some line in sight ultimately to be able to get to that 1.4. It might be a little bit delayed from where we were hoping, but we had those expectations input coming into this year.
Tristan Richardson: Helpful, thank you. And just a brief follow-up, with respect to Bluestem with the fractionator online now, can you see contributions from any of that capacity today, or any fractionation contributions would come when Bluestem comes online for the next year?
Micheal Dunn: Yes, assuming that Frac 7 and Targa is controlled is taking product, we will get revenue from that. So it is - as we understand, and so we will get revenue from that prior boosting coming online.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Your line is open.
Shneur Gershuni: Thank you for the extended update today, and a lot of my questions have been asked to answer, but maybe to follow up on Gabe's question a little bit here, but in a different way. When we think about the producers in the Northeast, a lot of them have - are not really well capitalized coming into this excluding Targa, which I realize is a very important customer of yours. Are we sure that the higher gas prices ensures that we get higher volumes or a higher volumetric opportunity for Williams. Was there a chance that they sit there and just sort of take their production ideas and enjoy the high prices and not accelerate CapEx, just to kind of try to think about how we should think about it from a volumetric perspective in '21, just sort of given the starting place from where the producers work?
Alan Armstrong: Are you speaking just to…
Shneur Gershuni: Northeast.
Alan Armstrong: Well, I would say as you would think a variety of producers and financial drivers out there, some are well hedged, and are taking advantage of the cost low - available cost structures to them out right now and growing very successfully and not really missing a beat. On the other hand, you have players for us like Chevron up there that has announced the sales process, and kind of pull back on their drilling operations. So, that's probably the extreme to that. But as I mentioned earlier, I do think that some producers are going to sit back and wait to see how firm these prices will get. They keep moving in the right direction. And I think they're waiting to - I think they believe that the fundamentals are on their side. And so if you translate all of the negative discussion around oil and shut-ins and demand destruction, if you believe that strongly, then you have to turn around and believe that gas is going to have a big call on these gas corrected basins. And so I think that's what you're seeing and some of them having quite a bit of confidence in fundamentals and are waiting to make sure that those fundamentals show up in the way of price where they commit to anything, but be clear, these are all - there is not - I can't point to a large producer that we deal with out there that I don't have quite a bit of respect for the way they think about this. They just have different motivations and drivers out there in front of them. But they all I would say are always in the case of planning. So they're not sitting back right now, even though it may appear that way. They're not sitting back on their haunches and not planning for what looks like opportunity for growth in the future. But I think they're only going to pull those triggers when they're confident that these prices are something that they can lean into. So I would say what we are seeing pretty visibly is a lot of planning for growth, but not necessarily a commitment to that growth just yet. And but I think there is a lot of belief in the fundamentals that exist out there. And again, it's kind of hard to believe in all the carnage on the oil side and not believe that on the pool on the gas side.
Shneur Gershuni: Maybe as a follow-up on that. Maybe this is difficult to speculate about. But do you see some scenarios where maybe some of them - just given how difficult capital access is right now for them, that they potential to JV and do like drill co JVs and so forth with private equity is? Do you kind of see that is a potential avenue for some of them?
Alan Armstrong: I think more of that - they are not necessarily the Northeast producers. I think we'll see more of that in the Haynesville area where there is a lot of easy acreage to go hit a lot of private companies that are even less capitalized in some cases. But they've got some very - it’s not a whole lot of risk involved in the development there, and certainly not a lot of risk in getting the gas to the markets. And so I think we'll see a little more of that kind of activity like these teams.
John Chandler: One thing I do want to go back to the question I was asked earlier about Northeast EBITDA coming in, I believe the question was about $1.4 billion. And I would tell you, coming in earlier this year, we felt like, perhaps could come in under that level, just because Cabot was going back to maintenance mode and we saw Chevron signaling, they were going to slow some of their activity down. But again, remember we had a really good first quarter and our volumes are really good, really strong. And of course, things are starting to look better for the Northeast in the latter half of the year as well. So as we look at it today, we do believe we'll be operating above $1.4 billion in the Northeast for the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Praneeth Satish with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Praneeth Satish: Just in the Haynesville, can you maybe just give us a breakdown on the customer mix there? How much is Chesapeake versus privates, and then in terms of potential growth in the Haynesville if it does occur, would you expect it to come more from the public or private producers in the region?
Alan Armstrong: I'm going to have Chad Zamarin, who has been dealing with a lot of the opportunities out there to address them.
Chad Zamarin: In the Haynesville, Chesapeake still about 70% of our volume. So if you've looked back about three years that would have been a much higher percentage even than that. So we've seen pretty rapid growth in third party volumes from primarily a private producers. Fine is one of those producers [indiscernible] as a producer that's not private, but we've been picking up additional activity province. To the question kind of earlier, we have seen those producers in the Haynesville taking advantage of the current pricing environment and extend their hedging and to Alan's point around access to capital for drilling in the Haynesville, ability to hedge out. Now, many of these producers are hedging more than 24 months out and those Haynesville wells are very much front end weighted from a value recovery perspective. And so those Haynesville producers have a pretty, pretty good opportunity to lock in their production plans over the next couple of years. So the recovery of kind of the back end of the price curve is really created a very stabilizing effect for ongoing development. In Haynesville, we actually think we'll see additional growth as a result.
Praneeth Satish: Right, thanks. And then can maybe just rank order, which of your oil directed regions would get hit the hardest from potential shut-ins? And then how many quarters would you expect the settings to persist for, is this a one quarter, two quarter for the balance of 2020?
Micheal Dunn: Yes, this is Michael, I will take that. From a [indiscernible] Eagle Ford is probably the highest at least in our acreage area because of the condensate that the customers are producing there, but we are protected by an MVC, for example, on the Chesapeake contracts, so even if the volumes do decline, we do have an MVC protection under letting them which we think would be very strong for us from a protective revenue there regard to that. So I'd say the Eagle Ford is probably the highest, the DJ is probably one as well, where they're also seeing some of things like gravity production, they are probably condensating oil that they're kicking in the DJ. So we would also have some months of work shutting risks there. Gulf of Mexico, you've got some of the smaller independence in the Gulf of Mexico. That's probably next on the list. But so far, we've not seen any of the large producers in the Gulf shut-in any production.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, I will now turn it back over to Mr. Armstrong for closing remarks.
Alan Armstrong: Okay, well, thank you all very much for joining us this morning. A great quarter. We're really excited to see the execution that we had in the quarter and we think the fundamentals are very strong for our business in the way we're positioned out in front of us. So thanks again for joining us this morning.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-20 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Williams Companies Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2019 Earnings Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn today’s call over to Mr. Brett Krieg, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Brett Krieg: Thanks, Carey. Good morning, and thank you for your interest in The Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon, we released our earnings press release and the presentation that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily. Joining us on the call today are our Chief Operating Officer, Micheal Dunn; our CFO, John Chandler, our General Counsel, Lane Wilson; and our Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development, Chad Zamarin. In our presentation materials, you will find the disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. And these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today’s presentation materials. And so with that, I’ll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong: Okay, great. Thanks, Brett. Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we discuss our fourth quarter and the full-year 2019 financial performance and our key investor focus areas. So let’s move right into the presentation and take a look at our strong year-end performance. Here on Slide 2. 2019 was another year of strong predictable growth and solid execution. This is now the third year in a row we have exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range on key financial metrics. This highly reliable and predictable performance is the result of continuously improving execution by our operating teams on many fronts: capital project execution, reliable on-time services for our customers, safety performance, environmental stewardship, capital discipline and operating efficiency, all of these efforts circle around a deliberate strategy to deliver long-term shareholder value by accomplishing the following. First is our focus on being the very best at providing infrastructure services for natural gas as an economically and environmentally superior energy source. Second is to reduce direct commodity margin exposure and basis risk to focus on highly predictable fee-based revenues. And certainly, the reason that our business has become so predictable is largely focused on that one. And we’ve very much achieved what we’d hoped to accomplish in terms of that reduction. And third is to deliver the balance sheet to provide flexibility and unquestioned financial stability. These efforts grow predictable record results in 2019 across key performance metrics. The company produced record annual adjusted EBITDA of $5.02 billion and growth of 8% over the record 2018 performance of $4.64 billion. Distributable cash flow, also record grew by an impressive 15% to an amount of $3.3 billion and this financial performance was driven by continued growth in the very large volume of natural gas the company gathers from a diversified array of both supply basins and a variety of producing customers. While our record average daily gathering volume of 12.9 Bcf a day for the full-year of 2019 was a 5% growth overall, and it was 15% in the Northeast. In fact, in the fourth quarter, that – on that comparison, we saw volume growth of over 10%, up to 13.3 Bcf per day and for the whole gas – against the whole gas gathering portfolio and a 12% growth in the Northeast G&P segment. So the company also continued to realize growth in the interstate gas transmission, driven by a 11% growth in the long-term firm contract capacity on Transco, the nation’s largest and fastest-growing pipeline system. Turning now to Slide 3. I want to take a brief moment to acknowledge some of the key performance metrics we are using to manage the business and to measure our continuous improvement efforts. First of all, our financial performance, along with the company’s disciplined approach to capital investment and successful efforts to monetize assets, brought our leverage ratio under 4.4 times, which was – is significantly inside our originally guided leverage ratio of under 4.75 times. So we are certainly well on our way to reaching our target of 4.2 times in 2021. Also, as an enterprise, we are focused on improving our return on capital employed, or ROCE, while it is only a snapshot and it’s certainly not a perfect measure of long-term returns, measuring the year-to-year improvement keeps us very focused on preserving our precious capital and a 13% compounded annual growth rate on the very large capital base the company has employed is great improvement. But we look to continue bringing our ROCE up with our continued strong discipline around capital investment. Our operating margin ratio shows how much of our gross margin gets to the bottom line after operating and administrative costs. And to improve on that, we have to utilize our scale to grow gross margin faster than our unit cost. We have improved this metric even in a slowing growth environment and dwindling commodity margins and target continued improvement here through both cost management and growth. And finally, our total recordable incident rate is a measure of our safety performance among several safety metrics we monitor. There has been a great improvement in our total recordable incident rate over the last several years, as our safety culture continues to improve and our employees find and eliminate hazards from the workplace and protect the public, while operating our assets. Every employee has full Stop Work Authority and they – and when they recognize the safety issue and are empowered to make it right. Our employees own this metric and are responsible for this great improvement, and I’m pleased to report on that group’s improvement here. And, in fact, in 2019, our TRIR came in at 0.55, which is well below the toughest of industry benchmarks. And finally, all this discipline and focus has culminated to drive an impressive 25% CAGR on our EPS from 2017 through 2019. Now, we’re going to move on to Slide 4. And here on Slide 4, we provided a clear view of our full-year and fourth quarter 2019 financial performance relative to 2018 period. And as you can see, we continue to enjoy steady growth across our key measures, despite the impact of asset sales and much lower commodity margins on a full-year basis. We covered some key annual performance metrics on the previous slide. But on this slide, from an annual perspective, I’ll just point out that growth in our GAAP cash flow from operations of 12% is right in line with the adjusted EBITDA in DCF performance we’ve already discussed and the per share metrics, both DCF per share and adjusted EPS, showed equal or stronger growth with DCF per share up 14% and adjusted EPS up with that 25% again this year. Another key piece of 2019 performance is the improvement in an already strong coverage ratio. Our DCF exceeded our dividends by 1.79 times, or nearly $1.5 billion. This healthy and growing coverage is one of the key items the management team and Board evaluated, as we raised our dividend here in 2020 by 5%. Our impressive performance on leverage was a result of strong operating performance that we’ve already discussed, but also importantly, a disciplined approach to capital investment. In fact, I think, this is one of the great highlights here for the year and for the quarter that our total capital, both growth and maintenance came in under $2.5 billion for 2019, and that was a $1.7 billion, or 40% reduction from 2018 and well below our original guidance on both growth and maintenance. So during 2019, we saw an environmental – sorry, we saw an environment shaping up that would challenge the growth plans some of our producer customers have laid out. We quickly responded to the realities we were seeing in the market by moderating our capital spin versus the budget we had created in late 2019. And, in fact, in the Northeast alone, our total capital spin came in approximately $400 million under that original budget. So against the backdrop of a much lower commodity price environment that we had in 2018, the company produced strong growth in our various earnings and operating metrics and grew dividend coverage, while also realizing over $1 billion in net proceeds from our portfolio optimization efforts and lowering leverage. We are certainly very pleased with the performance that we saw across many of these facets for the full-year. So let’s move on to Slide 5 and discuss the main business drivers of our 4Q 2019 over 4Q 2018 on an EBITDA basis. And so here on Slide 5 now, we compare fourth quarter 2019 to fourth quarter 2018. Adjusted EBITDA increased about 7%, or 8% if you adjust for the bigger transactions that affect the year-over-year comparison. This 4Q growth came at a point in the year when G&P customers had already begun to talk about moderated growth plans and commodity price concerns. Our business showed growth against a tough comp, where the prior year period already included contribution from the Atlantic Sunrise project and the associated gathering volumes that grew dramatically in the fourth quarter of 2018. On the left side of the slide, you can see a net unfavorable $7 million comparability adjustment in the gray bars, which includes removing the adjusted EBITDA from the various asset transactions netted against the favorable addition of 38% UEOM interest. Normalizing for those items, you see adjusted EBITDA growing 8%. Now moving over to the right side of the chart to focus on the financial performance of our continuing business, the Atlantic Gulf increased by $43 million, or 8% from the fourth quarter of 2018, driven by Transco revenue growth from the Gulf Connector and Rivervale South to Market expansion projects. Additionally, for fourth quarter of 2019, results include the increased EBITDA from the Transco rate case settlement. And lastly, while total deepwater gas volumes were up 17%, we saw a decrease in revenues due to temporary producer operational issues on our Gulfstar deepwater platform. And this issue appears to be corrected now, as we’ve seen volumes come back very strong here in first quarter. Also in the Norphlet pipeline, which serves Shell’s deepwater Appomattox field in the Gulf East, continues to see volume increases after flowing first gas on the pipeline in the third quarter of 2019. The next, the Northeast G&P area led the fourth quarter performance with a 19% increase, driven by an increase of about 970 million cubic feet per day, or 12% on higher gathering volumes and higher gathering fees that were associated with expansion projects and escalators that are built into those contracts. Volume increases were led by Susquehanna Supply Hub and Bradford areas, which grew about 600 million cubic feet per day, but all our operated Northeast franchises saw volume growth over this time period So overall, our operated assets in the Northeast continue to see very strong growth across the Board. Finally, even though we enjoyed an impressive 10% increase in total gathering volumes on our remaining assets during the fourth quarter comparison, the West EBITDA was relatively flat, due primarily to $31 million decrease in revenues for our Barnett gathering business. As a reminder from our third quarter results, this decrease was associated with the end of a Barnett MVC or minimum volume commitment and a related step down in deferred revenue amortization. The Barnett MVCs expired at the end of June 2019. And once that happened, the revenue recognition rate of fixed payments that we previously received, began to reflect actual volumes rather than the MVC levels. We also overcame about $13 million of lower NGL margins in the West, which was a 45% decrease from the prior year fourth quarter. Now moving on to Slide 6. We’ll look at the full-year drivers of adjusted EBITDA, which increased about 8%, or over 11% if you adjust for the bigger transactions that affect this full-year comparison. Once again, on the left side, in the gray bars, if you net these out, you’ll see an unfavorable $110 million comparability adjustment from the various asset transactions that occurred during this time period. In 2019, Atlantic Gulf increased 20% and the Northeast was up 19%, driven by the same factors discussed on the previous slide. With the addition of a full-year revenue impact of the Atlantic Sunrise project that came online in early October of 2018, the West is down about 6%, reflecting much lower NGL prices, again, to step down to the Barnett revenue we talked about, offset by growth in the Haynesville, Eagle Ford and DJ basin. Also, our Conway frac and storage business, so that’s our NGL services business, continues to see strong fee revenue growth on the back of NGL production that’s been coming out of both the DJ and the Bakken areas. Our team’s crisp execution drove the growth we continue to show in the Atlantic Gulf in Northeast this year, leading to an overall 8% growth in adjusted EBITDA, despite the significant asset sales, the much lower NGL margins and the one-time step down in the Barnett revenue recognition. So now let’s move on to Slide 7 to address the key investor focus areas. So first, let’s set the scene a bit for 2020. As of January 1, 2020, our Northwest Pipeline business will be managed and reported with our other regulated interstate gas transmission systems in a segment we will call Transmission & Gulf of Mexico. This move will streamline the management and operations of the regulated gas transmission business, combine these businesses into a single reportable segment and providing a clear picture of the very solid performance and predictable cash flow generation of these competitively advantaged assets. The deepwater business will remain in this segment as well and become more important to our EBITDA and ROCE improvement, as growth in this basin is coming back strong. Moving Northwest Pipeline out of the West segment will position the West as a gathering, processing and NGL services business, providing a full suite of midstream services to producers from wellhead gathering all the way through NGL fractionation storage and NGL logistics, especially after the Bluestem NGL project is placed in service later this year. And the Northeast G&P segment will continue to provide all midstream services to the prolific Marcellus and Utica Shale, the largest source of gas production in North America. We will continue to separately report the West and Northeast G&P segments, but combined management will allow us to take better advantage of our tremendous scale and continue to grow our operating margin in this producer-facing business. So I’d like to talk for a moment about how we see the G&P business, both in the near-term and the longer-term and how we have positioned this business. We saw record gathering volumes in 2019 because of continued production successes by our upstream customers, continued growth in natural gas demand and great execution by our teams. But over the last year, robust production growth has outpaced very healthy demand growth and, in fact, demand has grown significantly 21% over the last three years, but domestic production has grown even faster. This imbalance will be a near-term headwind to volumes and EBITDA in the G&P business, as current prices don’t support investment in gas drilling in most cases. So producers, of course, are acting rationally, slowing their capital investment and reducing production growth. While some producers are still forecasting growth, others are focused on keeping production flat, and while lack of recent investment from the upstream will cause declines in other production areas. Some producer balance sheets are stressed. We have already seen some bankruptcy filings. While a customer bankruptcy filing is often disrupted to the normal course of business, it affects various midstream services and contracts very differently. After a very long time in this midstream business, I have seen and experienced many instance of producers’ stress and even bankruptcy, and it’s very clear to me that the most protected service by far is that a wellhead gathering. Wellhead gathering is absolutely essential to any reserves that are going to be produced. Gas could not get to market and cash flow cannot be realized, if wellhead gas gathering is not available. While counterparty credit is important, the physical nature of the service is even better security. We believe this supply demand imbalance is only a near-term concern, as last week’s storage was only a 215 Bcf above the five-year average. We see continued demand growth bringing supply and demand – sorry, supply and demand back in balance. And our long-term strategy is, as we’ve told you many times before, is predicated on the belief that the economic and environmental benefits of natural gas will support continued long-term demand growth, both domestically and internationally and that U.S. domestic supply is well-positioned to grow its share of global demand as well. In the long-term, whatever demand is, supply will grow or decline to meet that demand. And importantly, we expect low-cost gas basins to continue to be the majority of supply that will meet this demand. Associated gas will be important, no doubt. But gas-directed drilling, the source of approximately 65% of today’s gas supply will remain the bedrock of domestic gas production. So we feel confident in the long-term position of our assets and strength of our strategy. But the current price environment is a reality that the market will navigate through here in the near-term, and we have built a very resilient G&P business that can succeed in a wide range of market environments, the dramatic growth we’ve seen over the last three years and the currently challenging price environment for our producing customers. We built this business very intentionally, not by accident. We’ve been at this a long time. And we have moved away from direct commodity exposure and from reliance on marketing and basis spread for profit. We have taken strategic action to broadly diversify our sources of EBITDA, both in the 15 different supply areas, our G&P businesses served and the very wide variety of customers we contract with to provide those services. Another thing I want to point out is that continues to demonstrate our ability to work with a wide range of stakeholders – excuse me, is that the free cash flow produced by our onshore G&P businesses grows dramatically when drilling activity pulls back. Capital spend declined significantly, driving near-term ROCE improvement and tremendous free cash flow growth. So, as we’ve said before, when we do see investment pullback on the drilling side, we see tremendous continued increase in free cash flow growth in the G&P business. Our West is a great example of that. And with regard to our 2020 guidance, we are reaffirming the guidance we provided at Analyst Day in December. While the largest near-term uncertainty is producer activity, we feel comfortable with our 2020 guidance. We will keep a keen focus on capital spending in cost management as the year evolves. And importantly, we are expecting to fund dividends and CapEx with internally generated cash flow, which benefits the company as we look toward our long-term goal of reaching a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 4.2 or lower. And so I just want to comment a little bit more here on the guidance for 2020. First of all, the volumes that we saw in the last-half of the year, certainly in the Northeast and the rates that we enjoyed there, along with what we’re seeing here in January and February in terms of volume, as well as some pretty significant cost cuts that we made late in the fourth quarter of 2019, all compiled to continue to give us confidence on our guidance for 2020, despite the challenging price environment that’s out there today. So now, let’s move on to discuss some of the key issues around our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico business. First, we’re pleased that we have filed our Transco rate case settlement with FERC on December 31. We had only supporting comments from shippers to FERC. Since the rate settlement was filed with FERC, we are pleased to have reached this settlement that we expect to provide $76 million benefit to adjusted EBITDA in 2020 versus our – the last full-year of 2018, which was the last time we had a period with no rate case impact. I also want to point out the successes we’re having on our portfolio of transmission expansion projects. Since September, we placed the Rivervale South and Gateway project in service, both of these were in New Jersey and our Northwest Pipeline commenced service on the North Seattle Lateral expansion. These are two areas with extremely rigorous permitting processes and a politically active vocal minority opposing natural gas infrastructure in short, challenging places to build gas pipelines. Williams continues to demonstrate our ability to work with a wide range of stakeholders in a constructive manner to address these regulatory, political and community concerns, while still getting important infrastructure expansions permitted and built. We plan to continue that track record on the over $3 billion of pipeline expansion projects that are currently in execution mode, and we are achieving key milestones on each of these projects. First of all, Hillabee Phase II is mechanically complete and ready for in-service. The Southeastern Trail project has all of its federal permits and began construction in January of this year, with an in-service targeted by year-end. The Leidy South and Gulfstream, Gulfstream’s sixth expansion now, both received favorable environmental assessments, which is a key step in the FERC certificate process, and each project remained on track for scheduled in-service, Leidy South by the end of 2021 and the Gulf Stream Phase VI expansion by the end of 2022. Our Regional Energy Access project is looking more attractive as time goes on. We have a project that will be between 800 million to 1 billion cubic feet per day. And once we’ve settled on the appropriate size of the project, we’ll move to complete the work to apply for FERC certificate. So we’re in the final stages of tidying up contracts there with our customers. But we do have a project at this point, it’s a matter of the size of that project. We also continue to feel very confident about the prospects for Northeast Supply Enhancements completion, and we look forward to the conclusion of National Grid’s process to assess alternatives for serving Brooklyn and Long Island’s growing energy needs. We continue to see this project as the most reliable, most environmentally beneficial, and most economically friendly alternative. At full load, the fuel oil to natural gas substitution for this project would enable an emissions reduction up – that’s equivalent to taking 500,000 cars off the road. So that, along with the savings to the customers and the residents in those areas, we think are powerful motors for getting that project approved, despite the very noisy minority around that. And we certainly know that this is by far the best solution for the area. Beyond these projects and execution, we continue to make good progress on our backlog of projects in development and we expect several of these to move into execution mode this year. Transco is well-positioned to continue growing our contracted volumes and a well-established corridor serving a large portion of the U.S. population. The forces you see working in the market today are only increasing the competitive advantages of Transco. Low prices continue to incent demand in all sectors, and our access to many geographies and types of demand is unmatched. LNG, industrial, power, residential, commercial are all growing along Transco. Difficulties seen by Greenfield pipeline projects will also benefit Transco in the long run, as Transco has uniquely positioned to meet new capacity demand by expanding along its existing rights of way, which are irreplaceable and unmatched in terms of their proximity to demand. Our Gulf of Mexico assets are similarly positioned against the growing market opportunity. Chevron made a positive final investment decision on their Anchor project in December of 2019. Anchor is near our Discovery’s Keathley Canyon Connector, and we are excited to be finalizing the definitive agreements to provide a full range of services for this very rich gas to be produced by the Anchor project. Anchor represents continued realization of the strategy that supported the original Keathley Canyon Connector investment, capturing new volumes from significant nearby deepwater prospects. Given its proximity and our pre-planning, we will not have to invest any significant capital for this new business. Williams will continue to pursue similar connections as other nearby prospects moved towards FID and first production, including the LLOG-operated Shenandoah, Yucatan, Leon and Moccasin; the Equinor-operated Monument; and the Total-operated North Platte. The Shell-operated Whale project is an even larger opportunity for us. And the services we expect to provide to this dedicated field include gas transportation, gas processing, and importantly, the crude oil transportation as well. Shell continues to make progress on this very large-scale project and expects to make their FID decision this year. And, in fact, in November of 2019, Shell awarded Singapore’s Sembcorp Marine the contract to build the well floater. In addition, Williams has executed a reimbursement agreement with the well owners to cover commitments in 2020 to keep the project on schedule for first production. Williams will secure several long lead items, including the line pipe valves and fittings and the installation contract and ongoing engineering costs. Whale and Anchor would represent a significant increase in the volumes we are currently handling on our consolidated assets. But these are just two of the many opportunities our deepwater assets are competitively positioned to win, as producers in the area are looking to align new development with existing infrastructure to lower cost and decrease time to market. We believe our business is very well-positioned to benefit from continued demand growth in natural gas over the long-term. And that our strong competitive position and conservative financial model makes us a resilient business that can deal with the near-term challenges in the market, while positioning ourselves for the strong growth that’s ahead. So with that, let’s go ahead and transition to our Q&A session. And thank you, again, for your time today.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will be from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.
Alan Armstrong: Good morning.
Jeremy Tonet: Just want to start off with, I guess, some of the strategic transactions that you guys had done in recent years and kind of some sales and JVs. And I was wondering if you could comment, I guess, on the ability to kind of capture those type of opportunities going forward here and what that could mean for hitting kind of the 4.2 leverage ratio that you guys are targeting there? If you’re able to do that, I guess, it’s quicker, or if that doesn’t come together, how long do you think it would take you to hit kind of a target 4.2?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Jeremy, good morning, and thank you for the question. I would just say, first of all, we’re encouraged by the attraction to the kind of assets that we have, which have long histories of cash flow. And so that’s very different than some of the other assets out there that aren’t as well-positioned or more speculative in nature of cash flow. So we think, assets that are stable and have a long history of cash flow are pretty important in this market today. And so we’re very encouraged by that. I would just say, the growth that we have and the continued cash retention that we have in the business, right now, we certainly have our eyes on that 4.2 even without that. But we look at the further transaction as a way to accelerate ourselves towards that, and likely well under that with some – with any significance to the size of those transactions.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it, thanks. And just want to see, I guess, with regards to producer activity and kind of conversations with producers today versus where they stood at the Analyst Day, just wondering if you could help us think through a little bit more on how that has changed? Has it been notable, or not as notable? I guess, I’m trying to think how that translates into guidance. Should we be thinking about the midpoint, or does this kind of bring more towards the lower-end of guidance, or any color you could provide there would be helpful?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Great question, Jeremy, and thanks for asking that. I know that’s an issue on lot of people’s mind. First of all, I would just say, obviously, we have a very diverse business and some things go South on us and some things go positive. If you think back to last year and you think about the commodity price assumptions that we had versus how the year actually wound up, we outperformed as, again, good evidence of how things can go our way to offset other negatives that occurred during the year. So I would just say, we do have a large portfolio. I also, though, as I mentioned in my comments, and I think this is really important for people to understand. If you look, for instance, a lot of concern around the Northeast volumes and if you look and took the combined – took the average of the third quarter and the fourth quarter, you would see that if we – if all we did was repeat that, we would come in above our guidance level for the Northeast for next year, and I know there has been a lot of concern about that. If you took and just took four times the fourth quarter, assuming the fourth quarter held where it was and didn’t see growth – any growth at all, you’d see a – we would beat pretty significantly that guidance that we had laid out for the Northeast. And so that, I would say, combined with a couple of things, one is the fact that our fourth quarter did come in stronger than we were expecting for the Northeast. When we were laying guidance out in – at Analyst Day, we were working off a forecast that was actually exceeded for the fourth quarter. So we’re starting off better than we start than we expected to. Secondly, we’ve seen January and February volumes now. And so we’ve got pretty good confidence about where actual volumes are. And then finally, I would say, we took the cost that we took out that we’ve worked on and planned around during 2019, most of those costs and the impact of those costs actually started rolling out very late in the fourth quarter of 2019. So we will have the benefit of that working with us going into 2020. So I would just say a lot of positive things that are occurring as well with some deepwater production that’s coming on a little faster than we would have expected as well. And volumes actually, again, exceeding where we thought they would be at this point in time when we laid out at Analyst Day. So those are the things that have given us the confidence on our guidance being maintained as we sit here today.
Jeremy Tonet: Got it, great. That’s it for me. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be from Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse.
Spiro Dounis: Good morning, everyone. Alan, I appreciate your comments around G&P being one of the more protective components of the value chain. But I guess, when we think about quantifying a potential impact, is there a way for you to help us quantify how much of your volumes or margin could be considered maybe above market or maybe subject to renegotiation? You’ve been pretty proactive on this front so far. So not sure how much your portfolio is, in theory, still at risk? And if you’re receiving any sort of inbound inquiry from customers to do a blend and extend?
Alan Armstrong: No, we are not – I think we have – we’ve completed all negotiations that anybody has entertained with us on issues right now, particularly with Chesapeake. We settled that in the Eagle Ford, and I think you’ll see this year, I think you’ll see that some of the assumptions that were made by some of the analysts about where that was going are going to be proven very wrong about their assumptions on that for the Eagle Ford. And I would say this in terms of incenting further drilling, we’ve been working pretty actively. Our commercial teams have been working very actively in places like the Haynesville to incent drilling on acreage that’s dedicated to us, but not otherwise being drilled. And that does require us putting an incentive rate out for new drilling, but it doesn’t affect the rates of the existing business. So it’s just a way to attract new drilling dollars against acreage that Chesapeake, for instance, likely wouldn’t get to, if we weren’t out working transactions to help make that happen.
Spiro Dounis: Understood. And then some of the common pushback we received from time to time just around the growth backlog and your ability to spend, I guess, enough to really on those demand pull projects to drive that 5% to 7% growth. And so in other words, I think people are struggling with maybe the scope of these projects and their ability to grow that $5 billion EBITDA base. And so are there opportunities beyond the ones you list that maybe we’re not appreciating, or is G&P actually still an ongoing major contributor to growth even at the lower CapEx levels?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I think, certainly, we had a great year of growth this last year and on an adjustment for both asset sales and margins, where our growth was a lot better than we would have just built into the plan in terms of volumes and fee-based rates last year, a lot of that came from good cost control and really good execution on our projects, bringing them on a little earlier than expected. But I would say, the things that I think the market tends to miss is the things like the DJ basin growth that continues to come on very nicely for us, the Bluestem project coming on for us, the deepwater, which is really coming back, I think, 95% of the rigs now available – floating rigs available are in under contract now in the deepwater. And so we are seeing a lot and expecting a lot coming from that area as well. So, these projects coming on in Transco are pretty powerful, but that’s not what we’re totally dependent on for our growth by any stretch of imagination.
Spiro Dounis: Very helpful. Thanks, Alan.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be from Shneur Gershuni with UBS.
Shneur Gershuni: Hi, good morning, everyone. I’m just wondering if we can revisit the guidance commentary. It sounds to me that you’re fairly confident with the midpoint of your guidance, despite producers being shifting over to maintenance mode at this stage right now. You’ve talked about some of the pushes and pulls, including some of the cost reductions that you’ve put through that that gives you some confidence in that. If this were to – maintenance mode were to maintain itself into next year, are there any more levers that you can pull on the cost side and on the CapEx side to sort of maintain cash flow generation, where you expected to be this year or even potentially driving higher next year?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. We certainly have quite a bit of capital still in plan. And despite the narrative that’s out there, we still have producers that are still pushing ahead with the growing plan, some of those based on hedges that they have and some based on contracts that they have. But we still have some pretty big obligations to keep up with that. I know, the market is – the narrative is very different than what you’re seeing. But in reality, right now, we do have that capital built in, because those producers are moving ahead right now with their activities, as they told us they would. And so – and those come with obligation on their part, so we have to be ready with that capital that’s in there. If that were to change for whatever reason, then that might shift that back. But I think we should be clear that we do have customers continuing to have growth and plan growth in the Northeast. And so, we’ll wait and see, obviously. But right now, it’s getting pretty late in the process for them to be pulling back from those plans that they’ve laid out for the year. And, again, I think a lot of that is based on hedges that they have in place that continue to support those activities. So I don’t want to get into each individual customers, because that’s up to them to lay out their plans and communicate that. But we are responding to the very detailed planning processes that we work within the customers, and we do have capital in the plan to help drive that. And so we – like we had last year, if we need to turn that back quickly, we certainly would. But there is quite a bit of activity that’s going on out there, despite what the narrative is.
Shneur Gershuni: And would you feel that you would have more flexibility on 2021, if this were to maintain itself?
Alan Armstrong: Shneur, you’re breaking up just a little bit. Could you repeat that?
Shneur Gershuni: Sure. Yes, would you have more flexibility on capital and cost structure for 2021, if this trend sort of maintained itself? Obviously, it’s late in the year to be adjusting things for 2020, but I was more thinking about 2021? Do you have a lot of levers that you can still pull there if this environment maintained itself?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, we certainly do. And I think part of our effort to combine the West and the Northeast G&P area is, because we do expect to move. I mean, that area has been growing grammatically. It sounds really easy for us to sit here in our offices and think about the kinds and talk about the growth off of spreadsheet. But the reality is the very, very hard work of our employees and the teams out there trying to keep up with all that growth. They’ve done a remarkable job on that. But it does take a lot of people and it takes – when you’re investing in the capital, it puts a lot of costs onto the operating teams as well, because there’s a lot of change going on that they’re having to manage. So the more mature in a slower growth environment absolutely allows us to go after and increase our operating margin in an area. And us combining our West and our Northeast from a management perspective is allowing us to get after some of that.
Shneur Gershuni: That makes great sense. And as a follow-up question, there’s some new PHMSA rules out. Just wondering if you’ve looked at it and whether this could kick off potentially a rate-based investment cycle, or do you constantly replace pipe and it’s really irrelevant to all these new rules?
Micheal Dunn: Good morning. This is Micheal. I’ll take that one. So on our transmission systems, we’ve been ahead of the curve there for a long time and maintaining our commitment to keeping our assets safe and reliable. And I would say, with the timelines that have been laid out in the new rules, there’s a long runway to compliance there. So I think that’s going to allow not only ourselves, but the industry to manage that pretty well within our maintenance CapEx and our normal OpEx. And so I’m not too concerned about having that drive any additional rate cases.
Shneur Gershuni: Okay. And then one final question, Alan, in your comments about the NESE project, if that were to come to fruition, would that be considered a positive ESG benefit to Williams, given your comments about how many cars you take off the road?
Alan Armstrong: Shneur, I’m sorry, you broke up, again. On which project were you asking that question?
Shneur Gershuni: With respect to NESE, you’d given a whole argument about how many cars who takes off the road and so forth. Just wondering like as we sort of think about ESG, is that something that would be viewed as a positive benefit?
Alan Armstrong: I would certainly hope so. But it’s – I think there’s a lot of uncertainty right now within the rating systems within ESG as to where we get that. We would certainly pronounce that as a win, because it certainly is going to impact the environment, and we certainly would be taking a big part in making that possible. So we certainly would want to talk about that. I would say even – perhaps even larger than that and more directly related to that would be the emissions reduction projects on Transco that we still intend to follow through with some negotiations lingering post the rate case on that. But that would be very dramatic conditions – reductions. And it’s exactly the kind of thing that I think the whole industry certainly, Williams and the whole industry is really capable of reducing emissions dramatically. And if the focus got to be on actually reducing emissions, and not just trying to stop fossil fuels, there’s a lot to be accomplished by the energy industry in terms of emissions reductions, and we expect to play a big part of that.
Shneur Gershuni: All right, perfect. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate the color today, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be from Tristan Richardson from SunTrust. Richardson, your line is live. Please be sure you’re not on mute. Al right. Next question will be from T.J. Schultz from RBC Capital Markets.
T.J. Schultz: Great, thanks. Just first in the Gulf, you’ve got some big projects in 2023, 2024 timeframe. But you also listed off in the prepared remarks a number of projects that may be more near-term potentially. So just any tiebacks assumed in the next year or two, that may be additive to EBITDA, or could offset some slowing G&P growth?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. T.J., great question. First of all, one of the impacts this year will be the growth in Appomattox. So remember, our Norphlet pipeline that we put online last year, that is finally starting to ramp up pretty dramatically as expected. Shell has got some big plans out there on Appomattox, so we’re really excited about that. So even though the construction work is there’s nothing new on that, the actual volume growth on that we expect to be pretty nice this year. On top of that, we tied in two prospects on discovery last year, that were kind of midway through the year. Those will contribute to discovery this year. And then finally, on Gulfstar, Hess’ Esox project was brought online well ahead of schedule. They did a great job of executing on that project, and really made for nice returns for both themselves. And, of course, we make nice fees on that business as well. So that was well ahead of our schedule, our plan as well. There’s also work going on by Kosmos around some of our areas with their Kodiak 2 well that they’re working on right now. So a lot of activity out there, and we’re very fortunate to have a lot of that activity directly around our assets out there.
T.J. Schultz: Okay, great. Just for follow-up, maybe a question for John. You mentioned at the Analyst Day the ability to lower some interest costs. Just what are you seeing today as the ability to lower interest costs for maturities in 2020 and 2021 that get refinanced? And does your guidance assume that you pay down any of that maturing debt with cash, or is that more dependent on asset sales?
Alan Armstrong: That’s more dependent on asset sales. Our guidance assumes a refinancing. But I will tell you, we do have $1.5 billion of our debt maturing in March at a net rate of 5.2%. We could refinance that today, for example, 10-year – at a 10-year rate of 3.3%. So we like the rate environment right now. I will tell you though, we’re holding tight and waiting you. I think it’s no secret that we’ve said we are looking at potential or opportunities for asset sales or selling interest in some of our assets. And I – we don’t want to get in front of that by paying down debt that otherwise could be paid down with cash received through one of those transactions. But I will tell you, our guidance and forecast didn’t include asset sales.
T.J. Schultz: Perfect.
Alan Armstrong: And so we could see interest savings just through the refinancing and obviously much more significant savings if we actually did pay that down through the – through an asset sale. Operator, are you still there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Colton Bean of Tudor, Pickering Holt & Co.
Colton Bean: Good morning.
Alan Armstrong: Good morning.
Colton Bean: Alan, you had mentioned that the volume trends that you are seeing thus far in 2020, can you give us or just frame the activity levels that you’re seeing in some of those primary basins in the West? I know we spent a lot of time in the Northeast, but just how you’re seeing some of the West basins and maybe how that compares to your guidance that you laid out in December?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Micheal, do you want to take that?
Micheal Dunn: Sure. We’re seeing really good results in the Eagle Ford right now coming in, starting the year as well as Haynesville are well ahead of where we thought they would be at this time of year. A little bit challenged in the Wyoming area with the weather. There has been some pretty severe weather in Wyoming this year that’s challenged the Wamsutter area as can typically happen at this time of year. But overall, I think, we’re going to see an increase of what we anticipated so far here in the first quarter from what our forecast should.
Colton Bean: Yes. And so it sounds like the Rockies segment there hasn’t been impacted as much as you would have expected from the natural gas decline?
Micheal Dunn: No, we’re still seeing good production coming out of the Piceance. For example, as Alan talked about earlier, we have some incentive rates out there with our customer, where they are continuing to drill in the Piceance, for example, and getting good results. And our DJ Basin is really performing very well with our Rocky Mountain midstream asset, and so we’re very pleased with that and also capturing the NGLs coming off the processing there that’s going down OPPL pipeline system.
Colton Bean: Got it. That’s helpful. And then just on Leidy South, given some of the moving pieces around producer plans, has there been any discussions with anchor shippers that would impact that Q4 2021 timing, or is that solely contingent on the permitting process at this point?
Micheal Dunn: No, it’s solely dependent upon the permitting process at this point, and we got our environmental assessment earlier than anticipated. So everything looks to be in good shape there, had no conversations at all about slowing that project down with our customers
Colton Bean: Well said. I appreciate the time. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be from Derek Walker from Bank of America.
Derek Walker: Hi, good morning.
Alan Armstrong: Good morning.
Derek Walker: Alan, at the Investor Day, you mentioned a return on invested capital around 12% for projects over the last several years. And as you look to sort of allocate capital to the highest returning projects, it seems like it’s a – for this year, it’s a mix of Northeast, regulated transmission, also some deepwater, where you have some operating leverage. So I guess, relative to that 12% number, do you see at least in 2020 or at least over the next couple of years getting above that 12% number, or is it just going to be a mix, or how should we think about that relative to the 12% number you guys been able to achieve over the last several years?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, great question. Well, first of all, I would remind you that our individual project returns are often – well, in fact, they are well above that number. But that’s working against things like deepwater declines, the declines in basins like the Barnett and certainly deferred revenue step down and things like that. So there is a natural decline in some pieces of the business that those returns have to offset. And – but I would say that our current returns on projects are as good or better than what we’ve had in our previous mix of projects as we’ve tightened the capital budget. Obviously, as you tighten the capital, you’re allocating stuff out. And so I would expect that number to continue to be as good or better than we’ve had on it on an overall number across the whole portfolio.
Derek Walker: Thanks. That’s it for me.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.
Becca Followill: Good morning. Alan, you’ve talked about that the Gulf of Mexico assets are well-positioned to win new business. Can you quantify what kind of EBITDA contribution you would expect over the next several years and what potential and the CapEx associated to get there?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, Becca, good question. A lot of the capital, what we’ll start spending some this year, as we mentioned, on things like Whale. And so in some – versus an Anchor prospect, so I’m just going to give you the kind of ends of the spectrum here. On one hand, pretty significant capital required on Whale now, because the volumes came in a lot larger than we expected to and the producers wanted plenty of flexibility in their capacity. And so that project is going to take more capital. On the other hand, Anchor, we had laid a sled down, when we built that Keathley Canyon Connector, we had put sled down, so that we could make those connections fairly inexpensively and the producers generally are providing that capital. And so in that case – and – but we’re not going to make return on that investment capital. So we’re going to make an existing rate. So in one case, I would tell you, Whale, very significant revenue contributions and EBITDA contributions, that will be in the 10% to 15% just by itself across the whole deepwater. And then things like Anchor would be inside of that, because it’s not – smaller. You also, as we’ve also mentioned, we have Ballymore. It’s a very large prospect. That project that Chevron and their partners are trying to decide if it’s going to be so big, coupled with some other prospects that they have in the area, they have to put a new floater in. If they had to do that, then we would have to invest new capital. Best thing for us is that they find a way to fit that on to blind faith. And that would be pure incremental EBITDA without any new capital. So it’s still in the mix. But I can tell you based on both volume and EBITDA, we think it’s very significant. In terms of the total percentage increase in the deepwater, it is going to be a very significant step up from our current EBITDA levels in the area.
Becca Followill: Alan, I asked the question, because it’s hard for us to give credit for that and evaluation when I have no idea what significant means in terms of EBITDA. I mean – or what the CapEx is to get there?
Alan Armstrong: Agreed. And I think I would just be cautious on our part. What we have laid out, Becca – so I’ll be clear, what we have laid out is that our contracts allow us to get the existing rate on our current systems, plus a 12% after-tax return on any incremental capital that we spend. So that ought to give you a pretty good read, if you take the rate in the Gulf West areas, for instance, you ought to be able to see a pretty nice increase in that. Obviously, we don’t like to spell out exactly what our deals are with our customers. So we’re not trying to be elusive as much as we are respectful of the relationships that we have with those customers. But if you look at the volume, for instance, on Whale and what’s been quoted out there, you’ll see it looks very much like Perdido, which is what we already gather in the Gulf West. And so this would be effectively a doubling of what we get in the Gulf West there today. So it is very significant. But, again, we’re – we’ve got contracts in place that we’re not going to lay out exactly what those are. But if you look at total reserve additions versus our current reserves tied up that are out there, you would see that we’re – on both the Gulf East and the Gulf West that we’re coming close to doubling those connected reserves out there.
Becca Followill: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be from Danilo Juvane from BMO Capital.
Danilo Juvane: Hey, Alan, good morning. Given that we are in an environment of slower EBITDA growth, how are you thinking about managing leverage and dividend growth? And at what point do you see those two converging longer-term?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, great question. Certainly, as we mentioned this year, our coverage came up. And so we certainly – our DCF came in quite a bit stronger than we had planned. And certainly, those are the things that we’re looking at in terms of dividend growth. And certainly, our – as our debt comes down and our interest payments come down, we’ll see continued improvement in that as well. So I would say, the capital allocation question remains out there for us, as we look at some of these larger transactions that we’re going to look to. But the dividend coverage that we have today is allowing us to have excess cash. And so we don’t see anything really changing on that front. But as we get into some of these higher-growth areas as we get into 2022 and 2023 that are not requiring a lot of capital. That’s going to build some pretty nice coverage even further than what we have today. So I’m not going to give you a very direct answer on that, frankly, because that’s a Board level decision in terms of what our growth rate on the dividend is. And I would just say this year, the factors that were considered were how much our DCF had grown and the other uses of capital that were available to us.
Danilo Juvane: Gotcha. I guess, my next question is for John. To the extent that you did have some impairments during the fourth quarter, any details on how much that impacts DD&A going forward?
John Chandler: Yes. So the biggest impairment we had in the fourth quarter was on constitution. We weren’t appreciating that at this point since it’s in construction. So that won’t really have an impact on our depreciation calcs.
Danilo Juvane: Great. Thanks for that. Last one for me. To the extent that the Texas RRC came out with a report on flaring this week, do you guys have any thoughts on some of the commentary that they laid out?
Alan Armstrong: No, I’m sorry. We couldn’t quite hear that on this thing. Could you try that again
Danilo Juvane: Sorry, I was mentioning that the Texas RRC came out with a report on flaring earlier this week. It may have some implications for your systems in Texas. I wanted to see what your thoughts were on what they came out within the report?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, thank you. Yes, we’ve actually been pretty engaged with the Railroad Commission on this issue and have attended several conferences, trying to come up with the right solution. And so, as always, we think the Railroad Commission is going to be very constructive. And work to address the concerns that are out there, I would tell you, the producer community, I think, for the most part, is being very responsible on that issue as well. And we were proud to see Chesapeake in there as one of the top producers in terms of limited flaring. And, of course, we provide those services to them. And so that indicates that our reliability is strong when they’re not having to flare, that tells you our reliability is strong on our service providing. And so we’re proud to see that when our customers are on that list. And so I would just say, we think that there’s going to be an effort to both at the regulatory level and both by producers themselves to continue to reduce flaring. And we think that’s important for the industry. And we are very supportive of that and we’ll continue to push the industry to do the right thing on that front.
Danilo Juvane: Thank you. Those are all my questions.
Operator: Thank you. This is all the time we have for today’s questions. Thank you for your participation at this time. I’d like to turn the call back over to Alan Armstrong for closing remarks.
Alan Armstrong: Great. Thank you. And just would close with saying we’re really pleased with the way the year ended up. We had a lot of headwinds, asset sales commodity prices that we overcame and delivered a great year. And I think that’s really attributable to the wide variety of services and businesses that we operate. And we’re very excited about the growth that is reemerging in several areas and the opportunities that we are working hard to capture. And so we appreciate your continued interest in the company, and thank you for joining us today.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s teleconference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-31 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Williams Companies Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Brett Krieg, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Brett Krieg: Thanks Britney. Good morning and thank you for your interest in the Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon we released our earnings press release and the presentation that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong will speak to momentarily. Joining us today is our Chief Operating Officer, Micheal Dunn; our CFO, John Chandler, our General Counsel, Lane Wilson; and our Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development, Chad Zamarin. In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. And these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials. And so with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong: Great, thanks Brett. And good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us. And as we discuss our third quarter financial performance and we also will hit on the key investor focus areas of the day as we usually do. So let's move right into the presentation and take a look at our third quarter results. On Slide 2, we provided clear view of our year-over-year financial performance and as you can see, we continue to enjoy steady growth in our key measures despite the asset sales that we continue to execute on and in fact I'm very pleased to say that our third quarter records for our fee-based revenues, our adjusted EBITDA and of course these were driven by record operated gathering volumes which exceeded 13 Bcf per day in the period and as well record contracted capacity on a regulated gas pipeline and these combined overwhelm the small amount of remaining NGL-margin exposure that was certainly low and in fact about as low as I can remember that we've seen in terms of margin contribution from the quarter. So really nice to see our strategy of focusing on fee-based revenues and growing that are, coming through at a time where we had a low cycle on commodities but again, we powered through that with the growth in fee-based revenues. So, taking it from the top and see here our cash flow from operations, which increased 15% for the quarter and 16% year-to-date and this continues to outpace our CapEx and as you can see on a year-to-date basis our CFFO has exceeded our CapEx by over $630 million. On the next line, we show 7% and 8% year-to-date growth for adjusted EBITDA and I'll have more to say about adjusted EBITDA performance in the next couple of slides and then as you can see, we posted continued growth in adjusted earnings per share of 8% for the third quarter and 23% year-to-date even stronger than our adjusted EBITDA increases. And on DCF, we were up about 8% and 16% year to date with growth in the per share calculation and continued strong dividend coverage ratio of 1.79 which continues to exceed both our 2018 coverage ratio as well as our guidance for 2019. And you can see our ending leverage metric for the quarter was 4.47 demonstrating that we are on target with the four or five guidance that we have for the year-end. So overall, nice improvement in our various earnings and cash flow metrics despite the impact of almost $2 billion in asset sales affecting the comparison and much lower commodity price environment that we had in 2018. So now let's move on to Slide 3 to discuss the main business drivers of our year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth. Here on Slide 3 where we compare 3Q '19 to 3Q '18. The adjusted EBITDA increased about 7% or almost 10% if you adjust for the bigger transactions that affect the year-over-year comparison. On the left side of the slide, you can see in gray that we have unfavorable $47 million comparability adjustment which includes removing the adjusted EBITDA from the various asset sale transactions completed during the last 12 months and then netting out the $13 million favorable item reflecting the addition of the incremental 38% UEOM ownership interest. And so that's the additional interest that were not consolidating in the Utica East Ohio Midstream business. And so normalizing for those items, you see adjusted EBITDA growing $112 million or almost 10% on this comparison. So now moving over to look at the financial performance of our continuing business, similar to the first two quarters of this year. Atlantic Gulf led with a 28% increase in adjusted EBITDA driven by topline Transco revenue growth from new expansion projects, of course the Atlantic Sunrise and Gulf Connector were two that were powerful in this comparison and additionally our third quarter 2019 Transco results reflect about $44 million of adjustments related to the settlement were breached in our Transco rate case and of course this recorded through both revenue and other income and expenses. I know there's a lot of questions on that. We look forward to being able to shed more light on that at our upcoming Analyst Day but I will have a little more to say here as we hit slide 5. Lastly, we did see a temporary drop in our Deepwater volumes associated with tropical storms and producers maintenance activities but Deepwater production is back to normal for most producers now in the fourth quarter and in fact growing in the Gulf East due to new production from Hudak to Northwood ramp up that continues. So we continue to be very impressed with the activity in the deal flow around our assets in the deepwater and that's another item that of course will spend quite a bit of time at our upcoming Analyst Day on. Next up, looking at the Northeast G&P area. We see a 17% increase in year-over-year adjusted EBITDA driven by an increase of about 1.3 Bcf a day were 17% higher gathering volumes and higher gathering fees associated with expansion projects. Volume increases were led by the Susquehanna Supply Hub and the Bradford areas which grew about 850 million cubic feet per day and we also saw double-digit growth rate in all of our other operated Northeast franchises. So overall, our operated assets in the Northeast continue to see very strong growth in volumes across the board. And finally in the West, we saw about a 16% decline driven by about a $29 million decrease in revenues for our Barnett gathering business. This decrease was associated with the end of some minimum volume commitments in that area and a related step down in deferred revenue amortization. So that was a one-time step down that was associated with some cash that we had received earlier and that cash was being amortized according to the revenues that we were receiving and so once that MVC step down, it kind of compounded that step down. The Barnett MVC expired at the end of June '19. And so once that did happen the revenue recognition rate of the fixed payments, we have previously recorded began to be based on actual volumes rather than MVC levels. So this was an expected step down and Barnett revenue recognition for this area and we have been forecasting it but we also saw a $32 million of lower NGL margins in the West as unit margins in the Rockies were down by almost 50%. Partially offsetting these impacts was a strong growth in the Haynesville, the Eagle Ford and the Rocky Mountain Midstream franchise and the DJ Basin and in fact adjusted for the four Corners area in 2018, our West gathering volumes actually increased by about 2% on this comparison. And finally, I want to mention our Conway frac and storage business which continues to see strong year-over-year fee revenue growth on the back of the NGL productions in the surrounding areas like the DJ and the Bakken. So next, let's take a quick look at the adjusted EBITDA growth year-to-date and so now on Slide 4, we show the year-to-date comparison, adjusted EBITDA increased about 8% or about 12% if you adjust for the bigger transactions that affect the year-over-year comparison, pretty similar story year-to-date as you heard. For the third quarter so I won't drag you back through that. On year-to-date drivers, we see Atlantic Gulf up 24% and the Northeast up about 19% driven by the same factors as we discussed. The West is down about 8% reflecting much lower NGL margins and again the step down in the Barnett revenue that we just discussed and the effects of severe winter weather this year on our Wyoming volumes during the first quarter of '19. As with the third quarter comparison, our full year West results actually reflect strong growth in the Haynesville, Eagle Ford and the Rocky Mountain Midstream franchise in the DJ as well as our Conway storage and frac business. So, very happy with the growth we've continue to show in the Atlantic Gulf and Northeast this year and the stability of our volumes in the West and strong revenue growth all leading to an 8% growth in adjusted EBITDA even considering the significant asset sales and low NGL margins and the one-time step down in the Barnett revenue recognition. So overall, operationally really strong performance overcoming a lot of those other structural issues. As you look over the sequential comparison to the second quarter of 2019 here on Slide 5, I'd point out that overall gathering volumes increased sequentially just over 0.5 Bcf a day to now over 13 Bcf per day for the first time and this was led by a 5% second quarter to third quarter increase in the Northeast and with somewhat negatively impacted by the Deepwater production outages that we previously discussed but the biggest driver 2Q to 3Q in the Atlantic Gulf was a favorable impact of reaching settlement terms with shippers on Transco. With respect to the lower West results, the one-time step down in Barnett revenue recognition amortization and the MVC expiration drove the decrease from the second quarter and the one-time Barnett step down overshadows what was actually about 4% improvement in gathering volume sequentially in the West. In fact, our West gathering volume trend continues to hold up well in a very tough commodity price environment and now that we're past the revenue recognition transitions and the MVC expiration, the steady nature of our West operations will become increasingly more visible. The operational cash flows are holding up in the West and the CapEx requirements are coming down, generating significant free cash flow from our West assets. So overall, we're pleased with our operational performance in the third quarter and it's very encouraging to see the kind of volume growth we continue to generate in the Northeast and the West G&P businesses and in fact is the first time that I can recall our fee-based business growth being able to overwhelm such a substantial decline in commodity prices showing that our move towards a more sustainable and predictable cash flow is now really paying off for our long-term investors. Now I'm going to move on to Slide 6 and take a look real quickly here at the key investor focus areas. First, on financial guidance. We are reaffirming our current financial guidance for 2019. It's definitely been a challenging commodity price environment for natural gas and NGLs versus the market's original expectations and our own for 2019. But I am pleased to say that it looks like we'll be able to deliver on our financial guidance once again this year in spite of this negative impact. As this is reflected in our year-to-date results through September 2019 has been a year of strong free cash flow generation and I'm pleased with the way our teams have kept us on track with our original business plan from a year ago and how they continue to exceed expectations on project delivery on generating new business, all while spending less capital than we planned. In fact, despite losing about $100 million of our planned direct commodity margins, we are still on track proving up the diversity of our cash flows and the power of crisp execution by our teams. Also growth CapEx could easily come in under the low end of our $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion guidance range which as you know has already been reduced once this year and our dividend coverage ratio continues to be better than our $1.7 billion guidance. Our 2019 results illustrate the steady and strong cash flow growth profile of our large-scale diversified natural gas focused business and the excellent security of our dividend even in a very tough commodity price environment. Moving on now to 2020 guidance, we're currently working through our 2020 operating and capital plan and intend to provide the 2020 financial guidance at are upcoming Analyst Day on December 5. At this event, we will also provide our latest views on the sustainability of our natural gas focused strategy and our unique positioning to grow alongside to continue expansion of natural gas as a preferred and vital fuel around the world. Although we have great confidence in the long-term sustainability of our business strategy, the current low natural gas and NGL prices which are exceeding the long-term growth of natural gas demand have had a pretty significant impact on the forecasted near-term growth from our G&P business, particularly in the Northeast. And clearly our producer forecasted cash flow that they have available to drill with has been heavily impacted by much lower strip prices for gas and NGLs. And as a result, our 2020 Northeast gathering volume growth forecast has steadily drifted downward. As we said earlier in the year, we are committed to keeping our guidance up to date with our changes in our producer plans and so we've continued as those forecasts have come in, we've continued to make those changes. However, as we've said before, confidence in low-cost U.S. natural gas reserves will continue and is continuing to drive strong natural gas demand growth over the long term and there will have to be a call on natural gas focused supply areas given the continuous growth in demand and the stronger than ever capital discipline from the producer community and of course we will be extremely well positioned and are well positioned for the upside associated with that. As a result, we believe that as long as we continue to see natural gas demand growth that we should see the volume and capacity demand growth necessary to generate the 5% to 7% adjusted EBITDA CAGR that we continue to talk about over the long term to be clear this is not mean that every year we will be exactly in that range, some could be slightly lower and others like this year will be above. The 2020 financial guidance, we provide in early December will be built off of low strip prices for natural gas and NGLs and because of this we view the guidance is having significant upside as the gas market rebalances. However, we're pleased to say that we have been taking measures to mitigate this risk and our 2020 plan will show the discipline and resulting improvement that we've been putting on our cost structure so realizing we were going to have some risk associated with this, we've taken a big swipe at our cost and team has been extremely effective on doing that. And so the benefit of that as well as some other continued growth, we believe, will continue to offset the reduction that we continue to see in the Northeast. We will see reduced capital expenditures in the Northeast but we also are very focused on the very strong dividend coverage that that's providing us. So speaking of growth capital, our 2020 capital budget will be dominated by our regulated pipeline expansions as much of the major build out of our GMP systems will be completed by the end of this year driving even higher levels of free cash flow growth and we had earlier expected. One of the areas that is beginning to be a big driver of free cash flow growth is the Northeast operating area and we have been working hard to stay on top of the producer forecast changes in the Northeast. Our previous guidance for the Northeast G&P for 2019 remains intact where we are currently forecasting gathering volume growth of about 13%. And this should result in adjusted EBITDA growth of 19% for a total of about $1.3 billion, so not a bad year given all the much more negative forecast provided by Research and others. So, year-to-date through the third quarter, we've generated about 17% gathering volume growth but we do expect that overall annual growth to moderate here in the fourth quarter since our fourth quarter comparison will be up against the volumes that grew rapidly right after Atlantic Sunrise came online last October. Looking towards 2020, our latest forecast informed by our planned producer activity shows about 3.5% gathering volume growth versus our previous expectation of 5.5%. The decline in expected G&P volume growth was driven primarily by lower customer forecasted volume growth in the Bradford Utica and Susquehanna areas as producers continue to react to lower forecasted 2020 natural gas and NGL prices and based on this forecast, we would still expect adjusted EBITDA growth of about 8% to get to about $1.4 billion, so $50 million is lower than what we had for our second quarter expectations for '20, but still $100 million of growth here in 2019 to 2020. So the decrease in expected adjusted EBITDA also includes a pretty significant reduction from the Blue Racer investment. So part of that $50 million reduction comes from the non-operating investment we have in Blue Racer. And then beyond 2020, we continue to see an opportunity for a stronger growth rate to resume in 2020-2021 in the Northeast and that of course would be dependent on better balance in the natural gas market but we remain excited about how well we are positioned for that call on natural gas. So overall, we remain encouraged to see the level of EBITDA growth. Our Northeast G&P business can continue to generate in a very weak natural gas and NGL price environment and we remain very focused on cost reduction and capital discipline as we await long-term fundamentals to balance. We believe it won't take a large price recovery to quickly restore growth rates above 8% for our Northeast G&P footprint. So now let's move on to discuss our Transco growth projects. First, I'll provide an update on the rate case, very pleased that we have reached an agreement on the terms of the settlement and as a result, we've reduced the reserve we established against the cash and the receiving from the filed rates that went effective in March of this year which along with other related accounting entries results in about $44 million in favorable adjustments. The agreement will resolve all issues in the rate case with no need for any hearings. Of course, final resolution of the rate case is subject to a filing for us to file a formal stipulation, an agreement with the FERC and final approval by the FERC. So a lot of process still in front of us to get final resolution on that rate case but we're very pleased with way that came out. The terms of the settlement are non-public until the stipulation and agreement has been filed with FERC. We will provide an overview of the key terms of the settlement following the FERC filing. For now, I'll just say we're pleased that we were able to reach agreement on the key terms with our customers and related regulators and we await the final FERC approval of the settlement. But I want to make it really clear on one point here, I would caution you from thinking that this reserve adjustment provides you with a clear picture of the annual run rate impact for 2020. And we certainly look forward to being able to show you the full impact once those filings are completed. So let's touch on the status of Transco's major growth projects, starting with the Northeast Supply Enhancement project. Lots of headlines out there related to this very important project for the residents and businesses of New York City. We are still awaiting the State Water Quality Certification permits required for the project from both the New York DEC and the New Jersey DEP. At this point, the risk to our targeted in-service date is increasing although we are going to do everything we can to meet our targeted in-service date for the fourth quarter of 2020, it is quite challenging to bring the onshore compression facility, a portion of the project which is there in New Jersey really challenging to get that done within a year's time frame and that is the current critical path that will be up against but currently we still feel that we can help support the peak load for the '20 and '21 winter. So a lot of great work by our team that's been going on that. I can tell you there's been an impressive amount of work in a working with the various agencies and the various stakeholders on that and I remain confident in our ability to bring that one across the line. So next, I'm very pleased that we're able to place our Rivervale South to Market project in the full service ahead of schedule. The project is a Transco expansion of 190 million cubic feet per day to service additional customers in New Jersey and New York City. We also received FERC approval for our important Southeastern Trail expansion. The Southeastern Trail project adds about 295 million cubic feet per day to the Transco pipeline system and this is designed to serve growing markets in both the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern states by November of 2020. In fact, all of our Transco projects that have been permitted for construction are progressing well. And finally, our most recently announced Transco project the Regional Energy Access project is now headed for approval at our upcoming November Board meeting, so great work by the teams in pulling that project together as well. And I'll remind you that one of the chief benefits of that project is being able to utilize our existing right of ways for that project. Now moving on to Slide 7. Here just to conclude, taking a quick look at our third quarter performance and our high-level review of our key investor topics, we look forward to our upcoming Analyst Day on December 5th and this is going to give us an opportunity to dive deeper into a lot of the really key issues that are out in front of us right now and a lot of the drivers for growth that we are really excited to share about with you both for 2020 and beyond 2020. So just in closing, I'll remind you we do live in a world that will continue to need more energy, there is a growing need for that energy to be as clean burning as possible. Renewables are certainly going to play an increasingly important role but their growth requires a partnership with natural gas to meet the energy needs of the world while also reducing emissions over time. Natural gas does have the lowest CO2 emissions to heat content ratio when compared to other fuels and provide superior economics versus other fuel types and as an example between 2005 and 2018 CO2 emissions from electricity fell 27% due to replacing coal and oil and natural gas power generation. So while low cost natural gas also facilitates costly investments in renewables, it is paving the way around the world to be the fuel of choice. Williams benefits from having ideally situated existing pipes in the ground and we continue to see demand for expansion for the long for both the near term and the long term and despite a pretty tough current commodity price and regulatory permitting environment the future remains very bright for Williams as we demonstrated here in the third quarter and for strategically placed natural gas focus assets like we are so fortunate to operate and we look forward to discussing that future with you in December. So with that, let's go ahead and transition to our Q&A session. And thank you again for your time today.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Colton Bean with Tudor Pickering Holt & Company.
Colton Bean: It sounds like Haynesville volume growth was fairly robust through Q3, can you use off your thoughts on how that's progressing here in Q4 and maybe what the outlook looks like for 2020?
Alan Armstrong: Well, I think there's obviously been a lot of focus on Chesapeake, in the Haynesville and certainly they've had a strong year of growth. But our teams have been out contracting with other customers and have been very successful with other customers in the area. And likely we will start to see some reduction in the growth we've enjoyed from Chesapeake volumes, we're now starting to see that picked up by third parties and we're really excited to be working with some of those and we've got some very collaborative ideas about the way to grow the Haynesville volumes out there. So we're actually pretty encouraged about what we've been able to work with other producers that surround and integrate with the Chesapeake acreage.
Colton Bean: And in terms of those agreements, are those consistent with maybe some of the legacy terms or should we think about those as newly cut the agreements that are more current market?
Alan Armstrong: Well, I would say there's a combination there. Obviously, it depends on what the market is in the area and so I'm not going to comment on specifically what those rates are but obviously it just depends on what kind of market apparently, we have in there.
Colton Bean: And then just maybe transitioning over to the West, can you characterize some of your discussions with producers around the Piceance and Southwest Wyoming footprints and maybe more specifically have the reductions to bank commodity there, so those having an impact at all for the private producers there?
Alan Armstrong: That's a great question. I would say we've seen very steady volumes there in the Piceance and so that's been a real positive. And it and it is mostly private money driving that. A lot of those folks as you know put hedges out in front and so they're just drilling up against those hedges. And then in Wyoming, in place like the Wamsutter, we have seen some slowing of what was some very robust growth but we are still seeing some nice growth there and the Wamsutter. Probably the area that I would expect to see more decline on volumes would be the gathering upstream of our old power processing plant would be the area. So a lot of that gas we don't gather, that is gathered by third parties but we do the processing on it so that's probably the biggest decline we are seeing in the Rockies right now is pullback in that area.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gabe Moreen with Mizuho.
Gabe Moreen: Just had a quick question on the Northeast capital spend and I know you'll probably get into this at the Analyst Day quite a bit but relative to what looks like to be in Northeast G&P run rate spend about $550 million is plus or minus this year, can you maybe talk about just how low that could potentially go next year order of magnitude and to what degree there might be some mandatory capital spend you still have to finish up next year?
Micheal Dunn: Gabe, this is Micheal Dunn. We will have a capital program up there. We have expansions that are ongoing in the Bradford that will continue to spend money on that are coming online in the second quarter. So we do still have a pretty significant program there and also some well connect activity as well. So I don't think you would see as robust as what we're spending this year by any means but we will still have some capital investment going on in the Northeast.
Gabe Moreen: And then. Alan, let me if I could ask just bigger picture in terms of the EBITDA growth trajectory. I appreciate that some years will be up some of those will be little lower EBITDA growth but to what extent you think dividend growth may need to move in lockstep or not in lockstep with projected EBITDA growth just your latest thoughts around that.
Alan Armstrong: That's an excellent question, Gabe. And I would just tell you that the free cash flow growth as you can see by the increase in coverage that we've got this year against it, we don't see any change in getting outside of that range that steady 5% to 7% range that we've talked about for dividend growth because the cash flow growth in a year where the capital spending might be lower, is just that much stronger. And obviously, we can see the growth coming because most of our capital despite we will have some capital in most of our capital, next year is going as I mentioned in my notes, most of our capital is going into regulated projects and therefore that cash flow growth is highly predictable to us in terms of when that's coming on. And so, we're not having to guess about what that growth in the prior years will be around that.
Gabe Moreen: And I appreciate you will get more on the Transco rate case settlement with FERC approval but can you at all speak to where they're not the emissions tracker, reduction tracker wasn't approved as part of the settlement?
Alan Armstrong: We cannot speak to that at this point. So I would just say there's a number of trade-offs around that but we cannot speak to that at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse.
Spiro Dounis: Maybe just starting off or going around with the 2020 CapEx. Alan, it sounds like you've indicated a little bit this on directionality year-over-year but you also mentioned 2019 coming in potentially below the low end. So just curious with that bar sort of getting even lower, how should we think about the magnitude and direction of CapEx coming down next year? Obviously, you mentioned G&P skewing towards the low end of course but you also talked about regulated asset spending and I guess that's where maybe I'm unsure. Do we assume flat higher year-over-year, does that offset a lot of the GP decline?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, I would just say certain projects like for instance the Regional Energy Access project which will be taken to the board. So we'll see increase perhaps from what we had forecasted earlier on the regulated side but decrease in particularly in the G&P area and as we've talked about a lot of the growth that we have in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico doesn't require much capital relative to its growth and so we're going to enjoy some pretty attractive. There is one project in particular there that is going to require some capital and that started to get very clear for us in terms of what that's going to require in the Deepwater but a lot of the projects that we're working on there that the producer is providing the capital for. So I would just say for '20 as I mentioned, the '20 CapEx is definitely going to be dominated between the regulated gas pipeline and the long haul NGL pipeline that we're doing the Bluestone Pipeline that's going to dominate the 2020 CapEx. As Micheal mentioned, there is some cost of service capital still going into place in places like Bradford but majority in 2020 is going to be on the transmission side and it looks like based on the continued demand for the regulated pipe that we're going to continue to see some growth there and then as we get into '21 and '22, we will start to see the some of the impact of - one of the deepwater projects that I talked about start to impact our capital for '21 and '22. So I think that's about all I can give you right now sort of what we're going to show you at the Analyst Day.
Spiro Dounis: Yes, and I can appreciate that. And then just on NESE, you mentioned the headlines and certainly I want to put too much emphasis on those but I guess what we're struggling with is, just given what some of the government officials have said, it just seems like some of those statements or maybe hard to walk back to get them to a point where they can improve the pipeline. So maybe just extra color on what we're not appreciating in that dynamic and to the extent that NYSE does get at the letter or may be mothball from here. Is there another regulated project out there that you can sort of fast track to get to the front of the stack? And as a replacement and then ultimately, what does that do to CapEx in '20 got I think that NESE is a big part of that right now.
Micheal Dunn: I will take that. This is Micheal. We're still confident the NESE is going to have some approvals this fall that allow us to start construction in order for us to meet that winter of 2021 timeframe and why we're confident is because of the significant emissions reduction opportunities that the project allows our customer and the customers of our customer in their service territory in Brooklyn and Long island but also the economic development impact is a very significant if this project does not get built. And so that's why it gives us a lot of confidence that this will happen and obviously you see the headline and we have been very responsive to the regulators in regard to what their concerns were with our permitting applications that we've remedy those we believe and we do have full expectations that we will have permits in place so that we can start construction this fall. And our teams do a great job of getting projects done on time and we certainly have developed contingency plans to accelerate construction if we get crunched on our schedule but we certainly believe we can make the December of '20 timeframe so that our customer can meet their peak load requirements that are occurring in the next winter season after this winter. Other projects in the queue, I would just tell you we have about $3 billion of capital that we're actively working that's just on the Transco system including NESE and Regional Energy Access and the other projects that we've talked about and certainly will provide a lot more information on this at Analyst Day but we have great confidence in this $3 billion of CapEx, it's about 2.5% Bcf of capacity increase alone on the Transco system. And these are the ones that we have very high confidence and I can tell you we're working on another couple of billion dollars capital investment just for the Transco system now that certainly out into the future, we're talking maybe a 2020-2024 timeframe as to when those projects will be in service but there is a long runway of projects just on the Transco system that we're actively working now. We have high confidence in it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein.
Jean Ann Salisbury: What if anything would cause Williams to renegotiate contracts with shippers? Are their win-win outcomes that you could see via contract extensions or new dedications?
Alan Armstrong: Sorry Jean, are you talking about gathering contracts I assume?
Jean Ann Salisbury: Yes, definitely.
Micheal Dunn: Yes. Because I wouldn't think of anything that would bring anything on the pipeline side, a very standard tariff and obviously you have to treat everybody the same on the regulated pipelines. On the gathering stuff, I would just say, we always have our eyes open to ways we can add value on that but there is really not anything we're aware of out there that would motivate us to lower any rates that are out there other than on a short-term basis to increment volumes in an area to spur drilling. But I really don't know of anything that would motivate us to lower rates from our existing rates out there other than for the increment sometimes that we do to incent drilling in the area.
Jean Ann Salisbury: And then just one more on SEM. If it does not go forward with the ultimate outcome of that from New York's perspective be more oil burning to meet demand or is there anything else out there that they've kind of proposed as an alternate solution?
Alan Armstrong: I think the only thing else we've heard is trucking LNG or bringing in propane. So I think that's the options other than more oil burning. I mean it is interesting because there is so much growth going on it surprises us I think when we realized how much real demand growth there is going and how fast the growth is going on in the Brooklyn and Bronx area there and that is what's really putting pressure on this issue is not just the conversion but as well the growth that's going on there. So it's pretty overwhelming as we studied it, what's really driving the growth there. And so, as Micheal said, I think that really gives us a lot of confidence both the ability to help reduce emissions in the area, but to also there's got to be support for economic development there in a sustainable way and therefore that gives us a lot of confidence.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
Jeremy Tonet: I just wanted to start off with 2020 EBITDA guidance and recognize that this is something for the Analyst Day and don't want to parse your words too much here but when you talk about 2020 the headwinds you noted growth could be a bit less that year than the normal five to seven range and when you say a little bit less, Just trying to get a feeling for that is that mean growth could be zero, could it be negative or is it just below five or is there any other color that you can provide on what you mean by a little bit less there?
Alan Armstrong: Jeremy, thank you. And I'm really glad you brought that question forward because I think there might be some confusion brewing on this issue. We really, we're just trying to remind people because we do have so much growth going on across the business and particularly with this Transco rate case which again we can't lay out the details on that but we really are trying to remind people as they start to see all these positives that they don't pile that on to the level that it gets inappropriately high growth rate but we certainly expect significant growth next year. We just want to make sure people don't get too far ahead of us and that they're taking those issues into account because people are really starting to form their model for 2020 and we just want to make sure that they're taking all these other variables into account because I think if you start piling all these positive things on top of each other, you would actually get to a pretty high growth rate, if you're not taking into account things like the Barnett in the Gulfstar step down, so that's really what we're trying to do there is just remind people to build that into our model. And so, perhaps our conservatism on that over did that a little bit but that was what we were trying to accomplish now.
Jeremy Tonet: And just want to go back a topic that's been talked about in prior calls and you guys have taken strong actions in the capital discipline side, as far as portfolio optimization is concerned do you still see opportunities to take actions there or any way to thoughts you could provide?
Alan Armstrong: Well, I would just say the thing that we've really done well and I call credit Micheal and his very engaged oversight on this is we have just been making sure that we're not putting capital out in front the growth and so we have really reign that end and so we've really made sure that any growth capital that we're investing in most of these areas comes with some either an MVC or rate increase that supports it so that we're not out on a limb building out in front of a bunch of growth and so that's the discipline and as a result of that people are not willing to make those commitments were pulling in the capital that. And so that is really what provide a lot of opportunity as well in UIO the synergies there is with the UEOM is a great example there where we had capital expansions, we were going to have to make for fractionation there. And by doing that deal, we were able to eliminate that we also have been able to work with some of the other processors in the area and take overflow volumes rather than seeing capital being invested in the areas. So we really, and it's nice to see the whole industry really trying to bring that capital discipline across the space, because I think that makes us all healthier and so we're seeing a lot of discipline that is showing up as higher returns and better free cash flow for us here in 2020 and beyond.
Jeremy Tonet: It is good to see you guys kind of swim in their lanes there. I think that's good for the industry but I was also just curious I guess on the joint venture side or asset sale side if there are any other thoughts on potential future actions there that you guys could share?
Alan Armstrong: I would just say we are, we still see very significant opportunity along those fronts. And we're really excited. I think one of the things that we have going for us is that where our assets are, we tend to have very well-positioned assets with very strong contract behind them and very long-lived contracts behind them and as a result of that, that gives a lot of security of the cash flows that we have. And that's exactly what the private side investor, not necessarily typical private equity but the private funds, pension funds and so forth is that's exactly what they're looking for and so we make a great joint venture partner with those folks because we're a safe, reliable and conservative minded operator. And so, we make a great partner for those folks. And so, yes to answer your question we see some pretty significant opportunity there and we are working that angle pretty hard.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Kania with Wolfe Research.
Alex Kania: Just a question on your thoughts around the mid pipeline sale and that was not certainly at this fall, I believe you guys had a right of first refusal on the transaction. So I'm just wondering what your thoughts were with respect to not going forward to exercise that, was it price? Were there any other benefits or something like that with respect to the leased at them, that that may have kind of made you sort of okay with not exercising that option, just curious.
Alan Armstrong: Yes, I mean part of it certainly was price. If you look at the cash flow relative to the price paid and kind of ignore the structuring around that, it's pretty low return and so that was certainly a piece of it and then there was some consideration that we received in exchange for that and we're not going to discuss the details of that. So we certainly took a look at it but it just didn't make sense really for our given our other investment opportunities that we have. It really just been stack up against our other investment opportunities.
John Chandler: This is John Chandler, if you think about that in many ways would be something like debt on our books and we're paying lease payments against that meet interest. We looked at that long and hard to actually buy that interest in what we would have incurred an additional $400 million in debt. Basically, to do that and that's taking our leverage the wrong way. So our leverage focus came into play in that decision as well.
Alex Kania: Just again respecting that you can't really say much on the settlement. Just I'm thinking about how the accounting and then necessarily would work when you're able to give more details on that. Would it end up you recognizing kind of revenue for this year and with that already be included in the guidance that you've reaffirmed or would that be kind of another variable that that might affect that going into the end of the year.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. It's a great question. I would just say that our performance or our guidance certainly takes in that into account and it's just one of those things that just like we've seen the negative impact of low cycle NGL margins is one of those things that offsets that - the beauty of having a big diversified business to be able to see some positives and some negatives during the year. So, but it definitely is considered as we think about the guidance affirmation for the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Praneeth Satish with Wells Fargo.
Praneeth Satish: I just have one question I guess one of your large utility customers is proposed a large offshore wind farm near Virginia. So I'm just curious how you think about renewables in general and then whether you've thought about investing jointly in these type of projects?
Alan Armstrong: It's good question. I would just say we have so much investment opportunity already that are at higher returns than what we've seen of - then realized in those projects that given our continued focus on balance sheet as well as the higher return investment opportunities that we have that just wouldn't make sense right now and obviously there is always learnings when you venture into something new and we think there's risk obviously associated with that and bottom line is sticking to our knitting right now we think is going to add a lot of value and is the right approach for us. Having said that, there are things like our right of ways and things like that that can be very valuable when it comes to renewables but we are very convinced after studying this issue a lot that the natural gas generation that has to go along with the renewables effort is going to continue to be a big driver of growth for us and it is showing up in very real ways in terms of RFPs and negotiations with customers even beyond the visibility that we provided to date on that. And so until that word in or we can start to see that starting and I just don't think we've got capital or risk appetite to venture into something new given the opportunities in front of us today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.
Craig Shere: If the 2020 strip remains below 250 and Cabot another customer moved maintenance only investment, would it be reasonable to use the third quarter, Northeast G&P run rate as a steady-state level?
Alan Armstrong: I don't really think so just because there is some MVCs and so forth that are getting built into some of the capital it's going in right now. So I really don't think that would be a real good assumption, it is a good question but I don't think-- it's certainly might be for certain areas as we get towards the end of the year here. I mean we have already seeing volumes obviously here in the fourth quarter that show us continued growth. So on an actual basis here so I don't know that would be a very fair assessment given what we're seeing here in October and then there is other areas that like in the Bradford where we have real capital but it is going into place in the cost of service will step up as a result of that. So good question, but I would tell you right now I kind of doubt that would be the case.
Craig Shere: And one last question, apologies if I missed it, it looks like some good clarification about the impact of the Barnett MVC step down in the third quarter, was there any specific figures around the Gulfstar One deferred revenue recognition in fact as we head into 2020?
John Chandler: This is John Chandler. As you think about 2020, actually there is a small additional, Barnett step that I think about it this year. We've had two quarters of higher levels of deferred revenue that step down in the third quarter, so we have about $20 million to $30 million of additional step down in the Barnett amortization next year just because you've got four quarters of that step down in 2020. And in addition somewhere around that $70 million to $80 million of up around $7 million step down in the at Gulfstar amortization. As we come out at the end of the exclusivity period that for that platform.
Craig Shere: And is that 70 plus million for Gulfstar in 2020 does that impact the full year or does some of that.
John Chandler: That's a full year number because that exclusivity period in the November the last payments of this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni with UBS.
Shneur Gershuni: One of my questions have been asked and answered but I was wondering if we could just circle back a little bit on the rate case, a little bit. First, just to confirm, one of the comments you made in the prepared remarks that we can't really on any of the reserve adjustments, should we just think of it is, it's an accounting movement from a reserve to the income statement and it's just a journaling entry and that really has no tell about what is going on with the rate case, is that an accurate reflection?
Alan Armstrong: Yes I mean obviously if you think about the way that works, we have to record our best available information that come through in that but the rate case has a lot of complex issues to be dealt with and I would just say that not all of those are reflected in that change that you saw. And so that's why I know everybody wants to jump ahead, we would rather have not had to show anything on that honestly but from an accounting rule standpoint, we have too but it is not the whole picture and we look forward to be able to share that whole picture there.
Shneur Gershuni: And I realize you can't sort of talk about the case itself. But I was wondering if you can talk about the back and forth between you and the counterparties in the negotiations, do you feel that both sides concluded that they got some of what they wanted?
Micheal Dunn: Yes, this is Micheal. I would say it was actually a very good negotiation with our shippers as we always have with the Transco organization and we have a great relationship there with the shippers and the regulators over those customers as well. And there is always contentious issue that somebody wants to make sure that they have success on and I would say both sides walked away from that pleased with the outcome. And we are happy to get it behind us and able to go through the litigation of the of the rate case and so there's always some issue that it can be contentious. But I think both sides dealt with it very professionally.
Shneur Gershuni: And then one final question, I know there's been a lot of back and forth about NESE and when it comes to the regulators and so forth but in a scenario where NESE is delayed longer and you have to move the in-service date by at least a year let's say, do you see an opportunity to potentially deploy kind of the budgeted CapEx towards buybacks, do you feel that's an option or an arrow in the quiver at this point that you can, potentially use just given where your stock is trading at?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, I would just say that first of all, we remain confident on that. And so really don't see that as something that we'd be looking at the trade up. I think as we get further out and we get below down to the credit metrics that we want to, I definitely think that will be on the table as a debate but right now the I know that we see a big hole in our capital coming up just because while there might be little changes here and there in the grander scheme of things, I don't really see a big change come in there and any anything that would present itself here in the very near term as a surprise, excess cash available would just go out and be to taken the credit metric down very quickly.
Operator: Our next question comes from Derek Walker with Bank of America Securities.
Derek Walker: Just a quick, just a quick one on the leverage and I believe you said you're expecting to hit kind of four five by the end of the year. And there is a long-term target of the four two number. Can you just talk about, I think you said you're evaluating some opportunistic transactions to improve leverage metrics further, is that what's needed to hit the four two or is that mostly just coming from an EBITDA ramp and are you still looking to make transaction to go below that four two number?
Alan Armstrong: Great question. Well, certainly the path we're on gets us to the four two. It's a question of, if there is additional value added transactions that we could do in other words that would add value to the equity side as well rather than just taking down the debt and so some of the transactions that we've done to date, we think a very valuable to shareholders where we've been able to sell assets at 14 to 15 times and redeploy that capital into higher return investment opportunities. And so we think as long as that continues to be available to us so that's really good value for our shareholders and we'll continue to pursue that, but the first thing we would do, it's just a matter of how fast we get there, really the first thing we would do with excess cash would be to take it down four two. And I'll just remind you in terms of the '19, we are already below the four five here for or '19 and so we're making great progress towards that. But it really just a question of rate or acceleration of that goal. But we certainly are on that trajectory is just that it's a big number and we can move it a lot quicker, if we were to do some transaction.
Derek Walker: And maybe just one on the operational side, I believe you just commissioned the Keenesburg one facility processing facility. I think as capacity of 225, can just talk about the utilization on that plant and I believe you are also targeting second Keenesburg plan in '21. And you mentioned sort of the step down a CapEx for next year. Can you talk about how you're thinking about that that like a plan as well?
Micheal Dunn: This is Micheal. I will take the question on the Keansburg plant. We commission that on time and on budget. Our team did a great job following up our Fort Lupton plant $200 million a day plant that we commissioned back in April. And we're able to balance volumes between those two plants and right now we're doing so and catching a lot of additional volume from spillover customers that have other arrangements and aren't being met with our competitor peer group in the DJ Basin and so we're actually tracking a lot of additional business there. Our Fort Lupton plant was at full capacity already and our Keansburg plant was at about 50% capacity pretty darn quick there and right now we're balancing between those two plants based on deliverability of NGLs off the plants as well as residue gas. So pretty good load factor on both those plants right now considering just came online this year.
Operator: Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Alan Armstrong for closing remarks.
Alan Armstrong: Okay. Well, great, thank you all for the really good questions. And we really look forward to sharing the growth that we've got ahead of us within the Analyst Day. So we look forward to seeing you there. Thanks again.
Operator: Thank you, everyone, this concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-08-01 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to The Williams Company’s Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John Porter: Thanks, Patrick. Good morning, and thank you for your interest in The Williams Company. Yesterday afternoon, we released our earnings press release and the presentation that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily. Joining us today is our Chief Operating Officer, Micheal Dunn; our CFO, John Chandler; and our Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development, Chad Zamarin. In our presentation materials you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconciled to generally accepted accounting principles. And these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today’s presentation materials. And so with that, I’ll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong: Great. Well, good morning, everyone. Thanks, John and thanks for everybody joining us. I know it’s a busy time right now. As we discussed the second quarter financial performance and the key investor focus areas we’re going to hit, as we have in the past, some of the areas that we’ve questioned, we’ve been hearing from our investor base. So let’s move right into the presentation and take a look at our second quarter of 2019 results. Here on Slide 2, we provided a clear view of our year-over-year financial performance. As you can see, we continue to enjoy very healthy growth in all of our key measures. In general, all the metrics we want to go up, we went up by double digits and those we’ve been working to reduce, it went down. So this growth continues to reflect very little direct commodity exposure, so we remind you. And in fact, year to date our 2019 gross margin is 98% fee-based versus only 2% coming from direct commodity margin. And I’ll remind you with that is a very predictable set of cash flows making this be 14th quarter in a row that we have been in line or been at least in line with Street consensus and our own guidance. So let’s take it from the top with our GAAP cash flow from operations, which increased 20% for the quarter and 16% year to date. Our business continues to demonstrate significant free cash flow and as you can see our CFFO exceeded CapEx by over $360 million and $625 million for the quarter and year to date periods. On the next line we show 12% and 9% growth for adjusted EBITDA, which is impressive in the face of significant asset sales affecting the period. And I’ll have more to say about what drove the adjusted EBITDA performance here in the next couple of slides. And you can see our continued strong growth and adjusted EPS metrics posting excellent 53% and 33% increases. Our EPS continues to be burdened with substantial non-cash charges. And I encourage you to take a look at Slide 12 and the appendix to appreciate the true power of our cash flows underlying these earnings. Our DCF was up about 36% and 21% with strong growth in the per share calculation and the related dividend coverage ratio moving up above 1.8x with the second quarter being boosted by a cash tax item that we disclosed. We’re making great progress on bringing leverage down. Our original guidance was to finish the year at less than 4.75x and we currently sit at 4.43x, and we’ll discuss our revised leverage guidance in a moment. And finally, crisp execution on our projects continues keeping our capital spending in line with our expectations. So really nice improvement in our various earnings and cash flow metrics despite the impact of significant asset sales. As we move on here to Slide 3, for the quarter adjusted EBITDA increased just over 12% or 14%, if you adjust for the bigger transactions that affect the year-over-year comparison. On the left side of the slide in gray, you can see an unfavorable $37 million comparability adjustment, which includes removing the adjusted EBITDA from the various asset sale transactions completed during the last 12 months and then taking out the $11 million favorable item reflecting the addition of the incremental 38% UEOM ownership interest. The normalizing for those items you see adjusted EBITDA growing about 14%. Now moving over to look at the financial performance at the continuing business. Similar to the first quarter of this year, Atlantic-Gulf led the increase with a 23% increase in adjusted EBITDA driven by top line Transco revenue growth from new expansion projects, including Atlantic Sunrise and the Gulf Connector. Next up, looking at the Northeast G&P area, we had a 20% increase in year-over-year adjusted EBITDA, driven by 17% higher gathering volumes and higher gathering fees associated with expansion projects. Volume increases were led by the Susquehanna Supply Hub area, which grew about 23%. But we also saw double digit growth rates in all of our other operated Northeast franchise except the smaller Laurel Mountain JV that we have with Chevron. Probably one of the more impactful changes that we had there was the Utica volumes up about 15%. And so as we mentioned in the past, the Encino transaction out there has really been important to us, to see the volumes in the Utica really start to turn around from what previously had been declined to now a very healthy incline. So overall we continued a very nice start to the year in the Northeast. And finally, we have the West, which is pretty flat to the prior year where a sharp drop in NGL margins was offset by nice growth and fee-based service revenues. And we’re excited to see as well a new plant at Fort Lupton quickly fill up this quarter in the DJ Basin. As we – we’ve now exceeded about 200 million a day of new inlet volumes coming into that plant. So as we told you, that just started up right around the end of the first quarter and into the second quarter and that new train there has already filled up. So great growth going on there in the DJ Basin. Moving on to Slide 4 and looking at the year-over-year results. Pretty similar story year to date as you heard for the second quarter. Once again on the left side of the slide in grey, you can see the unfavorable of $78 million comparability adjustment from the various asset sell transactions and then a $13 million favorable item reflecting the pickup of an incremental 38% UEOM interest again. And so normalizing for those items you see adjusted EBITDA growing about 13% for the first six month comparison. Year to date, we see Atlantic-Gulf up 21% and the Northeast up 20% driven by the same factors that we just discussed on the previous slide, namely Transco revenue growth and strong broad-based volume growth across Northeast. The West is down about 3% on this comparison, reflecting much lower NGL margins and the effect of severe winter weather this year on volumes in 1Q of 2019. All in all, very happy with our second quarter performance, which tracks well with our overall business plan from last fall despite the decline we’ve seen in natural gas and NGL pricing. And we are very well positioned to continue this growth here in the last half of the year. Next let’s revisit a few of the key investor focus areas. And before I dig into the items on this slide, I just want to remind you a few things. First of all, we just recently announced the reorganization and some other cost reduction initiatives that we have going on at the company right now. As you may have noted from our recent 8-K after more than 30 years of service, Jim Scheel will be leaving the company in December of this year. And we’re taking the opportunity to further reduce our operating areas to two, one focus primarily on our FERC regulated gas pipeline business led by Scott Hallam and the other focused on our non-regulated business being led by Walt Bennett, who leads our West Gathering business today. I have more to say in recognition of the fine work Jim has done for Williams on the third quarter call. But for now, I’ll just say the reorganization to two operating areas represents another step toward becoming further simplified and centralized as we seek to be the very best operator in the natural gas infrastructure business. So these moves are basically taking advantage of the scale that we have in these very similar businesses and continuing to drive common processes and common systems across our operations. But we will continue to provide supplemental disclosures to assist in the modeling of our non-regulated business, but don’t worry about losing any of the transparency that we provide today. Our supplemental disclosures will provide at least as much visibility as you have today and will continue to highlight the Northeast volume and EBITDA growth that continues to occur. Beyond the consolidation, the operating areas we have also initiated a voluntary separation program and are looking at other cost reduction opportunities given the $5-plus billion of asset sales that we’ve had over the last three years. And really narrowing our focus down to the natural gas infrastructure space is allowing us to take full advantage of the scale. And I can tell you the entire management team is very focused on us being – having the very best operating margin ratio in the business. And so we continue to push hard on that as a team and we really believe given the scale that we have – we ought to be the very best in the industry on this measure. And these efforts are taking us closer and closer to that point. So let’s look now at the first item we’ll be discussing, which is our financial guidance and progress on deleveraging. First off, we are reaffirming our current financial guidance for 2019 and now guiding to a further improvement in our year end 2019 leverage target. You can find the various elements of our 2019 financial guidance in the appendix of this presentation. Additionally, we are also affirming our longer-term EBITDA growth rate of 5% to 7% per year. Turning now to our leverage. We achieved the debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4.43x at the end of the second quarter and we announced that our year end 2019 debt to adjusted EBITDA to be less than 4.5x, as you’ll recall, our original guidance was to be less than 4.75x for the same period. The effects of our transactions along with our recently lower capital expenditure forecast has allowed us to significantly improve our 2019 debt to adjusted EBITDA expectations for 2019. There is no change to our long-term target of 4.2x that we plan to hit by the end of 2021 and we continue to evaluate transactions that could potentially allow us to reach the 4.2x at a faster rate. As an affirmation that we are making the right moves on the leverage front, we recently saw some favorable rating agency actions, where S&P improved its outlook to a BBB flat stable rating and Fitch put us on Rating Watch Positive. Shifting now to discuss the expected growth in our Northeast G&P business, we’d like to first emphasize that we still believe in the strong natural gas demand growth fundamentals that underpin our strategy. We’ve seen continued delays in the startup of nearly all of the LNG terminals that were planned to come online in the first half of 2019, but that just means we’re going to see an even stronger pool on natural gas in the back half of this year. It really is easy to see that the natural gas demand growth outlook remains very strong driven by LNG export growth, continued power generation and major industrial investments that continue to come online, trying to take advantage of low cost of U.S. natural gas and U.S. low cost NGL prices. Components in low cost U.S. natural gas reserves will continue to drive strong natural gas demand growth over the long term. And as a result, we believe that there will have to be a call on natural gas focused supply areas given the continuous growth in natural gas demand and the stronger than ever capital discipline being demonstrated by the producer community. Our near term, we continue to see commodity price headwinds for our producer customers in the area and we believe that producers are responding appropriately to the current market conditions, continuing to plan around or hope for higher prices would only exacerbate the length and supply. And we are also very focused on closely matching our capital programs with these latest forecasts. Our Northeast growth capital for 2020 probably ends up being about half of what it was in 2019 due to this reduce to us going back capital as well as the synergies that we’re realizing from the UEOM transaction, while also making significant near term reductions in 2019, as we continue to respond to the producers disciplined approach. So with that being said, let’s take a closer look at our current expectations for the Northeast G&P business through 2020, built on the backs of our most producer customer feedback. Starting with 2019, you can see that we are currently forecasting gathering volume growth of about 13%, which should result in adjusted EBITDA growth of 19% for a total of about $1.3 billion. Year-to-date, we’ve generated about 16% gathering volume growth, but we do expect that overall annual growth to moderate in the fourth quarter, mostly just since because our fourth quarter comparison will be up against volumes that grew rapidly after Atlantic Sunrise came on in the fourth quarter of 2018. Looking forward our 2020, very latest forecast shows about 5.5% gathering volume growth over 2019, generating about 11% adjusted EBITDA growth to get to about $1.45 billion. I might just note that we had always expected a slowing in the growth rate for 2020 versus 2019 with respect to our prior 10% to 15% gathering volumes CAGR. It seems that folks maybe missed the frontend impact that was present in the CAGR and instead thought we were assuming more of an annual or equal annual growth rates. That was never the case and the unequal growth rates across the 2018 to 2021 timeframe were indicated given the strong growth that we have been expecting and we are seeing in 2019. Beyond 2020, we do see an opportunity for stronger growth rates resume in 2021, but that of course, will be dependent on it better balance in the natural gas market. I’d also just mentioned that as we think about the Northeast pricing environment, it is important to remember that even if today’s pricing environment reduce our net backs are still better than they were in the 2015 and 2016 timeframe, when production was constraining and commodity prices were more a function of the basis differential than the Henry Hub prices, since then incremental gas takeaway capacity has come online improving realized prices in the region and the producers have become significantly more efficient and disciplined with our capital during this timeframe. So overall, we are encouraged to see the level of EBITDA growth. Our Northeast G&P business can continue to generate even in the weak natural gas price environment we’re currently experiencing and we remain very focused on cost reduction and capital discipline as we await long term fundamentals to balance. Now let’s move onto our – discuss our Transco growth projects. First, let me give a quick update on the Transco rate case, although not a lot of new information to pass along here. As our competence will set them up and our process continues. We’ve now had five conferences and we continue to work the issues like ROE with our customers. Last quarter, we stated that the settlement negotiations were likely to continue for many months, they have done that and resolution could extend in the next year. We are cautiously optimistic that a settlement can ultimately be reached without the need for litigation and the settlement would include the $1.2 billion emissions reduction tracker that will allow Transco to significantly reduce emissions from our existing compression fleet along the Eastern Seaboard. And as always, I’ll remind you that we don’t have any upside from the rate case reflected in our financial guidance. So let’s touch on the status of Transco’s major growth projects starting with the Northeast Supply Enhancement project. This quarter, we quickly reapplied for the 401 water quality certification in New York and New Jersey and promptly received notice of complete application from New York and New Jersey has indicated that our application is administratively complete. These are very important milestones in the re-filing of this and taking on some of the technical issues that were raised by both of those states. Obtaining both of these 401 certifications is essential to begin construction this fall in order to meet the project and service date. The enhancement of the existing infrastructure is critical and connecting much needed natural gas supplies to folks in New York and while improving the Airshed and system reliability in New York and New Jersey. In May, our customer National Grid had to announce that they will not be able to process new gas service requests and it’s service carry in Brooklyn, Queens, and Long Island. This means they will not provide any additional connections from service until there certainty that the NESE project can move ahead. Local, commercial, residential and political support for the project is strong as the need for gas on in both in economic and environmental improvement basis is clear and compelling. We fully expect a positive decision will come in time for us to maintain our end service date just ahead of the 2020/2021 winter peaks. Next, I want to touch on a couple of key milestones that were met recently for a couple of our Transco projects. We recently applied for a FERC certificate for our Leidy South project. As a reminder, Leidy South is a proposed 580 million cubic feet per day expansion of Williams existing Pennsylvania infrastructure that will further connect Appalachian gas with growing demand centers along the Atlantic Seaboard in time for the 2021/2022 heating season. Also our FERC certificate per Southeastern Trail project is pending approval and the Southeastern Trail project is a 295 million cubic feet day expansion of the Transco pipeline, system designed to provide additional pipeline capacity to serve growing markets in the mid-Atlantic and Southeastern states by November of 2020. And additionally, we received permission in June to place a portion of the Rivervale South to Market project into early service. This project is Transco expansion of 190 million cubic feet per day to service additional customers in New Jersey and New York City. The facility is required to provide 140 million cubic feet per day have already been completed and the remaining facilities are ahead of schedule targeting the September in-service date, two months ahead of schedule. Also, our most recently announced Transco project Regional Energy Access concluded its open season and our team is finalizing negotiations with this customer base. So all-in-all, continued tremendous amount of activity on Transco, both in terms of completing existing projects that we’ve got underway like Hillabee Phase 2, which is also ahead of schedule, and a long list of projects that we have in the permitting phase, so lots of great effort going on by our engineering and construction teams with both the permitting and the construction and continued great performance on the capital execution efforts here. And lastly, let’s move onto the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, where we’re seeing a pickup in activity and significant new discoveries in and around our assets that has us position for significant free cash flow growth for years to come. Beginning in the third quarter of 2019, you’ll start seeing contributions from our Norphlet deepwater gathering system investment. Norphlet delivers gas into Williams Transco system located on one of our Gulf of Mexico platforms and from there the gas will be transported to our recently expanded Mobile Bay processing facility. First gas production on the system began in late June and we acquired the $200 million Norphlet pipeline in early July. The Norphlet deepwater gas gathering system is extremely well positioned for even more growth than the existing Appomattox system with approximately 50% of the pipeline contractual capacity remaining available for future produced times of existing discoveries in that area today. So our discovery system is also seeing new volumes from the Hadrian North and Buckskin tiebacks, which achieved first productions on our systems in during the second quarter. The Hadrian North and Buckskin liquids rich production flows to our discovery system via the Keathley Canyon Connector and ultimately to our Larose processing plant in our Paradis fractionator. These tieback opportunities are high return projects and our example of many more to come in the deepwater. Looking forward, we are very active right now discussing multiple tieback prospects around Devils Tower, our deepwater platform where production could begin as early as 2021 and on the near Blind Faith, we continue to be excited about Chevron and Total value more dedication to us where first production could be seen as early as 2023, and in the very active Western Golf facility planning for Shell’s well prospect is on a fast track and we could see FID for our system expansion here in the fourth quarter of this year. So we continue to see opportunities for significant incremental cash flow in the 2020 to 2023 timeframe from our deepwater operations. And we are really excited about the very substantial growth that we’re seeing both on acreage that’s already dedicated to it and as well new acres that we’re very confident that we’re going to be able to pick up given our expenses network. So with that, we will transition to our Q&A session. Thank you, again for your time today. We’re pleased to share with you our very strong second quarter performance and continued focus on deleveraging and the progress we’ve made on our many growth opportunities. And so with that operator, I’ll turn it over to you.
Operator: Perfect. [Operator Instructions] We’ll take our first question from Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Spiro Dounis: Good morning, everyone. First question just around the financial guidance and being able to reiterate the 5% to 7% long term growth, I think, we were a little surprised there, just given the slight haircut on the Northeast volume outlook. And Alan, I totally understand your point on the expected slowdown and embedded in the 10% to 15% CAGR. But just still seems like something is in there, maybe offsetting some of that. So maybe just walk us through some of the drivers and how you’re able to maintain the 5% to 7%, and if you’re able to maybe even pull forward some demand driven projects as an offset.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Thanks, Spiro. Well, I would just say, obviously when we laid that out, we were that 5% to 7% – we were counting on a certain level of returns from our projects. And I would just say that some of those things have gone better than that. So in other words, we’ve had quite a bit of improvement if you think about it, since we laid out that 5% to 7%. We’ve had quite a bit of improvements in areas like the Utica within see now and the UEOM transaction. That gives us some synergies and ability to keep our costs even more under control there in the Northeast. So we’ve actually, we said that 5% to 7% some time ago. And just like in any big company like Williams, there’s been some things they go down a little bit, but there’s also things that go up and of course, and we’re continuing to put pressure on our costs as we talked about. So I would say, we are being agile and responsive to those changes. And we’re also picking up advantages like Bluestem, like – you might’ve noticed our Conway NGL and frac business was up pretty significantly this quarter, which was on the backs of us building up for some of those Bluestem volumes. And so we’re continuing to take advantage where the opportunities exist and those tend to offset things where things change a little bit to the negative, just the benefit of having a big portfolio.
Spiro Dounis: Got it. That’s helpful. And then just on the faster than expected deleveraging, obviously the asset monetization played a big part in that. And it sounds like you expect that to continue. But I guess you’d just look at somebody announcements made by some of your E&P customers in the Northeast recently. Just curious if you’ve seen any shifts or reduction in appetite there from potential buyers and JV partners? Are they still looking like they want to invest more?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, I would just say, well, that has not slowed down a bit. I think that – the distinction out there, this becoming more clear to us is that, there the interest rates are so low out there and so much available to that money up against these very certain cash flows and very predictable cash flows that we have. And so as long as, you have that predictability of those cash flows, that kind of low cost money is going to be available. And we continue to be impressed by that in terms of various transactions that we’re involved in. But it’s clear to us that that’s people just are being out these very low interest rates against these very predictable cash flows. And I think we’re going to continue to see that with lower interest rates.
Spiro Dounis: Got it. That’s also helpful. Last, quick housekeeping one, we’ve got a few inbounds on this lately, but just with respect to Chesapeake and Haynesville contracts you’ve got there, could you just remind us again when those contracts roll and what your appetite is at all to renegotiate anything here?
Micheal Dunn: As far as – this is Micheal Dunn, those contracts are dedicated to us and we – I don’t have the exact time frame on when you’re a language about when they might roll, but all that acreage is dedicated to us and we are continuing to work with Chesapeake there. And they’ve been active in there and we’ve been bringing on additional production from them, but we’ve also been very successful in capturing other business in the Haynesville besides Chesapeake that is coming into our systems there. So volume in the Haynesville is up for us. And we’re pretty pleased with what we’re seeing there right now.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I would just say, they’re in the Haynesville when we renegotiated that several years ago there we did extend the life of that contract and I believe that contract extends out into the 2030s, so that was one of the benefits we got out of that transaction when we renegotiated that a couple of years ago. So the Eagle Ford is as similar long term timeframe, so there’s not any re-ups coming in either of those areas.
Spiro Dounis: Got it. I appreciate all that color. Thanks guys.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Gabe Moreen with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Gabe Moreen: Good morning, everyone. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit overall about the ability to reflex CapEx higher or lower in response to the natural gas pricing environment. You gave a preliminary outlook for CapEx guidance for 2020. To the extent gas prices go maybe sub $2. Is there even more ability to reflex that downward? Maybe you can speak to that? Or is that kind of 50% reduction sort of where it goes regardless of the environment?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, Gabe, good question. Yes, I would just say, there are the capital that we have out there today is backed by rate increases or MVCs. And so if there was a further pullback that occurred today I would just say that a lot of that capital that we’re talking about really wouldn’t move all that much unless there was some kind of renegotiation because most of its underpinned by obligations on the other side. So really wouldn’t expect it to move too much. I would tell you that the outside of the Northeast, obviously, these demand pool projects, which will be the bulk of our capital in 2020, of course – just further improved by low gas prices. So we don’t really see any change there. And then we still got capital going into DJ Basin, and the Wamsutter area and those who mostly getting driven off of oil prices. So we don’t see much change going on there. And of course, the deepwater is such a long term play. It didn’t really get driven by the shifts – short term shifts in commodity prices.
Gabe Moreen: Thanks Alan. And I guess as a related follow-up. I was wondering, if you can comment a little bit on the headlines that are crossed on the Blue Racer system over the last couple of weeks. And I think related to that, there was a fairly substantial Marcellus gathering transaction that happened about a month ago and I think Williams had ownership in a couple of those systems. Was there an opportunity to maybe piggyback on that transaction and community speak to that as well?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. No. The answer is – I’ll just answer the simple part of that first and then I’ll turn it over to our General Counsel to answer the more complex question you started with. On the pinot investment that we have with Rivers – midstream up there, that is a really small interest and there is not really any opportunity there for us. So there’s really nothing on that front. We do think there’s some good consolidation opportunity up there that we think will like some our way, even with that asset, we think there’s some good opportunity around the liquids that come off of that plant that do come over to UEOM. But again, I’d just say, we were impressed with another high multiple being paid in the space out there. And I think we continue to see that. And so we continue to see our businesses mark well below that, those kind of multiples that are being paid. So we were impressed by it and we are obviously we’re paying close attention to that. I’m going to have Lane Wilson, our General Council responds to you on the Blue Racer question.
Lane Wilson: Hey, Gabe, as you’re talking about the news lately regarding the litigation in Delaware. I will think about it. All we want to say there is, that we are cooperating and supportive of the efforts to IPO the Blue Racer business. That said, there are a number of rights around the structure and scope of certain filings that we have related to that IPO efforts. And the litigation is really just effort on our part to protect those rights. Beyond that, I think we just want to wait for the court to rule probably it occurs on time in August.
Gabe Moreen: Thanks, Lane. I’ll let that rest. And last one for me is, it seems like a little bit of pushing out to the right on timing on some of the Rocky’s processing expansions. I think Alan, you mentioned oil – being a function of oil prices, it seems like the processing picture is pretty dynamic out there in the DJ. Can you maybe speak to that and the timing going on there?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, we’re really pretty encouraged by the continued steady growth rate that we’re working with on producers out there. We did push out Keansburg II plant and our Milton Train. We did push those out in our schedule. But we are really impressed with the growth that we’re seeing out there and the fact that we’ve already filled up just here in one quarter. We filled up that one new train we placed in service first part of April. And so we were really pleased with the way that’s going. Actually, I would tell you one of the risks I didn’t like about that basin was the peaky nature of the production growth. And so that flattening out a little bit with the same amount of reserves back. We actually picked up a very large dedication in East Greeley from extractions since we did that deal earlier. And so we continue to build dedicated acreage behind the system and a little slower growth rate with less capital going in wouldn’t hurt my feelings at all in terms of the long term return on capital that we would see out of that area. So overall, despite all the regulatory concerns, which is not to be dismissed, we actually think the basins doing very well, and the producers are doing a nice job of following through on the permits. And a lot of which were already grandfathered in the area. So I would be contrarian perhaps, but I am pretty – have a pretty positive perspective about the DJ and the actions going on out there right now.
Gabe Moreen: Great. Thanks, Alan.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We’ll take our next question from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Chris Sighinolfi: Good morning, Alan. Thanks for all the announcements, really helpful. I did want to follow-up on a couple of areas. The leverage guidance change last night, I noticed obviously it came down at touch without any subsequent change in the EBITDA or CapEx ranges. So I’m just wondering, is that sort of a feeling that you’re going to be at the higher end of the EBITDA range or the lower end of the CapEx range or both? Or is it some other cash flow item, like a working capital change or something like that we should pay attention to it?
Alan Armstrong: Well, yes, great question and very fair one. I would just say that on the CapEx side, we’re probably coming in towards the lower end of that range on CapEx guidance. So that’s a piece of it. And as well, I would just say we’ve got more confidence around the way that quarter has gone. And one thing is pretty interesting if you think about it, we always show our CapEx and that’s like gross CapEx number. And so when we – for instance, the JV we have now with CPP, that’s our gross CapEx that’s embedded there as that is our gross. But our capital burden obviously, is less with CPP picking up some of that capital load from us. And so that actually helps that as well a little bit.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay. No, I think maybe I had a not quite paid attention to that latter part, so I appreciate that. I’m also pivoting a little bit wanting to follow up on Spiro’s earlier question, right? You’re gathering contracts perhaps frame it more broadly than he did. As you had referenced, you renegotiated some agreements in select areas and with select counterparties in the 2015, 2016 timeframe, I think an often instances you received an upfront cash payment and then subsequently lowered the rate as per activity and preserve, I think in total your NPV. I’m just wondering, given the pullback now and the intense focus on producer activities, if you’re having similar conversations with anybody anywhere?
Alan Armstrong: No. Not that I’m aware of, Chris, I’m not – I don’t see anything out there right now. There’s certainly a lot of desire as we always have. There’s always desires with our producers to further streamline and align our interest out there. And so they’re certainly on that, but I don’t know of anything where there’d be an upfront payment kind of situation out there. And really the only thing, as we had that really was the Barnett that Total now the operator on. And so we’re constantly working with Total and alignment and especially in a low gas price environment. We work closely with them on reducing costs between the two of us out there, very healthy relationship and very positive one with Total there in the Barnett.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay, great. And then a final question for me, Alan is, we’ve obviously paid attention to, what you guys are seeking in Texas with the Exco situation, it feels like the RRC is going to make a decision here next week and I’m just curious if I could get a little bit more color from you on maybe the background there and if that’s a situation that might be replicated elsewhere if you have a producer that’s flaring on a system that already exists and how that may be dovetails into some of your ESG efforts.
Alan Armstrong: Yes, great question. When it truly is one of those things where it just doesn’t, frankly, from our perspective make a lot of sense. But it is very complex background that was originally that acreage was dedicated under the Chesapeake agreement. Chesapeake sold their mineral interest to Exco but didn’t move the dedication. And so though the cost of that – those assets remains in that cost of service calculation under the Chesapeake agreement. And so just because they sold it didn’t mean it, it changed the nature of that. The gas was physically connected to our system and had previously flowed. And so this isn’t a situation where we’re saying, hey, our pipelines sitting out there and we could connect it to you. It literally is connected. And so given that this is our gas and therefore puts off a lot of H2S – has a lot of H2S component in it. And we would put off as SO2. We think, there is lot of good reasons to be making sure that’s going on. I will say that our team has worked in a very positive manner out there with Exco, despite the conflict. We’ve been working with them in a positive way to try to contain the gas and be buying the gas from them. And so we are working on continuing to improve that relationship and be constructive as we always would. So I do think, we’re going to wind up at a constructive place on that, but it is a complex issue because that actually was – is under an old Chesapeake agreement and the cost of those facilities that we installed were under that cost of service agreements. So but as far as I’m going to take that one but we are – I would say, our move out there was just one of protecting our rights. And the contract for the Chesapeake acreage out there prohibits flaring. So you shouldn’t assume that this gets extended to further actions in the area, because it’s specifically prohibits that. So don’t really see any follow on from this.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay. Well, thanks again for the time and congrats on a steady execution. It’s certainly not been lost on us.
Alan Armstrong: Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning. Wanted to pick up on the balance sheet situation here, it seems like you guys been quite busy has been noted on the call with asset sales and strategic JVs, really accelerating that deleveraging process here. I was just wondering, if you could expand a bit more on how you see leverage kind of progressing here. I mean, if you’re bringing in 2020 CapEx coming down, as you noted, I want to see, the potential to continue to maybe divest assets in the West that don’t have – that are not contiguous and can’t have value chain integration? And possibly the ability of moving forward, hitting that 4.2 leverage target, if things come together there.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Jeremy, good question. I would just say, we’re always looking at that and I would say another driver for that, which is more value than just deleveraging because I think we’re on a very clear path in our mind to get there anyway. And so we feel pretty confident just on the natural path we’re on to getting there. However, given the value spread between what the private space is willing to pay for these cash flows, very certain cash flows versus what the public equity is valuing that. It just continues to provide an opportunity for us to gain value for our shareholders. And so I would say, even if it wasn’t for that for the deleveraging benefit that comes from that, we would be looking at those kinds of opportunities anyway. Just because we don’t feel like our gathering and processing assets are valued appropriately. In fact, I would question where we are today. I would question, if our pipeline assets are being valued appropriately. So we’ll continue to take advantage of that spread. And of course, it does have the benefits of continuing to do collaborate pretty rapidly as well.
Jeremy Tonet: That’s helpful. Thanks. And just turning over to Regional Energy here, I appreciate that you’re at a kind of commercially sensitive point in the development, but just wondering if you could expand a bit more as far as kind of a shipper interest and how you see that progressing?
Micheal Dunn: Yes. Micheal Dunn here. We had a lot of interest in that project. We are working through the scenarios of delivery points and supply points and we’re optimistic that will ultimately have a very nice project there. There were several paths that were available there to shippers submitting under the open season and we’re just evaluating the submissions that we receive and configuring, various scenarios to ultimately make a great project for a Transco and our customers there.
Jeremy Tonet: That’s helpful. That’s it for me. Thanks.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Please go ahead.
Shneur Gershuni: Hi. Good morning, guys. Maybe just start off on the Northeast guidance just to come back to it a little bit here. There’s sort of a delta in the CAGR between the volume metric growth rate versus EBITDA growth rate. And my understanding is that it’s a function of timing with respect to the contracts and the contract structure and so forth. In a hypothetical scenario where 2021, let’s say, was zero percent growth, would there still be some EBITDA carryover that would roll into 2021 in a scenario of zero growth?
John Chandler: I don’t know that we have evaluated that. I would tell you we run a pretty precise model that gets us to that. But I don’t know per certain, so I don’t want to speak out of school on that. We have competence in model we have, but I don’t want to get out on a limb without the benefit of the detailed model behind that answer. I’m not saying it doesn’t, I’m just telling you I’m not certain as we sit here.
Shneur Gershuni: Okay. That makes sense. And then secondly on the Northeast, if I read your tone correctly, it sort of sounds like you’re trying to shift towards a harvest cash flows from the Northeast and kind of adjusting time kind of CapEx approach. Is that in fact correct? And as you sort of think about projects you’re noodling, where do you expect to spend the majority of your CapEx kind of on a go forward basis?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I would say, I think we’ve always been on adjusting time mode there in the Northeast for many years now and making sure that we’re staying aligned with the customers and producers up there that are coming to us wanting additional capacity. And we’ll still continue to do that. We’re finishing up some pretty significant projects this year with the TXP-2 installation at Oak Grove that’s now online as well as their checkmark pipeline. Our Monarch pipeline, which is an NGL pipeline that goes to our Harrison fractionation complex. So we’ve got a lot of capital that, we are deploying this year that will be rapidly filling. So I guess in future years, I would say we’re going to be very responsive to the customers there. We are still talking to them about expansions. And so we’re not just in harvest mode, but we are still continuing in each one of those franchises. We talk to the customers about expansions and things they want to do up there, and seeing who has been very active on the cardinal influence systems and evaluating. There are new acres that they bought from Chesapeake and we’re excited to work with them on that as well. So I think we’ve got a lot of opportunities there to continue to look for expansions and it’s certainly going to be depended upon price with many of those producers, they’re very keen on watching the price and what they can achieve there with their net backs.
Shneur Gershuni: Great. And maybe one final question. And I’m really not sure how much you can say about the pending rate case. Sort of think about the landscape out there, it’s increasingly getting extremely difficult to build greenfield projects. I’m sure you’re aware of everything that’s going on and so forth. And so I’m sort of thinking about it, an outcome where your customers are interveners are pushing for – let’s say, a lower ROE authorization. Wouldn’t that disincentivize you to build any further? I mean they can’t force you to actually expand Transco. And does that factor into the process of the negotiations about coming to a win-win scenario? Because it’s difficult to build and at the same time you have a system in place. But if they enforce a little return on you, then you have no incentive to actually build. Just wondering if you can sort of comment about that and whether that’s something that comes into the discussion process.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I would just say it’s pretty complex issue, but maybe to bring it home to something pretty simple. The emissions reduction program that we have, which is a $1.2 billion program that benefits everybody and including directly our customers in those areas, because we reduce emissions in the areas which allows for further expansions, businesses in the area by reducing emissions, and so for their power plants, for instance. So there’s a lot of positives that come out of emissions reduction project and obviously a lot of those customers have been making those similar investments in methane, leak prevention and so forth. So they spent a lot of money on their systems under their PUCs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And I think everybody is in favor of us doing that. Getting a low return up against our portfolio of other opportunities, doesn’t really get us very far on that because we need to have economic incentive to make those investments. And so – and to your point, we have these other items and really where that nexus comes together is up against project expansions. And so if we have high return opportunities for expansion projects because things are so difficult to build, that is going to get the money up against a lower ROE. And so said another way, because somebody can’t force us to build those lower ROEs, we will have negotiated rates that generally get us to a higher rate. But that of course then just puts pressure on the capital allocation process on opportunities for those kinds of investments. And as well, things like cybersecurity and everything else that we need to invest on. So we’ve got to make sure for the health of this industry, we’ve got to make sure that those ROEs are in line with the investment opportunities across the space. And if we don’t, we’re not really – the FERC really is veering away from its responsibility to make sure that those returns are attractive enough to incentive investment in the space. And so that’s certainly a key issue as we go into those negotiations.
Micheal Dunn: I think it’s clear to say as part of that discussion and negotiation, the difficulty with building new pipe, risks that companies, pipeline companies bear, they’ll build these new assets, certainly goes into the reality that this isn’t a super low return environment. I mean, we need an appropriate return to go along with the risk, some of the timing delays and other things that go into constructing pipelines today. So, that’s certainly part of the argument.
Shneur Gershuni: Perfect, guys. Really appreciate the color. Thank you very much.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Christine Cho: Good morning. So the lower Northeast guidance isn’t that surprising, just given recent commentary out of Northeast producers? But can you talk about how you came to the lowering of your guidance? Some of your producers have publicly talked down numbers, but others less though. So can you just help me reconcile how much of it is your own estimates on what you think producers are going to do and how much of it is what producers told you that they’re going to do?
Alan Armstrong: There’s certainly small pieces in there, but I would tell you the vast majority of our information is directly in line with detailed work that we do with our producers. They can’t surprise us and want production brought online. We have to plan well in advance with them. And so while there maybe little pieces here and there, it’s pretty detailed and we keep that model up to date with the very latest work that we’re doing with producers. So Mike, I don’t know if you’d add anything to that.
Micheal Dunn: Yes. Christine, we do detailed analysis with each one of our producers. Some of the producers we meet with weekly to plan our projects and plan activities associated with either they’re well-connects that are coming online or their future expansion opportunities. So we have a very robust planning process with nearly every one of our producers up there. And that’s what we desire with every one of them and we strive for. So we do a lot of work with them in order to make sure that we’re not getting out in front of them, but we’re also meeting their needs. And we worked really hard to scale back a lot of our capital investment immediately with the producers when they told us that they were scaling back some of their turn in lines for their wells. And so we were able to very quickly take a lot of capital out of our Northeast investments that we had planned for. Therefore, that’s why we’re edging toward the lower end of our growth capital guidance just because of that activity downturn.
Christine Cho: Okay, helpful. Thank you. And then given the changes at EQT and their customer, can you just remind us how your contracts with them work, if they’re volume commitments or acreage dedication. And if you could confirm the tenure left on that contract and whether or not you expect the changes that customer to be an opportunity or a more neutral?
Alan Armstrong: Well, I would just say, the contracts are long-term in nature and they do come with an MBC, and it’s a MBC that ramps up over time. So we do have that. I’m not going to get into a whole lot more detailed beyond that. And I would also just add that a lot of the acreage that they are – that the new management group is very focused on is in the West Virginia area where we have a lot of the existing infrastructure in the area. So we’re encouraged to be working with them. We’ve got a lot to offer them, but our existing contracts are MBC based and they are long-term.
Christine Cho: Okay. And then last one for me. Can you just walk us through, when do you need all your approvals by for the Northeast Supply Enhancement project in order to hit the winter 2020, 2021 in service date?
Micheal Dunn: Yes, Christine, thanks for the question. We are working through the 401 with both New York and New Jersey right now. We would hope to have those in hand this summer and order for us to be able to then achieve the 404 permit from the Corps of Engineers. And then we intend to start construction this fall on the project. Primarily the compressor station construction would occur first. That is the really the long lead pacing item here and with all the environmental windows that are associated with the offshore construction, we slotted that construction in for next summer. So the real pacing item here is the compressor station that would be on the critical path because it’s a longer duration construction. So we would expect to have in hand a 401 certifications the summer and then certainly after that, the 404 permit would have a very small public comment period that would open up and we would have that 404 permit so that we could go to the FERC and then ask for a notice to proceed and then began construction in the fall.
Christine Cho: Great. Thank you so much for the color.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital. Please go ahead. Caller, your line is open.
Danilo Juvane: Good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in. I wanted to start with the Northeast and thank you for providing guidance for the second financial year. To the extent that you have provided this information, beyond 2020, how should we think about volumetric sensitivity as it relates to EBITDA? For instance, for a percent change in the growth rate, what does that translate to from an EBITDA standpoint going forward?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I think obviously it’s dependent on what the growth is. It’s not perfectly linear obviously. But I would just say, the ability to continue two have a higher EBITDA growth rate than volume growth rate will continue just because our cost structure is more and more efficient. Our unit cost continues to lower over time, and so as volumes go up. So that relationship, there’s not really any reason that that would stop for us. Some of the pretty significant increase that we’ve got here in the front end is based on some higher rates associated with the capital we placed. And so, you wouldn’t see a continuing increase to that rate, but the basic fundamental piece of lower unit costs with higher volume will continue to benefit that relationship.
Danilo Juvane: Thanks for that, Alan. Second one for me. The long-term 5% to 7% target growth rate, to the extent that there may be ongoing issues with NESE I mean, how – and we still sort of hit that growth rate going forward. How should we think about that?
Alan Armstrong: I’m sorry, Danilo, I didn’t quite understand which growth rate. Are you talking about 5% to 7%?
Danilo Juvane: Correct, the 5% to 7%. If there are any additional delays with NESE for instance, from a timing standpoint, is that something that’s still kind of is intact going forward?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. We’ve got – I would just say, a lot of other variables to consider other than just NESE. NESE is a very attractive project for us. But there are a number of other things, but I would certainly say that we are confident right now and that’s the occurring and that is included as we think about that 5% to 7% growth rate out there right now that is included in that. But as we mentioned, we have a lot of other things that are variables in that as well. And we tend to find a way to offset, if we did have a negative surprise on that if some time. But I would just tell you, we as a team are very confident right now in that going ahead just because we know how critical it is to that area that it does go ahead.
Danilo Juvane: Thank you. Those are my questions.
Alan Armstrong: Thanks.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Jean Ann Salisbury: Good morning. Over the past year you gained gathering market share in the Northeast, driven by Atlantic Sunrise. In your 2020 5.5% growth number, can you – do you know if you’re kind of expecting to gain market share or is that the same rate that you would expect the basin to grow and you’re just in line with that?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, we’re not counting on any new customers out there in that number. So that just off our existing base of customers, if that’s your question. Obviously, different producers have different motives and different activities that go on out there. So it’s not perfectly rate-able across the space obviously. So I don’t really know what the broad base estimation is, but I can tell you that’s just from our existing customer base that we have out there in terms of our growth rate.
Jean Ann Salisbury: Okay. That makes sense. And then just as a quick follow-up, I think in 2020 there are some Gulf of Mexico MBC rollout related to Gunflint. Can you just give any range that you have of the EBITDA decline that might be associated with that?
Alan Armstrong: We don’t have any MBCs out there.
John Chandler: We do have some deferred revenue step downs that occur and we had some fixed payments that actually declined. So call that in the tune of $75 million roughly in that range of step down between 2019 and 2020.
Jean Ann Salisbury: Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. That’s all for me.
Alan Armstrong: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors. Please go ahead.
Becca Followill: Good morning, guys. Following up on the Northeast gathering. So if I’m looking at Page 10 with your growth projects, is it fair to say that when you referenced the MBC that you have on this gathering that the Susquehanna Gathering for 2019 and 2020, and then the Bradford Gathering, those are going forward regardless that those have MBCs associated with them?
Alan Armstrong: Well, just to be clear, the most of the Susquehanna Gathering doesn’t have MBCs, it has higher gathering rates. So the gathering rates are applied across all of the volumes, not across – there’s not in MBCs to be clear in Susquehanna. Bradford on the other hand is a cost of service agreement. So that is dependent on the capital being placed. And once the capital is requested, then that goes into the rate of return calculations. So I’d say another way, it’s not volume sensitive once the capital has been put in place.
Becca Followill: So would the payback reduce your activity, these projects are still going forward?
Alan Armstrong: Yes.
Becca Followill: Okay. No change at this point. And then on the Gulf of Mexico. Can you quantify on the Norphlet pipeline that you acquired and then the incremental discovery volumes from Hadrian north and Buckskin tie backs. What kind of EBITDA those contribute?
Alan Armstrong: I don’t believe we’ve provided that detail. I think we have said that the Norphlet was a five to six multiple project for us. So you can do the math on that $200 million. And that is just against the base field out there. So there are some other nice discoveries in the area that we are very well served – very well positioned to serve, but that isn’t going to come on for the next – in the next couple of years. That’ll be beyond that period.
Becca Followill: And then finally you talked about we’ll possibly be in FID at the end of this year. But on the Page 10, it shows that as a 2022 plus. So is that – is it’s fid this years, is it still 2022 plus.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Just to be clear, my comment was our infrastructure. So our system, not speaking for the producers on that, but given our work with the producer, we would be looking to FID our work and our expansion associated the dedication’s already there. And so we would be taking action on our part based on the dedication, so just to be clear on that. So we’re not going to get ahead of Shell and Chevron on their timing on the project out there. But I would tell you it is on a very fast track within both shops.
Becca Followill: So it would still be 2022 plus per Page 10.
Alan Armstrong: Yes.
John Chandler: That page is intended to represent when we believe the project really will come into full service.
Becca Followill: Okay. Got you.
Alan Armstrong: So we’ve got a lot of work to do out there and so our FID is necessary to make sure that we’re not on the critical path.
Becca Followill: Got you. Thank you.
Operator: That concludes today’s question-and-answer session. Mr. Armstrong at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for your closing remarks.
Alan Armstrong: Okay, great. Thank you for all the good questions. We’re excited to continue to report on the breadth – overall breadth of our business and the growth going on really in all areas across Transco, across the Northeast, the deepwater. And we’re excited to see the DJ started contributing as well. We appreciate all the interest and the continued support for the company. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now ended. Thank you for your participation. You may

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-03 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the The Williams Companies First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John Porter: Thanks David. Good morning and thank you for your interest in the The Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon we released our earnings press release and the presentation, that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong will speak to momentarily. Joining us today is our Chief Operating Officer, Micheal Dunn; our CFO, John Chandler; and our Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development, Chad Zamarin. I've also mentioned that we've refined our quarterly earnings materials and our format for this call. We've adopted a clear earnings press release format and we've integrated the previous stand-alone analyst package into the earnings release documents. So we now basically have one document there rather than two. In our presentation materials you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to generally expected accounting principles. These reconciliations schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials. And so with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong: Great. Thanks John, and good morning and thank you for joining us this morning, as we discuss our first quarter financial performance and the key investor focus areas today. As John said we took a fresh look at the format and we're going to stay pretty brief and focused in our prepared remarks, to allow time for Q&A. So let's move right into the prep -- to the presentation and take a look at our first quarter 2019 results. On Slide 2, we provided a clear view of our year-over-year financial performance and the results you see reflect continued steady and predictable operational performance and strong project execution from our E&C team. And the results reflect very little direct commodity exposure, in fact our first quarter 2019 gross margin reflects 98% fee-based versus only 2% in direct commodity margins. And these contracted fee-based revenues are not dependent on basis differentials or commodity buy-sell transactions, allowing for continued predictability and durability in our cash flow streams. So taking from the top here, cash flow from operations increased 12% demonstrating significant free cash flow in the quarter when compared with the 46% reduction in the capital expenditures you see at the bottom of the slide. A much more to say about the adjusted EBITDA performance on the next couple of slides, where you can see here that it increased 7% year-over-year without adjusting for asset sales. And also you see really nice improvement of 16% for our adjusted EPS and on DCF we were up about 8% and we've also introduced DCF per share on this summary, which grew about 7% versus last year, and then lastly our very strong 1.7 times dividend coverage also increased versus the prior year. So really nice improvement on our various earning and cash flow metrics despite the impact of significant asset sales. And now let's turn to Slide 3 and review where we finished the quarter on our leverage metrics. The leverage story of the quarter end requires some unpacking, since we have significant asset sale proceeds coming in post the quarter's end. So starting on the left-hand side of the table, if you start with the debt-to-adjusted EBITDA directly from the March 31, 2019 financial statement, you get to value of 4.92 times. However that metric includes about $727 million where the purchase of the remaining 38% interest in UEOM which we funded partially with our revolver right at the end of Q1. But we'll be refunded with proceeds reserved at the closing of the UEOM, OVM, JV that we done with CPPIB, while the latter's there. If you adjust out that $727 million in cash we plan to receive at the closing of the JV, the leverage metric falls to 4.77 times. And then furthermore, if you account for the approximately $600 million of additional proceeds we will receive from CPPIB at the closing of the JV along with the $485 million we have now received from Crestwood, where the Jackalope Gas Gathering transaction, the leverage metric falls to just over 4.5. So I'll discuss the strategic transactions and leverage goals in more detail later, but now let's move on to Slide 4 to discuss the main business drivers for our year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth. On a year-over-year basis adjusted EBITDA increased just over 7% or 11%, if you adjust for asset sales. And so on this slide you can see a $37 million comparability adjustment, driven by asset sales including the adjusted EBITDA from the sale of Four Corners assets, the Gulf Coast purity pipeline and the Brazos JV accounting changes. Now moving over to look at the financial performance of the continuing business, Atlantic-Gulf led the increase with an over 20% increase in adjusted EBITDA, driven by top line revenue growth from new expansion projects including Atlantic Sunrise and Gulf Connector, really very impressive growth from the Atlantic-Gulf driven primarily by continued projects that have been going into service on a regular basis on Transco. Next up looking at the Northeast GMP area we also see just over a 20% increase in year-over-year adjusted EBITDA. This was driven by 15% higher gathering volumes and higher gathering fees associated with expansion projects. Volume increases were led by the Susquehanna Supply Hub area which grew about 25%, but we also saw a double-digit growth rates in the Marcellus South and Utica and a high-single-digit growth in the Bradford and OVM areas, so overall very nice start to the year for the Northeast GMP. Finally, we have the West which is showing about a 7% decrease in year-over-year adjusted EBITDA after adjusting for bit share of the asset sales described earlier. And that decline is primarily driven by lower NGL margins due to a temporary surge in natural gas prices at Opal, and the effects of severe winter weather affecting one of our key customers production in the Wamsutter, Wyoming field. Importantly our operations team in the area was able to keep our facilities ready and available but upstream production freezing off was the culprit in the area. Next, let's look at the sequential adjusted EBITDA growth where we saw about a 2% increase since last quarter. A modest increase in EBITDA for the first quarter of 2019 versus the fourth quarter of 2018, as you can see here on Slide 5. Of course it's important to note that there were two fewer days in the quarter which by itself is about $26 million or 2% of an impact. The Atlantic-Gulf was up about $30 million over fourth quarter, driven by lower O&M cost and Transco revenues were higher related to Gulf Connector, but lower due to Gulfstar One volumes caused by well maintenance. Northeast G&P was pretty flat to the fourth quarter, where increased revenue and lower O&M expenses were offset by lower wet Utica gathering and JV EBITDA from Aux Sable for our interest -- Aux Sable and Blue Racer midstream recall that Aux Sable is an on-off interest in a processing complex in Illinois. And as we discussed in the past, the Northeast EBITDA growth in 2019 is more weighted toward the second half of 2019, and we'll be covering the outlook for the Northeast in more detail in a moment. Finally the West is pretty stable compared to 4Q of 2018. Revenues in O&M were relatively flat sequentially and per unit NGL margins were quite a bit weaker. However on a sequential basis, those lower per unit NGL margins were more than offset by the favorable change we had in our NGL line fill evaluation margins. And as you may recall, our fourth quarter 2018 marketing margins were unfavorable impacted by the same losses in marketing inventory. So as prices move up and down, the line fill evaluation is something that swings up and down. Lastly in the West also we did see some nice sequential double-digit growth in the Haynesville. Overall volumes were flat due to the severe weather in the first quarter of 2019, again from the Wamsutter volumes which were down in 1Q from weathers, mentioned earlier. So generally Haynesville, we had some nice growth in the Haynesville, but it's pretty well offset by the long set of volume decline in increase off there. In summary, 1Q adjusted EBITDA was within 1% of our business plan overall. And as we've said before, we see the overall 2019 growth be weighted more toward the second half of the year, due primarily to the shape of the Northeast EBITDA growth. So let's move to Slide 6, where we'll spend the remainder of the prepared remarks focused on our views around some of the topics we most frequently discussed with our investors. The first item we'll be discussing is our financial status update. A lot has changed since we originally issued our 2019 guidance about a year ago. From a macro perspective we've seen our producer customers pressure to pull back on capital investment and we've seen a significant downward shift in NGL margins. We've also had five important portfolio optimization transactions including the Four Corners of DJ Basin transaction, the sale of our Gulf Coast purity business, our Northeast JV that which mentioned and most recently the sale of our Niobrara business. So lots of moving parts since we had laid out our guidance this time last year. But I'm pleased to confirm that despite these unforecasted changes, we are maintaining our guidance ranges for adjusted EBITDA DCF and dividend coverage ratio. We are actually raising our guidance for adjusted EPS to $0.95 at the midpoint due primarily to some lower depreciation expenses caused by last year's Bernard impairment and lower expected interest expense, thanks to deleveraging efforts. If you look in the Appendix at Slide 13, you can also see that we've added a DCF per share metric and provided a bridge between DCF per share and EPS. We've had lots of discussions with investors about the very significant non-cash charges that impact our EPS, so we've given more visibility in the development. On the growth capital expenditures front, we've seen quite a bit of changes since last year associated with deleveraging efforts and new projects like the Bluestem Pipeline. And as we'll discuss further in the moment, we are targeting a lowering of our CapEx in the Northeast G&P business, to respond to the producer activity in the region. So our teams are doing a really nice job of making sure that we bring that capital on just in time and don't get anything out in front of the drilling operation. So really nice work by our teams here, that are constantly operating in a very agile motive there. So when you net all of these changes we're revising our consolidated growth CapEx guidance to a new midpoint of $2.4 billion, down from the $2.8 billion midpoint that was provided with our fourth quarter earnings release. And when you factor in the new Northeast JV, our total contributions from JV partners this year take up another $120 million in addition to that $400 million reduction in the stated growth capital. And when you consider the proceeds we received from the Northeast JV and Niobrara transactions along with our excess cash after dividends, we expect to fund our 2019 capital expenditure need with operating cash flows and proceeds from these transactions. The effects of our portfolio optimization transactions along with our lower capital expenditure forecast has had a favorable effect on our 2019 year-end book debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, which we now expect to be under 4.6 times. Looking beyond 2019, we are still expecting 5% to 7% annual adjusted EBITDA growth over the long-term. So let's move on to the next topic which is an update on the Northeast growth. As you'll probably recall at our third quarter earnings call, we introduce forecasted 15% CAGR for the Northeast area gathering volumes growth for 2018 through 2021. Since then, we continue to work with our producer customers during two more forecasting cycles. And since last fall delays in outages on Mariner East and delays on major gas takeaway pipeline like MVP have dampened the realized price expectations for producers in the area on a forecasted basis. So despite this price decline, I'm pleased to say that we are still expecting to see a 15% growth rate again this year on gathered volumes and a slightly higher EBITDA growth rate for the Northeast in 2019. Most of this is on the backs of great performers like Cabin and Southwestern. But increasingly we will see the impacts of additional investments by Encino on their new Utic acreage. With the recent weakening of forecasted commodity prices of fewer producer customers have focused on tuning their drilling CapEx, directly to their free cash flows and therefore producer forecast at this point where 2020 and 2021 are very sensitive to forecasted pricing. And I think very important to note there, that a lot of the planning is done around forecasted pricing. And as prices change we see producers shifting that obviously. Right now, I would say with the pressure we've seen in local NGL prices in the area that has pulled some of the capital out of some of the wet Marcellus areas, and that is embedded in the forecast. We think it is wise and good for long-term sustainability for our producer customers to take this agile and measured approach, and we applause the capital discipline. Over the long-term we believe that demand growth ultimately will drive producer volumes. Demand from converted power generation, LNG exports and new industrial loads is continuing to grow after several years of heavy capital investment and construction. And now we are seeing a second wave as the Permian gas supplies have further convinced the world that the U.S. has sustainable low gas supplies for decades to come. As a result we don't believe that the current downturn in pricing is sustainable giving the continuous growth in natural gas demand, coupled with the discipline we have seen from the producer community. And while Permian supplies are a needed resources to help build the demand, we still have two-thirds of our gas supplies here in the U.S. being generated by gas, only directed drilling that will have to have a price signal and has become evident that we simply can't get the infrastructure build fast enough out of the Permian to keep up with the demand it continues to grow. While those fundamentals continue to support our steady and sustainable long-term growth we do want to be transparent about the producers forecast as they relate to our near-term gathering volume and growth rate using the current detailed forecast from our producers, our gathering volumes CAGR is expected to be a very impressive 10% to 15% growth through 2021. And while our EBITDA CAGR would still come out at or above 15% through the same period. Also on this front, I'm pleased to say that our capital programs are closely aligned with our producers, allowing us to reduce growth CapEx to more efficiently placed capital against the same amount of producible reserves. Though we are encouraged to see the level of EBITDA growth of our Northeast G&P business, can continue to generate even with reduced capital being applied and this combined with synergies from our new JV will allow us to place capital more efficiently than ever in this important basin. Next up, let's get an update on our deleveraging efforts. With that excellent execution this year on our portfolio optimization efforts, the Northeast JV transaction with CPPIB accomplished multiple benefits for the Company. Consolidating the UEOM and the OVM systems while bringing up immediate cash for deleveraging and aligning us with long-term strategic partner who also owns and controls one of the most important customers in the area, Encino. Encino has attracted some very experiencing capable personnel and we are excited to be forming another key mutually beneficial relationship in the region, much like we have with Cabot and Southwestern today. The Niobrara transaction allowed us to accelerate deleveraging by exiting an area that wasn't strategically connected to the rest of our business network, and this transaction was priced at the same strong mid-teens multiples, we've realized in other portfolio optimization transactions. So no changes to our long-term leverage target of 4.2, which we target to hit by the end of 2021, while maintaining the 5% to 7% annual growth targets over this period. So let's move on to Slide 7 and start with an update on the Transco rate case. As we previously discussed, we filed for an annual rate increase in our August 2018 filing. And those new higher rates went into effect on March 1. So we're currently receiving the higher cash payments from our customers subject to refund, but you won't see that reflected in our results as we're reserving the increase pending ongoing settlement negotiations. On the settlement progress front we've had two conferences recently and we'll have another in May. The negotiations are confidential as long as we remain in the settlement process, so I can't share where we stand at the counter parties at this time. I can tell you that the settlement negotiations are likely to continue for many months and could extend into the next year. We're hopeful that the settlement can ultimately be reached without the need for litigation and that the settlement would include the $1.2 billion emissions reduction investment opportunities. And we continue to present any upside from the rate case -- sorry continued to not have any of that upside build from the rate case reflected in our financial guidance. And let's also touch on the status of Transco's major growth projects here. Lots of news out there these days and questions regarding the effects of the recent Presidential Executive Order might have for our projects. Obviously Williams supports efforts to foster coordination, predictability and transparency in the federal environmental reviews and the permitting process for energy infrastructure projects. Along those lines, we were actually very impressed with the level of detail that appeared in the executive order on complex issues like the EPA's water quality certification requirements and we are appreciative of the administration's efforts and in strong support of a sustainable approach to ensuring consistent application of EPA's regulation. However, we know that any major shifts in policy is coming out, the executive order will likely be challenged by oneness of infrastructure and fossil fuels no matter how clean. We deal with these permitting challenges on a daily basis and our project development teams consistently do great job of navigating those. And so beyond presidential orders, we continue to advance our key New York and New Jersey projects like the Northeast Supply Enhancement project, the Rivervale South expansion and our Gateway expansion by demonstrating their critical importance to the markets they serve and the quality of our execution track record, as was most recently demonstrated by our teams on Atlantic Sunrise. Transco's large scale existing right of way and vast interconnection network are really the best way to bring clean, safe affordable and reliable natural gas with these Northeast population centers, that allow these regions to continue to lower the greenhouse gas emissions. And to that end, we continue to press on that 20-plus Transco projects we currently have in development, including the most recently announced Regional Energy Access project, the binding open season for our Regional Energy Access was extended from April 8 to May 8 to give shippers additional time to get the approvals they needed not for just the indication of interest, but for binding commitments. And we have been impressed with the interests the project has garnered. We are targeting a final investment decision in the third quarter of this year with pre-filing to follow. And next up, I'll touch on our growth in the DJ Basin area. Since February there has been ongoing developments in Colorado as the new executive and legislative leadership of the state took action to address oil and gas development laws. Ultimately the new legislation seems to be a much more balanced approach than what we saw last fall with the sale proposition went well, with the vast majority of oil and gas activity occurring in the industry friendly wealth county area. We welcome the shift and authority to local counties and municipalities and we will continue to monitor as regulations are developed. In fact our teams are working hard right now to keep up with the growth, supported by a long backlog of currently permitted wells. During early April, we started up our new $200 million cubic feet a day Fort Lupton III cryo and train is running very reliably and great jobs by the team getting started up safely. And construction is progressing very nicely on our teams Keenesburg I cryo that should be online in the third quarter of this year. And in February, we signed up another new pact of gas along with NGL marketing rights, right in that same area where we're continuing to develop infrastructure. So really very pleased right now with the strong demand for reliable and gathering processing services in the area, and we look forward to continued growth and support for our NGL marketing businesses including the Bluestem pipeline projects and associated upgrades at Convoy. And next on the deep water. Last but not least, we have seen a steady increase in that, pivoting the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. For a substantial new discoveries that are being made in close proximity to our assets. This is an area where our existing assets and acreage dedications give us tremendous competitive advantages and we are thrilled to see the dramatic rebound of activity that is focused on keeping costs and cycle times low by utilizing existing infrastructure like ours. This year we'll see EBITDA contributions from our Northwest projects including those from the purchase of the Northwest Pipeline and additions to our Mobile Bay processing complex, that we did last year and that is going to get paid for. Actually our Northwest Pipeline purchase gets paid for, once first oil begins later this year and we have line of sight to existing new potential business with likely FIDs in 2020, on several major projects that would lead to large incremental free cash flows on our existing assets base in 2022 and beyond. So as I promised on the introductory side, we'll try to keep things brief today. But we are pleased to be able to update you on the solid first quarter performance and great transactional progress that is accelerating our natural rate of deleveraging. With that, let's continue the discussion in our Q&A session.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Jeremy Tonet of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Jeremy Tonet: Wanted to start-off with the Northeast G&P and I was wondering if maybe you can provide a little bit more detail with the volume growth that you're talking about. Maybe some thoughts on the cadence there how you see that kind of progressing over the next several years, based on producer conversations and also kind of CapEx specific to this area? Has that lightened up at all?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, in terms of cadence I would just say right now we've got a lot of activity, a lot of wells being and pad being turned in the line right now as we speak actually here in the last month. So a lot happening out there right now, it's all over the place both in the Northeast and the Southwest. And so what's going on that, I would say in the Utica area the Encino team there has just now taking over operations of that area, and transition from Chesapeake and that we are really working closely with them to have kind of the same kind of integrated approach to development and growth development that we have with both Cabot and Southwestern, so really excited about the team they've pulled together there at Encino and our ability to work with them. In terms of kind of the cadence there, I would just say certainly, Cabot intending to lead the way with development with 20% kind of growth. And so I would the Northeast PA continues, they have continued to invest with or support our expansions of further expansion on our gathering systems out there. And of course we're very interested in additional takeaway capacity out of the area, given the big reserves and the low cost reserves they have in the area. But I would say in the Northeast there really hasn't been anything other than just continued steady performance by Cabot, and we're starting to see that kind of spread in to some of the other areas as well like in the Bradford area. So Northeast, so I think is very predictable and steady. The areas that have more I would say volatility in terms of ups and downs and perhaps things are little more reactive -- the prices is in the west gas areas like I mentioned earlier, both the Marcellus wet and the Utica wet. And a lot of that, I would tell you is driven by pretty sharp price -- realized price decline on NGLs that were associated with the Mariner East up and down, in the course of now hoping for expanded capacity out of their own Mariner East 2. So I would say that the pricing forecast on NGL has been difficult to predict. And of course the gas takeaway situation particularly with the MVP has been pushed back a little bit as well. So I think those things will resolve themselves as we get in. Obviously as we get into 2020, I think those things will resolve themselves. But we are seeing those producers be very responsive and I would say very strict about living within their cash flows and their forecasted cash flows. Of course that requires them to forecast prices. But I think that's what we can look to in terms of signals there. Our drilled outflow continues to be pretty robust for both the Southwest PA and the Utica area, a lot of new capital. But we're finding ways to really trim that back, and have a capital come on just in time, as the production comes on and so that's what you see we requested in some of our capital pullback and redemption in capital, that you see here in our guidance.
Jeremy Tonet: That's helpful. Thanks for that. And turning to UEO-OMV the combination there, just wondering if you might be able to provide a little bit more detail as far as some of the synergies you see, bringing those two assets together as far as capital efficiency improvements.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Great question. It's reeling on two fronts. First of all, the very simple front there, is on the liquids front, so we have the Moundsville fractionator sitting there, that has been running right up against its maximum capacity and we had some investments, that was going to be required there to continue to operate that facility, and to expand it. And now we're going to enjoy being able to put those liquids through our new pipeline that we're building over to the Harrison fractionator. And so, we'll be taking those liquids over to the excess capacity, big excess capacity that exists at the Kensington fractionator. And so they were sitting there a lot of the latent capacity on the fractionation side, and better markets there at the Kensington area. So effectively allows us to shift our focus of growth for fractionation and reduce any investment required at Moundsville, and quickly take that capital out of our capital plan, so that's the simple side, on the more complex side we also are looking at ways to take advantage with the excess processing capacity that UEOM enjoys. And we're starting to run up on the capacity constraints there at OVM. And if growth continues there we'll be looking for ways to move volumes over to UEO as well. So those are kind of some of the obvious issues, obviously there is management consolidation and overhead consolidation, that's beneficial to us. But a lot of it really just has relates to being able to take capital out of our plan that would have otherwise been in there.
Jeremy Tonet: That's really helpful. Thanks. And last one if I could, it seems like NESE could really lower CO2 emissions by displacing dirtier fuels. Just wondering how that messaging is resonating in the communities that you're looking to operate in there? When do you see kind of the path forward at this point as far as permits been -- when construction could start there?
Micheal Dunn: We absolutely think that NESE is a key piece of the puzzle in the New York city and New Jersey metropolitan to reduce emissions especially CO2 emissions, it's very dramatic in regard to the emissions profile of the fuel oil. It's currently being used and converted to natural gas up there. And we're going to be a key part of that, continuing opportunity to convert. If NESE gets approved and we think it will and gets built. The permitting process is currently in the late stages here. We expect to receive a FERC certificate for that project any day now. And the 401 Certification deadline in New York was mid-May. And then the 401 Certification deadline in New Jersey is mid-June. So we would expect several of those permits to come to the forefront here in rapid fashion.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Shneur Gershuni of UBS. Please go ahead.
Shneur Gershuni: Just sort to follow up on the Northeast questions a little bit. Your first and foremost just the consolidation of UEO into Williams or the UEO transaction rather. Is that sort of change your weighted average growth rate kind of beyond 2019? And when you talked about being able to take down CapEx what you've done materially for this year, does this CapEx efficiency benefit roll into 2020 and beyond?
Alan Armstrong: And first of all on the gathering volume fees it really doesn't change that, because remember we're already operating the gathering systems that feed into UEOs, so those gathering volumes would have already been in there, so their drilling not any change on that UEO, is primarily just the fractionation of processing facilities downstream to that. So that's really no change from that. So that's really no change from that. On the question about capital savings going forward, I would say a big chunk of the capital savings and the synergies are actually now forward-looking as we take advantage of being able to balance between the two processing complexes and the liquid. So actually a lot of the capital is even more -- lot of the gathering capital really won't change that much. If you think about, that it's really on the processing and fractionation capital, that will be able to shift volumes into areas that would not have put expansions into, I think it would --.
Shneur Gershuni: Great color. Just another follow-up kind of a bigger picture question. You sort of talked about in your prepared remarks about a longer-term growth rate of 5% to 7% for EBITDA. Can you talk about what kind of capital program would be needed to support that type of long-term growth rate? And could we assume it would be funded at least 50% from internally generated cash flows?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. And I'll maybe have John Chandler take that in terms of where we would go with that. As we said the $2.5 billion to $3 billion, assuming a little more moderated returns than we've been enjoying, generates that 5% to 7% growth rate. And so obviously as we can high-grade our investments that improves, and bring in synergies like we're doing on these JVs. But generally that $2.5 billion to $3 billion is what we think it takes to grow that 5% and 7%. And I'll let John talk about the funding.
John Chandler: I think that's fair. As we look forward in our projections today, using -- this $2.5 billion, you use that as the number, a tight expansion capital. And as we look to our forecast, we're able to fund that completely and entirely through excess cash flow. And obviously some new leverage in the future but with the growth of our EBITDA we're able to maintain and continue to lower our leverage ratio going forward. And fund that capital exports, that kind of EBITDA growth.
Shneur Gershuni: So with your -- effectively once you hit your leverage target, will there then be room to consider share repurchase business while also?
John Chandler: We had to talk about that once we get there. There is still work to do obviously between 4 -- under 4.6 to 4.2, there is still quite a bit of work for us to do. So I think we've got time to talk about that, but certainly when we get to the point where our leverage targets or where they need to be, we will be generating a significant amount of excess cash flow.
Alan Armstrong: Yes, so I would just say on that front, we'll see what the markets look like when we get to that point. But -- and so is kind of hard to answer that, because we're speculating on what the returns would be on that investment versus our other investment. But I can't tell you we're constantly allocating out capital return project, that a lot of the industry would accept. And so I think, there will be a balance there between increased capital investment opportunity, is another thing we can do with that capital. And like I said, we're constantly allocating away projects today as we continue to press on deleveraging the business.
Shneur Gershuni: Okay. And one last question if I may. Your excitement level about the Gulf of Mexico seems to be increasing. You sort of touched on your prepared remarks, but I was wondering if you can sort of expand on the opportunities that you see there and how we can -- should be thinking about it on a go-forward basis?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I would just say, the opportunities are getting to be so clinical -- that kind of get hard to keep track honestly -- but some of very certain opportunities exist around the Gulf, West, our operations around the Perdido area. Obviously, the well prospect out there is going to be a big mover for us. And Shell just announced a little bit earlier this month or sorry in April the Blacktip discovery which is also another very large discovery in that Perdido belt area. And then to the south of that of course, the Mexico Perdido is even a much larger kind of where a magnitude opportunity, that we're extremely well-positioned for. So on the Western Gulf it's going to be a matter of maximizing our return on the investments. There is plenty of production to fill up our existing capacity and then to more. And so really important opportunities for us out there, and we're just extremely well-positioned both contractually and with the infrastructure that we have in place out here today. If you move over to Gulf East of course, really excited about the Ballymore prospect that will likely get produced across the Blind Faith -- Chevron Blind Faith platform. And that's also a very large find there. And again just big free incremental cash flows coming our way with very little to no capital on our part, so we're excited about that. And then the Northwest prospect while we kind of thought that was almost singular as an investment. Originally, we like the returns just singularly across that one field. We've seen a lot of new development out there around the North -- not just by Shell but also by Chevron, now in that area. And so, what's going on in the central Gulf, lots of new opportunities. The LLOG-Repsol JV will bring some promise to us in the area, and a lot of new development is going on there as well. So I'm not even getting into the multitude of the smaller projects that have been in our way. But a lot of the reason that I think we're so fortunate is that in the past, what we saw was producers really looking to add big reserves, and when oil was $80 to $90, as they were enjoying prior to '14, there wasn't so much focus on the use of existing infrastructure to keep cost down. But now with the lower prices we're seeing a huge focus on utilizing existing infrastructure. And therefore that means we're not having to build a bunch of new capital, it's just development in and around our existing assets and that is really good for us and really good for the industry as a whole. And so I would say, if I was going to describe one big change from the last time we saw the deepwater take off, that is really it. But there is this intense focus on the utilization of the existing infrastructure. And of course that, when you are -- already have a lot of the big gaps infrastructure in the deepwater that bodes very well.
Micheal Dunn: Yes, I'd like to add to that -- on the opportunity, so that was a great negotiation for us to have with Shell there where we acquired the pipeline that they build, it was pretty negotiated with the return. And we're obligated obviously to move their gas to shore through our Mobile Bay facilities, where we have percent of liquids contract with them to process that gas. But the strategic value there additionally to us is the fact that pipeline won't be full. And from day one we can go out and acquire other business to bring through that with subsea tie-backs into that Northwest pipeline, that will purchase upon first gas movement there. So a great opportunity for us to take advantage of that facility, that it's already been build, so the construction risk is taken away, as well as the timing risk has been taken away, because we don't pay for it until the gas flows.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Christine Cho of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Christine Cho: Good morning, everyone. You guys have talked about wanting to consolidate Northeast for some time. And obviously the UEOM tend to actually test you in that direction. How should we think about the potential for Blue Racer to be included under that umbrella?
Alan Armstrong: Great question, Christine as always. And I would just say the -- a lot of value in that combination, we're working through some various transactions to try to extract some of that other than through direct control of the asset. But certainly a lot of opportunity there. But I would just say we haven't been able to get there from a price standpoint, we haven't been able to get to what we thought it make sense for us on that. And so I would say lots of opportunity, but we remain patient and will remain patient with making those combinations. So, but I do see some opportunity just contractually to continue to find ways to utilize common facilities out there and I think that's a -- step in the middle if we can't reach agreement on a broader transaction.
Christine Cho: Okay. And then you guys are tracking to get to your targeted leverage faster than planned. Should we think that there are any other non-core aspects that you're contemplating selling? Or is this sort of it?
Alan Armstrong: Well, I would just say we're always -- look we continue to see this big spread between what our stock is trading for, versus what these assets are selling for. So if we can do those kind of transactions in a way that don't dilute our future and our -- and stand in a way of accomplishing our strategies then we'll continue to look through those. But we don't have anything specific on the drawing boards. And I think as we said forth, I think looking to our strategy and looking to how things link in our asset base, is not because we have some written rules, that says we have to have the downstream business for it to be a core asset. But when it comes to placing capital and new capital it's competing in this capital allocation process, that we're constantly running. If it doesn't enjoy the downstream benefits and the coupon that both from a downstream benefit, the incremental returns just don't stand out. And so, Niobrara is actually a perfect example of that. The returns just on the stand-alone G&P basis there, just didn't stand up well within our capital allocation program. So we had both partners and customers -- frustrated with our lack of interest in investing at those return levels. And wasn't for any reason other than a distant stack up within our capital allocation process. And so that's why we are fixated on that and just because those areas that are in growth tend to drive those higher returns, and therefore make it through our capital allocation process. So I think that's about as much as I can tell you. Do we have site and then check where at this time, the answer is no.
Micheal Dunn: I would also say though there is possibly cheap money looking for opportunity out in the marketplace and very similar to our Four Corners asset. We get approached by the market all the time on asset. So again to Alan's point, well we don't have anything specific thing targeted and we're constantly being approached.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Gabriel Moreen of Mizuho.
Gabriel Moreen: I just had a quick question on the Transco rate case and some of the associated details around that. It seems like you timeline there has been extended, around settlement discussions. Can you just talk a little the decisions to kind of keep going with some discussions and having extended timeline here fairly considerably, I assume you're pretty confident in terms of your position there, so why not a move -- to maybe litigate a little bit earlier than end of 2020? And related to that, the -- emissions reductions expanded at Transco. Is there, is that going to be part of the rate cast or separated out and is that something you would spend before the rate case was concluded?
Micheal Dunn: I wouldn't say it's necessarily extended out per se, it's just a process we have to go through in front of a administrative law judge there and regards to trying to reach resettlement. So we think it's prudent to continue that process, until we reach impasse with our customers, but we certainly not there yet. So we're rapidly working with them to try to come to a settlement that both sides appreciate and like. But it certainly doesn't mean we won't be willing to litigate that, we would impasse and certainly the administrative law judge will assist us in getting there. Hopefully, quickly, so that we can don't move on to litigation path, that settlement is not, where we ultimately end up, but we would love to have a settlement with our customers there, we think it's a proper way to -- hopefully to achieve a good outcome for both sides. But, we're not afraid of litigation path as well. Specifically on the emissions reduction, so the way we've contemplated that it would be a separate tracker as we spend the capital, we would basically change the rate upwards to accommodate the compression that's been replaced there. And it's really just allows us to do that, as if we were going through a rate case, so to speak. Without having to go for a rate case we'd be able to increase those rate, as we deploy that capital to reduce those emissions along the Transco pipeline system. And so it's ultimately we don't get the emissions tracker, that would make it more likely that we would have more rate cases coming, to be able to accommodate those emissions reductions projects within our rates.
Gabriel Moreen: And then maybe if I can just get more of an update sort of on Bluestem and how discussions are going on that? It looks there, recent oil prices has been motivating customers a little bit more. And to what extent you're looking at partners there? Where it may stack up sort of on the returns profile or within your capital backlog?
Chad Zamarin: I would just say, we continued to work on projects in the Permian to Transco markets. But we've seen recent dislocation in basis from the basin obviously to the coast. But if you look at the forward curves, I think the market has been a little slow to recognize, that might be long-term sustainable. So we're going to be really, I think cautious in ensuring that any project that we would proceed with this -- is one and that has really solid fundamentals and economics. I think if we were to move forward it would be with partners. We are not looking to make an investment of that scale, out of the basin on our own. And ultimately I think, what's important to us is to continue to build Transco's market connectivity both on the supply and on the demand side. And so we believe those volumes ultimately wants to get to the best market and so we think Transco offers those very best market. So again, we continue to explore participating in a project from the Permian to the Gulf coast. We have volumes, with our partnership with Brazos Midstream that we can leverage for the purpose of benefiting and improving a project. But again I think the economics that we've looked at, at least the date on the project that have gone forward and that have been contemplated haven't yet met our expectations, alongside the inventory of opportunities that we have. And so we'll continue to work it. And again, I think the most important thing for us to be -- we make sure that Permian gas has a good home to come to along our Transco market.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Colton Bean of Tudor Pickering Holt & Company. Please go ahead.
Colton Bean: Good morning. Actually, just a follow-up on the Bluebonnet discussions there. Have you seen any shift in producer willingness to flare given kind of the extreme focus on ESG for the upstream community over the last couple of months?
John Chandler: Yes, I think we continue to see quite a bit of flare, but I do think the producers are interested in getting gas to market. I think they're looking forward to release coming later in the year, when the first long-haul project comes online. We've seen significant volumes shut-in, in the alpine high area. And so we have seen, I think restrictions associated with gas prices in Waha. So I think we get a lot of questions around with this large, the basis is why we haven't seen a stronger move toward the additional project. I think what we're seeing is, it takes, as Alan mentioned in his comments, it takes a lot of time and effort to create infrastructure that can move all the way from West Texas to the market. And so, I think we'll continue to see a desire to reduce flare, but the options today are either shutting in or waiting for infrastructure to be built and it take some time. We think another project needs to get built, but again if you look at the curve, the forward curves from basis from Waha to Henry Hub, right now, those prices don't support an investment in a long-haul pipeline. So until we see producers and end market users willing to step-up for a longer terms and better economics. And I think we'll continue to see challenges in the basin.
Colton Bean: Got it. And just circling back to the Q1 results here. So on the downtick in the Atlantic-Gulf operating expense, is that a function of timing on the maintenance spend? Or is there something more structural or nature to point too?
Micheal Dunn: Yes, this is Michael. It's not really, it's more of -- we had some one-off issues last year, that specifically in our unregulated business with turbine overhauls and things of that nature, that contributed to that higher expense in the comparable quarter in 2018. So it's not really a structural issue, it's just a timing issue of activity.
Colton Bean: Got it. And so 2018 was probably an elevated level and this maybe a better look at the go-forward rate?
Micheal Dunn: Well, I'm not going to be predictor of go-forward rates with the exception of saying that, it is lumpy, because of timing and specific terminal overhauls. They're pretty expensive, a couple of million dollars to terminal overhauls and it have to be done at certain intervals of run time hours. And so we have to accomplish those and we had the run time hours, and so it's highly dependent upon the run time of the equipment. For example, when we have to do those, and we have emerging problems, we have to go take care of. And I would also say in 2018 quarter we also did a lot of work on our reciprocating compression on the Transco system, that had to be accomplished as well. So it's just a timing of overhauls aspect and it's highly dependent upon run time.
Colton Bean: And just a quick final clarification here. For the $400 million reduction of the capital program, I think you all noted previously that around $90 million was associated with Jackalope. So is the balance of the entirety there solely attributable to the Northeast? And as we think about the Northeast, Alan I think you mentioned a just-in-time element for some of the reductions. Does that imply that any of this has shifted to 2020? Or should we think about it more in terms of the processing discussion you outlined?
Alan Armstrong: First of all, it's combination on the last part of your question. It is a combination of stuff getting pushed out, as well as ability to not have to for instance, continue to expand at Oak Grove and Moundsville. So yes it's getting pushed into '20 but you'll see some of the benefit of synergy show up in '20 would offset that. And then finally on your question of the $90 million, the Jackalope $400 million elsewhere. Well, I just say a lot of moving parts, of course we had a little bit of cost in there for getting on with the fractionation at Bellevue, as well as Bluestem, who is going in there. Some capital coming out of the Northeast and some lower capital for the year, just as these projects, we always have a lot of contingency built into these projects, and those push out and get closer, you saw we advanced one of our Transco projects in the 2020. And so we're actually seeing really good performance on that front. But for the most part, it is coming out of the Northeast, but not all.
Operator: We will now take our next question from T.J. Schultz of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
T.J. Schultz: On the executive order, you guys highlighted what's your expectation from the DOE, is it worse to submit report just on timing to get more clarity around that? And any input you all are having on that process?
Alan Armstrong: Well, obviously on the Presidential Executive Order, first of all we were really impressed with the work that was done by the various attorneys -- staff attorneys around EPA. I think everybody recognize that the -- some of the so called guidelines and I'll use quotes around that, term guidelines had been put in place during the Obama administration, that has become treated almost like rules by the state and in fact, there never really been a regulatory process to establish that. And I think the appropriately the EPA administration is regardless of which part of the affiliation you're interested in. I think they thought, that was not proper administration and regulation and so they're trying to bring clarity to that. And I think exactly what we've been asking for, we haven't been asking for easier regulations, we've been asking for clear and consistent regulations. And that's exactly what we thought the order tried to address without overreaching toward any one particular project. So it's something that need to be cleaned up. And if you really dig into that, it's actually a very astute and a detailed approach to it, that we really applaud. I think it's exactly big step in the right direction and it's obvious to us, and there was great experts involved in that. So well, I don't see it being a miracle tier for anyone of our particular projects that we have out there right now. I do see it as a big step in the right direction for bringing clarity and consistency between how the states and the Fed still with Clean Water Act regs within the EPA. So pretty impressed frankly with sophistication of that work.
T.J. Schultz: Okay. It makes sense. Just one more, you mentioned on Bellevue a couple of times, may be ignoring timing on end service, they've built a lot of that project. Assuming they get to Station 165, you talked about synergy, has that moved into commercializing anything at this point, if they have to wait on firmer in-service, just any color on the benefits there see you all. Thanks.
Micheal Dunn: Sorry, just to clarify you were talking about Moundsville pipeline is that correct?
T.J. Schultz: Yes, sorry about that. Moundsville pipeline.
Micheal Dunn: Okay. Yes, thank you. This is Michael. Just seeing what the Moundsville pipeline backers have said about their project, obviously they feel certainty in regard to completing their project. And we're obviously watching that very closely along with them. And ultimately we'll get Station 165 area and they're very likely should we take way opportunities for us, from that point on the Transco system, once that project gets closer to some certainty there. So we're certainly looking at that and willing to take on any customer-related projects, that would like to move that gas away from the Station 165, we certainly think there is opportunity to do that.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Jean Ann Salisbury from Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Jean Ann Salisbury: Hey, good morning. It looks like latest growth into Transco from the Northeast Marcellus, around 4.5 Bcf/d including Atlantic Sunrise. Is that effectively the max capacity for Transco there? Is there anyway that you could take more gas than you paid for -- just a compression anything like that?
Micheal Dunn: Obviously say, there is -- just to remind everybody on that. Transco's capacity is fully sold, so it's consistently sold out of the [Technical Difficulty]. And so really what we're talking about is just the interrupt, just lows and how much we can physically flow during the period and that's very dependent on local loads where the gas need to be delivered to. And so there is a lot of variables that go into play there. But I would say generally, we are constantly maximizing capacity out of that basin right now, because the margin support that. But a lot of that is managed by the shippers, in other words they're the one who is dictating where they want to move the gas to and from. So a lot of that has been calculated by them. But I think that's where I would say every day we're optimizing as much as we can move that, that area.
Jean Ann Salisbury: Okay. That's helpful.
Micheal Dunn: [Indiscernible] are staying full like Atlantic Sunrise has virtually been full almost since day one. So that does bode well for the future opportunities to move additional expansion volumes out of there with new projects. So Regional Energy Access, Jean Ann, Regional Energy Access though takes advantage of a lot of existing infrastructure as does the Leidy South project, that we're working on for National Fuel Gas and for Cabot. And in so there is obviously some pretty easy expansions out of the area, relatively the project seems better working on that [Indiscernible] we got a lot of compression, we can do and a little bit of looping to do -- to add capacity out of that area.
Jean Ann Salisbury: That's really helpful. Thank you. I mean, do you still have any spare capacity in gathering in the Haynesville, I mean perhaps in the Eagle Ford or is your system pretty much maxed out there?
Micheal Dunn: I'll say in the Haynesville we bumped up against the top-end, there quite often as well pads come on. We get maximum capacity there last year and continue to find new volumes coming in there, that would try to max capacity. So we're pretty maxed out of Haynesville from time-to-time and it's highly dependent upon, from the [Indiscernible] on those wells. And then the Eagle Ford we continue to have new well connect opportunity there as well. And we continue to expand our systems there as needed for the producer customers out there. Most of that requires additional compression when we bring that online and some new well connect capital equivalent and possible looping. So it's just highly dependent upon where the producers are drilling their pad. Yes, -- system like the Haynesville, that system actually has South and North, component to it. And so what you might see one part of the system get loaded up, the southern part, maybe more than the north sometimes or vice versa, that really dictates. So it's not like, it's a processing plant, we just have a fixed amount of capacity through the plans, the system, the capacity is very dependent on where the gas goes up. But our team has done a really nice job out there, working with other midstream operators in the area, they use up capacity to be able to cross haul between systems and they continue to do that. On the Eagle Ford we would remind you that, that is a cost of service agreement. And so that as we add capital there that gets covered in our rates where the Haynesville is not, it's not that setup.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Michael Lapides: I'll be quick. I know there has been a bunch on both MVP and ACP. Hypothetically is ACP and let's say even if MVP didn't go through, meaning got stuck in the court system, bogged down for a lot longer or cost creep inflated to a point making it untenable. How do you think about the solutions that Williams could offer into Virginia North and maybe in the South Carolina? And the ability the timeline to realize some of those solutions?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, Michael, obviously it's topic that's been getting a lot of discussion. We have a lot to offer, in terms of distributing the product with gas to market whether it's healthy, what would be the ACP, Eastern system or moving supplies to them. We have -- we do have a tremendous amount to offer with our existing lighter weight. MDP is more just kind of a downstream issue so to speak, because obviously they're getting across the trial with those supplies. And so that's really struggled there. But, I would say, we have a lot more to offer ACP in terms of meeting their market distribution goals. And as the MDP, they need, they're going to need some market distribution as they do get across the trial and we're well-positioned to help them out with that. So that's how I describe that. Obviously in this environment I think it's important for all of the industry participant to try to utilize as much as existing facilities as possible, keep the cost down and that's what we're very focused on in both those cases.
Michael Lapides: But if ACP for some reason or another didn't get completed, how much new infrastructure, or new steel in the ground, how much significant new pipe would you have to build especially to get it? To get the gas into North Carolina? I'm just trying to think about the infrastructure requirements and the timeline to deliver them.
Alan Armstrong: I would say we have a lot of -- lots of [indiscernible] already into some of those markets, but it is significant in terms of the investment, it's not, it's obviously quite a bit lower cost by using the existing facilities. But it would be pretty significant investment required and it's very dependent on where the supply comes from. So a lot of variables here depending on where the supply comes from. But if you just showed up with the supplies along that 155 to 194 corridor, we have a lot of ability to help distribute that gas into the market.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Justin Jenkins of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Justin Jenkins: Great. Thanks. Just one follow up for me. Just if you take the 1Q run rate per CapEx for a bit below the full year guide, so is it more balanced throughout the rest of the year here? Or is it back end driven? Maybe just to hop on the cadence of the CapEx if you could?
Micheal Dunn: Yes. This is Michael. Say in Q1 you can't say $10 million is the run rate because our construction projects really ramp-up in the second and third quarter of the year, that our growth projects that we're working on. So we're still within the ballpark of our guidance suggestion that we put out there, with the information that came out this week, and it will ramp-up as the summer construction season heats up.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Chris Sighinolfi of Jefferies. Please go ahead sir.
Chris Sighinolfi: Hi everyone. Thanks for the call this morning. Alan you guys have been very active since analyst day a year ago with asset sales, JV rationalizations and clearly a focus on deleverging. I guess, I have two questions stemming from all of that. The first is to follow up on Shneur's earlier question about your longer-term 5% to 7% annual EBITDA growth guidance. Just curious how to interpret your longer-term place in for periods beyond 2019, just wondering maybe how you or John will think about the outlook versus the forecast contained in the WTZ S-4 last summer?
Alan Armstrong: Well the WTZ S-4 for last summer, I wouldn't pay much attention to the financial information. We had to do a fair amount of talking through that, that wasn't obviously meant for marketing purposes. So as we look at our forecast today, again back to our earlier point, as we look at our forecast today, over the next two to three years and we look at a capital spend of around $2.5 billion on expansion capital. Again we continue to see our deleveraging and at the same time we see this level of EBITDA growth of 5% to 7% range. So I really wouldn't put too much put much weight on the WTZ document.
John Chandler: Yes, I would just say Chris on that, we are focused on delivering on both of those ends both on the 5% to 7% growth, as well as deleveraging. And we're constantly balancing that, and obviously being able to sell assets that -- well at high multiples is pretty attractive way to get there. But we also are very focused on making sure we have plenty of reinvestment opportunity to drive that growth of 5% to 7% growth. And so far I would say, we're very comfortable about our ability to continue to face that capital. Project just continue to develop that, moving on pretty nicely. And within this period I would tell you that the one sizable project that's developed is Regional Energy Access project that's come along very nicely and with a lot of strong support all of a sudden. So I think we're really doing pretty good about the opportunity -- the high return investment opportunity continue to come. And as we get into the 2022 timeframe the deepwater -- this isn't speculative on our part, the deepwater cash flows there are going to be pretty big, because the FIDs for those projects are moving ahead and a lot of that business will be coming through this. And so lot of that's part of the [Indiscernible] exactly the size of that and exactly how much those projects are out there and are coming on our way. So we've doing very good about the ability to see that kind of growth rate and continue deleveraging, but we are managing both of those as we think about the transaction. I mean obviously we continue to take -- even though we saw in somewhat maybe a long-term view of growth in the Northeast volumes from 15% CAGR to 10% to 15%. Again we still see robust EBITDA growth coming out of the Northeast. We've got a number of projects, if you look in our slide deck in our index, number of Transco projects coming on into this year and next year that will be adding the EBITDA. And of course those are the same as DJ Basin assets that we have had acquired last -- late last year, there is a significant ramp up in growth coming from that as well.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay, and one clarification on that John, just my own purposes, it's very clear that you omitted any Transco rate case related impact on the formal 2019 guidance. But as we think about 5% to 7% over the next couple of years is it safe to assume that if you get a positive outcome there in that period of time, that's additive to that range or maybe puts you higher up in the range?
John Chandler: It would put us higher up in the range.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay. And then I guess that's very helpful. And my second question very much appreciate the reading or the presentation materials and something that we always acknowledged but illustrates clearly, I think it's Slide 13 it's just the significant non-cash items that 2% of drag to EPS. And I guess I'm just curious, are there additional transactions or impairments for restructuring, that you could do maybe trim some of those items for the benefit of EPS? Just we got a lot more questions from investors about the EPS, I'm assuming, you do to, and I'm just wondering what more could be done on that front? Thanks.
John Chandler: That's a weird commentary for a CFO to look for impairments, but it is something obviously that to the extent we could have that, it would benefit our depreciation -- by lowering our depreciation which is way out of line with our maintenance capital. There is really not a lot we can do on that front, absent to the extent we partner on assets that we consolidate today. That and to the extent we move the assets from a consolidation to a non-consolidation type approach to maybe partnering through JVs. That potentially could allow us to revalue assets and impair, and bring that depreciation level down. Anything short of that though, any of the test or impairment is based on gross cash flows, and well a lot of these assets got marked up to really high-value, back in the Access, Midstream merger, which was not a cash deal which is stock-for-stock trade but it forced us to revalue a lot of the Access assets at a very high valuation level. While those are at a high level, the gross cash flow still exceeds those book value. So anything short of actually some system kind of partnership for JV that would force some level of deconsolidation, that's the only thing that allows really to help bring that depreciation down.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate it. I know, it's a line of questions for you. The focus seems to fully changed. And it seems like that the reason [indiscernible] in Northeast maybe our structure [indiscernible] as well. So, just, that was where I was --. Appreciate it.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Craig Shere of Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.
Craig Shere: Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered. I did have a quick one. Alan you commented on the weak wet gas, in Marcellus and Utica in terms of recent trends, and NGL pricing looks like Blue Racer had a pretty tough quarter. How do you see all those impacting the pace at which your new West Virginia panhandle processing might fell off over the next couple of years?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I think Craig, the investment we have there feel pretty good about that filling up. And it is as I mentioned earlier we got a lot of pads being turned online, and so really starting to see that come off. It doesn't -- it didn't a lot, big as those patents are, to make progress on that front. And we had some contracts coming our way that are shifting volumes our way. So feel pretty good about the TXP-2, the existing base capacity plus TXP-2 and we were able as a result of this synergy and knowing we have excess processing capacity, the UEO, that takes -- puts us in a position to not have to prebuild any capacity out in front and don't grow any further. So this energy or the -- as I mentioned earlier one of the nice things about that synergy is that, it prevents us from having to put capital in place to build out in front of those increasing volumes, because we do have alternatives that where we can ship those volumes to, but preserve the cash flows from it. And so I would just say, that gives us a lot more breathing room and allows for better capital efficiency as it relates to the OVM processing capacity. And so we intend to take full advantage of that.
Craig Shere: Sounds good. So your TXP-2 is basically contracted up -- that slowdown is not really going to impacted but your derisk, the fact that you don't need new capital because you have the ability to work between basins?
Alan Armstrong: Right. Correct.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Tim Schneider of Citi. Please go ahead.
Tim Schneider: Some -- just real quick. From my seat, I would say the biggest debate points among investors is capital allocation for companies in the midstream space. So I'm just kind of wondering how you guys look at the strategically, when you get together kind of bouncing growth, delevering and returning cash to shareholders over the longer-term and I think you said kind of the -- to leverage target, but what you think the right leverage is for a company with the asset mix of Williams? is that something that should go below 4x, are you happy kind of being in the low 4s, just interested in your thoughts here.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I would just say our asset mix, just we don't have a lot of -- very little business that's marketing based, is not basis differential based, it's not the term optimization that gets you to often around the assets, which is trading around the assets. We don't have that kind of variability per cash flow. And I bet you can see that with the remarkable predictability to our cash flow streams, that continues to flow. So no, I don't think they ought to get -- mark all the same, but I would say that the rating agencies have told us that, on their basis, it's a 4.5x kind of number to be BBB flat, and we want to be there be confidently there, at BBB flat level. And so that for 4.2x mark on kind of a steady run-rate basis is what we are seeking that because that happens to be coincidental with that BBB flat side from the rating agencies.
Tim Schneider: I mean, I guess if you guys are getting feedback from the investment community, do you really want to see something more of 4x, is that something that you would aim for in that case? Or do you think, well let's just kind of go with what the rating agencies are saying?
Alan Armstrong: I would just say from my own personal perspective on that. I think they're tend to be fads that move through the investment community. And I think from our vantage point keeping our debt costs down and capacity to flex when we need to, is what we're targeting from the business trajectory. And I think we think that's really the smart place for us. And I think the market has to figure out, and it should figure out, who has volatility in their cash flows and who doesn't, and that ought to be driving the number, that each company should aspire to not just because somebody magically came up with a 4x number.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Alan Armstrong for any additional or closing remarks.
Alan Armstrong: Okay. Well, great, thanks everybody. Great questions as always and we appreciate the opportunity to visit with you on this. Really excited about the continued very predictable way our business is running, and the way our teams are executing on projects. So look forward to speaking with you in the future and at the next quarterly call. Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-14 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Williams Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations, and please go ahead, sir.
John Porter: Thanks, Amy. Good morning, and thank you for your interest in The Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to you momentarily. Joining us today is our Chief Operating Officer, Micheal Dunn; our CFO, John Chandler; and our Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development, Chad Zamarin is with us as well. In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. And these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials. And so with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong: Great. Good morning, everyone. Thank you, John. I'm going to start a little bit with the macro conditions that continue to support our strategy so well. So if you think about our continued focus on natural gas demand and how that's driving our strategy and you look at actually what's occurring, we really saw it start to accelerate in '18 as we saw an 11% increase in overall natural gas demand. And as I'll remind you, that's on top of a big demand that we had in '17 as well and we also have another expected 5% increase by most of the forecasters now for North America, so demand growth on top of demand growth on top of demand growth. But if I put that in perspective for you, it really is starting to -- what is happened is -- what we expected to happen, which is not just the U.S. but all of the world is really starting to try to take advantage of the U.S.'s ability to get gas out of the ground at such a low cost. So just to think about that 11% increase that we had this year, I think it's helpful to put that in perspective and something we can all relate to and that is that 11% increase was greater than all of the dry gas production from the Permian in 2018. So just here in one year, we've had an increase that's greater than all of the dry gas production coming out of the Permian today. So the demand growth is very important to our strategy and we continue to see that be very supportive. So with this backdrop, I'm happy to report that our portfolio of indispensable natural gas infrastructure performed even better than expected this past year as we once again came in at the top of our guidance ranges for key financial metrics. In fact, we achieved an all-time record for adjusted EBITDA in 2018 even in the face of asset sales totaling more than $4.6 billion over the past 2.5 years. And these transactions continue to reduce our commodity exposure and continue to improve our leverage metric for WMB. And all the while, we funded growth over the past two years without the need for equity issuance. So as you may recall, we started 2018 setting delivery records on Transco, which we've now, in 2019, equipped once again during the record cold snap that impacted our markets last week. And in 2018, Northwest Pipeline also hit an all-time record for annual throughput, eclipsing the prior record by 5%. So we are seeing the impact of all this increased demand showing up on our pipelines, obviously. We had a timely and crisp execution on the critically important WPZ rollup transaction, reestablishing Williams as a simplified C-Corp with investment-grade credit. We continue to make great progress overcoming a highly challenging regulatory and permitting environment, placing critical new Transco projects and service like Garden State, Atlantic Sunrise, and just recently, the Gulf Connector. And we continue to make progress advancing the expensive next generation of Transco fully contracted projects like Southeastern Trail, Rivervale South to market, Leidy South, Northeast Supply Enhancement, Gateway and several other Transco projects that we've not gone public with yet. Late in the year, we saw the beginnings of the accelerated Northeast G&P growth. We expect to continue for many years to come as the takeaway cloud finally has begun to lift from this basin. We expanded our ESG disclosures on our website, kicked off the project to further expand our ESG disclosures in '19 and further strengthen our exceptional Board of Directors with two new appointments. We continue to exercise capital discipline, passing up many opportunities but executing on others like our entry into the DJ Basin, which was funded through our exit from our legacy Four Corners position. And we are now set for continued value-creating portfolio optimization here as we begin 2019. And once again, despite increasing commodity price volatility in the liquids markets, our low-cost natural gas business strategy has us positioned well for further predictable growth here in 2019. And importantly, today, we are reaffirming the 2019 guidance that we provided in May of last year. So with that quick look back at a very busy 2018, let's move to Slide 2 and take a closer look at our financial performance versus 2018 -- for '18 versus our guidance. Here on Slide 2, you can see that we've shown how we finished the year relative to our 2018 guidance ranges. Although our GAAP net income was affected by a large impairment on our Barnett gathering system, you can see that adjusted net income exceeded the midpoint of guidance and our adjusted EPS, which was at the high end of guidance, showed strong growth in 2018 of 25% over the 2017 EPS. Despite selling $1.3 billion in assets that was not accommodated for in our plan back when we made that guidance, our adjusted EBITDA DCF and dividend coverage ratio all reflected strong performance at the high end of our guidance range. You can see that our growth CapEx spending came in about $300 million under guidance and that was primarily driven by shifts of capital out of '18 and now into '19. So when we get to our '19 guidance, you'll see an uptick, which was just the timing of that $300 million moving from '18 to '19. And finally, with respect to leverage, you can see a nice outperformance with year-end leverage at 4.8. So once again, as was the case in '17, our financial performance was quite good as compared to our guidance. It was another year where we delivered on expectations, including steady, predictable and growing cash flows while improving the balance sheet. On the next couple of slides, we'll quickly break down the major drivers of our financial performance for the fourth quarter and the full year, so let's move on to Slide 3. First, looking at the fourth quarter GAAP numbers on the upper portion of the slide, we see that the year-over-year comparisons were affected by some large accounting entries, which have been adjusted out of our non-GAAP. Specifically, in 2017, we had some large positive accounting entries related to tax reform. And this year, we have a large revaluation on our Barnett gathering system, somewhat offset by gains on asset sales. Looking at adjusted EBITDA in the lower portion of the slide, we see that the nearly $1.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA was up a little more than 3% versus 2017, but up 9% if you normalize for revenue recognition changes and the sale of our Four Corners system. Looking at the bridge then, once adjusted for the revenue recognition changes and the loss of Four Corners, which are shown in gray, you can see that our adjusted EBITDA increased almost $100 million, where strong increases in our Northeast and Atlantic-Gulf segments were somewhat offset by a lower quarter in the West. So it's really great to see the Northeast and Atlantic-Gulf adjusted EBITDA numbers growing by 28% and 22%, respectively. Atlantic Sunrise was the big driver, of course, for Atlantic-Gulf, and the Northeast saw about a 13% increase in volumes, led by increases in Northeast Pennsylvania area, but also we saw good growth in Southwestern Marcellus and the Utica area as well. So as we look at the results for the West, you have to be mindful of the pretty dramatic effect that the sale of Four Corners had on our reported gathering volumes. So specifically, if you look at our analyst package, you'll see that the West gathering volumes are down about 22% sequentially from 3Q and that our full year 2018 volumes are down about 4% from '17. However, if you exclude the Four Corners volumes, then we are flat year-to-year and down only 3% versus the third quarter of '18. And of course, that was impacted, we did have some freeze offs in Wyoming here in the fourth quarter of '18. Additionally, another big driver for the West in the fourth quarter of '18 related to about $25 million unfavorable swing in the EBITDA of our NGL marketing business, which was driven by the drop in the value of the inventory that we hold for [indiscernible] primarily out West. The value of this near comp and inventory changes every quarter as we mark this product to market prices from one quarter to another.  So now let's turn to the full year 2018 results and go to Slide 4. Starting with our GAAP results in the upper portion of the slide, we see that the large accounting entries we discussed in the prior slide are also driving the year-over-year comparisons. So again, tax reform entries, gains on sales of assets and impairment entries make it a little tough to see the performance of the ongoing business. So let's look at the adjusted numbers where these items have been excluded. First off, I just highlight again that the 25% growth in adjusted EPS, which grew to $0.79 from $0.63 in the prior year. Looking at the bridge on adjusted EBITDA, you see in gray the effects of lost EBITDA from the Geismar assets we sold in '17, the changes in revenue recognition accounting rules and the loss of EBITDA from the Four Corners assets we sold in 2018. So once again, adjusted for revenue recognition changes and the lost EBITDA from sold assets, you can see that our adjusted EBITDA increased a little more than $300 million, driven by strong increases in our Northeast and Atlantic Gulf segments. Growing volumes in the Northeast Pennsylvania and Southwest Marcellus and the Utica areas all drove the higher Northeast segment results. The Atlantic-Gulf segment growth was again driven by Atlantic Sunrise, but a number of other projects that came on for a partial year in '17 also drove higher results in '18. So now let's move on to Slide 5 and quickly recap some of the more significant and recent business developments. This slide showcases our recent accomplishments, demonstrating strong project execution, continued permitting successes, operational excellence and strategic transactions at the corporate level. Our teams have done an outstanding job of bringing key expansion projects in the service, like Transco's Atlantic Sunrise and Gulf Connector projects. One other project that I'll highlight on the list is our Norphlet project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. It's great to see some major new deepwater volumes coming midyear as our Norphlet project serving Shell’s Appomattox builds in the Eastern Gulf gets up and running. With the completion of these three projects, the majority of our project execution risk that is behind our growth drivers for '19 has been squared away. So on the permitting front, we have also seen great progress despite the difficult environment. Northeast Supply Enhancement received its FERC FEIS. This was a critical permitting step for a project that will support the conversion of heating oil to clean burning natural gas for New York City and Long Island areas. Transco's Gateway expansion was another project that hit a key milestone, receiving FERC approval to expand existing pipeline to help New York and New Jersey meet growing natural gas demand needs in time for the 2021 winter. And most recently, our Southeastern Trail project cleared the environmental assessment hurdle at FERC. This is another example of Transco's tremendous advantage of having existing right of ways in all of the right places. Operationally, our Northeast GMP segment increased gathering volumes by 13% from fourth quarter of '17 to fourth quarter of '18. And this was driven primarily by several gathering expansions of our Susquehanna system as well as incremental takeaway capacity for Northeast Pennsylvania. We will continue to see volume growth on our Northeast systems into 2019 and beyond. Our Transco expansion -- Transco delivered a record amount of natural gas, setting its peak day mark of 15.68 million dekatherms on January 21 of this year. Transco also set a new 3-day mark from January 30 to February 1. The recent frigid conditions across the country are an important reminder of the vital role transmission pipelines play in delivering natural gas to keep millions of Americans safe and secure. And I want to take a moment to recognize the great employees that are there working behind the scenes to make that happen. It's not a simple task and it takes a lot of dedication, and we certainly have that from our employees here at Williams. And speaking of records, our Northwest Pipeline also hit an all-time annual record delivery of 820 trillion BTUs versus the previous annual record of 781 trillion BTUs. So a tremendous job our Northwest team as well as they overcome some major supply outages in Canada from third-party pipelines coming in and we're able to manage around that and keep the heat on for our residents in the Northwest area as well. Looking down the list, you'll see our Bluestem project, which we announced yesterday afternoon. Let's move to Slide 6 to take a closer look at the newly announced project Bluestem. We've got some good detail on this slide about this exciting new project, which will provide all new connectivity between vast Western NGL supplies and premium Gulf Coast markets. This strategic partnership provides great opportunity to really strengthen and expand our NGL transportation and fractionation business. We are pleased to partner with Targa on this NGL infrastructure solution that creates an integrated solution and a platform for growth for both parties. Expanding on NGL pipeline business to interconnect with Targa's strategically positioned Grand Prix pipeline will provide Williams and our customers with access to Mont Belvieu, while opening up additional markets for Conway, attracting new volumes to both our Overland Pass Pipeline system and the Conway fractionation and storage assets and will provide Williams with 80,000 to 120,000 barrels a day of firm access to Mont Belvieu. Additionally, this delivers a long-term infrastructure solution for NGLs from our Opal, Echo Springs, Willow Creek and our new Rocky Mountain Midstream systems in the DJ Basin, while also creating a platform for growth, offering us the opportunity to gain incremental downstream revenues as we expand our GMP business. We're targeting an in-service date of the first quarter of 2021 for this project. Additionally, I would point out that in connection with this project, Williams will also have an option to purchase initially a 20% equity interest in one of Targa's recently announced new fractionation train 7 or 8 in Mont Belvieu. Our goal is to be well aligned with Targa in maximizing the value of our collected assets in Conway and Mont Belvieu and the piping in between and to offer attractive service offerings to our processing customers in the West. We expect our investment in these NGL logistics projects to be $350 million to $400 million, with most of that spending will -- that will occur in 2020. And now let's move on to the next slide to review our 2019 financial guidance. As we previously discussed, we are reaffirming our 2019 financial guidance with the exception of growth capital expenditures. Of course, much has changed since we originally issued 2019 guidance last May. Specifically, we sold our large scale Four Corners system and entered into the DJ Basin where the system there that we now operate was still in the early stages of its continuing expansion and development. And we and our producing customers, of course, saw a 28% decrease in crude and NGL prices from August until year-end. Really, the key point here is that the stability and predictability of our natural gas infrastructure-focused strategy has allowed our 2019 guidance to hold in there very well even as we continue to optimize portfolio and have seen lower pricing environment for our producing customers. As a result, our 2019 guidance for financial performance remains unchanged and much of the project execution risk for 2019 is already put crisply behind us. ASR, Gulf Connector and our Norphlet facilities, as I mentioned earlier, all now completed. So as I previously mentioned, we are revising growth capital expenditure guidance from $2.6 billion to a range of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion, and that's really just the timing shift of some of the amounts we didn't spend in '18 that got shifted into '19. The last thing I will say about 2019 is that we remain very focused on improving our credit metrics. To that end, we will continue to exercise capital discipline and to pursue portfolio optimization transactions much like you saw in '18. And of course, our strong cash flows and continued string of asset sales has allowed us to fund the equity side of our growth capital needs. So with that update, let's move on to the last slide, Slide 8, and wrap up, and then we'll take your questions. On this last slide, we again just laid out a few of the highlights from 2018, which was a very important year for Williams. It was a year where we beat guidance, returned to a simplified C-Corp investment-grade infrastructure company, completed the largest project ever on Transco, progressed on deleveraging the company and made continued progress in optimizing our portfolio. Also in this last slide, we've summarized some of the things on our mind here for 2019. We look forward to another year of strong natural gas demand growth. We also look forward to showing our business can deliver cash flow stability and predictability during times when the crude markets are volatile and saggy. We continue to be pleased with the opportunities we are closing on in the DJ Basin, thanks to the great work of our Rocky Mountain Midstream team that has done a great job of establishing themselves in the areas well with our customers up there. As an example, we just executed a new gas gathering and processing agreement for an additional 5,200 acre dedication that is fully permitted in the DJ. To support this development, we'll be expanding our gathering and collection services in the basin as we expect to open up additional near- and long-term opportunities for our midstream services in the DJ. And we will have two new processing trains starting up this year as well, one of which is entering the commissioning stage and the other at [indiscernible] where construction activity is progressing according to plan. We look forward to another year of advancing the important Transco projects that you are aware of and to introducing you to new opportunities for the nation's largest and fastest-growing natural gas pipeline, and we look forward to another year of strong Northeast GMP volume growth. And last but not least, we will continue to delever. We will do this through solid execution of our business plan, which allows us to reinvest excess cash flows into new growth opportunities, but we will also continue to vigorously pursue portfolio optimization activities in support of this effort to delever. And finally, I also want to let you know that we've taken a look at the timing of our annual Analyst Day, and we'll be making a shift from the May time frame to something later in the year. This major -- the major driver of this move is to really make sure that our Analyst Day follows up our annual forward board session, which is in August. So we think that's a nice move to governance and simplifying our internal process to be able to roll right from our annual board strategy session into guidance. So with that, let's go ahead and turn it over for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from Shneur Gershuni of UBS.
Shneur Gershuni: Just wanted to start off on the new project that you announced last night. On a go-forward basis, do you expect to aggregate more barrels? And could you see a need for a greater than 20% stake in a frac? And also with -- any sense on what the stack rate would be to get the Y-Grade all the way to Mont Belvieu?
Alan Armstrong: I would say, first of all, on the volume growth, yes, we did build in the flexibility in our relationship with Targa to be able to expand our volumes as we need to, both on transport capacity as well as on the investment in the fractionator. So -- and I would say that we definitely are seeing a lot of opportunity to continue to pick up new barrels out of both the DJ and the Rockies. And so we're pretty excited about that. And obviously, we like the fact that Conway becomes an important center now as we open that up to new markets, so we're pretty excited about that alternative.  And then on the -- I would just say on the rate, we're not going to disclose that. But I would say it's very competitive and we're very excited about it, about the way that rate is structured. And again, I think Targa saw this as a long-term strategic relationship with us, and likewise. And so we see this as a great opportunity to maximize the combination of our assets at Conway and Bellevue.
Shneur Gershuni: That makes sense. And given your new partnership with Targa, do you see an opportunity to expand the relationship with respect to gas takeaway out of the Permian, given that both companies have been exploring different gas takeaway solution?
Chad Zamarin: Yes, this is Chad Zamarin. I would just say that we continue to -- I think if you look at our recent announcement with the Brazos Midstream system in the Permian, we continue to focus on the Permian. And I would just say, we're going to continue to be disciplined and there have been two projects that have been announced coming out of the Permian to move gas to the Gulf Coast, but we continue to look at options. The Brazos system provides us much like the move that we made into the DJ and the ability to move downstream from that position. The Brazos system provides us with an opportunity to continue to develop projects that we moved to the Gulf Coast. And I would say that we are likely, if we do move forward with the project of that sort, to partner with others in order to make it a most efficient project. So we continue to work in that manner.
Shneur Gershuni: Great. And one final question. When I think about your CapEx guidance for 2019, I know it technically goes up from the prior guidance. But when I think about it on an apples-to-apples basis, you have some rollover from 2018 into 2019. And you've just announced new project, so it would kind of seem like, on an apples-to-apples basis, your CapEx is actually declining versus prior expectations. Can you give us a little bit of color around that? Is it cost related? Is it due to some of the asset sales? Just trying to understand these subtle changes.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I would just say, first of all, most importantly, the Bluestem -- most of that capital for Bluestem will be spent in 2020. So that's primarily why you're not seeing less driver in that. So it's not -- frankly, it's not all that complicated because it really is just quite a bit of pushing. There's a lot of -- in a budget of that size, obviously, there's a lot of things moving around from time to time. But they tend to find themselves towards the mean, and that's precisely the way this came out this year as well.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We will take our next question from Christine Cho with Barclays.
Christine Cho: Just wanted to make sure I understand this agreement with Targa. Are the economics here really going to be driven by the volume growth out of the Rocky Mountain Midstream JV? And also, any color around when you expect to achieve that EBITDA multiple of 6x and what sort of volume we should assume is underpinning those economics?
Micheal Dunn: It's Micheal. Just -- to start on the first part of that, we see a lot of growth not only from the Rocky Mountain Midstream, but we've got barrels on our Rockies plants that are already out there that will be moving on the Bluestem pipeline eventually. As you know, we've got the partnership on the OPPL system. And we'll continue to move with Rockies barrels down the OPPL system to Conway and then further south on Bluestem. And with our 2021 in-service date on Bluestem coinciding with Targa’s build to the north with us, we would expect a lot of those barrels to move south and ultimately, get to a 6x multiple on that. And really, a lot of that is driven by timing of the barrels coming out of Rocky Mountain Midstream frankly, but we do see some pretty significant growth in the Rocky Mountain Midstream assets, especially with the agreement that we just executed, and so we would anticipate approaching that 6x multiple pretty quickly.
Christine Cho: And just to clarify, the volumes coming out of like your existing plants, are those priced off -- those are priced off Conway, right? And so to the extent that you can bring them down to Bellevue, that's going to be margin that you keep for yourself. Is that how I should think about it?
Alan Armstrong: There's a variety -- for our own equity barrels today, we have the option of either Conway or Bellevue at a differential in price. So today, we do have that option for those barrels up to an amount that we can move under the existing exchange agreement. So I would just say that we do have Bellevue access for those barrels today to the degree it's available. But for the Rocky Mountain Midstream barrels, that's a different story in terms of being able to include those because we're limited on capacity on Overland Pass right now. So as Overland Pass opens up, that allows us to make a very nice margin by making these investments on the downstream.
Christine Cho: Got it. Okay. And then just switching over to the Northeast, the gathering volumes have been great, but the processing volumes have been flattish for the last year. What do you think we need to see to have these volumes increase?
Micheal Dunn: Well, Christine, I would say we do expect those volumes to increase. We have line of sight to what the producers are doing. There's a lot of drilling activity behind our processing plants that will be coming online this year. It's a little bit delayed for more than where you had thought it would have been last year. That's really coinciding very nicely with the completion of growth TXP-2. And so we have very good confidence that our current capacity will be filled probably in the second quarter, and that's about the time that TXP-2 and Oak Grove comes online. So we anticipate certainly [filling] [ph] TXP-1 this year and TXP-2 will start processing gas shortly after that.
Alan Armstrong: Christine, I would just add to that question, and it's a good observation on your part. I would just add, we've got several significant upstream projects, like [Checkmark] [ph] pipeline and some other projects that are -- that we have to get completed before we can bring those new processing of those volumes in for processing. So there's quite a bit of infrastructure having to happen upstream to be able to get some of the new drilled volumes from Southwestern and other customers into the front of Oak Grove and we're nearing completion on a lot of that work.
Micheal Dunn: And Christine, I probably should add to that, we have been in volume commitments whenever we agree to go deploy capital there at those processing facilities. We have MBC to back that up. And so that's why it gives us a lot of confidence that those volumes are going to show.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan.
Jeremy Tonet: Maybe just kind of speaking up on that last point there. There's been kind of concern with regards to producer activity in the Northeast and some producers kind of taking in that growth rate, focusing more on free cash flow. I was wondering if you guys could address how you see that impacting your footprint because it seems like some of the guys behind your systems might be taking a bit of a different task than others there. If you can extend on that, what gives you guys the confidence in the Northeast growth as you expected?
Alan Armstrong: Sure. I'll just take that at a high level and then and Micheal can fill in with some details if required. First of all, I think not all producers out there are created equal, and certainly not all acreage is created equal. And so for instance, if you look at Cabot, which is one of the primary drivers of our growth, they continue to show a very strong growth profile because they've got markets established upwards towards 4 Bcf a day of markets that they've established. And so they've done a great job of getting the markets out in front of them, and we're working furiously to keep our gathering system expanded to keep up with them. So that's very obvious to us where that growth is coming from in that area. As well as Bradford County area continues to grow very rapidly for us as well. And so as Micheal pointed out earlier, we have a lot of transparency into that growth in that area. And then as you move into the South, I would just say that while there has been some folks pulling back a little bit on volume growth, as Micheal mentioned, those MBCs that people have made to us, they're going to work hard obviously to build those up. They are being very successful with the production behind there.  And I would just tell you the 15% CAGR that we put out there earlier, we had quite a bit of room, if you will, between what producers were forecasting at that point versus that 15%. And so we're still very -- feel very confident in that 15% CAGR that we put out earlier based on the detailed work that we do with producers. I would say, as I've mentioned earlier, probably the one more positive things about that growth that's occurred is the Encino acquisition from Chesapeake on that Utica acreage, which was a very large piece of volume and acreage behind us that was declining previously. And now with their activities, we're actually starting to see that growth. So that's a really big positive for us in terms of offsetting some of the declines that exist there, yes.
Jeremy Tonet: That's very helpful. Just wanted to turn to Atlantic-Gulf here real quick. And you had quite a nice quarter there. I was wondering this kind of -- something that's a run rate level for you guys? Or is there still more kind of Sunrise is not fully baked in for the quarter and you're continuing to see growth there? How should we think about that segment?
Micheal Dunn: This is Micheal again. I would say the majority of the quarter, we saw the Atlantic Sunrise revenues in there came online October 6 is when we started charging full rate for Atlantic Sunrise. But recall, earlier in 2018, we were also charging for some interim capacity that we were able to achieve there. We were able to bring the full volume on October 6. So basically, you would see the fourth quarter having the majority of the revenue in there for Atlantic Sunrise. And if you recall, it's a revenue payment -- sorry, a capacity payment. On a revenue throughput, although very strong throughout the fourth quarter, doesn't drive a lot of the revenue differences there because of the capacity reservation charges that Transco enjoys.
Operator: And from RBC Capital Markets, we'll hear from TJ Schultz.
Torrey Schultz: Just one thing on the last point on the Chesapeake, Utica acreage now with Encino. Can you find any better rated change you're expecting from an asset those in decline. Now it sounds like more activity. Just any notable color from early days of Encino in place.
Alan Armstrong: Well, they're still on their process deciding how aggressively they want to go after it, but I think it's a -- the big shift, of course, is a -- the available capital that Encino has through the Canadian pension fund. And so they are anxious to put that capital to work and driving returns on that. So it takes a while to get ramp back up from the declines that had been occurring in the area, but we're working with them to make sure that we keep the infrastructure out in front of them right now. So I think it's a question of how many rigs that they're going to run in the area right now. I think they're planning -- they've got two and planning on maybe going to three at this point. And so that will -- that's what will drive that. And of course, they're very efficient. They've got a lot of team that was already existing there, very efficient operators. And with three rigs, they'll be growing pretty rapidly in that area.
Torrey Schultz: Okay. Great. Just one more, on Gulf East, if you could just clarify a little on Appomattox. It sounds like coming on a little sooner than expected. If you can just remind me the status of the Northwest Pipeline auction to you. And just, in general, what you're expecting from the ramp in that area this year?
Alan Armstrong: Sure. TJ, yes, we have completed all of our work and the pipeline auction and it gets triggered just ahead of production coming online. So we're in those discussions and that's all pretty -- I would say that's very clean and very baked, and there's not a whole lot to happen there other than us making decision to exercise that. So really, it's just a matter of Shell doing their work on Appomattox and being ready to flow. And so that's what will drive the timing on that is their work on the Appomattox platform and getting that ready to flow. And they've done a great job, really great execution on Shell team on being so far ahead of schedule as what they had planned originally. And our team did a nice job as well having our side of the infrastructure done. So we're excited about it, a lot of volumes just from the fuels proper, but a lot of new work going on by both Shell and other producers in the area and acreage around that, that would be nice [indiscernible] to the Northwest to our infrastructure out there. So I think that's going to wind up being even bigger than we had originally planned in terms of the number of fields and new development that's going on out there. Both -- again, both by Shell and Chevron's activity in the area as well.
Operator: Our next question is from Dennis Coleman with Bank of America.
Dennis Coleman: If I can just go back to the Bluestem project to start. I wonder if you might talk a little bit, how did you first scope the project in terms of deciding where the connect would come and who would build the what with Targa?
Alan Armstrong: Well, we did say that Targa had -- and this is why it turned out to be such an attractive project for both parties, was because they were building up to that Kingfisher area anyway to capture other volumes in the Midcontinent area there. So this was a low-cost expansion for them to be able to pick our volumes up as well for them. So the transaction and the rates that we enjoy, we're benefiting from that. And so it was just a matter of us placing the capital to build down from Conway down to where they were already going to be picking up other barrels in that area.
Dennis Coleman: Okay. And so are there -- there's contracts on these systems already? Is that -- there's a contract structure in place, there's shippers, or is it Williams that's the shipper?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. On our system, it would be own -- of course, remember, you have Overland Pass that we own 50% with One Oak upstream of this. That comes into the Conway area and then we would own that system 100%. We would be the -- in terms of shipping on that, we would have an exchange agreement, purchase agreement with Targa for some of those barrels and we will have relationships with upstream producers. Plants that's in the Rocky Mountain area will have relationships where we will be buying their barrels at a fixed margin in that area. So we'll have a combination of both our own equity barrels, which are very substantial today as well as barrels that we've been continuing to pick up in the DJ Basin and some of the surrounding area there.
Dennis Coleman: Okay, got it. And then just there's a word in the press release that I want to just try and understand. You said there's an initial 20% option on one the fracs. I guess, that implies that there will be additional options or potentially, is that -- am I hearing that right?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Great question. As I mentioned earlier, we structured the transaction so that we can expand both our equity investment and the frac, but that would come with additional volume commitment on our part as well, and so that's kind of how it's structured, so -- but we built in flexibility, knowing how robust we're kind of forecasting the growth in the Rocky Mountain midstream area to be, we want to be prepared to be able to handle those incremental barrels. And so while today, we don't want to make that kind of commitment without seeing the barrels actually show up, we did want to make sure that we had the capacity to allow for that growth coming from that area.
Dennis Coleman: Okay, great. And then I guess, maybe just one on the leverage. It seems that, that further reduction is primarily a function of asset sales. So I wonder if you might talk about what kind of -- any assets that you're particularly looking at. Is there a program going on now or is that going to be more opportunistic?
Alan Armstrong: No, I would say we're constantly looking at optimizing our portfolio and. Where we are working really hard, I can tell you the entire team, with the board's support, is working hard to reduce our leverage. And so we continue to work various transactions and asset sales that would help complement that. So to answer your question, we are actively pursuing those type of transactions.
John Chandler: But I would -- this is John Chandler. I do want to say, even without that, though, again, remember, we're generating around $1.2 billion of excess cash even with attractive dividend growth, and we can use that cash even on new investment dollars. So we actually are deleveraging even with investments in new projects because we're funding so much of it with cash. So again, after sales will enhance and speed up the deleveraging, but we're deleveraging even without asset sales.
Operator: Next we'll hear from Mike Lapides of Goldman Sachs.
Michael Lapides: Two questions unrelated to each other. One, is there an update on the siting and permitting process for the Northeast Supply Enhancement that you can provide? Just in general, it seems like federal processes are kind of running as expected but just curious given a lot of the challenges others and you all have paid in terms of building pipelines into New York and dealing with kind of state level intervenors or stakeholders.
Micheal Dunn: Michael, this Micheal. I will give you an update on that. This is a great project for us to be able to facilitate the reduction of emissions in New York City as well as improve the cost profile of people's energy use there. We just recently received our final environmental impact statement from the FERC and we would expect within 90 days, further regulations and their practice to provide a FERC certificate, assuming the FERC commissioners approve that within 90 days. So you would expect to see that hopefully within the 90 days and then we're in the process on the state side of getting the 401 certifications from New Jersey and New York. Both of those state agencies had scheduled public hearings for the 401 certifications with just recently, the state of New York giving the notice of complete application on our 401 certification. And so we'll go through those processes with the state of New York as well. And once those 401 certificates are issued by each one of the states, then that allows the core of engineers to issue let's call the 404 permit, and FERC that into consideration in order to give us a notice to proceed with construction. So we've got all that to occur within the next several months.
Michael Lapides: Got it. Much appreciated. And also, totally different topic. Any update you can provide on the Transco rate case, just in terms of whether settlement talks are underway and whether there's a potential for settlement or whether you think goes the full litigated route?
Micheal Dunn: I can give you an update on that as well. So we would expect to see the -- what's called the top sheets from FERC in mid-March, and that's really their staff's reaction to our filing. And they would provide the sideboards, if you will, so what we could then go to settlement negotiations with for staff and our customers on. And so the first or the start, I should say, the next settlement conference is scheduled for the end of March. And so at that point in time, we'll have a pretty good idea of how likely it is that a settlement can occur. And obviously, that's the path we would prefer to go down. I think that's the best for our customers and ourselves to be able to agree upon that and not litigate the case. And that's what the expectation is right now, for us to achieve an outcome in settlement that's satisfactory to both Williams and our customers.
Operator: With Tuohy Brothers, we'll hear from Craig Shere.
Craig Shere: A couple detail items and then a bigger picture question. Maybe my math is off but it looked like there was an unusually high tax rate reflected in adjusted income. If that's correct, what was driving that?
John Chandler: It's really a couple of things. This is John Chandler. There's a couple of things that drive that. Number one, in the fourth quarter is when we usually do our tax provision re-estimation for the year, so I'd encourage you to look at the entire year at the tax rate instead of just the quarters since we do have some noise around that. I'd also say we had several obviously large unusual items in the fourth quarter, including the impairment and other things, that when we do estimations of taxes and the impact of taxes on those unusual items, we use a 25% rate, which is actually higher than our average blended rate for the quarter. So that results in some skewed tight calculations because we're using a different rate for our adjustment items, our normalization items. We use our standard annual rate of 25% than what it actually blended to. It's probably confusing but I'd just ask you to reach out to our IR team. I think they can walk you through that. But so it's really those two things, the significant usual items and the tax position adjustments that are done in the fourth quarter.
Craig Shere: Looks like the EBITDA was in line but the adjusted EPS is a little off and that explains a lot. Alan, in your prepared remarks, you talked about several other Transco projects not going public with you yet. Can you give us a picture of the range of opportunities in terms of size? And maybe any updates on the Transco project one that was heavily foreshadowed on the 3Q call?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, sure. First of all, on project 1, remember we had two there, we had project 2, which was Leidy South, which is moving ahead very nicely and fully contracted. Project 1, we continue to work with the counterparty, a primary counterparty on that. And I would just to continue to be very interested in the project and highly supportive of the project but have some of their own internal issues to get through to be able to transact with us. And -- but we remain very confident in the fundamentals on the drivers behind that project. I would also say though, we have several other new projects that are well on their way to development. A lot of strong interest that would continue to alleviate capacity constraint out of the Northeast PA area. And so we're pretty excited about that and that also helps expand in some of the markets that are continuing to need expansion. And despite what you might hear, those markets are growing pretty nicely in terms of their demand for natural gas there in Zone 6. And so we've got several projects that are pointing at that and again, the interest in those projects is very strong, I think.
Craig Shere: So it sounds like there's incremental pipeline development that can further add to the Northeast GMP opportunities.
Alan Armstrong: Absolutely, yes. And I'm not going to call it project 3 because we're growing weary of that. But it is a nice project flowing right behind the other two.
Craig Shere: Okay. And here is a little bit of my bigger picture question. I understand the Barnett is not a 2019 headwind, but I want to get some sense of the longer-term gives and takes at GMP. If we look out to 2021, as you targeted a 15% CAGR on Northeast GMP volume growth off 2018, depending on assumed margin growth for them, is it reasonable to assume that Northeast GMP EBITDA can rise $600 million to $900 million plus off '18 levels? And then would Barnett maybe be a headwind of as much as $150 million?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. We're not going to provide guidance individually on Barnett. But I would say this, Craig, the lowering or the impairment we took on Barnett is -- I don't want to drag everybody through all the accounting details, but we were -- that asset was held according to the undiscounted cash flows on the assets when the -- and obviously, that was dependent on gas prices in the area, both -- by the way, that contract is set up as well as drilling expectations from Total, our primary customer in that area. When the Permian price for -- so every year, we test an asset like that for its cash flows, looking forward against the held value. And this year, when we had to take into account the very large basis differential in the Permian and how that would affect both the rate that we received as well as the actions of what we've estimated would be the actions of the producing customer, that brought us down below that estimate. And therefore, that triggered us to have to remarket the fair value. In other words, what we think we could sell the asset for in the market. And that was very different than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows, which -- what was related with Mark earlier. So it was a -- said another way, it was a relatively small movement in expected cash flows from the asset but it put us down below that fair value and that triggered a different way of value in the asset, and that's why we got such a large impairment. So you shouldn't read into that, that the business is collapsing there but it moved enough on the far out values, it moved enough that we had to reposition the way we value it. So nothing's really changed all that much there other than, again, the Permian gas supply hits -- if the Permian pipelines all got filled adequately and we see the Permian gas prices come back up, then that avenue would change for that area. But for the meantime, we have to take the facts as they are and look at the forward curve for the basis differential out there.
John Chandler: And I'd just add to that. If you go to the third quarter of 2017, we impaired our Midcontinent asset that was the same scenario that was set up. There wasn't a material change in the actual EBITDA generation from any kind of assets, but the gross cash flow dropped in the -- to make us take it from historically high carrying value down to its fair value. So, same is happening with the Barnett. We don't see any meaningful change in the EBITDA streams but it was just enough to trip that write-down from carrying value to fair value.
Craig Shere: No major change even looking out say, to 2021?
Alan Armstrong: No. Not really. Just the impact of gas prices long term for the asset just brought it down just enough. So we do not see a major shift in the cash flows from that business. We have had pretty modest growth expectations in the past for that, but this effectively just stripped that out, and the growth expectations completely stripped out of there in terms of drilling activity. And so that's what -- but we have had very modest expectations.
Craig Shere: And finally, the bookend that I put out there depending on margin per M of Northeast GMP gaining say, $600 million to $900 million plus in EBITDA over 2018 through 2021. Is that a decent bookend?
Alan Armstrong: Well, I would just say we are very much on our way towards that $0.50 to $0.55 EBITDA per Mcf range that we've talked about earlier. And so with the volume growth and with that kind of margin improvement, the answer is yes. But I'm not crystal clear on the timing that you're laying out, just to be very, very thought through that versus that amount. But in terms of what we laid out here at Analyst Day, we're feeling very good right now about both the volume growth and the margin growth that we're experiencing.
Operator: From Wells Fargo, we'll hear from Sharon Lui.
Sharon Lui: If you look at, I guess, the annualized Q4 numbers for your adjusted EBITDA from equity investments, it sounds like you kind of suggest a much higher run rate versus your 2019 guidance of $825 million. And I guess if you assume contributions from Jackalope as well as Rocky Mountain continue to ramp, maybe help us try to reconcile to your 2019 outlook based on what you guys reported in Q4.
Alan Armstrong: John?
John Chandler: Off hand, I don't know if I have the details in front of me to be able to answer that, so I might have you call Dr. John Porter on that question.
Sharon Lui: Okay, sure. And I guess, just a housekeeping question on the impairment charge. So there's no impact on cash flows, only on DD&A expense. Is that correct going forward?
John Chandler: If there is an impact on cash flow, that's very minimal on Barnett. So yes, it's just that it's an uplift or it's an improvement or reduction of DD&A, that's correct.
Sharon Lui: Okay. And then the amount that Williams actually recognized in terms of the amortization of deferred revenues, is that still about $100 million going forward?
John Chandler: Yes, that sounds right. Yes.
Operator: Next up is Jean Salisbury with Bernstein.
Jean Salisbury: Just a couple of quick ones for me. So it seems like Mountain Valley and the Atlantic Coast project has hit some difficulties. And as you articled that one of these projects is ultimately canceled, could Transco address that demand with new laterals? Like, could that be a source of new projects?
Alan Armstrong: We are very well positioned on the market end for those projects. In other words, being able to help usually existing right away, but not solely. So said another way, some of that market expansion will be required, but I would certainly say that we have a lot to offer in that regard in terms of the use of our existing right aways and systems to be able to help supply that growth. So yes, we have a lot to offer there to the degree that, that occurs. But I would also say that particularly as it relates to Mountain Valley, that there's so much continued growth in demand on our system that those supplies coming in, we're going to be -- we'll have synergies with Mountain Valley whether it gets filled as planned or not, we would have quite a bit of synergies there with that system. So I would say there's little different because they serve two very different needs, but clearly we have the ability to help out both projects.
Jean Salisbury: That makes sense. And then just a quick clarification. That Bluestem EBITDA is all incremental from the EBITDA that you'd expected on the initial Discovery deal. I assumed, so I just want to make sure.
Alan Armstrong: Yes, I think that's probably a good way to look at it. We did anticipate some NGL uplift in the Rocky Mountain midstream acquisition model. So we knew that we would be able to acquire some of those barrels ultimately, and so that's factored into that.
Jean Salisbury: Okay. So maybe a little bit of double dipping but a lot of it's incremental?
Alan Armstrong: Yes.
John Chandler: I would say this though. When you collective put in the investment on Bluestem with the investment in the Rocky Mountain midstream assets, we still accomplished 6x multiple even on even a combined investment when hopefully that system is fully up and operational.
Operator: Next up is Colton Bean with Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.
Colton Bean: So Alan, you mentioned that continued focus on portfolio management, so just wanted to touch on that. With the vertical integration here of the Rocky Mountain processing fleet with some further downstream opportunities, does that change the way you assess those assets and kind of how they fit in the broader asset footprint?
Alan Armstrong: No. I would say that the -- we will always look to vertical integration as one of the facets to consider when we think about whether an asset is strategic or not. Because obviously, the aggregation of barrels, for instance, gives us value opportunities, investment opportunities just like Bluestem. So we definitely think about, when we think about what assets we would want to hold and that we add value as an organization, as a corporation, what we add value to, that vertical integration is obviously a key part of that. So that is a facet that would be dependent on and certainly to the degree that we've got combined downstream investments. It makes those assets more valuable to us as a company often than to somebody else. And so I think that's the best way to think about that.
Colton Bean: Got it. That's helpful. And then just to touch brief on the West. So you mentioned gathering volumes net of the Four Corners adjustment there, down around 3% Q-on-Q. Just interested in what you're seeing on the Haynesville system and maybe a longer-term outlook there as well.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. As we said in '17, we had a really big growth rate on Haynesville in '17, and we forecasted that we didn't expect that to occur again in '18 because that -- there was so much new plus production and the decline rates on that new plus production is pretty high. So and we -- at the first of the year, we actually saw some growth but towards the end of the year, we did see some decline on the Haynesville system, so -- and most of that from Chesapeake production. The good news is on the Haynesville system is our team has been doing a really nice job of capturing new acreage out there from third parties other than Chesapeake. So we're encouraged for the way that looks, not on the base dedicated acreage out there, not really a change on that, but in bringing -- we've been winning some new business out there. So that will help to maintain the volumes in the Haynesville.
Colton Bean: Great. And just on those incremental agreements. At a high level, could you comment on whether those are weighted towards public or private producers?
Alan Armstrong: Mostly private.
Operator: From Jefferies, we'll hear from Chris Sighinolfi.
Christopher Sighinolfi: I'm not sure if this one's for you, Micheal or Chad, but I do want to circle back on the NGL project just one more time, more from a philosophical perspective, I guess, regarding the Conway market. You guys had made clear, the advantage of gaining better access or greater access to Bellevue through Targa's system, both the pipe and the frac. And it's clearly an advantage moving barrels on your own system versus a third-party system. So I guess, two follow up questions with regard to that set up. First, your views on the Conway purity product market outlook over time and your regional frac volumes there, given these announcements seem all Y-grade in nature. And then two, do you have Y-grade contracts now on third-party assets south from Conway that you can transition to Bluestem Grand Prix over time? And if so, what sort of schedule should we anticipate there?
Alan Armstrong: A lot of questions, I'll take a stab at a few. Let's see. First of all, on the Conway market, yes, and I think it's important to know that if we flatten out the spread between Conway and Bellevue, we're a winner in that. So you should think about that being somewhat of a natural hedge for our business because we already own those assets. And so to the degree that Conway product -- spec product prices go up in the purity markets, then that makes Conway and the services that we offer there that much more attractive, so that's a way that we think about that, obviously. And in terms of whether that's spec product or Y-grade, that's just a matter of how much incremental fractionation capacity there is on both ends of the pipe, basically in terms of being able to make those markets. Let's see. And yes, we do have contracts with third parties on Y-grade that have fixed margin built into them.
Christopher Sighinolfi: Okay. And is that something we can expect in a reasonable timeframe, maybe the next 2 to 5 years, to be up that could transition to this new collection of Williams-Targa assets? Or is it a long...
Alan Armstrong: Yes, absolutely. No, those are -- I would say, when we start up in 2021, I think we'll be well positioned there to be able to start taking advantage of that immediately.
Christopher Sighinolfi: Okay, great. I guess switching gears and just a quick follow-up for me on one of Jean Ann's earlier questions. You had noted that when you entered the DJ JV with KKR, that you pertaining some options to acquire from KKR additional interest. And so I'm wondering, Micheal, you had said that you contemplated other NGL solutions as part of that investment. I'm wondering now that they're getting more formalized with this agreement with Targa, if it shapes your view on whether or not or how swiftly you'll exercise options with them.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I would just say first of all, we've got 7 years, I think, total on that option, so a long time to the decide what that is. And I'll just remind you, the investment that we have with KKR is solely the GMP assets. And so, there's not an investment in the downstream value chain on that outside of that JV, it's just in the GMP assets that are proper. So it doesn't really affect so much that option value, if you will, because it's really just going to be the cash flows from that GMP business that will drive the option value there. But it does -- I would say, the relationship there with KKR is very solid, well aligned. And the fact that we have that option does keep us very focused on driving the value in the JV as well. So it's actually a pretty nice feature in terms of keeping us aligned there.
Micheal Dunn: And us being able to provide these NGL solutions downstream creates value for the partnership there with KKR because we can go to the producers and provide a value chain there that we can give them fixed pricing.
John Chandler: And Alan did mention earlier that what we've been successful is some new connections there at pretty attractive returns. You remember, our option with KKR is at a fixed return, so to the extent we can add new gathering business at higher returns, it just becomes that much more valuable, of course, in the future to exercise that option.
Christopher Sighinolfi: And so I guess, final point on that then, John. Assuming your -- the guided leverage number you gave for '19, is it safe to assume that, that does not include any option exercise on that asset?
John Chandler: That's does not. That's the beauty of this agreement. We have quite a period of time to execute that, so we've got plenty of time to continue to bring our leverage down and find that opportunity sometime in the future to execute that option.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. And I'd like to turn the conference back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Alan Armstrong: Okay, great. Well, thanks everybody for joining us. Really excited about the platform for growth that we've got set here for '19. Teams continue to work very well together to take advantage of all these opportunities. And I would say our execution just continues to get better and better and really proud the way the teams are operating. And we like the macro conditions that are set up ahead of us, as well. So feeling very good about both 2018 and the platform for growth that we've got set up for '19 and beyond. So thank you again for joining us.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams Companies Incorporated Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John D. Porter - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Todd. Good morning and thank you for your interest in the Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck, that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to you momentarily. Joining us today is our Chief Operating Officer, Michael Dunn; and our CFO, John Chandler; and Chad Zamarin is with us as well. In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to generally accepted accounting principles. And these reconciliations schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials. And so, with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Great. Well, thank you, John, and thanks everybody for joining us this morning. We're pleased to review with you a very strong quarter for – third quarter for 2018. We demonstrated continued, predictable and sustainable growth in all of our key financial metrics, and we also think this is a great platform for the more dramatic growth that has just begun. But before we get into presentation, I want to take a moment to officially welcome our new Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer, Debbie Cowan to Williams. We're really excited to have such an outstanding leader join us and join our executive officer team. Debbie's an accomplished human resources professional coming to us from Koch Industries. And we're excited to add another great member to our very talented team here at Williams. I'll pause briefly now and point to our cover slide which highlights briefly now and point to our cover slide which highlights just a couple of the many exciting construction projects that are going on in the company right now. Honestly, it's kind of hard to pick because we have so many projects going on, but here on the left-hand side is a photo of the 200 MMcf a day Fort Lupton plant III gas processing plant. So, this is the third train at this Fort Lupton site and it's expected to be in service by the end of this year. And the photo on the right is from our Oak Grove complex in Oak Grove West Virginia where you can see the construction of both TXP2 which is well underway now, as well as TXP3 which is in the background there. So, it's an exciting time for Williams now. The robust domestic natural gas demand growth is fueling demand for our fee-based natural gas infrastructure services. Natural gas usage is growing across almost all categories and has proven to be a good companion fuel for renewables, as well as we saw demonstrated this summer. And in fact, this summer was a great example of the kind of demand growth we're seeing as net power generation was up by 4% or about 15,200 gigawatt hours. But natural gas fire generation was up 17,300 gigawatt hours. So, not only did natural gas capture all the growth during the summer period, it also made up for coal and hydro losses as well. So, again, it actually outstripped – got all of the growth and then some in the space and we're continuing to see that big pool. In fact, if you really study the EIA numbers that just come out recently, you'll see that natural gas has been more than holding its own even in the face of large investments in renewables and currently accounts for over 57% of the new generation capacity that's currently in late stage development. So, it's really interesting to see this emerge and see natural gas starting to become base load now as well as following load as renewables come online. And so, a lot of new renewables but actually natural gas is outstripping that growth. So, let me just list the other things we're going to talk about today here real quickly. First off, we'll spend a little time providing perspective on some of the key investor focus areas for Williams. Then, we'll discuss the key drivers behind our financial and operational metrics for the third quarter and year-to-date. And we'll highlight the major project contributions in the third quarter and provide an update on the other key achievements that have happened during the period. And I'll wrap up by revisiting how WMB stacks up as an investment against the broader U.S. market. So, let's move to slide 2, and look at some of those key investor focus areas. First of all, we enjoyed a great quarter with many highlights. But before we get into the details of those results, I want to discuss the strong fundamentals that insulate us from many of the investor concerns in this broader space. And so, on this slide, we thought we quickly hit some of the most frequent investor topics and provide our own current perspective on how we stack up against these areas of concern. So first of all, we do get a lot of questions on our views of Northeast G&P growth. And so, that's our fee-based gathering and processing business in the Northeast. And as we all know, Atlantic Sunrise has opened up new markets for Marcellus producers and that is now driving even more accelerated growth in our Northeast G&P business segment. There's a strong demand pool from pipeline commitments and – sorry, Atlantic Sunrise's startup collapsed the local bases providing much stronger economics from producers in the area. As an example, on the day that Atlantic Sunrise was placed into service, which was October 6, Northeast Leidy gas prices rose from $1.20/Mcf to $2.70 per Mcf. Now, that by – in just one day, wouldn't tell you a whole lot except that gas prices have continued to drift upwards now for the balance of October. So, probably, in my career, that's been the most significant change that we've seen from any major piece of infrastructure changing an entire basin, not just the Leidy gas but also Dominion South and the Tennessee gas price as well. So, where is the Northeast G&P headed? Right now, we're wrapping up our annual budget cycle where we've work closely with producer customers to understand the very specific project needs that they're going to have over the next two years to meet their own business plan. This is a very detailed well-by-well work which, over the last few years, has led us to internal forecasts that have been very accurate. And for example, through September of 2018, we are within 2% of the plan (00:07:07) expectations and that's on over 7 Bcf a day of operated volumes with a number of different drivers going on. And so, that's a plan that was generated about this time last year. So, we do think we have a very good handle on the drivers and right now our forecasting work along with the minimum volume commitments that continue to build as we build out our facilities tells us that we should expect steady growth in our Northeast segment amounting to a volume CAGR of 15% from 2018 through 2021. And additionally, we also expect to realize significant operating margin uplift during this time which should drive even higher overall growth in EBITDA than that 15% CAGR. So, as evidenced of our improving operating margin, you can actually see it here in the third quarter 2018 results versus third quarter 2017, where the EBITDA per Mcf, which is a measure we've often pointed you to in our Analyst Day, that we've seen that now increase in that period again, 3Q 2017 to 3Q 2018, by 8%. So, we are seeing that come through as we had forecasted. And as our volumes build, we're going to see more and more of that benefit. So, not only growth in volumes but even faster growth in our EBITDA. Secondly, we field questions about our overall EBITDA growth beyond 2019. And while we're not providing specific guidance beyond 2019, I think we can be pretty clear about our general expectations in this area. As you probably know, our guidance for 2019 reflects approximately 10% EBITDA growth over 2018. We feel comfortable sharing our expectations of approximately 5% to 7% EBITDA growth on the longer term. And, of course, as we have new projects, that growth could improve further but we have great visibility as we look at our five-year planning cycle. We have great visibility into that 5% to 7% growth just as the business we have contracted today. And what's more, this growth is steady and predictable because it's based on fully-contracted demand payment projects and our existing fee-based business model that is not impacted by volatile commodity margins. And over the long term, it is impacted by natural gas demand. And those fundamentals just keep getting better. So, next up, let's talk about leverage. There's been significant deleveraging over the last few years and I can assure you that focus will continue into the future as we move toward a 4.2 times book leverage target over the long term. And we have been de-leveraging through an asset sale program, not by issuing undervalued equity. And as we all understand, that is going to drive long term value and this certainly is a driver as we look at the kind of growth that we're seeing in our EPS right now. So, very focused on the per share growth metrics and by continuing to go, do asset sales that have been very attractive, we think that's the best way to continue to grow shareholder value there. Our management team focused – is focused on a very rigid capital discipline. We passed up many opportunities over the last couple of years where the risk adjusted returns just no longer match up with our principal focus on improving returns and decreasing our leverage. And this focus has also led to creative portfolio optimization strategies like the sale of assets in a maturing basin in our former Four Corners Area at attractive multiples and redeploying some of that capital to the higher growth DJ Basin. In this transaction, we received an over 13 times multiple, highlighting the valuation discount that exists between the public market valuation of our company today and the indisputable market value of even the bottom quartile of our portfolio. The announced sale of the Dominion's interest in our Blue Racer Midstream JV that just came out this morning, is one more piece of evidence to support this assertion. Where they quoted on that transaction of 14 to 16 multiples. So, we see people running some of the parts, but it's very clear to us, as we're involved in a lot of these transactions, that the private side money is putting a lot more value on these reliable cash flow assets than certainly the public market is right now. And so, we will continue to work to take advantage of that situation. Next up, we've definitely heard a lot of confusion in the investment community about this year's FERC actions. The FERC rate making environment appears to have weighed on the natural gas focused names like Williams. So, I want to remind our investors that our Transco rate case was filed on August 31, with an overall increase in rate. Keep in mind, an improvement from 2018 Transco rates would be an upside to what we've provided in our 2019 EBITDA guidance. But also of importance is pointing out that we do not expect our major natural gas pipelines, not Transco, not Northwest pipeline, and not Gulf Stream, to be impacted by the 501-G process. We've seen various writings and people expressing concerns out there and we're just here to tell you that is not a concern from a Williams' perspective. And finally, we continue to be pleased with our joint venture DJ Basin acquisition. Operationally, the newly renamed Rocky Mountain Midstream is performing well and we are seeing even more growth than we expected. We have sites with permitting underway for greater than 1 billion cubic feet per day of gas processing. And certainly, we've had many questions about the Colorado Proposition 112. Based on the incredible importance of the oil and gas industry to the state of Colorado and the fact that this is a campaign run by out-of-state interest, we tend to think that the measure will not pass or that it will get significant commonsense revisions from the Senate legislator – legislature if it does pass. And we've certainly seen that. We've been in Colorado for a long time, not in the DJ Basin, but in other parts of Colorado. And we've seen these kind of things come up before, and we've always found the state there to be fairly pragmatic as a whole. And so, we really feel – are not overly concerned. We do think it's an – very important issue for the state and for the oil and gas industry, and wouldn't try to understate that in any way. But we have seen the state be pretty pragmatic over the years. But even if it does, we want to make it really clear that 100% of the forecasted wells that are supporting our growth have been permitted through 2020, and over two-thirds of the forecasted 2021 wells have also been permitted. So, really feeling good about the growth that we're seeing in that area and the proactive effort that the producing customers upstream of us have taken to have their wells permitted. So, thanks for letting us take a little time to share our perspective on these key investor focus areas, and let's move quickly to slide number 3 and take a look at third quarter 2018 results. Lots of numbers on this page here with our unadjusted GAAP results in the upper portion of the slide, and our normalized numbers in the lower portion. But looking first at our GAAP net income, we see an improvement of $96 million, increasing to $129 million. This favorable change was due primarily to a $227 million increase in operating income. Partially offsetting this improvement was an increase in the provision for income taxes driven by a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets following the WPZ roll-up. And turning now to the adjusted metrics. We can see our adjusted EPS of $0.24 was an impressive $0.09 or 60% versus the third quarter of 2017, and adjusted EBITDA grew 7.5% in that period. This improvement was driven primarily by a $68 million increase in fee-based service revenues due largely to Transco expansion projects brought online in 2017 and 2018 and also higher gathering volumes in the Northeast G&P segment. The quarter also benefited from higher commodity margins in the West; however, these were largely offset by the changed accounting practice on revenue recognition. So, if you normalize WMB's third quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA for the change in the revenue recognition, you would have seen a 10% growth through the same period. At the business segment level, Atlantic-Gulf adjusted EBITDA increased by $49 million in the third quarter of 2018 to $480 million. The improvement reflects a $43 million increase in, again, in fee-based service revenues primarily on Transco's Big 5 expansion projects that were placed in service in 2017 and an additional expansion project placed into service in 2018. Our Northeast G&P segment increased by 14% or $35 million to $281 million and this increase reflects a $33 million improvement in fee-based revenues due to higher volumes at the Susquehanna and Ohio River systems, and improved operating margins as we discussed earlier, and we expect both of these trends to continue for quite some time. I might also note that Williams' Other segment you can see on the slide includes historical results of our petchem services business. Now, let's move on to slide 4 and take a look at the year-to-date results. Year-to-date net income is down on a GAAP basis by $71 million versus the same period in 2017, even though operating income was up by $320 million. The 2018 net income year-to-date is missing a large gain on asset sales that was recognized in March of 2017, and that really drove that difference. Focusing now on these – on those adjusted metrics, you can see down below, we see year-to-date adjusted income per share attributable to The Williams was up 45% versus the same time period in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $70 million to $3.44 billion, even after the lost EBITDA from the Geismar plant sale and a $65 million unfavorable impact from the adoption of new revenue recognition standards in 2018. All three of our current business segments showed growth over the period – sorry, over the prior-year, driven by a $233 million increase in service revenues due largely to the Transco expansion projects, as I mentioned earlier, and higher gathering volumes in the Northeast G&P segment. So, fairly similar drivers between the third quarter and the year-to-date results. Now, let's move on to slide 5 and take a look here at the tremendous accomplishments and solid execution that our teams continue to deliver in a very predictable manner. We're very pleased with the recent announcement of the Leidy South Expansion project, which I'll talk a little bit more about here in just a moment. Very recently, the FERC approved the start of construction for our Rivervale South to Market project that will take place primarily in New Jersey. We're targeting the 2019 through 2020 winter season for completion of this project which will help meet the growing heating and power generation demand for the Northeastern customers, primarily in New Jersey and New York. So, yet another fully-contracted, high-return project that we have gotten permitted in very difficult territory. So, I will tell you it's no easy task but our teams are very good at it and continues to build a great reputation with the regulators. You may recall, we announced our Bucking Horse expansion project with our joint venture partner, Crestwood, in late July. When finished in 2019, this expansion will increase processing capacity to 345 million cubic feet per day to serve growing customer demand in the Powder River Basin. This growth is on top of the growth we are also experiencing in the Wamsutter Basin in – just to the south in Wyoming as well. We have already spotlighted our entry in the DJ Basin. That transaction occurred in the third quarter. And on October 1, we closed the Four Corners sale for $1.125 billion. The cash proceeds contribute to funding our portfolio of attractive growth capital and investment opportunities. And, of course, that gain on that sale would be recorded in the fourth quarter. We completed the Williams acquisition of Williams Partners on August 10, providing Williams with a simplified corporate structure and streamlined governance while maintaining investment-grade credit ratings. Great execution by our corporate teams on that effort. And then, most of you know that we placed Atlantic Sunrise project into service on October 6. But what you may not know is that the Atlantic Sunrise project was awarded the International Association for Public Participation's Project of the Year Award. So, this is a very large international organization that looks at big projects that require public participation and engagement and we – and that award was granted here in the third quarter. Really proud of that team. That's a very prestigious award and they look at projects all over the world for that. And so, I think a great example of the way our teams are doing things on – in a right way. We are not running over the top. And people are looking for win-win solutions with all of our stakeholders and we're focusing on environmental and regulatory compliance from the start of the project and working very closely with regulators to keep them informed. So, we do things the right way and it's – while sometimes it doesn't make us start off the fastest, we tend to win the race at the end of the day and Atlantic Sunrise is a great example of that. Atlantic Sunrise segues into an impressive list of 2019 drivers as we'll have a full year of revenue from ASR, the 1.7 Bcf per day Transco expansion. And this increases Transco's capacity now to 15.8 Bcf per day and provides $35 million of revenue per month just on that asset proper, not including the upstream gathering revenues that will flow behind that. As we already discussed, it also plays a role in debottlenecking the Northeast where we already hold the largest gas gathering position across the Marcellus and Utica Shales. This increase in gathered volumes is facilitated by gathering and processing expansions that are going on as we speak. We have another Transco expansion that will soon enhance our customers' LNG export needs. We are closing in on placing the Gulf Connector project into service much earlier than originally planned. This project has been designed to deliver about 400,000 dekatherms per day to Cheniere Energy's Corpus Christi liquefaction terminal, and an additional 75,000 dekatherms per day of natural gas to Freeport LNG Development liquefaction project and we're going to be able to deliver those about three months ahead of what our original plans were for that project. So great, great effort by the teams on bringing that project in ahead of schedule. Our Norphlet pipeline in Gulf East is expected to be placed into service in mid-2019 and this will deliver some results in 2019 and then will be a bigger driver in 2020. That's in the Shell Appomattox field. They actually have four other fields that are dedicated to us in that area as well. We have completed our work on the Mobile Bay plant, and are ready to take on that gas as soon as they complete their offshore line also well ahead of schedule. And if you'll recall, if you look back in our earlier notes on this project, you would have seen we were expecting that to come on in 2020. So, another project that we're well ahead of schedule on. Let's move to slide number 6 and check in on a couple of key projects providing access to new Northeast supplies. When we spoke to you at Analyst Day in May, we referenced two expected Transco expansion projects to provide access to new Northeast supplies. First of all, known as Project Number 2 at Analyst Day, Project 2 is actually our Leidy South project. We have a 15-year commitment with Seneca Resources and Cabot for 100% of the 580,000 dekatherms of firm transportation capacity and this will continue to grow our strategic footprint in the Marcellus, adding to the 62% growth in Transco design capacity since 2013 and adding to the already 3 billion cubic feet per day of Transco's Marcellus takeaway capacity over that same time period. We are targeting a fourth quarter 2021 in-service date that will provide attractive returns consistent with the recent Transco expansions. And then, additionally, now on Project 1, this project is very much alive and well. We're awaiting final board approvals from our customers, and – on that project, and expect an announcement in the fourth quarter of this year. So, again, great work that's been going on in that, and that's a very strategic project that we're all very excited about. These two projects just keep adding to the string of hits that give us confidence and use the transparency you seek for our growth for years to come. So, with that update, let's move on to the last slide, number 7, and wrap up, and we'll take your questions. On this final slide, we've recapped many of the key points we've made detailing why Williams is a strong, stable, conservative and growing company. Many of these themes link back to things we've discussed previously in the presentation, so I won't drag you back through all that detail here again. Rather, in summary, as I've said in the beginning of the presentation, I am extremely pleased with how the company is positioned right now. Natural gas demand is experiencing strong growth, and the fundamentals continue to build on the backs of low-priced natural gas for demand, and that's really what's going to drive our success. We've experienced strong execution across our irreplaceable natural gas focused asset base. We've built an earnings base that is highly predictable and not subject to commodity price volatility. We've improved our balance sheet position and we have visibility into continued improvement primarily through capital discipline and visible earnings growth on a per share basis and earnings across all of our businesses driving that. On the right-hand side of the slide, you can see the continued very favorable comparison one finds between Williams and the Median S&P 500. And as we discussed on slide 2, after what is going to be a terrific 2019 with 10% EBITDA growth, we have a clear line of sight to 5% to 7% EBITDA growth for many years to come. And this quarter, strong execution results highlight why we are so bullish on the future and we look forward to coming back quarter after quarter showing how Williams is delivering on the opportunities created by our natural gas infrastructure focused strategy. And with that, I thank you for your time today and we'll turn it over for our first questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our first question from Shneur Gershuni of UBS.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Morning, guys.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Good morning.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Just as a – thanks, Alan – as a question here, in your prepared remarks, you sort of talked about the Blue Racer asset selling for 14 times to 16 times EBITDA. You're obviously trading below that. And I'm sort of thinking about your guided dividend growth rate of 10% to 15%. Sort of given that valuation disconnect, has there been any thought about altering your return of capital plans to maybe lower the dividend growth rate and then do a share buyback in – to fill the gap? I'm just kind of wondering how you're thinking about these valuation disconnect with your discussions with the board.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Great question and certainly something we constantly monitor and discuss with the board. I would say that we certainly are very focused on deleveraging. And so, I would say that is front and center. But as you've seen, being able to continue to do asset sales at these kind of multiples drives a lot of value as well and frees up capital for those kind of things. So, we certainly constantly look at those opportunities and we think there's a lot of value to be driven in the stock as we consider those various alternatives. But I wouldn't want you to lose sight of our focus on that 4.2 times metric that I would tell you both the board and the management team are pretty laser focused on right now.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: So, is it fair to say that you would – if you were offered a very attractive price, that you would consider selling assets as well also?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: I would say our – we look at things first from a strategic standpoint. And as you've seen, the Four Corners asset really wasn't integrated into our asset base and we didn't see the growth in that business and what – it didn't have the kind of operating margin ratio that we typically enjoy there. So, that's one example where an asset is not really all that strategic to our future any longer. So, we certainly look – we'll look at assets like that. We also have a transaction that we're working for the purity pipes in the Houston Ship Channel area that's not – that was part of our petchem business and really not strategic to us any longer. So, I would say it's a combination of the kind of value that we think the assets can build in terms of our overall strategy. But I think, as we've proven, we're willing to pull the trigger when we see a valuation upgrade that doesn't damage our strategy in any way.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Now, that makes total sense. One last follow-up, an operational-type question. I was wondering if you can discuss what you're seeing in the Northeast in terms of producer behavior. You had strong dry gas gathering volumes but you also had higher NGL production. And at the same time, processing volumes were down. Are we starting to see a shift from dry to wet? Just kind of wondering if you can give us some color around that or if that's just really more driven from JVs and so forth?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. The Ship, I think we're going to see some dry gas volume pickup obviously with Atlantic Sunrise coming on. And I would just say the ability for producers in the Northeast PA, the volume – the wells are so large up there and can come on so fast, that if you're looking at volume, you might see a little quicker reaction up there just because of the size of the wells and the production up there and the number of pads that already exists. But I would say that, over the last nine months or so, several of the producers, and namely Southwestern, probably being the largest of those, has really ramped up their efforts and we are ramping up our efforts, putting a lot of infrastructure in the Ohio Valley Midstream area. And so, we are going to start seeing some pretty impressive volume ramp up in that area as our infrastructure starts to come on there. So, I think, really, we're going to see a pretty balanced approach to both the wet gas and the dry gas. Again, it doesn't really sneak up on us because we've got to build the infrastructure out to allow that gas to flow, and we're well on our way to getting that infrastructure built out right now.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Perfect. Thank you very much. Appreciate the color today.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Danilo Juvane of BMO Capital.
Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks, everyone, and good morning. Alan, now that the Atlantic Sunrise is online, how transformational do you see this being for the Northeast G&P segment? You outlined in your prepared remarks that you expect EBITDA growth in the segment to actually be higher than the 15% in volume CAGR you outlined. So, I'm trying to understand how big this could be for Williams going forward.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah, Danilo, thank you. We've been investing in the Northeast for a long time kind of waiting on things to finally get debottlenecked. I don't think anybody has doubted the resource. But one thing I might point out, because we've seen a variety of different producer reports come out here in this quarter and this earnings season. And I would just point out to folks that much of the production behind our system has been held up for various reasons in terms of the production growth in those areas. Cabot obviously, and then – and our Bradford County, and our Susquehanna County area has, literally, had no way out of there at a price that made any sense. That has opened up. Even gas in the Southwestern PA area and in the West Virginia area, even though it's had takeaway capacity, the pricing has not been all that attractive until here more recently. But one thing I think people really miss is the amount of acreage that is set behind our systems that have not been drilled on. And so, if you looked at the density of drilling on our dedicated acreage versus a lot of our peers, you would see that our density of drilling is much lower than our peers, partially because there was a number of high price contracts that have been resettled. There was the Chesapeake contract that Southwestern picked up and then we reformatted for them in a way that allowed them to get after the drilling in that area. And then, even in the Utica. If you think about the Utica, Chesapeake was undercapitalized to produce the Utica. Now, we have Encino with the right capitalization to bring that up. So, really across all these areas, we've kind of been sitting right up against those points of resistance and we're now seeing those various points of resistance cleared. And so, that's really what is driving a lot of this rapid growth here as we look for the next three years.
Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks for that. And within that CAGR that you outlined for the volumes, how much CapEx are you assuming annually?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: I don't know that we've put that actual number out there. I think if you go back to look at the Analyst Day package there, Michael can...
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. At Analyst Day, we talked about $500 million a year for our Northeast investments, and that's ramped up a little bit with the projects that we approved earlier this year at Oak Grove, but we see that as a pretty good average there in the Northeast. And other than that, a little bit to Alan's previous answer in the Northeast growth, we're seeing a lot of our producer customers that are capturing market that never has to hit the interstate pipeline. There's a lot of large power plants, gas-fired power plants that are being built right on our gathering systems. So, we move those volumes in our gathering systems from the wellhead to these power plants for our producer customers and they don't even have to leave the basin. So, there's a lot of growth there that you see from our customers that they're capturing this business.
Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks, Michael. Last question for me. Alan, you stated in your prepared remarks, focus on the capital discipline. As you evaluate growth going forward, have your thoughts evolved on Bluebonnet Market Express?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I would say that we certainly see another project needing to be built there. We see a lot of interest. Chad Zamarin and our team there have done a great job of looking to see what kind of joint ventures are possible out there for us. And so, I would say stay tuned on that. We're certainly going to remain – have a lot of remaining capital discipline, but we've got a pretty creative team and they're doing a great job there of matching up our capital discipline with opportunities in the basin and so I'm encouraged by their activities and the kind of feedback that they're getting right now.
Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Those are my questions. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Danilo.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning. Just want to build on the topics of portfolio management and leverage here. And it seems like in the marketplace, there's a very – there's a strong preference still for getting leverage lower and I know you have the 4.2 times kind of longer term target there, but just wondering what your thoughts were as far as possibly accelerating the kind of approach to that target. Given, as you said, Blue Racer fetched a very strong price tag. You've listed other kind of assets were non-core, especially things that came along with Access in the past and especially because you guys have such a great suite of growth projects in front of you, there's so much capital to be deployed there. I'm just wondering your thoughts on maybe being – looking to sell some more assets here and really kind of grab the bull by the horns and move that leverage down.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Well, I would just say, we're – as I've said earlier, we are constantly looking at that and then the opportunity is not lost on us, so – but again, we really don't want to damage our future in the process. I would say that continuing to work with the private infrastructure fund money that's willing to pay and evidently has a much lower cost to capital than the public space does right now, we see ways to work with them that provide us growth potential in the future upon exit opportunities for them. So, we think that's a pretty attractive vehicle for us. And so, we think we can continue to build our backlog of portfolios through looking at that. But I would just tell you, we're – as I've mentioned earlier, we're wanting to make sure we don't damage our long term strategy on the one hand and on the other hand, we take advantage of this. But I would say we are dead serious and very anxious to get down to that debt levered metric that we see out there. So, I would say we're working pretty hard towards that.
Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: That's helpful. Thanks. And just wanted to turn towards the guide here for a minute, and you said you're heading towards the top end of the 2018 guide. But even if you do hit the top end, it seems like it would be kind of Q4 flat versus 3Q, and granted you have the Four Corners sale but you also have Sunrise, the G&P upstream of Sunrise really providing some nice operating leverage there. So, wondering what line of sight do you have to that, exactly how that bump is materializing? And is the 4Q guide just being kind of conservative here or any other headwinds we should think of?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: No, I don't think there's any particular headwinds. Just a couple of things that you should consider in that math. First of all, I would say, we are making a lot of room for much lower NGL margins and, certainly, we've seen NGL margin. And so, that's not a big number for us. But within that margin of error you guys are talking about here, then it is a) something to consider. And I would just say, we're trying to make sure we've got plenty of room and you could argue we're being conservative. But we've seen these things swing hard before. And then, secondly, I would say as well, we have operating costs in – across our systems. And if you think about our Asset Integrity program, where we go out and smart-pig our pipelines, and we're constantly in the process of doing that, we want to make sure we leave plenty of money in our operating budgets to repair things when we find it. Said another way, we really don't know until we run those tests and dig systems up. We really don't know what we're going to get into in terms of repair costs, so we're trying to make sure we leave plenty of allowance in there for that. I would also tell you that is pretty conservative in terms of how we have that built into the plan right now. And then finally, you got to take out the Four Corners sale out of there as well. And remember, as you're calculating kind of that increase on ASR that we have the AFUDC, that would have been in the third quarter as well. So, that goes to earnings on Atlantic Sunrise. So, those are some finer points that would get there. I would say, in summary, I think it's fair to say that we feel very confident in being able to come in at least at the high end of the guidance range.
Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: That's helpful. Thanks. And just finally, when you talk about the 2019 EBITDA guide being 10% higher, is that relative to the midpoint of 2018? Or if you hit the high end, would it be off the high end or how do you think about that?
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. It'd be off the midpoint. I mean, we haven't changed our guidance for 2019. The midpoint there was $5 billion.
Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got you. That's it for me. Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Dennis Coleman of Merrill Lynch.
Dennis P. Coleman - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'd like to just hit on the leverage for a couple more questions here. The 4.2 times number that you're talking about this morning, how did you come to that number? Is it – I mean, we see a lot of targets out there and oftentimes it's 4.0 times or 4.5 times. How do you come to such a precise number of 4.2 times?
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. This is John Chandler. We – obviously, in preparing for the WPZ roll-up, we spent a lot of time talking to rating agencies. And we have a desire to be a solid BBB, Baa2 rated company. Solidly in that category. It became pretty clear to us during that – those discussions that that meant, on their calculations, using their – the way they do their calculations, that that was around 4.5 times. There's about a 0.02 to 0.03 difference between our book, that EBITDA ratio, and how they calculate 4.5 times. That's where 4.2 times came from. So, at a 4.2 times level, in my mind, and of course that's always subject to validation again with the rating agencies, that puts us squarely in a BBB, Baa2 solid category.
Dennis P. Coleman - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Perfect. Makes sense. And so, you talked about a long term target. Any guidance or any thoughts you might have as to how quickly you can get there?
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Well, in 2019, we guided to inside 4.75 times. And we – obviously, in 2020, we'll continue to see EBITDA growth that will help bring that down further. And as Alan pointed out, we continue to look at – for opportunities for asset sales. And ultimately, to bring that down further, it will acquire some additional asset sales. I don't want to give you an exact time when we're going to get there, but I can tell you we're very focused on moving towards that as quickly as we can.
Dennis P. Coleman - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Okay. That's great. It was worth asking. On the DJ, if you could, you talked about, on your slide 2, having all the wells permitted out through 2020 and mostly through 2021. Can you give us any more specifics on what the forecasts are, how many wells you're thinking of, or how – what that forecasts entail?
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Good morning. This is Michael Dunn. Right now, we've got about 60 MMcf/d of processing capacity installed, and we're working to get another 200 MMcf/d in by the end of the year, first part of 2019. So, you can look at that ramp, and then we actually have construction of another 200 MMcf a day at our Kingsburg facility up there that's under construction as well. So, we expect that online in mid-2019. So, once that is online, we would have about 460 MMcf a day of processing capacity there in our new Rocky Mountain Midstream asset and we do expect, obviously, that the first 200 MMcf/d that's going online late this year or in January to be full very quickly, obviously, and that's why we have the Kingsburg facility under construction for a mid-2019 in-service date.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Okay. Just in terms of number of wells – in terms of total number of wells on that, our math shows us that we've got a little over 800 wells that are already approved looking at 2019 and 2020 and 2021.
Dennis P. Coleman - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Okay. That's great. And so, you would go forward with all of that, what Mike just talked about regardless of the outcome next Tuesday?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yes. Though – as long as – we're certainly going to pay attention to the way that it gets treated but I would just say right now as we're moving ahead, there is plenty of gas that is waiting on this infrastructure. So, the near term construction is a certain lust and our producers are desperate to see that get installed. Obviously, we'll keep our eyes before we spend – commit any further capital to see what other changes might occur out there but, right now, there's plenty of volume, plenty of demand for the service to continue with our expansions.
Dennis P. Coleman - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: That's great. Thanks, Alan. That's all I have.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you we'll take our next question from T.J. Schultz of RBC.
T.J. Schultz - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just first, given the private capital available and your comments on its ability to invest at certain multiples. You partnered in the DJ, are there other opportunities to partner with private capital that may be available to leverage your system as a whole?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Absolutely. And I think the good news is we are seen as a very reliable operator in the space and we have tremendous footprints already. And so, I would just cite that the Northeast area is an area that provides a lot of consolidation opportunity and ability to reduce capital investment in the area. The consolidations always occur in these basins and we think that we provide a great investment opportunity for these infrastructure funds to invest alongside us. And so, I would tell you that Chad and his team are extremely engaged with a lot of those sources of funds right now and have a lot of irons in the fire right now looking for those opportunities.
T.J. Schultz - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay, good. If I just move to the Gulf of Mexico, my sense is some of the potential growth comes at somewhat lower CapEx needs. Can you just frame that a little, what maybe is a nearest term opportunity to get some of the operational leverage embedded into the system, and where would you see more meaningful investment options to kind of further that, maybe around Mexico deep water realizing that's still a bit longer-dated?
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah, this is Michael. I'll take that. We do have a lot of tieback opportunities there that we're working on, as you indicated, that there are low or no capital just because of the infrastructure that we've already put in place there. We're actively working on a number of those opportunities and are building those into our future guidance as we speak. So, we are very optimistic about the Gulf of Mexico right now. Our Discovery system has several opportunities along it as well. But you also mentioned the deep water in Mexico, off our Perdido system, where we're the only entity out there and we really do expect some opportunity to come our way there in the future as well. So, a lot of great projects in the pipeline so to speak there and we're going to take advantage of the infrastructure that we've built there with very high-return projects with not a lot of capital to deploy there.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: And just to kind of name some of those, just to remind you, we've mentioned in the past, we've mentioned the Chevron-Ballymore prospect in the Eastern Gulf, the Shell well prospect in the West, and then there's also several Chevron prospects that we are working with them on in the Central Gulf right now as Michael mentioned around our Discovery system. So, the list actually is pretty long and some of them are more certain than others. Certainly, these very large fines like Ballymore and Well, while they're further out into the future, they are very significant in terms of revenue and EBITDA growth force with very little capital required.
T.J. Schultz - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Makes sense. Just last one. Thinking longer term with the liquids that you will control out of Rockies Midstream, does that provide or present opportunity for more downstream investment and how are you thinking about the ability to secure access to the coast for those barrels longer term?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah, I'm going to dodge that question. I'll just tell you right off the bat here. We are working a number of different opportunities. We're really excited about how we're going to position ourselves for the future on that, but we're in quite a few discussions right now and it doesn't make sense for us to lay that out at this point.
T.J. Schultz - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hey guys, two questions. One, just on the Northeast G&P, kind of that CAGR you put out. How are you thinking about the cadence of that? Meaning, very front-end loaded 2019, and then kind of tailing off? Or are you all kind of looking at that a little more evenly spread out?
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Michael, this is Michael. I would say it's – obviously, expansions come on chunky, if you will. And we've got an expansion underway right now in northeast Pennsylvania that we're working on, that will increase our capacity on the system there by 800 MMcf a day. That will be coming on in tranches in 2019 as we add compression and pipeline looping. And that would put us – our capacity up to almost 4 Bcf a day on that system alone in northeast Pennsylvania and the Susquehanna Supply Hub. So, I'll tell you, it will come on in chunks as we obviously expand the capabilities there, but we've got an exciting one underway right now. And we're talking to our producer customers out there right now about the next expansion that will come behind that 800 MMcf a day, specifically in northeast Pennsylvania. And the other growth that we're seeing in the Appalachian area, in southwest Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio, we're seeing the producer customers there ramping up their activities. And if you saw the transcript from the Southwestern discussions, they are – once they have their Fayetteville sale, Fayetteville Shale sale executed, they fully intend to ramp up activities there as their call indicated. And that production is coming right to our Oak Grove processing facility. And we're building a lot of compression up there for them right now as well as processing capability for them and our other customers in the area. So, it will be coming on in both of those different areas in tranches But we have a lot of activity under way right now with our teams there getting ready for that capacity.
Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you, Michael. Much appreciated.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Craig Shere of Tuohy Brothers.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good morning.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Hey, Craig.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: As far as the average $500 million a year multiyear figure for Northeast G&P to roughly hit the levels discussed at the May 2017 Analyst Day, since you've already announced projects that kind of place 2018 and 2019 above that trend, can we presume that the capital spend necessary in 2020 and 2021 would be significantly lower to still shoulder that seemingly roughly 11 Bcf a day in 2021?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I think, for the trajectory of growth that we're discussing right now, I think that is a fair assessment. I would add though, I think the big opportunity or an incremental opportunity for us that would reduce capital even further would be consolidation of some of the joint ventures in the Southwestern part of the play, so between the Utica system, Blue Racer, OVM, and some of the other adjacent assets in the area. There are some pretty big consolidation opportunities out there that would reduce the need for more capacity to be built. So, we're hopeful that we're able to execute on some of that consolidation and more rapidly reduce the capital investment in the area.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Excellent. And speaking of the growth, the 15% CAGR seems to imply over three years about 11 Bcf but then also, it looks like in the third quarter, your adjusted EBITDA was about – almost $0.42 NM versus less than $0.39 for the first half of 2017 and you're kind of guiding towards that to grow even further given the combination of above-growth processing, increasing West gas volumes, and higher overall system utilization. Is it reasonable to think that by 2021 we could be at $0.50 plus NM implying gross segment EBITDA of over $2 billion on 11 Bcf a day?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. That's a lot of math you went through there, Craig. But I would just say as we continue to look at the marker that we set out there at Analyst Day, that we feel very comfortable with that – that we're on a trajectory right now that makes us feel very comfortable about that. And so, I would say that that was kind of set out there aspirationally that said what if the Wood/Matt growth level occurred and I would just say that we're moving past that down to more detailed base focus in our system starting to support that rather than an analyst broad picture of the basin. So, I would say we're moving off of being reliant on somebody else's forecast and becoming more reliant on our own visibility to produce redactions there. So, an answer is, yeah, we're certainly moving to that. And again, I will just remind you that because we had some areas that had been retarded from growth due to lack of – very severe lack of infrastructure out of the areas, we are in some of the higher growth areas. And so, that's driving, and maybe even a little better, than what we had laid out there earlier.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Well, to simplify it, if at least in the third quarter my math is correct, you're approaching $0.42 NM in terms of adjusted EBITDA. Is it reasonable to think – is it unreasonable to think that you could get $0.50 plus by 2021?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: It is. That is very reasonable to think that we could get there by 2020. Again, it's going to be very dependent on mix between where the volumes show up and that will move around a little bit. But we – one thing that's really come our way in a very positive manner is the Utica rich which had been on a decline and that is a very high margin basin for us and that had been on decline and that has at least stopped declining now and has a potential for growth. And so, that was working against us previously but it's starting to turn the other way for us.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Last question, when you say 10% into 2019 and 5% to 7% long term, the 5% to 7%, is that off the 2019 level or in aggregate over several years?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: That is – yeah.
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Off into 2019. (01:00:41)
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah, that's just off of 2019 looking forward. And I would just remind you, though, that that is based on just our existing contracted business. And so, I would say there's potential for improvement as we continue growing a decent business that are not included in that forecast yet.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Understood. I appreciate the call. Congrats on the quarter.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC: Hi, Alan.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Good morning.
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC: Thanks for all the guided detail this morning. Two questions for me, if I could. First, in looking through the 10-Q you filed this morning, it seems like you've had roughly a $430 million working capital headwind over the last four quarters, which is significantly more than I could find of any time in the last 10 years. So, I'm curious, what's driving that? And then, if we might expect it to reverse in the future quarters?
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: I'm not aware offhand of what that – really that there's some unique working capital drop. If I had to guess, we've had a significant amount of capital spend. And so, you probably have a build in payables at the end of a quarters for projects that are underway that we know we've invested but haven't had an outflow yet. We'll definitely look into that and give you more details, but I suspect it has probably something to do with capital spend.
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC: Okay. But if that's – if that – if your hunch is correct, we should see then some reversal in the future?
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yes.
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And then, second, and this is just a curiosity question, but the analyst package last night have listed $35 million in preferred stock contribution to the Williams Foundation. I haven't seen you guys do anything like that before, although ONEOK had made a similar contribution to its own foundation last year. So, I was just wondering what the terms of that preferred stock are, realizing it's very small? And then, what your plans are, if any, for additional future contributions to the foundation?
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. The preferred stock has a 7.25% coupon on it. We have no plans to add anything to that. That was part of just planning and structure around the roll-up, just like ONEOK would have had in their situation. So, that will be outstanding. We annually make a contribution to our foundation anyway. And so, whether we're making it in an actual cash contribution or doing it through a dividend, the outcome is really the same to Williams. Yeah, and so, we'll just increase it. We'll be paying a dividend in lieu of some cash contributions we historically have made to the foundation.
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC: Okay. So, this is consistent to historical treatment but just more of a streamlined approach.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: And it accomplished a structural need that we needed in the roll-up. But again, much as ONEOK did, and we saw the light from their transaction. And so, pretty complicated question. But I would just say in practical terms, so it is very much – that activity was very much driven by that structure but – in the roll-up, But I would say that practically, in more pragmatic terms, as John mentioned, we've had that expense out there. This covers that for quite some time for us. So, it's actually a positive against what you would have seen in previous cash flows. But I also would tell you that we – the foundation is very strategic to the company. When we go into new communities, we like to show that we're a good neighbor in the communities that we operate as Williams. And the Williams Foundation helps support us being a good corporate citizen in those communities. And so, it is a very strategic investment for the company to make those investments in the foundation.
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC: All right. Thanks a lot for the time, guys. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.
Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Good morning. So, Alan and Michael, just circling back briefly to the comments on margin expansion in the Northeast. You kind of noted the overall uplift there at the EBITDA level, but specifically thinking about cost, it seems like unit costs have held pretty steady here through kind of year-to-date 2018. As you look at the volume ramp and you've dialed in kind of your expectations through the budgeting process for 2019, how should we think about the progression of OpEx over the course of 2019 just relative to where we sit here?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah, good morning. Thanks for the question. We obviously have higher cost as we add compression and we'll add operators to go in and operate the equipment there. But I have to remind you, as I do every quarter, in regard to the electricity cost, a lot of our compression that we're adding is electric compression due to the regulatory constraints on the air shed there. And so, that shows an increase in our operating cost, but the majority, if not all of that, is reimbursable from our customers. And so, you won't show that netted out from that reimbursement against our operating costs, in our operating cost line. It actually comes to us in other income. So, you will see an increase and it will look disproportionate to our actual cost that we have experienced in the past and it's all driven by higher electricity costs that are reimbursed elsewhere.
Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Got it. So, overall expectation is declining unit costs they just do not reflect on a line item specific basis?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: That's right. We continue to see our EBITDA per Mcf going in the right direction and our cost per Mcf moved going in the right direction as well.
Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Got it. And just on the West there, so a slight downtick in volumes. Can you guys provide a bit more detail on the moving parts there at the basin level? And then, just a quick follow-on. So, you mentioned DJ outlook being insulated by permits; any thoughts on the impact to the Piceance?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. A lot of the Piceance is – one, it's not very heavily populated, if you've ever been out there. But two, the – a lot of that is on federal land as well and, of course, this – that Colorado Proposition 112 doesn't affect federal land. So – and a lot of the producers actually own the land that they operate on out there. So, very different picture for the Piceance and don't expect much impact there. And so, I would just say that that's really the only exposure. The other area down around Durango and so forth, of course, that was the Four Corners Area asset. We've operated in that area for a lot of years, but that now is sold. So, we don't have exposure anywhere other than the Piceance and the DJ Basin. Oh, I'm sorry; you had asked about the Western volume. Sorry. Sorry about that. Yeah. Don't have a whole lot a color to add to you on that – for you on that. We constantly have some up and downs. The Haynesville growth had been driving a lot of the growth there in the Western volumes and we've seen – as we forecasted last year, we expected that to level off a little bit in terms of that rampant growth. We are seeing a lot of new opportunities with new customers in the basin and we're really excited about that. So, we may see the growth in the Haynesville come back more from customers outside of the Chesapeake acreage there in the area. Chesapeake continues to be successful but not seeing the kind of growth we saw from them last year. So, that's probably the biggest moving part if you looked at 2017 to 2018 in terms of what the growth drivers have been behind the basin. I would say, both Wamsutter and the Jackalope system are the two areas that we're going to see some growth here as we look forward to the next 6 to 12 months.
Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Got it. Appreciate the time.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.
Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. On the DJ Basin, I understand your comments on where you think you've got wells permitted and DUCs, et cetera. But let's say, hypothetically, that this does pass. How much of your 5% to 7% EBITDA growth is attributable to DJ Basin growth?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: It – Bec, it's really – since it's in that outer period, it's really not factored into that so much at all right now. So, it will start to add up in 2020 and 2021. It will start to be meaningful but as we look forward to that right now, it's really not a very big factor in our overall 5% to 7% growth. So, we're hoping...
Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC: Super.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: We're hoping that it will be but just given the limited size of the investment there, it's not that meaningful against the number right now.
Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC: And just wanted to dig a little bit deeper on your thought process on making investments, assuming that this does not pass. But there's still, I think, a view that this is still going to be an issue in Colorado and it may come up whether legislated or two years from now. So, how does that play into you making decisions for long term capital investment on plants besides these first two plants?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Again, I think we're going to see responsible development. I think Williams is very good at being responsible. I think the industry is going to shape as it needs to, to merge with Bucklift (60:58) And by the way, if somebody thinks this is going to be limited to Colorado, I would tell you that this move came from outside of Colorado, and I'm not sure that the move against development in areas is going to be limited to just Colorado. And I think producers and midstream infrastructure providers are in a different world today than we were five years ago, and we're going to have to learn to deal with the various stakeholders. I think Williams is extremely good at that. And because of our school of hard knocks that we've had in the Northeast, I think we're very good at that. And so, I would say I think these kind of areas present an opportunity for us because we found ways to appease the concerns and the needs and – to be able to grow infrastructure in a responsible manner in the area. So, yes, it's an area that I think will slow growth down. But if you think about that from a midstream infrastructure provider standpoint, this is a – something that's lost on people a lot of times because people are focused on the short term too often. But to the degree that you have acreage dedicated to you, if that acreage all got drilled at once, the efficiency of your input structure would be very low because you'd have to build all your capital at once, all the cash flows would come through in one spike, and you wouldn't have the longevity of the cash flows, and you'd have to build for a bigger peak. And so, I would just tell you that a rate of development that is more sustained is actually a positive for return – long term returns on midstream infrastructure and I think that's missed on people pretty often as they think about this issue.
Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC: Thank you. And then, the next question is just, I want to clarify that in your guidance there is zero uplift from Transco rate case?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: That's correct.
Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Christine Cho with Barclays.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, everyone. I just have one question on the Northeast. The 15% CAGR, could you give us a general idea of the breakdown of that growth between Northeast PA and Southwestern PA/West Virginia? Just trying to get a sense of like if one is higher growth than the other.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah, Christine. Let me see – give you a little bit of color here. Probably on a percentage basis, the two highest areas are the Ohio River Supply Hub area, particularly on a margin basis; and then Susquehanna Supply Hub is probably right behind that; and towards the bottom of that would be the Bradford Supply Hub; and then last would be the, in terms of what we have assumed in here right now, would be Utica Supply Hub. But I would tell you, there is a remarkable small amount of difference if you looked at the CAGR for each one of those. It's actually pretty balanced in our current forecast.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then, I just wanted to touch on the equity method investments in the Northeast. Quarter-over-quarter, we saw a bit of a jump from 2Q. I was just wondering if you could just talk about which JV specifically drove that, and how we should think about that going forward?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I'm looking and see if Michael or John have...
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: I think that's probably in the Bradford.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. (01:15:06)
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: I would say, that's where we saw the biggest volume growth. It's in the Bradford JV.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: That's correct. It was Bradford.
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Bradford and Marcellus South.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah.
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: (01:15:20)
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: And Marcellus South is part of our Ohio River Supply Hub, and so it sits on the eastern flank of our Ohio River system and feeds processing volumes into Ohio River.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it.
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Bradford had about a 9% increase in volumes...
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I'm sorry.
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: ...quarter-over-quarter. Bradford had about 9% increase in volumes quarter-over-quarter.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jean Ann Salisbury of Bernstein.
Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning. Just two quick ones for me. First, have you noticed interest from different classes of generalist investors since the buy-in of WPZ or nothing really changed that much?
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: I'll take it. Nothing's changed that much as we speak, or I think our price would be performing a little bit stronger than it has been. But I can tell you we are extremely focused on talking to new investors. We spent some time in Europe. We'll spend some time in Asia here very soon. We'll spend some time in Canada, and with the sole focus of identifying new investors and attracting new people to our name. We think we've got a powerful story to tell with our stability, our strong yield and the growth that we've got in our business. So, we've just got to get that out of the marketplace. But our goal is to accomplish that within the next year for sure.
Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes. That makes sense. And then, could you give a little more color on the mood of the Permian E&Ps in signing up for gas takeaway? Do you feel like most believe that they'll be able to flare if they need to? So, that it kind of puts less pressure on signing up at all? Or is it more that they probably will sign up, but perhaps with competitors other than Bluebonnet and it's just gotten very competitive out there?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Chad, you want to take that?
Chad J. Zamarin - The Williams Cos., Inc.: I'd just say I think there have been two projects that have been sanctioned so far that's for 4 Bcf a day of takeaway capacity. So, that does, I think, provide some relief in the basin in the near term. But I will also say that those projects had a variety of different investors and I would also say risk-adjusted returns that wouldn't really look attractive to us when we look at our opportunities for investment. So, I think that we're going to continue to watch the basin. There is additional need for takeaway over time. But we also want to make sure that we don't participate in any overbuild coming out of the basin. And so, we're going to continue to be thoughtful and disciplined. We're certainly out there talking to every producer. We're looking at every opportunity, but we'll – if we do something with respect to a project from the Permian to our Gulf Coast assets, we're going to make sure it's a smart investment. I would say though that even if we don't, in the near term, participate in building a pipe from the Permian to our Gulf Coast assets, we're seeing a lot of interest in those volumes wanting to get to the Transco system and deliver into markets along our footprints. So, we will participate in moving Permian gas through to Transco markets one way or another and, like I said, we'll continue to look for opportunities to build that larger infrastructure. But right now, those projects just aren't as attractive as I think they need to be to make it to the top of our list.
Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Sure. That makes sense. That's all for me, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our questions for today. I'll turn it back to Mr. Armstrong for closing remarks.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Okay. Great. Well, thank you. Thanks for the great questions and we continue to be really excited about the way the third quarter turned out and importantly, obviously, as you heard today, the catalyst that we think this sets up and the nice platform for growth that we've got established going forward. So, very stable cash flows, very predictable as we continue to make our numbers and we look forward to reporting more good news to you next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Williams, Williams Partners' Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John D. Porter - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Todd. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck, that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to you momentarily. Also joining us today is our Chief Operating Officer, Michael Dunn; our CFO, John Chandler; and Chad Zamarin, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development. In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to generally accepted accounting principles and these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials. And so, with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Great. Well, thank you, John, and thanks, everybody, for joining us this morning. I'll get right into it here. This was another very predictable quarter for us from a financial metric perspective. It was just slightly above our internal plan for the quarter that was used to forecast our guidance that we've provided to you. However, the extraordinary thing about the quarter was the tremendous amount of progress on projects, planned expansions and new business that was contracted during the quarter that gives us even more confidence in our growth rate for years to come. We are obviously looking forward to more dramatic growth in the second half of the year as Atlantic Sunrise project nears completion and producer activity on our systems in the Northeast and in Wyoming continues to ramp up. We're also excited about the transactions announced earlier this week. Selling assets in a very mature basin at attractive multiples and then redeploying that capital to higher growth basins allows us to capitalize on future growth opportunities without stretching the balance sheet or issuing equity. It is also clear that the demand for natural gas that we have been saying is just around the corner has recently come to life in a very dramatic manner. In fact, all sectors of natural gas demand are up in 2018 compared to the equivalent 2017 time period. LNG exports are up 57% for the year-to-date versus 2017. Power is up as well, up about 9% versus 2017. Residential is up and industrial is up and growing very rapidly. As a result, we have storage inventories now that are nearly 560 Bcf or 20% below the five-year average, yet price remains low, which is just creating another wave of investment in businesses poised to take advantage of this low pricing clean fuel. All of this spells higher production volumes and transmission throughput here in the U.S. to keep up with this rapidly growing U.S. and global demand. And as I think most of you appreciate, no one is better positioned to benefit from that growth in volumes without taking commodity price risk than Williams. And now some quick financial highlights that I'm excited to share with you from the quarter, first of all, we are up quarter-over-quarter in net income for WMB by over 66% and up quarter-over-quarter in adjusted income per share by 31%. On the WPZ side, we were up about 33% in net income quarter-over-quarter. So, for today's call, we're going to hit the following topics. First of all, the key driver behind our financial and operations metrics for 2Q and year-to-date, I'll highlight the major project contributions in 2Q and provide an update on other key achievements, also discuss the two strategic transactions that we announced earlier this week and finally highlight the value proposition to be created by the WPZ merger. And then, of course, as always we'll take questions. But before we move on to slide 2, I want to publically welcome Vicki Fuller, our newest Independent Director on The Williams' board of director. Vicki most recently led the New York State Common Retirement Fund where she had tremendous success as an investor there and leading the organization on their investments. She brings a wealth of leadership skills and financial expertise. Her investment management insights will be invaluable in our ongoing efforts to expand our investor base and maintain crisp focus on creating long-term shareholder value. Vicki will serve on the Audit Committee and the Nom. and Gov. Committee. Her appointment you may recall follows the June 4 appointment to the board of Nancy Buese. Nancy is currently Executive Vice President and CFO for Newmont Mining Corporation. Prior to that she was the CFO at MarkWest, now MPLX, and a key part of that leadership team that created tremendous shareholder values over the years and during her tenure there. We're already benefiting from her outstanding financial and energy leadership experience. And Nancy is serving on the board's Compensation and Management Development Committee as well as our EH&S Committee. I really am excited to welcome both Vicki and Nancy to our board of directors as we continue to build on what I think is the strongest board in the sector. Going to move on to slide 2 now and first of all, net income on a GAAP basis is up at both WPZ and WMB quarter-over-quarter. This is primarily the result of an increase in operating income of about $68 million at WPZ. WMB's GAAP EPS was up $0.06 per share or 60% versus second quarter of 2017. After adjustments for certain non-recurring items, WMB's adjusted EBITDA came in at $1.1 billion. Williams also delivered strong growth in EPS on an adjusted basis and adjusted income per share was up 31% over the second quarter 2017. As you can see on this slide, if you adjust for the sale of our olefins business and the impact of adopting new accounting standards for revenue recognition, our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up about 4%. This was a little above our quarterly plan, but both financials and operating stats were impacted by several plant outages, most notably the Mobile Bay and Echo Springs plant in Wyoming. NGL margins for the whole industry were extremely strong in the quarter, but our impact was limited by both NGL takeaway capacity as well as NGL hedges, which impacted us by about $7 million. In both cases, these plants were being modified to get ready for significant increases in volumes from the very liquid-rich new streams of gas. So, a lot of new opportunities coming on, including the Norphlet in the Eastern Gulf, and we are getting very near being completed with all of our work that readies our systems for that very large influx of very rich gas and as well in Wyoming in the Wamsutter field there, a lot of work going on and a lot yet to come in that area to ready for also a very large stream of new rich gas in that area. So, a great job by our teams in executing these efforts in a well-planned and safe manner. We also accelerated a significant amount of pipeline integrity work that was planned for the second half of 2018 into this quarter. The maintenance cost shifted from the second half to the first half was to take advantage of the timing of outages associated with expansion, construction work and project work that's been going on along the Transco system. This timing of maintenance work minimizes the impact on our customers, while reducing future revenue interruptions. Additionally, most of the increase in maintenance CapEx during the quarter was also on Transco and we fully expect to recover this capital investment via Transco's rate case. Let's move on to slide 3 and look at our year-to-date results. Year-to-date net income is down on a GAAP basis for both WPZ and WMB. The absence of a large gain on asset sales in the first quarter of 2017 affected the results and this comparison for both entities. Moving on to our non-GAAP results, which normalizes for non-recurring items like the 2017 gain on asset sales I mentioned earlier, our first half adjusted income per share attributable to WMB was up an impressive 33% over the first half of 2017 and WMB's adjusted EBITDA was $2.245 billion, again slightly ahead of our business plan that was used to create our guidance. And as you can see on this slide, if you adjust for the sale of our olefins business and the impact of adopting new accounting standards for revenue recognition, WMB's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up about $99 million or 5%. So, now let's move on to slide 4, where you'll see a list of several accomplishments and projects that are in progress. Here on slide 4, as you can see, our second quarter results featured contributions from a number of recent achievements. First of all, the Transco team placed Phase 2 of the Garden State project in service during March. Our customer activity continued to grow in the Northeast, where our inlet gas processing volumes were up more than 37% in our Ohio Valley Midstream processing complex in looking at the second quarter of 2018 versus same period of 2017. Our gathering volumes were up 160 million cubic feet per day quarter-over-quarter and up by approximately 250 million cubic feet per day on a year-to-date basis. Led by the Haynesville again, the West combined natural gas gathering volumes were up 270 million cubic feet per day on a year-to-date basis. And in the Atlantic Gulf, we saw Transco's transportation revenues up $114 million or 16% on a year-to-date basis and this was driven by fully contracted expansion projects. There are several good updates listed here for our various projects, including our Southeastern Trail project, which filed its FERC certificate application in April. In Wyoming, we just announced an exciting expansion on our Jackalope Gas Gathering System and associated Bucking Horse gas processing facility in the Powder River Basin that will increase processing capacity to 345 million cubic feet per day by the end of 2019 to meet the growing customer demand in this under-served growth basin. We also have begun construction activities on another major expansion of our G&P system in the Wamsutter field to serve Southland's fast growing production that was recently contracted. We achieved key milestones on Northeast Gathering and Processing expansion projects, which were highlighted at Analyst Day. We've now executed final agreements supporting system expansions in Northeast Pennsylvania, which are expected to increase capacity by about 800 million cubic feet per day. So, this is another expansion on top of the one that we just completed here at the first part of this year up in the Susquehanna Supply Hub area and we also have another major expansion underway at our Oak Grove gas processing facility in West Virginia, which is also fully contracted and we'll expand that system dramatically as well. The effects of these additions of supply are just now beginning to show as we complete key compressor facilities on our gathering systems that allow newly connected pads to begin flowing. So, we are really impressed with some of the production rates that we're seeing from some of the new pads that we're just now turning on. The number of projects that our teams are managing in the Northeast are way too numerous to mention here, but the fruits of their labor will begin to show later this year and into 2019. As mentioned at the top, we are nearing completion on our Atlantic Sunrise project and are targeting full in-service towards the end of this month for that 1.7 billion cubic feet per day expansion on our Transco system. I'm going to pause here just a minute and tell you how proud I am of our project teams for their focus on doing the right thing, both from a safety perspective and an environmental compliance perspective. They have been very thoughtful in listening to regulators and key stakeholders in the communities and their careful planning, engineering and patience is truly distinguishing our efforts as we near completion of this important project. They have dealt with very tough regulatory issues, religious orders, a very tight skilled labor market and record levels of rainfall with tremendous diligence, professionalism and integrity. And while we are still battling the impacts of major flooding in the area last week, we are pouring it on in order to bring this one over the finish line as the weather allows. So, let's move on to slide 5 and talk about the two strategic transactions announced this week. Our ongoing business and project execution has become remarkably predictable, but we have also been working hard to manage our portfolio of assets in a way that maintains our platform for growth for many years to come. I'm really pleased with our execution on the two big transactions we announced earlier this week. First of all, Williams, along with KKR as our joint venture partner, announced the acquisition of Discovery DJ Services for $1.173 billion, subject to the customary closing conditions and purchase price adjustments. Our initial contribution is 40% of the purchase price or said another way, Williams is responsible for approximately $470 million of that total purchase price and will be the operator of these very attractive assets in the DJ Basin. The assets feature a total of 260 million cubic feet per day of gas processing capacity, which is expected to be in service by the end of this year and permitting underway for greater than 1 Bcf a day of gas processing that is required to service the 260,000 acres that are already under dedication. In addition to the attractive growth opportunities we see just in gathering and processing, Williams also expects to generate additional value by integrating production from these assets with our existing footprint in our West segment, including our downstream NGL assets. We expect the Discovery transaction to represent a 5 times to 6 times multiple and that's using The Williams' investment inclusive of the required growth CapEx based on the 2020 EBITDA forecast and the growth on the asset should continue to ramp well beyond 2020 and of course that multiple will get even better as that growth occurs. Now we realize that this multiple seems higher than a competitive market would typically allow, but this is an example of when we can take unique downstream synergies being applied to a 50% upstream investment. So, said another way, we are enjoying 100% of those synergies, but they are being applied to a 50% upstream investment and that really is what drives that much higher-than-market multiple. We like this strategy a lot and I would tell you that our team has been working hard to develop these kind of opportunities where we work with private dollars and really leverage those to take advantage of a lot of the great synergies that we have available to us from our large scale footprint across the U.S. Concurrently, we announced the sale of the Four Corners asset for $1.125 billion in cash from Harvest Midstream Company, an affiliate of Hilcorp Energy Company. The cash proceeds will help fund the Discovery transaction in a portion of our extensive growth capital and investment expenditure portfolio. The Four Corners Area has been an important part of Williams dating back to its acquisition in 1983. However, pressure on natural gas pricing from adjacent basins, like the Permian, demand a new basin model that consolidates and integrates upstream production with midstream operation in a way that optimizes throughput and lowers cost. We believe that Harvest Midstream along with Hilcorp are ideally positioned to achieve this integration while Williams is able to redeploy the proceeds into improved opportunities for growth. This value and multiple on EBITDA of 13.7, we are receiving as a testament to the high-quality assets that Williams' employees have grown and maintained in the Four Corners Area for the past 35 years. So, now, let's look at the next slide and discuss the CapEx guidance update. After consideration of the effects of both the purchase of the Discovery DJ Services and the divestiture of the Four Corners Area as well as several other forecast updates, our current guidance from a Analyst Day on May 17, 2018, remains unchanged except for our growth capital expenditure. Growth CapEx has been revised for 2018 and 2019 to account for the inclusion of the purchase of the Discovery system and other projects included. In the 2019 figure are our planned Niobrara expansion and our various expansions in the Northeast G&P segment. While CapEx is up due to the Discovery deal, it's important to note that the Four Corners transaction allows us to fully finance the initial Discovery DJ investment and its follow-on CapEx without issuing any equity or increasing our debt and we've generated additional cash flow beyond those needs to finance other growth projects. So, while this transaction doesn't drive the metric shown on this page, the Harvest and swift deployment of capital into higher returning opportunities that take advantage of our downstream synergies is a terrific example of how we're focused on driving shareholder value through active portfolio management. Now, let's look at the key investment benefits for Williams' shareholders following the rollup of WPZ. We look here at slide 7. Williams is certainly unique investment amongst the S&P 500 companies. The post-merger entity will provide a large scale entity, focused on natural gas with significant growth opportunities, low volatility and highly predictable fee-for-service cash flows. After the WMB-WPZ merger closes, we'll have a much more simplified org structure and a highly liquid C-Corp with associated shareholder rights and impressive market capitalization. Our attractive dividend yield and growth along with our strong focus on improving ROCE will deliver significant advantages for shareholders. Williams fares extremely well when compared to other S&P 500 companies in dividend yield, adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA growth and dividend growth. In fact, Williams is so unique that you'd be hard pressed to find another S&P company whose consensus estimates meet or exceed Williams' outlook for these key measures. Now, we're going to move on to slide 8 here to wrap up. So, as we wrap up the presentation here and prepare to take questions, this slide 8 really provides a good summation of Williams' attractive position. Our financial results are meeting expectation with solid results for our continuing businesses. Importantly, net income and adjusted EPS are both up substantially quarter-over-quarter. There's also clear visibility to future growth. We are leveraging advantaged assets and approaching our expected in-service date for the Atlantic Sunrise project. We expect Northeast volume growth to accelerate into the end of 2018 and continue to grow at 2019. The West portfolio is also gaining attractive growth opportunities and we have plenty of great high-return investment opportunities to invest the proceeds from the sale of our Four Corners Area business. Finally, The Williams and Williams Partners merger is on track and as a reminder, our special Williams stockholder meeting to vote on the proposed merger of WPZ and to WMB will be held on August 9 at 10:00 AM in the morning, Central Time, at our Tulsa headquarters. Williams' stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 9, 2018, are entitled to vote. I would remind those who haven't yet voted to please do so. Assuming a successful vote when the merger is completed, Williams simplified structure, investment-grade credit ratings, growth opportunities and cash flow available to fund that growth, all contribute to positioning Williams as a uniquely attractive investment opportunity compared to almost any sector or equity across the broad universe of investments. So, with that, we thank you very much for your time today and operator, let's take our first question.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our first question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I just want to touch on the transactions in the West here that you completed. And just wondering if there is any more to read into this as far as looking to kind of diversify into – more into liquids-rich areas or kind of grow the presence in more basins, bigger presence of the basins inside the Northeast. How did this factor into your thought-process here?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Well, thank you. Great question. And I would just say that, we're always looking for basins where we have a lot of downstream synergies to be able to apply and it's really a unique situation when we can take private dollars and invest a smaller slice of our own capital and do something, but enjoy the downstream of synergies and drive downstream synergies into our existing asset base. And so, I think that's really the clue that you ought to be looking for is really where we can drive synergistic value and that unique competitive advantage that we have in a process like that is really where our efforts are focused. And so, I wouldn't see this as wide scale outside of areas where we've got the ability to drive quite a bit of synergies with either existing assets in the basin or with downstream assets that we could develop.
Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: That's helpful. Thanks. And just wondering, Bluebonnet, if there's anything new to report there.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I'm going to ask Chad Zamarin to take that. Chad?
Chad J. Zamarin - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Sure. Thanks. I would just say that we continue to advance that project and we strongly believe that Permian volumes are going to want to access Transco markets, which are truly second to none. So, we do see a lot of momentum towards a build-out from the Permian towards Transco markets. I would just say that we're going to remain disciplined in how we contract that project. It's certainly an active area to competitive market. We've got a great inventory of projects across our footprint. So, we're confident that, that infrastructure will be available for us to build to bring those volumes into Transco markets, but at the same time, we're going to be thoughtful about how we contract. I would say we've seen one project fully contracted for a Permian takeaway and we fully expect that there will be multiple additional projects over time. And so, we've continued to see good momentum on the BMX project and we'll continue to work it as we move forward.
Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: That's helpful. Thanks. And then, in Appalachia outside of Northeast PA, I was just wondering if you could give us a feel for producer activity and focus on drivers as you see in your areas there and how you see volumes trending. And then, NESE as well, just wondering if you could add any new updates there. Thanks.
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Okay. This is Michael Dunn. I'll take that question. In the Northeast, we are seeing our volumes grow really significantly in the Ohio River Supply area with the richer gas that's coming into our Oak Grove processing facilities. So, we're anxiously awaiting the in-service date of our second train there at Oak Grove to process this gas and we think we'll be at capacity on Train 1 that's already in-service there by mid next year, which is when we expect Train 2 to come online. So, really seeing a lot of good growth there. We saw about 30% growth in the Marcellus South year-to-date compared to last year at the same time and so really excited to see those volumes coming on. And also in Susquehanna and Bradford, we're seeing volumes grow there as well, but overall, we'd expect volume to continue to grow in Northeast Pennsylvania after Atlantic Sunrise comes online and we see some of those volumes continue to grow from our customers there. As far as NESE goes, on the NESE project, I think you've probably seen the updates that we've had there in regard to our permits that we've been working through with New York and New Jersey on the 401 certifications under the Clean Water Act and both of those permits have been resubmitted to New York and New Jersey. And we're working with both of those states to continue to process the permits, the data requests there. We have a draft EIS that's out on the project as well and continuing to work with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the core of engineers in the states to process those permits, but we have anticipated now that will slide the in-service date out to the end of 2020. And I will tell you and remind you that we typically do risk-adjust our revenues in our guidance and our balance plans and so that will closely align with where we anticipated our revenue in the first place with the projects. So, we've had a shift of capital out of 2019 and more closely aligned with the 2020 and service date on NESE.
Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: That's helpful. I'll stop there. Thanks for taking my question.
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Christine Cho with Barclays.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. If I could also start with the acquisition, could you provide any additional information about your option to acquire a portion of the KKR interest at the predetermined, agreed-to terms?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Sure, Christine. I'll ask John Chandler to take that.
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Sure. First, I want to say just generally about the structure, we find KKR to be an excellent partner in this project. This is unlike maybe some of the traditional partner investments you've seen with private money in that this isn't a preferred investment. So, there is preferred coupon or anything like that between joint venture partners in this transaction. Even though it's an initial 40%, 60% investment, 40% Williams, 60% KKR, we do have voting control and governance control in the partnership from day one. And over the next year-and-a-half, we will bring our equity interest up. We invest first dollars in the growth projects over the next year-and-a-half, which will bring our economic interest up to 50%, 50% interest. And as it relates to the buyout option, we do have a buyout option in the future with KKR, but we're able to call their interest as – I'm not going to give you the exact return, but it's a low to mid-teen type return. We believe these assets on their own just the gathering assets produce a return higher than that. So, we think that's going to be a very attractive economic option for us in the future. But it's at our option to call that interest for a limited period of time and in the future. And in doing that, we did give up something to them. We gave them a liquidation preference in the event there was ever a meltdown of the investment, which is highly unlikely. And so, they did receive that return for us getting the right to call their interest and also the right not to be drug if they did sell their interest and we didn't want to participate in that. That answered your question?
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Thanks. And then, can you talk about how the contracts are structured for the Discovery asset? Is it fear of pop (30:53) and will you be offering a bundled service for the gathering processing, Overland Pass and frac? And also would you have to loop Overland to accommodate those volumes?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Christine, thank you. The business is almost all fee-based there in the DJ Basin and there are downstream contracts for the NGL services that are separate for that. And in terms of whether we would have to loop OPPL, I think that's dependent on other actions from players, but unlikely I think, given ONEOK's Elk Creek facility and the White Cliffs conversion, I think it's unlikely that, that would be required. But – so, we don't really expect that to occur. So, I think, we see a lot of opportunity under our existing contracts and business to really help the DJ Basin producers and get access to attractive markets and we think we're well positioned to do that and that's where a lot of those synergies come from.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, up in the Northeast, just in your prepared remarks, you had mentioned the Oak Grove expansion is being contracted. Can you remind us what those are? There were some contracts that you announced and the acreage had turned over from some of the original producers to ETT and Southwestern. But just curious if there were any additional signed subsequent to that.
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: No. Christine, this is Michael again. Those are the primary contracts we have there, but we're obviously talking to a lot of different producers up there that are bringing in rigs at least anticipated and we'll continue to have new contracting opportunities to continue to fill that, but, right now, we have, like I said earlier, Oak Grove TXP Train 2 under construction and we're actually under construction with a portion of the civil work on Train 3 as well, which we think will probably need by the end of 2019, early 2021, once Train 2 fills up. So, we expect Train 2 to rapidly fill in 2019 and be at capacity by the end of the year. That's why we're currently building Train 3 as well and even talking to our internal parties and some of our producers up there about a need for Train 4 after that. So, there's a lot of activity up there and we're pretty excited about it.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: And I would just add to that, Christine. In addition to the Oak Grove or to the Ohio Valley Midstream area proper, we also have some expansion ongoing with Chevron on the LMM system as well. That's new business to us. And so, really kind of across the board right now with the one exception being the Utica, we're seeing pretty substantial growth and, of course, we're excited about the new investor in the Utica replacing Chesapeake there who is going to bring a lot of new capital to that area. So, while Utica has really been kind of the slower growing piece of our Northeast position, we're really excited about their plans there in the Utica now.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Very helpful. Thank you.
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: I should have also talked about our NGL pipeline that we announced at Analyst Day as well that we're well on our way to having that project completed probably in the second quarter next year from our Oak Grove facility up to the Harrison Hub as well. So, we've made great progress there. We've got all the right-of-way acquired. We've cut the majority of the trees along the right-of-way and we'll start construction on that this fall.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt Company.
Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Good morning. So, it looks like the Northeast unit operating expenses were relatively flat versus Q1. So, just given the volume trajectory you guys expect in the second half of the year and then particularly moving into 2019, should we expect that rate to continue to decline or I guess, definitely, how are you thinking about the potential margin expansion you've highlighted in the past?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Colton, great question. I would say, yes, we are expecting as volumes continue to grow and we continue to take cost down. The second quarter is always a – and particularly this second quarter where we had a lot of rainfall in the area, so there was a lot of pipe slips in the area and even a lot of road damage in the area that we had to contend with up there tends to drive our operating costs higher. As well, it's also the time when we come out of a thaw period there in the Northeast and we start doing a lot of our maintenance work in overhauls. So, typically, the second quarter gets a lot of those kind of incremental cost. So, even though we were able to hold it flat, I think if you normalize for those, you'd start to see a trend towards even better unit margin than you're picking up on. So, we're really excited about that. The team is very focused on that and I would tell you, as an organization, we focus on and in our goals is the operating margin ratio for each of these areas, which is very close to the EBITDA unit margin that you're looking at. And so, we pay very close attention to that. The teams are measured on that and the executive team is compensated on that. So, you'll continue to see us really pushing on those numbers and the teams are extremely focused on that.
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I'll just add to that, Alan. We do have variable cost up there that are driven by our electrical power costs. We do have a lot of electrical compression in the Northeast. And so, when we have volumes ramp up, those power prices – those power costs are translated into our operating expense, which for the most part are reimbursed, but it's not netted against our operating expense, it comes in other revenue. And so, you wouldn't see that as a net to our operating expense.
Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Yeah. That's helpful. And I guess, could you just update us on where you stand with the proposed Leidy Project that I think you guys highlighted the Leidy to Zone 6, I think at that point in time, you had a precedent transaction agreed to and were in negotiations with a couple of other producer counterparties there?
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. We're still making progress on that. Really nothing new to update from Analyst Day with the exception of the fact that we're just making progress there and hoping to conclude those negotiations soon. And the team is working on the applications that we will need to make for the FERC filings on that, but still making progress there and expect to have an exciting project to talk about in the near future.
Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. And just last one for me here, in the past, you've noted the Hutchinson rail terminal, the loading capabilities there near the Conway assets. Just given the spread that we're seeing between Conway and Bellevue, does that asset have any value to you guys in terms of arbitrage capture?
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. We're seeing a lot of activity actually there. We're taking in lot of barrels from the Bakken, which is because of some impacts, probably short-term impacts, with takeaway capacity there, but we are seeing some new contracts that actually go out a little further than you would expect in regard to when those constraints are relieved. So, we're actually pleased with that. It's new business for us that we're capturing there and I think we'll continue to be able to do that.
Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: All right. Well, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning. Just wondering if you can comment on the key drivers and maybe the pace of growth to get to that five to six multiple for Discovery DJ and if you can maybe just talk about the potential to add processing capacity, I think you mentioned that there is a space or permitting for 1 Bcf.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Chad, if you'll take that.
Chad J. Zamarin - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Sure. Yeah, yeah, thanks for the question. First, I'll take that in reverse. As part of the acquisition, the Discovery system already owns sufficient property or has under lease sufficient property to support the over 1 Bcf a day of capacity that's expected to be required to service the existing dedications and from a growth perspective, it is a growth asset. There's a lot of activity already underway on the acreage that dedicated to the system. There's a really attractive portfolio of producers that make up that 260,000 acres of dedication. And we've modeled a fairly conservative expectation around ongoing activities. So, we're not expecting a tremendous amount of new activity to have to move into the area to support the growth that the Discovery system is poised for. So, we're really excited about the fact that we've got a very stable strong producer base that we fully expect to be moving a lot of volumes through the system over the next several years.
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: I think it's also fair to say, given – I think you're trying to mathematically look at the ramp of the EBITDA, we didn't change our guidance in 2019. Clearly, the Four Corners assets have gone away and they historically produced an EBITDA in the range of $80 million to $85 million. We're not saying these assets will produce that level, but it's certainly close enough that -we aren't adjusting our guidance. So, there is a ramp through 2019 and into 2020 to that five to six times multiple.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then, I guess just on constitution, any thoughts in terms of potential timing for FERC rehearing or any updates on that front?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Lane, do you want to take that?
Terrance Lane Wilson - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. This is Lane Wilson. The FERC denied rehearing. And so, we're now clear to pursue that case in the D.C. Circuit. We're evaluating that right now, but we anticipate doing that at some point before the deadline.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Sharon.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC: Hey, good morning, Alan.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Good morning, Chris.
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC: Couple questions for me. I was just curious if there was any update on either the timing or the components of the pending Transco rate case. I know, you've talked about August 31 as the filing date, at least – as the last date. But you had mentioned sort of the acceleration of some of the maintenance work into the first half of the year to coincide with the outage there. It sounded like that might have been a bigger amount of maintenance than you had initially planned, probably small in the margin, but just wondering if there's any changes we should anticipate with regard to that case?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Mike, do you want to take that?
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: I will. Hi, Chris. We permanently took advantage on those outages of getting the work done before ASR came online. There was a significant amount of activity that has been planned for quite some time with our in-line integrity work. This is primarily the smart pigging that we've been performing on the Transco system as well as the number of hydro tests that were going back in pressure testing, the older pipeline system components of Transco. So, that's – really what we were doing was taking advantage of the shoulder season here in the second quarter primarily. So, I would think you would see a different thing you've seen in the past in regard to our maintenance CapEx and our OpEx on the Transco system, where we really had to flip it this year and a lot of that was driven by ASR coming online later this year, where the Transco system is going to be operated much tighter than it has in the past. And so, we really wanted to get that work done before ASR came online.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: And, Chris, I would just add to that. Obviously the maintenance capital, which also you saw was high during the quarter, obviously that does – that will affect the rate case through May obviously. And so, we fully intend to build or recover the maintenance capital portion of that through the rate case. So, I would say we're looking forward to getting that rate case out on the table and getting on with that. So, there has been a lot of changes obviously on the FERC side that have kept people hopping on a tax treatment there, but we feel very good and team has done a terrific job of keeping up with all those changes and is ready to follow through with the rate case here in August.
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks for that. If I could pivot and I apologize if I missed it, but was curious, John, if you could let us know or if you had outlined what the cash tax expectations were in association with your Four Corners sale. You had put the sale proceeds number in the release, I just didn't know sort of on a post-tax basis what we should anticipate?
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Obviously with the step-up from the roll-up, there will be not be a tax consequence. We'll be recreating a significant net operating loss through that. So, we don't anticipate cash outflow relative to the transaction.
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC: Okay. That's what I anticipated, I just wanted to confirm. And then finally, I guess dovetailing back on a question earlier from Jeremy about the appetite to enter new basins or make step-out investments that might not be entirely homegrown, particularly, Alan, as you've mentioned where you have sort of capability for downstream synergy. I think it's obvious to a lot of people as they look at the pro forma WPZ merged Williams, there's a lot of capacity to spend money. And so, just wondering – you had mentioned in prior calls, probably last year, about potential consolidation in the Northeast partnerships. There is at least one third-party entity in the Northeast that might be coming out in a more independent fashion. I'm just curious, the appetite you might have and then also geographic focus for that appetite.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I would just tell you, I think this team is extremely disciplined. There are a lot of opportunities out there, but we recognize that our cost of capital relative to the private cost of capital right now is strangely enough. We're going through a period right now as an industry where it's very obvious to us that the private infrastructure fund money is much lower cost than the public dollars are. And particularly given the growth rate in our public equity that I would argue is not being reflected in our price, it really pushes us to recognize we've got a very high cost of capital outside of what we can – of the cost we can internally generate obviously. And so, we have to think about the other uses of that cash whether that is dividend or share buyback or whatever that might be, that's alternative use of that capital. So, yes, we have some great high-return investment opportunities as a result of our big footprint. And we will take advantage of those where we can and if we can use other people's money, that is lower cost than ours, to help capture some of that like we are doing on the DJ transaction, then we will certainly pursue that. But I would tell you we're going to remain very disciplined around capital allocation and look at it broader than just to our assets, but what it means ultimately to shareholder value.
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Yeah. That's helpful. We've obviously noticed the same cost differential and I don't know if you have views on it, but perhaps perversely, it might be good rising rates, which I think historically were thought to be negative for midstream equity values as given that they had a dividend component might actually be a positive, but they drive off the cost with some of this private competition.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. (47:47)
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. No. That's a very interesting thought, Chris. I would just say, I think, right now it appears to us is there continues to be a lot of money trying to flow in to the infrastructure funds and private equity and I think, we see a lot of money, anxious to go to work and we think there's great places that are aligned with us that we can put that money to work and that's exactly what the team has been working on. And I think, again the transaction we just did is a great example of that.
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC: Great. Well, I appreciate all the added thoughts.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thank you, Chris.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Derek Walker with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Derek Walker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning, guys.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Good morning.
Derek Walker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I have just a quick one on the merger. With the shareholder vote on August 9, how should we think about – assuming that there is a successful process there, should we expect that to close shortly thereafter or are there some other items we should be watching out for?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: No. You should expect it to close very shortly thereafter.
Derek Walker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Great. And then, Alan, you mentioned a new customer in the Utica. I just want to confirm is that related to the Chesapeake sale that was recently announced? And then, just want to also confirm, do those contracts roll with the new customer and have there been any discussions yet from that customer to perhaps renegotiate any of those terms?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: The answer is yes. Those contracts roll. And no, there hasn't been any discussion of restructuring those contracts. As far as I'm aware of, I don't think there is any expectation of that. I think the new customer knows. Obviously, we're always open to value-added transactions. And teams are always very aware of how value can be added. But right now, those contracts roll with the acreage and we think there's a lot of value. I would just tell you that to the degree there's capital available, obviously Chesapeake has been capital constrained. They've had a lot of great opportunities, including the Utica, but they've been capital constrained. If you think about the nature of those cost of service contracts, like we have on the Cardinal Gathering System there that services the rich Utica, if somebody can come in and apply the capital and get the volumes up, they naturally take the rate down. So, there's a way to fix and get a lower rate just through the investment of drilling capital. And so, that's kind of what I would expect to happen, given the availability of capital that, that team is going to have to apply to those assets. So, I would just say that's been a challenge for Chesapeake to take advantage of that opportunity just because they've been capital constrained. So, I think this is a good example of the market working and new capital being brought in against attractive return opportunities in terms of drilling on that acreage and that's fully what we expect to see and volumes will go up and rate eventually will go down be it a cost of service model associated with them.
Derek Walker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thank you, Alan. Appreciate it.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.
Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC: Good morning, guys. Back on the DJ Basin, the downstream synergies that you talked about, what are those?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Becca, there are multiple synergies. I would just tell you we have some fairly complex contractual relationships downstream that I'm not going to get into that relate to our existing Rockies business, but we're not going to divulge the details of that, but I would just say there's quite a bit of opportunity in that. And as well obviously, we have a downstream infrastructure in terms of both OPPL and Conway fractionator as well. So, I would say there is multiple opportunities around that and a lot of it relates to our contracts that we have for our existing NGL volumes coming out of the Rockies.
Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC: Thank you. And then, you talked earlier in your remarks about some constraints on NGL takeaway, maybe dampening a little bit EBITDA. Will you have the ability to flow volumes from these processing plants, especially when you're at the 200 million a day on OPPL since it's full?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Good question. First of all, I would say the NGL constraints are in multiple locations as you know, I think you're well aware that the two ways out of the Rockies are either on the MAPL System, which unfortunately flows through the Permian to ultimately get to the Bellevue. So, that path previously has been an open path, but with all the Permian congestion, the route south on MAPL out of the Rockies has been constrained. And so, the San Juan Basin asset, as an example of that, has been on allocation for quite some time. And so, when ethane margins become available, that's very difficult to capture, given the allocations going to South. And of course, the other option out of the Rockies is on Overland Pass and that has been on curtailment for, I don't know, maybe 13 or 14 months now. It has been on curtailment and has limited our ability to extract the ethane margin out of the region as well. So, that's the constraints that I spoke about earlier. In terms of things that are changing obviously on that, as I mentioned to Christine earlier, of course the Elk Creek pipeline that ONEOK is building along with the more near-term transformation of the White Cliffs System from crude to NGLs as well as another major expansion out of the DJ Basin in the way of the Front Range system, all are providing quite a bit of relief for that particular area that will provide relief for both the Bakken and the DJ and the Rockies ethane molecules. And so, that's where a lot of that uplift will come from as those systems all are expanded out there.
Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC: Thank you. And then, last question is there have been more roadblocks put out in front of pipelines, a lot of surprising wins by the Sierra Club, the FERC now going to take into account or looking at taking into account the larger greenhouse gas emissions, how is that playing into how you're projecting your timing for new pipes – new gas pipes?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Well, I would say, for instance, on the NESE project even though that's been delayed from what we had in our capital in terms of our internal projections, we had a delay built into that. So, I would say, unfortunately, we're pretty accustomed to the delays and I think have done a good job of predicting them. I also though – and so, I really – I would tell you that I think that, that opposition has been very effective on a number of fronts. And I think we've got to continue to do things the right way as an industry. We've got to improve discipline across the industry on our construction practices and how we deal with the public. I would tell you, I think Williams is a leader on that. I think Atlantic Sunrise is a good example of that. But we have to build in quite a bit extra time in the Northeast. I think it's yet to be determined if that opposition spreads outside – dramatically outside of the Northeast. Obviously, the attack on Sabal Trails is an example of it spreading out of the Northeast. And so, we may see that expand other areas as well. And so, I think everybody better have eyes wide open when you think about greenfield or long-haul pipeline construction. I think everybody better be eyes wide open and they need to sharpen their skill sets both in terms of regulatory compliance and the engineering that goes into building these pipelines in a way that stays well within the bounds of the regulators and the communities that we serve. So, I would tell you we've been attuned to that issue for a long time just because a lot of our construction has been in the Northeast. But I have a feeling that, that is going to spread outside the Northeast. And I'm hopeful that the rest of the industry really starts to pay attention to those issues.
Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC: Thank you. That's all I had.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thanks. Thank you, Becca.
Operator: Thank you. We are out of time for questions. I'll turn the call back to the speakers for closing remarks.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks everybody for joining us. Again a very predictable quarter from a financial metric standpoint, but a tremendous platform being built and a lot of work that went on this quarter that positions us for even greater growth here in the second half of 2018 and certainly in a big way into 2019 and beyond. So, really excited about the great work by the company during the quarter and we look forward to sharing that with you in the future.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams, Williams Partners' First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John D. Porter - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Christina. Good morning, and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include press releases and related investor materials including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to you momentarily. Joining us today is our Chief Operating Officer, Michael Dunn; and our CFO, John Chandler. In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to generally accepted accounting principles and these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials. And so, with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Great. Thank you, John, and welcome, everyone. I plan to keep the remarks pretty brief today due to our upcoming Analyst Day, where we're going to provide a much more in-depth review of the business. We're really looking forward to highlighting a lot of things that are going on. I would say here at a high level, the quarter was right on plan. We met expectations and we continue to remain on course and anticipate significant growth as we look toward the second half of this year and into 2019. Our strategy of focusing on connecting low cost natural gas supplies to the fastest growing demand centers allow the organization to leverage our solid foundation of advantaged positions to deliver another predictable quarter of broad-based growth. Once again showing year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA in each of our business segments, and while we now have a long string of adjusted EBITDA growth posted, we're most excited about what our intense focus on strategy will produce for us in the long term. This focus has allowed us to continue to identify, develop, and contract for new opportunities at a higher than industry average returns. And this is going to drive improvement in ROCE and shareholder value for many years to come. No one is as well positioned as Williams to capture the accelerating growth and demand for U.S. natural gas, and we look forward to updating investors about our significant achievements and the future plans at our Analyst Day event on May 17. So, for today's relatively brief call, we're going to hit just a few things here. First, a recap of our performance for the first quarter of 2018. I'll hit a few highlights that we saw in terms of strong execution in the quarter and that we're delivering across all of our business segments. I'll drill down a little bit into the business segments. And then finally, I'll continue to outline the key topics that will provide a deeper dive into our Analyst Day event. But for now, let's move to slide 2 and review our results for the first quarter. First of all, I'll say I'm pleased with the continued project execution and operational performance our teams delivered during the first quarter of 2018. And now looking to our GAAP results, the Williams Partners' net income was $360 million, reflecting a $274 million decrease from first quarter of 2017. The higher net income in 2017 was driven by a successful asset sale program that we executed in 2017. The largest driver of change was the absence of a $269 million gain that we booked on an asset sale in the first quarter of 2017 and the absence of margins from the Geismar olefins facility, which was sold in 2000 – sorry in July of 2017 and that was about – that was the bulk of the $59 million increase in commodity margins that you can see posted in our number, so $269 million on the gain and the largest portion of that $59 million of commodity margins. Moving on to non-GAAP measures, adjusted EBITDA was $1.12 billion, an increase of $5 million over the first quarter of 2017, that was up $53 million or 5% for the partnership's current business segments over the same period in 2017, and this was driven by a $58 million in increased revenues from our Transco expansion projects being placed into service in 2017 and another $11 million of higher fee-based revenues in the Northeast Gathering segment. This was partially offset by the $23 million decrease in proportional EBITDA from joint ventures and I'll hit on that a little more in a minute. And all three of our current business segments showed year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA. So, let me drill down into the drivers for each of these areas. First of all in Atlantic-Gulf, we saw a $13 million increase in adjusted EBITDA. The fee revenues on Transco were up 16% due in large part to the many fully contracted expansions placed into service during 2017. And we did see higher expenses compared to 1Q of 2017, but expenses actually decreased by about 10% from the sequential quarter in the Atlantic-Gulf segment. The larger offset came from Discovery, where the depletion of Exxon's Prolific Hadrian wells, drove the JV EBITDA down about $29 million in the quarter, and that was as we projected in last quarter's earnings call. And we'll see that taper off – that impact continue to taper off as those wells depleted down through the third quarter of last year. The completion of Atlantic Sunrise worth about $105 million per quarter of incremental revenue for Transco will be a significant contributor to the growth we anticipate in later half of this year for the Atlantic-Gulf segment. Now moving to the West, the West increased adjusted EBITDA by $17 million, and despite some large impact from revenue recognition in this comparison, the West continues to produce stable results from a broad range of customers and supply basins; in fact, gathered volumes were higher in 9 of the 10 franchises versus first quarter of 2017. And the one area that was lower was the Barnett, which showed about a 5% annual decline from same period last year. The West continued its strong record of reducing expenses as it showed another decrease in expenses from first quarter of 2017 and overcame the loss of EBITDA associated with a gathering asset sold in 2017, and from the new lower rates that we are recognizing on Northwest Pipeline. Looking forward, producers are starting to respond to higher oil and NGL prices, while gas gathering volumes were up 8% for the West, processing volumes increased 9% on a year-over-year basis and that's on an inlet – plant inlet gas basis, and we are seeing additional producer activity in liquids driven plays like the Wamsutter area and the Washakie Basin in Wyoming, the Eagle Ford, and now emerging is the Turner formation in the Powder River Basin, all these areas should drive volume growth for the balance of the year. Now turning to the Northeast Gathering segment, the Northeast showed the largest year-over-year improvement of $23 million or 10% in adjusted EBITDA. The improvement was driven primarily by 5% increase gathering volumes and increased gas processing business at our Ohio Valley Midstream complex in West Virginia, where we actually saw inlet gas processing volumes increased by 27% and NGL production was up 34% (00:08:40) over the first quarter of 2017. This was driven by both new drilling and new contracts being won by our team in Pittsburgh. While managing these volume increases, the team worked hard to keep cost flat on a year-over-year basis and actually reduced operating expenses from the fourth quarter 2017 to the first quarter of 2018. Results for the current year also benefited from an $11 million increase in proportional EBITDA of joint ventures, and this was led by the Bradford County JVs that we increased our ownership in during the first quarter of last year. We're seeing a significant ramp up in requests for system expansions as the Atlantic Sunrise and other key takeaway infrastructure serving in the Northeast begin to take shape. We expect significant growth in volumes and EBITDA from the segment by the fourth quarter of 2018. So, we really are seeing a lot of activity going on. Our teams are staying very busy responding to requests from producers for expansions on our systems right now. And now looking at DCF, distributable cash flow continued to increase by 5% versus the first quarter of 2017, allowing us to meet our guidance and distribution increase of 5% to 7% annually while maintaining a strong coverage ratio. Our coverage again this quarter was 1.33 at the partnership level, and of course, on an economic basis then is much higher at the WMB level. Now looking – turning to slide 3. We recapped some of our recent achievements here as we continue to build long-term predictable growth in the business. And as I've said earlier, we'll discuss our projects in greater detail at our May 17 Analyst Day event, but already this year, we've managed to set new delivery records on our Transco system. We also have started construction on the Gulf Connector, 475 million a day Gulf Coast LNG delivery expansion, so that's an expansion that goes from Louisiana into the – some of the large Texas LNG facilities, namely Freeport and Corpus Christi. And we placed Phase 2 of the Garden State Transco expansion into service and placed additional gathering expansions into service in both our Susquehanna Supply Hub and our Wamsutter Gathering System in Wyoming. Finally, just last month, we established new volume records on our Susquehanna Supply Hub. This was driven by the expansion projects that we placed into service in that area and Northeast volumes continue to increase as planned. West volumes increased in 9 of the 10 franchises, as we continue to see growth in many of the areas of that segment. We also filed our FERC application for a fully-contracted Southeastern Trail expansion project that'll serve growing demand in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern markets. And again, another one of these projects which were unique on our system that is demand-driven projects and the contracting for that is being driven by markets, not by producer push. On the 1.7 Bcf a day Atlantic Sunrise project, 90% of the pipe stringing and welding for the pipeline construction portion of the project has now been completed. Hydrostatic testing has commenced on certain segments of the greenfield pipeline and we have begun making a very large number of tie-ins along the line. Despite an extremely wet and extended winter, we continue to target mid-2018 for placing the project into service, and I will tell you that is thanks to some very dedicated and hardworking employees and some terrific planning by our team. So, really have been very difficult conditions up there, but the team has continued to overcome that and is making great progress on putting that project in service. All of the items I've highlighted here reinforce our confidence that we'll see good operational performance and increasing growth in the second half of this year, which sets us up for an even stronger 2019. Now moving on to slide 4, as I mentioned at the beginning of the call, I look forward to visiting with many of you at our Analyst Day event on May 17 in New York. We will certainly highlight our natural gas strategy and how our leading positions uniquely enable us to connect low cost supplies to the robust demand for natural gas that we are now beginning to realize on our systems. We will also look at our extensive list of attractive projects spanning our operating areas that are currently in execution or under development and these give us great transparency towards predictable growth over the – not just in the short term, but very much in the long term. So, we're really excited to see the way our pipeline for growth is continuing to fill in and we'll highlight that. We'll also address the recent FERC action on regulated pipelines held by MLPs, and finally many elements are coming together which provide great transparency to our 2019 growth, and we look forward to highlighting the key drivers of the significant ramp up that is now before us. So, again, I'm very pleased with the operational performance and project execution of our teams and the year-over-year growth in our continuing business segments reflects the very solid quarter of results that Williams and Williams Partners delivered. So, operator, let's take the first question, please.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our first question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Morning, Jeremy.
Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Appreciate that you might want to wait for the Analyst Day on this, but I just wanted to touch base on the FERC and see if there's anything additional that you could share with regards the recent decision, and if collapsing the structure could mitigate some of the impact there, and if so, would you be able to quantify that in any sense?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I would just say Jeremy, just like we've said previously, we're very confident in our ability to manage that through various structures. And so, we don't expect any impact to our guidance. So, really nothing new on that to offer you other than we are very confident in the various structures that we have available to us to manage that.
Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got you. Thanks for that. And I think you touched on a bit on in your comments, but the West stepped down 4Q 2017 into 1Q 2018. I was wondering if you might be able to decompose a bit more as far as some of the drivers there. Appreciate there was the rate case with Northwest Pipe, but anything else you can kind of share there?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: (00:16:13).
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah, I would say that probably the biggest impact in the West was that Northwest Pipeline rate case, where we had a settlement with our customers and that did take the revenue down. So, I'd say that's probably our biggest impact in the West there. And on gathering volumes, keep in mind although sequentially we were down, we were very strong in Q1 2017 to Q1 2018. And I would just say on that we had very strong performance in Q4, primarily in the Haynesville, and naturally that's a tough comparison coming off the fourth quarter compared to the first quarter when we had such strong results at the end of last year. And just in some of our gathering area, surprisingly we didn't have any weather impacts in Wyoming in our traditional cold weather areas, but we did have some Eagle Ford and Haynesville winter impacts in Q1 that hurt our volumes a little bit, but it really wasn't too bad this winter.
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: And Jeremy, one other thing I'd add to that point too in the West, we talked on our last – this is John Chandler, we talked on our last earnings call about the new revenue recognition standards, and in the West particularly that's where we've had a number of previously settled MVCs and other things where we received prepayments. And under the new revenue recognition standards, we're extending the amortization that over a longer period of time. So, there was just a pure book step down. It wasn't really a cash step down between the fourth quarter and the first quarter, probably to the tune of $20 million to $30 million between those period. So, there was a big step down related to non-cash revenue recognition items.
Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. That's really helpful. Thanks. And then, just one last one if I could, in the Northeast, could you provide a bit more color, I guess, as far as where you see gathering volumes shaping up over the balance of the year? Any more color that you can share there as far as producer activity behind your systems?
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. This is Michael Dunn. I'll tell you in a couple of our areas would start in Ohio Valley Area, the Ohio River area. We're seeing a lot of growth there on the West side of the system bringing in volumes from Southwestern, EQT, and likely Chevron this year. A lot of activity in regard to our processing facilities there, Fort Beeler, we're at capacity on that, that's between 550 million and 600 million of processing capabilities there and Fort Beeler's full. And we're expanding Oak Grove. If you recall Oak Grove has one Train there. And right now, we're putting Train 2 in, that will go in service next year, and likely Train 3 following shortly after that. So, we're seeing a lot of activity on that side of the system. Shifting more to the Northeast Pennsylvania area, we will be seeing a lot more activity coming from the Susquehanna Supply Hub as well with Cabot ramping up to fill their volumes on Atlantic Sunrise. Some of that volume will be a shift from where they're delivering gas today on other interstate pipelines, but they'll also be bringing on incremental production there. They had no net Marcellus wells come online in Q1. But right now, they're anticipating 20 net Marcellus wells in Q2 and about 60 in the second half of 2018. And all of that volume comes on our Northeast Gathering system. So, that definitely will be ramping up to fill Atlantic Sunrise. And they've stated publicly that they intend to fill that volume nearly from day one as soon as we're able to bring the project online.
Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: That's great. Good to see a continued growth in the Marcellus even despite what we hear around the Permian, so that's encouraging. Thank you for that color.
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Sure.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Christine Cho with Barclays.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So, I wanted to start on the FERC actions that took place. Hypothetically, in the event you guys do a transaction, where there's a step up in basis in the assets. Would that eliminate or materially reduce your accumulated deferred income tax balance for your pipes? Just trying to get a sense of the impact transaction like that would have on your rate base calculation for your FERC assets.
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. No, we don't think it would eliminate that now.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay.
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Now just to be clear though at the same time, if you think about kind of the two steps to our accumulated deferred income tax, there's of course the regulatory liability (00:20:53) the year-end relative to going from 35% to 21%. That would still be subject to possibly providing great relief back to the shippers, but that was part of our guidance when we talked last quarter that we believe we could still file for a rate increase even with that in mind on Transco. As it relates to the March 15 filing, we'll still be a corporate tax payer and we believe that that the deferred tax liability will still be out there and still be payable by the company. So, we don't feel like that has any rate implications. And at the same time, I don't believe we will be eliminated either.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: What do you expect – well, if you, I guess, keep it in the – keep the pipeline in the MLP, what do you think – and you have to take it from a 21% to 0%, are you going to have to book more into the regulatory liability?
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I think that would be the outcome if that were the – if at the end of the day it was – it were in the MLP, you'd have an additional regulatory liability, yes.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay.
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: And I would also say though that's subject to the notice of inquiry. It's not completely clear yet how the FERC intends to handle that. So, various regulated entities are responding to that NOI. So, I think it's still subject to that.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay.
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: But to the extent that the FERC follows kind of the same approach that is there on the 35% to 21% move, then yeah, you could expect that to happen.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then earlier this year, it was out that Caiman was marketing their interest in Blue Racer. And you guys seem to indicate that buying out their stake wasn't of interest, but getting control was maybe to gain some operational synergies. How do you think about this now that Dominion is out there potentially selling their ownership and that one party could collectively buy both their stakes, which I think out up to over 70%?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Well, Christine, we don't get into the details of that, but we do have rights related to that type of transaction, particularly as it relates to the Caiman interest. And so, we're not to consider – nothing has really changed in that regard just because of our rights indicates the sale or transfer of interest there.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, lastly, can you give us some more color on the denial for the water permit for the Northeast Supply Enhancement Project? What the next steps are and what that does to the potential in-service date?
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Christine, I can do that. This is Michael Dunn. During the past year, we have been working very closely with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation to satisfy the conditions necessary for issuance of that Water Quality Certification. They did inform us prior to the denial that they needed additional time to complete their review. There is a statutory period, and you probably recall this one-year period that if they don't act, there could be a waiver be deemed to occur. And so, in order for them to allow more time for their review, they did deny that permit, but we certainly have every right and every intention to re-file that permit, and the whole support of our customer National Grid. Now, assuming we still get the Water Quality Certification and all data permits and FERC approvals in the same timeframe, it really wouldn't have any impact on the schedule. We do intend to re-file that in the next several weeks, and assuming that New York continues its review, which we think that it will, we will be able to continue on with the project schedule. It's a critical project for New York City National Grid, certainly needs it in order to continue converting the fuel oil that's burned there into natural gas units. And right now, our project would displace about 3 million gallons of heating oil every year and that would reduce CO2 emissions by up to 2.4 million tons per year. So, we certainly think it's a much needed project and National Grid certainly needs it to continue their conversion activities there in the Northeast.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you for the color.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Good morning. So, it looks like there was some solid growth on the volume front for the Northeast equity investments, but the proportional EBITDA lagged a bit. So, any color on the primary drivers there, whether it was maybe Blue Racer or Utica East or just what caused that variance of it?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Most of the volume growth there was on the Bradford JV, but you are right, the Cardinal and UEO interest, they were declined on the rich gas, the Utica volumes there. And so, that had impact on that joint venture. So, primarily it was Bradford increases, offset by some Utica Rich decline.
Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. So, just the lower-margin dry gas there so a bit of a makeshift?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: That's exactly right.
Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: All right. Okay. And I just wanted to follow up on Jeremy's question on the West.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: No. But just to be clear there – Colton, sorry – just to be clear that we did see EBITDA increases on Bradford, but – so that – we had lower rates there, but you're right that Utica Rich we have higher margin on and that is where we saw a lower EBITDA.
Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Appreciate that. And then, to follow-up on Jeremy's question on the West, if you could just give a little bit more detail there. I mean, I think you mentioned the weather impacts in the Eagle Ford, Haynesville, anyway to quantify that? I mean, it sounds like it was fairly marginal or have you also seen any sort of shift in activity, maybe from producers actually transitioning rigs away from the Haynesville to liquids-rich basins, whether that be Niobrara or your Powder River assets? So, any comments there would be helpful.
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I'd say the winter impacts there were very minimal. I just mentioned them because it's unusual to have those winter impacts in those areas for us. And I would just say the Haynesville ramp up was a very significant last year for us, if you recall us talking about that last quarter. And the rig activity there is still there. I think just we talked about other wells that they brought online just this week in the Haynesville, which is pretty significant lateral length there, so we would expect pretty significant production on an initial production rate from that well. So, we're still seeing activity there and we expect them to have significant activity in the Eagle Ford as they talked about on their call yesterday as well. But there's also a lot of activity occurring in the Powder River Basin with a lot of producers up there seeing some interest in that area and we're fairly well-positioned with our partnership there with Crestwood to take advantage of that as those opportunities arise.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah, I would just add to that in Eagle Ford, we also had an outage or planned turnaround at our Dilly (28:17) gas treating facility, sour gas treating facility there. And I think that was about a week of outage there. So, that was – that is an unusual event. It was planned, but it didn't impact the quarter. And I think on the Haynesville, as we've mentioned earlier, any time you have these big new wells coming on like we saw a lot of in 2017, you've got a big decline to work off in the near term. So, the fresher the production, the more immediate decline. There is adequate activity out there and we are seeing that pick back up here as we get through the winter. So, you always have kind of a little bit of a lull during the winter. And so, at the end of the fourth quarter, of course the first part of the first quarter and so, we'll see some of that pick back up. But we are definitely seeing more rigs move over to the oil and rich gas areas right now. No doubt about that.
Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Got it. I guess just a last one. So, you hinted at some updates to the CapEx budget at the Analyst Day. So, I understand if you'd prefer to hold out most of the details. But just any indications as to whether those are primarily adjustments to the scope of existing projects or whether we should expect to see some additions to the backlog?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. It is a lot of new projects I would tell you. And it's kind of just a lot of it's more of the same, if you will, in terms of incremental demand for services in the Northeast and some new opportunities along the Transco system that are driving that.
Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. Just coming back to the FERC items. I know you're going to touch this on the Analyst Day, but I think on your last earnings call, you said you wouldn't see downside into the rate case from going to a 21% rate on the income tax allowance. So, if you keep Transco in the MLP and you go to a zero tax allowance, do you have a refreshed view on the potential for whether that would be a reduced tariff or what kind of impact that would be using a zero tax allowance?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I would just say we have plenty of structures to use and we don't intend to contemplate that path. So, there's plenty of other structures that we would employ, and so I do not expect us to follow rate case without the tax allowance in it.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. That makes sense. And so then, if we do, and I'm sorry for the hypothetical, but if we do stipulate that one of the ways to do that is to roll up WPZ into WMB. I guess, have you previewed what that might look like with the rating agencies? Have they given you any sense of what you would need to be at from a leverage perspective to be investment grade at a consolidated entity?
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Not really on that front, but I would tell you this, I've had an opportunity to talk to rating agency, obviously having been new here at Williams – this is John Chandler again. Having been new here at Williams and now eight months in, I've had an opportunity to talk to the rating agencies just to kind of reaffirm my view of what is BBB, Baa2 and I think it's consistent with what I felt it is, somewhere inside 4.75 times and ultimately down to 4.5 times. So, I think as a long-term view on a consolidated basis, we desire to be BBB flat, Baa2. But it's certainly clear in my mind today too that we may not be totally at that level, but we're certainly investment grade on a consolidated basis. We're certainly at Baa3, BBB flat with a lot of capacity there.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And John, just to be clear, those numbers you're quoting, you tended to I think lift the numbers versus the reported EBITDA by about a quarter of a turn. Is that fair?
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: That's right and those are – the numbers I'm referring to are rating agency adjusted.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Perfect. Yeah. Understood. And then, last one from me just on Atlantic Sunrise, great to see the progress there. Sort of what's left – what are the key items left, milestones that you need to hit to hit that sort of mid-2018 in-service date that you've discussed?
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Right now, as Alan said, we had a tough winter up there. Anybody that's residing in the Northeast knows how tough it was, and a lot of snow and rain on the right of way, but the contractors have done a great job progressing through the winter. And as Alan indicated, we're looking at a mid-2018 in-service. Compressor stations are coming along and looking very good from a schedule standpoint as well as the pipeline right of way. We've got four of the six horizontal directional drills completed. The other two, we should have pull-back here in the next two weeks on those and we are starting hydro tests. So, it's really weather-dependent now. We're targeting an in-service date, and we're plus or minus weeks on either side of that date right now and it's really all driven by getting some good weather in the Northeast, and we'll make some really good progress as soon as the weather breaks up there for us.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's perfect. That's it for me. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Darren Horowitz with Raymond James.
Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey guys. Good morning. Just a couple quick housekeeping questions for me. The first, looking at the sequential change in O&M, it was down nominally and you guys mentioned the asset sales, but it looked like it decreased about 100 basis points, so thinking about it on a percent of total segment revenues, it was around 16%. Is that the right way to think about things as we progress through this year?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Sorry, Darren. Could you repeat that? We didn't catch the first part of that question, sorry about that.
Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: No problem. Yeah. I was just referencing Alan that that O&M obviously is down nominally sequentially, but as a percent of total segment revenues, it looked like it dropped about 100 basis points from 17% in the fourth quarter to 16% now. And I'm just wondering from an O&M perspective if that's the right platform when we think about margin for the duration of this year?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I think we're making a really good progress as we gain scale on these projects. We're making good – we track what we call an O&M margin ratio, which is a similar measure to what you're talking about and we're tracking very closely and actually drive performance around that for the teams, and we do expect to continue to improve that from where we are today. I think if you look at it on a quarter-to-quarter basis, sometimes it can move around on you, but on an annual average basis, we are continuing to drive that ratio better and we would expect as our scale gets larger, a lot of our costs obviously in these operating areas like the Northeast are somewhat fixed, and so as we drive volume and revenues against that we are able to increase that, and similarly, in the West as well we have that issue. I would say the West is very mature in terms of its ability to drive costs down and that team even without the benefit of big volume increases, that team has been continuing to drive our unit cost down in that area. So, I would expect us to continue to improve on that number, but you may not see it from quarter-to-quarter as much you will see it on an annual average basis.
Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then my follow-up, just thinking about the Northeast G&P EBITDA ramp for the back half of this year, you know recognizing the contribution of what Susquehanna and Bradford can lead to that. How do you think about kind of the cadence sort of the rate of change with regard to gathered volumes in plant – in light gas volumes versus just how much incremental contribution from EBITDA there is going to be for Bradford and Susquehanna as they build?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I think Susquehanna is going to be somewhat stair stepped and be a little more driven. There is quite a bit of capability to boost volumes out there as we saw this winter when we saw some good pricing hit locally in those demand areas. We saw some volumes pick up pretty rapidly. Part of that was because we had expanded the system on what we called our Genesis expansion out there. But I think the thing that was impressive from my vantage point was the ability for the producer to respond when the pricing was there. So, we're going to see that occur as Atlantic Sunrise comes on. And we're certainly seeing all the activity in place today to keep up with that. Cabot has done a great job of managing the business and as well managing their markets. They've got a couple of big gas-fired power projects that are coming on that they've contracted to serve as well. So – and those projects are doing very well. So, I think in the Northeast, we're going to see response to both Atlantic Sunrise and those gas-fired power generation facilities coming online. And down in the OVM (00:38:04) area, we are just really impressed with the degree of activity going on, on the rich gas there and the team has done a really nice job of winning new business there from some – from business that were elsewhere. And so the team has really done a great job of continuing to grow volumes on that. As Michael mentioned, we're going to be up against our capacity limits there pretty quickly, but we've got about another 150 million a day to fill up and then we'll have TXP-2 that were in the process of constructing right now coming online and then TXP-3, which is another 200 million a day would follow behind that. So, don't really see much slowing down the ORM – or sorry the Ohio Valley Midstream area, but that's going to be a little smoother, if you will, just because we're seeing adequate gas takeaway capacity out of the area right now. And now it's just a matter of the drilling continue to fill up our processing, but in the Northeast, I think we see a little more stepwise function that'll be late in the 2018 period for seeing those volumes come though.
Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Alan. I appreciate it.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Eric Genco with Citi.
Eric C. Genco - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Just wondering, can you remind me real quick what is the test period again on the Transco rate case? When did that go through?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Right now we plan to file our rate case at the end of August and that test period goes through March 1st, assuming that we file there.
Eric C. Genco - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And I wanted to ask – again... (00:39:52)
Eric C. Genco - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: March 1, 2019. Okay. And I realize this is kind of again hypothetical, but in thinking through sort of rating agencies and how some of the stuff goes, if you were to look through and you were to choose sort of a roll-up option hypothetically, there's still a process from when that gets announced to when that closes and it feels like Atlantic Sunrise is kind of around the corner at this point in terms of being online. So, we heard at one point that the rating agencies were kind of eyeing Atlantic Sunrise and thinking about that in terms of sort of where you fall in the investment grade spectrum. Is that something where if you announce something and then eventually it closes, but Atlantic Sunrise kind of comes on in between, is that something you think you could get credit for? What's the process for something like that like? I apologize for being theoretical.
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: I think given the fact – this is John Chandler again. I think given the fact that the revenue stream is highly predictable, because it's firm capacity, when that project is in service, I do believe we'll be given credit, at least somewhat of a pro forma full credit for Atlantic Sunrise.
Eric C. Genco - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then maybe I'll just ask one sort of kind of philosophical question and then a lot has been made about sort of the Northeast Gas and associated gas in the Permian and sort of how that goes, but I wanted to sort of ask philosophically, if you were to think through a scenario where you get through the next couple of years where LNG is kind of coming on and then there's a bit of a wall in sort of demand growth. How do you see the tradeoffs between sort of a lower for longer price situation, which could obviously affect some of your customers. But being that you're levered to demand, low prices tend to spur demand. So, I'm just trying to think about how you think about looking beyond the next decade and what that holds for Williams philosophically?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Great question. I would just tell you something we give a lot of thought to and study quite a bit. And I actually think that the Permian supply is actually helping us in that there is much more confidence in low prices for the longer, which is spurring big capital investment – continue big investment in capital. And so, I think we're going to continue to see LNG expansion on the backs of that, where in before I think people, there was some doubt about it. I don't think there is any doubt about the U.S.'s ability to produce a low-cost gas supplies for a very long period of time. And so we are seeing tremendous amount of activity and we've got two methanol plants in Louisiana, big methanol plants that we're serving that are great – that we're building – have contracted now to serve I should say. So, we're seeing big capital go in trying to take advantage of low-cost gas. And I just think the Permian is just additive to that story frankly. In terms of the Marcellus versus the Permian, even in the Bernstein report, which is probably the most negative towards the Marcellus has impacted by the Permian, even there you have a very large, like a 50% increase in volumes, and so I would say if that's the downside case for the Marcellus, that's pretty rosy from my perspective to get that kind of increase coming out of the Marcellus, and we certainly are starting to see signs of that. But bottom line is I think the Permian is really helping in terms of the big capital dollars that have to go into sustained demand and we're certainly seeing signs of that.
Eric C. Genco - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much. I appreciate your time.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good morning.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Good morning, Craig.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: The New York Northeast Supply Enhancement regulatory playbook sounds a little familiar when it comes to what you've been through with Constitution. Can you opine on from a broader industry perspective, whether the promise of an improving regulatory environment for citing new projects is actually coming through or we're not really seeing any traction on the ground there?
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Craig, this is Michael Dunn. I would say there are challenging locations for us to permit projects, but it still doesn't negate the need for this project specifically. This is a very important project for New York and the Northeast. And I will just tell you from what we saw over the winter and all of the Northeast that two week cold spell that was in New England between just after Christmas through the New Year, they burned more fuel oil in those two weeks than they did in all of 2016 and had to import Russian LNG into Boston. And I will tell you that somewhat ridiculous whenever you have the cheapest gas in the world, just a few hundred miles away, they can get to those markets. And so, we think there is really a need up there. The New York City Housing Authority this winter had some really difficult times, keeping their buildings heated and with hot water serviced just because of the failing equipment there on the boilers and the fuel oil systems. And they really need to be upgraded and they need to be upgraded with natural gas to reduce emissions and reduce costs for the citizens in those areas. So, it is a challenge to permit projects. There's no doubt about that, but we're going to be out there and with our customers, challenging those opportunities and making sure that we get a real definitive purpose and need out there into the public hands and get our projects permitted.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah, I would just add to that Craig. It certainly is the same certificate – the 401 certificate, the same one that got denied in the case of Constitution. It also got denied on Earth Day. And so, that has a lot of similar ring to it. As Michael points out, this one really is important for New York City, and we really are starting to get some strong political support from folks that are actually locally affected by not having access to natural gas. And we certainly think that that's going to be paid attention to. I'd probably no need to remind a lot of folks on this call, but Governor Cuomo is certainly trying to stay far to the left right now, and we get that politically, and we think the timing is an important factor here in terms of the approval and the State's actions on this project. So, I think there's a lot of very strong positives for New York City in terms of dramatic reductions in their emissions by getting off of fuel oil. Almost all of this gas is going to take out fuel oil. And so, there's actually a very large emissions benefit from this project and it's getting lower cost fuels in to folks. So, we think ultimately, the politics will turn to our favor on this and we've been working closely with the State and again feel like there's very much an issue of timing regarding the denial on this that's more related to the governor's election and particularly in the primary. So, the feeling does go very familiar on one hand. On the other hand, we think we have some really strong politics that'll work for us eventually on this project.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Sounds good. Obviously logic doesn't work in some political situations, but they hopefully will listen to constituents.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: One other quick question. We've talked a lot about Transco and the March FERC order and tariff implications. Is the Northwest Pipeline rate settlement because of the settlement immune to that order or can it be dragged in, in the next year or two?
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Well, I think the FERC NOPR suggested that companies will be required to come in and explain how they're going to address the NOPR of course. We would address it that it was addressed specifically in our tariff and it does provide for the 35% to 21% tax rate reduction. And by the time we get to that point of actually doing that, we expect also be able to say that Northwest Pipe is part of a corporate tax paying entity depending on whatever structure we put in place to make that happen. So, we do believe potentially that there would be some communication with the FERC, but we don't think we have to follow the traditional process that others are going through since we have a settled rate case that specifically addressed this.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: And Craig, our current rate that we're charging as reflected this quarter already has that 35% to 21% step down. Even though we're actually receiving a higher cash rate, we're only recognizing the rate that would be appropriate to the 21%.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Great. I appreciate that clarification.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Shneur Gershuni with UBS.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple of quick questions. First on the future of operations in the Northeast type of question. About four or five years ago when NGL evacuation was an issue in the Northeast, producers tended to move rigs over to the bigger dry gas wells. This year, at some point, Mariner East 2 is expected to come into service. Are you hearing at all from any of your producer customers about an interest in shifting the rigs back to the more liquid-rich wells, which would also have lower gas output? Just kind of curious what you're hearing from producers.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: I would say there is a move that goes back and forth that's depending on a lot of things, and certainly right now, there is a lot of focus on the rich gas right now, because propane prices have been high. Obviously, the spread between oil and gas is continuing to drive rigs towards the richer gas right now. And so, I think we're seeing – that's interesting you know as well and is somewhat coincidental, but the southwest part of the play, so West Virginia and Southwest Pennsylvania and Ohio has the benefits of increased takeaway projects that have come online. So they also – you're starting to see a pretty big spread between TETCO M-2 and Dominion South, which serves that area versus the Tennessee pricing and the Transco-Leidy pricing, which serves the Northeast part of the play. And so, not only do you have right now better gas pricing in the southwest part of the play, you obviously have the benefit of strong rich gas. So, I would say there has been a leaning towards rigs being deployed in the southwest part of the play right now for those two reasons. I would say as Atlantic Sunrise opens up and really starts to provide great access to real markets, not just sending gas into a cul-de-sac, but real new markets, we're going to see some increased activity in the northeast part of the play as well.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And two follow-ups, just some of the answers you gave to previous questions. First, with Christine's questioning about the FERC, would you be able to confirm if your (00:52:17) would be wiped out if you did a roll up of WMB to WPZ as we've seen with some of the other ones that have happened?
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: I mean, we're continuing to look at that. I think the one thing that still leaves a little bit of a question mark in our mind is the fact that today obviously WPZ has owned 74% by corporate tax payer. And so, I think in those other transactions – I mean we are looking specifically at that to see what happens in that scenario. And we're not clear at this point whether or not the material ownership by Williams of WPZ impacts that calculation at all. So, there's other scenarios that I think Christine was talking about. I'm not sure what the level of ownership was by a corporate paying parent versus the public, and so, I think the notion is that to buy-in or roll-up, there is a payment of all taxes due by the unitholders, and I think we're just processing through what that means relative to our specific scenario where 74% of the partnerships owned by a corporation.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And one follow-up and I think you used the word corporate tax paying entity in your response to Craig's question, and in some of the other responses, you have mentioned the word structures, which is plural, I mean the obvious one to us is rolling up WPZ, are there any other structures that you're looking at that you can share with us, and will you pick the direction that you're going to take by the Analyst Day or will that really come before you file the rate case?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: I'll take that. There certainly are many other structures to look at, and you've heard the Street talk about those. I don't think we're going to get into a long description of all those various structures, but there is multiple structures that are available in that regard. And primarily the difference and why they are so many available to us is what John pointed out, which is that at the Williams' level, we are already a tax payer at the Williams' level and therefore there's a lot of structures available in that regard. So, that's first part of the question. The second part of the question is, I'm not going to answer. So, we're not going to pin ourselves down as to when exactly we're going to answer this question at this point.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: No. Fair enough. I figured I had to try. Just one last follow-up. The argument about WMB owning 74% of WPZ's units and WMB being a corporate tax payer, I mean, how does that argument differ from the fact that they're no longer allowing the ITA when it was originally constructed as the unitholders are ultimately tax payers? I mean, the common man or person out there does pay taxes. How does – what's the distinction in the argument that WMB is a corporate tax payer versus an individual being paying personal income taxes as well also?
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: I think the distinction – I mean specifically to the aided and maybe we're twisting it a bit, but I think the distinction here is if there were a roll-up transaction, there would not be a taxable event as it relates to WMB's ownership of WPZ. And so, the notion that all taxes have been paid including deferred taxes. I think it's one that you'd have to analyze and as it relates to the 74% ownership we have in WPZ. Does that make sense?
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah. That makes perfect sense. All right. Thank you very much, guys. I appreciate the color.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.
Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC: Good morning, guys. Just back to that same issue. There's been a lot of comments filed on the NOPR and a lot of them asked for the FERC to take into consideration before they made that final order, the comments on deferred income taxes and the NOI. Do you feel like you need to have a final order out of the FERC before you can elect a structure or decide what you're going to do in terms of a simplification?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: No. I don't think we would want to wait around for that final order. So again not saying exactly what the timing is, but I don't want to sit around and wait for that. I think the ability to completely turn that over is not real high. So...
Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC: Super. That's all I had. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Armstrong, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Okay. Great. Well, thank you all. I would just say a great quarter for us, just continuing to be very predictable I would suggest and execution IR teams is tremendous in phase of some pretty tough environment, the team's continue to execute very well. So really excited the way things are going on that front and really excited about our Analyst Day and rolling out a lot of exciting projects that are going to drive us into the long term as well. So, thanks for your questions today and look forward to seeing you at Analyst Day.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams and Williams Partners Fourth Quarter 2017 Year-End Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John D. Porter - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include press releases and related investor materials, including a slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to you momentarily. Joining us today is our Chief Operating Officer, Michael Dunn; and our CFO, John Chandler. In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks, and you should review it. Also, included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. And these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials. And so, with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Great. Good morning, everyone, and thank you, John. First of all, I'll just say these are going to be a little longer comments than usual, just because there are a lot of issues that we want to discuss this morning, so I'm going to jump right in. I'm going to begin by saying how pleased I am with the organization's strong execution in 2017. A lot of notable achievements. We safely, and in timely manner, delivered on Transco's Big 5 projects, which was Gulf Trace, Hillabee Phase 1, Dalton, New York Bay, and the Virginia Southside II. And we exceed the midpoint of our guidance range for adjusted EBITDA, and actually exceeded the top end of the range for distributable cash flow and cash coverage ratios. And finally, we were able to bring CapEx spending in slightly below the midpoint of the range. Our teams achieved these impressive results, which include improvement in year-over-year adjusted EBITDA for both the fourth quarter and the full-year 2017 despite the impact of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Nate, and while executing crisply on $2.3 billion in asset sales. And if you go back to September 2016, it's actually $3.3 billion in asset sales. As you'll recall, a strong foundation was laid with the financial repositioning we executed in January of 2017, which positioned the company to fund our attractive slate of fully contracted, large-scale expansion projects without the need to access public equity markets for projects included in our current forecast. And now, we're providing further insight into 2018 where we look forward to a full-year revenue contribution from our Big 5, as well as contributions from our Atlantic Sunrise project, when it is placed online later this year, along with the associated growth in the Northeast gathering volumes upstream of that. We are as excited as ever about our opportunities across the asset base, which we see driving continued growth for 2019 and beyond. And so, for today's relatively long call, we're going to hit a recap of our performance for fourth quarter and full-year 2017; we're going to hit the 2018 financial guidance; and we're going to take a brief look at the types of opportunities we see driving our growth into 2019 and beyond. And just to remind you, we are planning an Analyst Day event in May, where we'll dive deeper into our growth drivers for the future. But, for now, let's move on to slide 2 and review the fourth quarter. So, according to our GAAP results, which included some large onetime events related to the recent federal income tax reform, Williams' C-Corp level reported fourth quarter net income of more than $1.6 billion, a $1.7 billion improvement from fourth quarter 2016. This large improvement was driven primarily by the re-measurement of Williams' deferred tax liabilities to reflect anticipated lower future tax payments. And this resulted in a $1.9 billion gain at the GAAP level. But it's not quite that simple when it comes to the impact of Tax Reform, as we also had to take a $713 million non-cash charge at WPZ related to Tax Reform for Transco and Northwest Pipeline. I'll go further into the Tax Reform impact on the regulated pipelines a bit later. But for now, I'll just say that, generally speaking, we had to book an estimated regulatory liability of $713 million for possible future impacts on our cost-of-service rates, resulting from this Tax Reform bill. Even though this is a big number, it's likely to only affect our future actual cost-of-service rate case calculations by relatively small annual amounts, as it gets spread over a period that could be 20 years or more and is one of the many variables that impacts the ultimate rates that we charge for our max rate tariff service. To that point, given higher integrity expenses and maintenance capital expenses at Transco, we still expect to file a rate increase on our cost-of-service rates, even after taking into account the effect of this change in the tax liability. So let's move to the performance of the business in the fourth quarter, where WPZ's adjusted EBITDA was up $84 million, or 8% when you exclude the NGL/Petchem businesses that we've sold. This increase was driven mostly by our more than $100 million increase in fee-based revenues. These came primarily in the Atlantic-Gulf and our West segments. And with that, let's move on to slide 3 to look at the full year of 2017. So even for the full year, those large fourth quarter Tax Reform related items played a key role for the GAAP results. But there were a few other drivers, including about $1.3 billion in gains we had on the Geismar and Permian JV sales. And then looking at adjusted EBITDA, WPZ was up over $200 million or about 5% versus 2016 when you exclude the former NGL/Petchem businesses that we sold. You can see in the graph where all three of the segments show improvement for the full year. Atlantic-Gulf saw increased adjusted EBITDA driven by the Transco expansion projects and increased volumes in the Eastern Gulf, partially offset by higher O&M expenses, as we continue to do quite a bit of asset integrity work and hydro testing on the main lines along the Transco system. For the full year of 2017, results for the West benefited from lower cost. Growth in basins like the Haynesville and higher commodity margins, that were partially offset by the loss of results from the sell and trade of our DBJV trade with Western Gas and Anadarko. And the Northeast realized added benefits from the growth in the Bradford area with increased ownership from the various Bradford County systems that came with that trade I just mentioned. Positive results on our Susquehanna and Ohio River systems were offset by lower volumes in the rich Utica and our non-operated interest in the UEOM joint venture. So up there in the rich Utica area, we continue to see declines in that area. And as you'll recall, we own both a rich gas gathering system and then we own a 62% interest in a non-operated interest in UEOM up there. In the Northeast, we've consistently spoken of 2017 and 2018 as transitional years for Northeast volumes. During 2017, we started to see step changes in takeaway capacity in the Southwest part of the play that are beginning to unlock the growth potential of these unmatched natural gas reserves. And of course, we've also seen a lift in NGL prices in that area that's really spurred a lot of drilling in the Southwestern part, in the rich part of the Marcellus play. Moving on here to slide 4. Here, we've recapped some of our recent achievements as we continue to build long-term sustainable growth in the business. It certainly was an impressive quarter and full year for the Transco team. The Big 5 projects that we've referenced many times added approximately 25% pipeline capacity to Transco, which is saying something given the size of Transco to start with. The final two of the Big 5 projects, New York Bay and Virginia Southside, were placed into service as planned in the fourth quarter. Also in the fourth quarter, our West team saw higher volumes in 8 of the 10 gathering franchises, led by continued growth in the Haynesville. In the Northeast, our exit rate gathering volumes were up 600 million a day or 9% over 2016, as the debottlenecking of the Northeast is just getting started. And a portion of this volume growth is contributing to higher utilization of our Ohio Valley midstream processing capacity, where we now expect to expand that facility by an additional 400 million a day supported by strong customer volume commitments and driven by this continued rich Marcellus drilling activity. We've already seen the impact of the five major projects this year, which added over 2.8 Bcf a day of new capacity. And this was really on – these projects are demand-driven projects on Transco. And this new capacity enabled Transco to set one-day and three-day delivery records in January. All of this is before we realized the benefits of the most significant expansion in Transco's history, the Atlantic Sunrise project, which continues to make great progress. We have been dealt a challenging winter on the Atlantic Sunrise project. But a tremendous effort by our team managing the many contractors involved has kept this project on track, and importantly, in compliance with the many environmental regulations controls required up there. Certainly been no easy task for the team. But today, we are greater than 30% complete on the pipeline segment, and importantly, greater than 40% complete on the compressor station. So difficult winter conditions up there, but team's really been working it hard, and importantly, as I mentioned, really paying attention to the permitting requirements that are on us up there. We are targeting a July start-up for the mainline portion, with the greenfield compression likely taking a few months longer than that. Our LNG-related story continues as well, as the Gulf Connector has begun construction. And we're targeting the first quarter of 2019 for the in-service date for this 475 million a day addition to our Gulf Coast LNG delivery system. So we really have built out quite a delivery system along the Gulf Coast, being able to serve all the growing LNG. And Gulf Connector will be the second big addition to that. We also made the FERC certificate application on Gateway, a project that recently moved from the potential project list to full execution. And we continue to look at the potential to enhance Southeastern Trail. I'll remind everyone that we do have a binding shipper commitment that make a very attractive project for us on a standalone basis. But we are hoping to combine this with other customer needs to make another very significant large scale and strategic expansion on Transco that would be right on the heels of the Atlantic Sunrise expansion. Turning to the West. You may remember we spoke about the Chain Lake expansion in Wyoming during our third quarter call. Today, I'm pleased to update that we placed an additional Chain Lake expansion project into service in January, as we continue to add volumes on our Wamsutter system in Wyoming. So all in all, a great quarter with significant accomplishments across a variety of fronts. And with that let's move on to slide 5. I'm not going to spend too long on this slide, but it's an important and notable wrap-up reference regarding our 2017 performance versus guidance. All good news here with beats on all our key performance metrics and great progress on our leverage metrics as well. We continue to deliver not only on our operational metrics, but on our financial objectives as well. One thing I'd like to note here relative to debt, you can see our actual net debt to adjusted EBITDA came in well below the guidance. And on PZ, it came in about 3.5x, and on WMB at about 4.4x, which you can see is well below what we were targeting. You need to add about 0.3 or 0.4 to the actual number when estimating the rating agency calculation. And if you do that, this gets you up to about a 3.85 ratio on PZ and about a 4.75 at WMB on a consolidated basis. So just to be clear on that, we're excited about that, and certainly, we achieved better than we were hoping to for the year. But I would just remind you that we will see that creep up a bit here in 2018 as spending wraps up on Atlantic Sunrise, ahead of the full cash flow coming on. And then we expect that to come right back down as those cash flows come on. So overall, really great news on the credit metrics. And we'll continue to drive our strength in our balance sheet. Now, let's move on to slide 6 and take a look at our 2018 financial guidance. There will likely be some surprise at our adjusted EBITDA range, which has a midpoint of $4.55 billion, but as we'll see on the next slide, our year-to-year comparison on guidance has recently been hit by about $150 million of unusual noncash items that are driven by how regulatory accounting practices treat the new lower taxes and new GAAP revenue recognition standards that were applied to some amortized cash flows. Neither of these items impacts actual cash we will receive from customers in 2018. So, I want to stress that this really is driven by these accounting practices. Our base businesses look set to deliver guidance of about $4.7 billion prior to these items, which is a $300 million increase or about 7% on an apples-to-apples basis. So, what's this $150 million of noncash items about? Well, first of all, the new GAAP revenue recognition rules require us to spread out some of our deferred revenue for contracts that we've already received payment on over about 10 years longer than the old rules, and that dropped the 2018 adjusted EBITDA by about $120 million. And then, we also saw about $30 million in 2018 Tax Reform impact. Most of that comes on to Northwest Pipeline via regulatory accounting charges due to the Tax Reform, even though the revenues we receive from our customers won't change during this current rate cycle. Again, we'll look at the bridge on the next slide. Moving to DCF, we have a range of $2.9 million to $3.2 billion, and the midpoint of the range represents an 8% growth over 2017. Our dividend and distribution growth rates, related cash coverage, and leverage metrics are all consistent with the guidance we provided this time last year. And now, a year later out, we believe these growth rates will continue as we look out over the next two years. You will also note more specificity on the timing of growth through the year. At WPZ, we expect to increase distributions each quarter, so those will be quarterly raises. While at WMB, we expect to raise the dividend on just an annual basis. So, once each year. So, to be clear on that front, we'll be recommending a 13% dividend increase to be paid in March to the WMB board here in the near future with the same dividend level being recommended for June, September, and December, resulting in this 13% increase at WMB, which comes in slightly above the midpoint from our guided growth rate last year. We expect the WPZ raise to be right in the middle of the range of that 5% to 7% range that we talked about last year. We expect to maintain strong coverage at both WPZ and WMB, and the leverage metrics will remain at healthy levels, although we do expect the levels, as I've just mentioned, to rise a little bit as we spend on Atlantic Sunrise here in the near term. Coverage at WMB of approximately $100 million per quarter will be used to continue paying down the WMB revolver here in the first part of the year, and we continue to evaluate the best use of that excess cash flow at WMB post the revolver paydown, which will come in the second half of the year. So, let's take a closer look at that build-up for 2018 adjusted EBITDA now on slide 7. First of all, begin with the big pieces. By virtue of our sell of the Geismar olefins facility in July of 2017, you can see the $72 million step down there. That's just the EBITDA that was associated with that business. We expect a solid $300 million increase from our continuing businesses, with significant growth driven by Transco's expansion projects, partially offset by the loss of the Hadrian volumes on Discovery. We also expect strong growth in volumes and EBITDA out of our Northeast G&P business. Susquehanna Supply Hub is poised to make significant contributions as expansion work currently underway will wrap up in the first quarter. The end service of Atlantic Sunrise will lead to significant volume growth at both Susquehanna and Bradford County systems, but we are not counting on this until the later part of 2018. And recently, executed contracts combined with new business, we are currently finalizing will contribute to very strong Ohio River Supply Hub growth. The continued growth in our business and asset integrity work is leading to modestly higher operating expenses in 2018, as you can see. So, wrapping that up, $300 million of adjusted EBITDA, which is approximately a 7% growth rate year-over-year when comparing results from the continuing businesses leads us to about a $4.7 billion what would be EBITDA before the impacts of these non-cash new GAAP revenue recognition and Tax Reform impacts. As I discussed earlier, the key impact of the new accounting standard was to spread out the recognition of the prepayments we received in 2016 associated with Barnett and Mid-Con contract restructuring. If you recall, those were on gathering contracts that we had with Chesapeake that now primarily are Total contracts and reducing revenue recognized in 2018 and 2019, but increasing revenue recognized beyond 2019 versus what we expected on the old accounting standard. If you'll recall, it really was just driven by the fact that the period of the MVC was the period that we were amortizing that period over the new accounting standards require us to smooth that out over the entire life of the contract, not just the period that had the MVC impact. The impact on 2018 is about $120 million, less revenue being recognized under the current standard than we would have recognized operating under the old standard We want to get in the habit of providing multi-year guidance, however, we do expect an even stronger level of growth in 2019, particularly in Northeast G&P, and of course, on Transco. Given the timing around Atlantic Sunrise and the significance of that project as well as other projects we brought on in 2017 and 18, we thought it would be helpful to give you at least a glimpse here into what we expect coming off of Transco into 2019. So, let's move on to slide 8 and take a closer look at how Transco's adjusted EBITDA is growing over the next couple of years. So, here, as we dive deeper into what is going on with Transco, it's clear growth in Transco will be driven by negotiated rate expansion projects, and there is strong growth coming in the future. Let's begin with the impact of a full year of revenue from the 2017 Big 5 projects. Note that in 2017, we only had $140 million partial year impact of the Big 5 projects that were placed in service during the year. And in 2018, on top of that $140 million, we'll see an incremental $110 million. In 2017, we did have a significant step up in expenses, primarily due to necessary pipeline integrity and maintenance programs. We placed a high priority on safe operations and on proper maintenance and the cost of what you see coming through in our results in 2017. In 2018, you can see the full $250 million impact of the Big 5 when you add the $140 million partial year and $110 million – sorry, that was in 2019. And you also begin to see the impact of Atlantic Sunrise and Garden State here in 2018 with a partial-year contribution of $140 million after going into service in 2018. We also expect a big increase in Transco during 2019. So, as you can see here, these are some of the drivers. First of all, the effect of a full-year revenue from Atlantic Sunrise is captured here, as you see full-year impact of $425 million in EBITDA, resulting from a $285 million increase in 2019 on top of the $140 million contribution in 2018. And finally, as I mentioned earlier, Transco is also working on its next rate case. And I know there's a lot – high interest in this topic particularly with the recently enacted Tax Reform law. So, I wanted to talk you through what we think that process might look like as well. First, I want everyone to understand that the negotiated rate contracts Transco has are not subject to change with this rate case. Tax Reform will have no impact on these contracts. Those are firm fixed contracts and both parties agree on a fixed rate on front end for the term of those contracts. Most of our major expansions are covered by negotiated rate contracts. And in fact, by the time Atlantic Sunrise is in service, we expect Transco to be comprised of roughly 50% negotiated rates and 50% cost-of-service-based rates. It's the cost-of-service-based rates that are subject to changes with each of Transco's rate cases. Second, from a timing standpoint, we expect to make our initial rate filing in August, and we expect the revenue impact of new cost-of-service rates to be primarily a 2019 event. And then third, I want to discuss the factors that affect the actual value of a new cost-of-service rate. Certainly, operating expenses are intended to be recovered in the cost-of-service rates. So, for example, the increased expenses that we've been incurring on Transco from pipeline integrity and reliability improvements will be accounted for and recovered in our next round of cost-of-service rates. I would tell you that we've continued to have a lot of work to be done in this to keep the system safe. And so, you do see that cost continuing here for some time. Also, the maintenance capital spent on Transco goes directly into the rate base, and Transco will earn a return on that capital. So, these items would work to push our cost-of-service rates up from where they stand today. The Tax Reform Act has also generated lower corporate tax rates, which will also be a factor. There are two primary ways that the lower corporate tax rates will impact the pipeline's rates. First is simply the lower cost that lower tax rates represent the provision in our rates for current and future taxes will be lower and now that the corporate tax rates decreased, so that's kind of a forward-looking piece. The second impact is represented in the non-cash regulatory charge and related regulatory liability, which you saw when we discussed the fourth quarter results earlier in the call. This liability represents an estimate of the value that will be returned to shippers to account for the deferred portion of income tax provisions that we've collected in the past on Transco's rates. This liability will be amortized off of Transco's books and realized by cost-of-service shippers over an extended period of time, which could be as long as 20 years or even more. So, the rate making process on Transco for the cost-of-service contracts will likely be in negotiation that takes all of these factors into consideration as we jointly determine the fair cost-of-service rates for our max rate tariffs. So, in summary, taking all of these items into account, along with other impacts to the cost-of-service model, Transco does still expect to file for an increased cost-of-service rate in our upcoming August 2018 rate filing. So, now, moving on to slide 9. As we've shown, we have impressive growth in the next couple of years, largely from long-term fully contracted and fixed rate demand charges on a regulated pipeline, and the expected pull-through under our existing gathering contracts. Beyond these near-term growth drivers, our natural gas focused strategy and competitively positioned assets will likely capture even more growth in 2019 and beyond. And it's important to remember that Transco's fully contracted growth doesn't end with Atlantic Sunrise. And, in fact, we have a committed backlog of seven fully contracted projects that will go into service in 2019 and beyond, currently led by our largest of these, the Northeast Supply Enhancement project with commitments on that project mostly from subsidiaries of National Grid. We've applied for the FERC certificate and the FERC is currently working on the environmental impact statement. We are targeting a late 2019 in-service date for the project. But consistent with past practice, we include some additional time when forecasting revenue and EBITDA growth into our future business plans. Beyond this fully committed projects, I want to update you on the large portfolio of potential interstate transmission opportunities we are pursuing. At our 2017 Analyst Day, we discussed approximately 20 projects, which we were pursuing at that time. Since that time, 3 of these 20 projects have moved out of this bucket and moved from potential to customer committed. So, we've made great progress on those projects. Rivervale South to Market. And the Gateway project moved into full execution with FERC certificate application filed. And the Southeastern Trail project now has binding customer commitment, as I mentioned earlier. But new opportunities continue to emerge. And, in fact, the potential project list has now been backfill and now stands at over 20 projects. Moving to the Northeast Pipeline infrastructure build-out, we'll continue to unleash the power of the gas reserves in the Marcellus and the Utica. Based on our customer commitments and new activity, we now expect to expand our Ohio Valley Midstream processing capacity, which I'll remind you includes the Fort Beeler processing facility or complex as well as the Oak Grove complex. And we expect that combined capacity to increase by 400 million a day, which will take us up to over 1.1 Bcf a day on that processing complex. We also have discussions underway for a sixth major expansion of the Susquehanna Supply Hub. And in addition, we expect to complete the fifth expansion this quarter. So, a lot of that's already online, but we do have one remaining compressor station and a few loops we're putting online there. But really impressive how the Susquehanna Supply Hub and our work with both Cabot and Southwestern continues to expand our volumes up here. In the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we also are seeing great growth opportunities, especially in 2020 and beyond. First of all, modifications to our Eastern Gulf assets to serve the new dedicated volumes from Shell's major Norphlet play are under construction, and so we're well underway with that. And just to remind you, we've been installing a lot of those facilities, and Shell has been reimbursing us for those. And so, we're really excited about seeing the impact of that, that'll come on likely in 2020. We're also very excited about our recent announcements from Shell on their Whale prospect and Chevron on their Ballymore prospect. Here, a few weeks ago, both these major prospects got announced. And just to kind of pin that down a little closer for you, the Whale prospect is within 15 miles of our Perdido oil and gas export pipeline, which come up onto Shell's Perdido facility. And the Ballymore prospect is within 3 miles of Chevron's Blind Faith platform, where our Mountaineer oil pipeline and our Canyon Chief gas pipeline already served Chevron in these areas. So, we do expect both of these major discoveries to drive significant free cash flows increases in 2020 and beyond. And finds such as Ballymore and Whale are clear indications that Deepwater developments remain highly commercial. And Williams is in the absolute right spot in both the Eastern and Western Gulf to benefit. And drilling activity in Wyoming is going to continue to drive growth in our gathering and processing volumes in both the Wamsutter and the Niobrara field. In fact, right on the heels of the two Chain Lake expansions I mentioned earlier, now comes another expansion opportunity in the Wamsutter for an additional customer in this emerging play. So, we continue to see a lot of activity going on out here in the Wamsutter field. We also continue to see volume growth in the Eagle Ford and Haynesville. And this activity demonstrates the value of our strategy to be in the right spots, in the best basins, and to be a large-scale competitive player in whatever basins we're in. We see very attractive long-run return on capital from our Western gathering and processing footprint. And that return on invested capital will be extended by the latest round of this customer activity. So now, I'll wrap it up here. Williams is committed to executing the plans that we've laid for our shareholders and customers and to expanding our business in a manner that generates sustainable shareholder value. The result of strong execution in 2017 included generating healthy cash coverage that supports investments in our attractive portfolio of growth projects, while significantly strengthening our balance sheet. Williams realized a $3.3 billion reduction in consolidated net debt during the year. And through disciplined capital investing, we drove an important improvement in our return on capital employed, which has become really a key focus not just from the management team, but obviously that was driven by the board. And I would tell you that that's become front and center in our decisions as we look at our business. And as we do look ahead to our plans to expand the business, I want to reiterate that Williams has achieved full self-funding. We do not need to issue any public equity at WMB or at PZ to fund our stated forecasted capital projects through our full planning horizon. We're able to do this while maintaining a strong balance sheet and leverage metrics and healthy coverage of both WPZ distributions and WMB dividends. WMB shareholders are now positioned to benefit from a $1.9 billion reduction in deferred tax liabilities, which will manifest itself through an extended period of cash tax deferral. Williams does not expect to be a cash federal income tax payer through at least 2021, and this could be potentially longer of course, depending on our future capital spending opportunities. And we'll experience much lower taxes being paid when that deferral period does ultimately end. So we're excited about where we are with the company today. We're excited about where we're going. We think we are extremely well-positioned financially. We've got the operating capabilities that we need. And strategically, we think we're positioned better than anybody in the space when it comes to taking advantage of these low-cost natural gas reserves that continue to expand and grow demand in our both U.S. and international markets. So I thank you for your time today. And with that I'll turn it over to the operator for our first question.
Operator: Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan.
Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Good morning.
Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Want to start off with Northeast gathering and processing there. And the O&M had stepped up a bit quarter-over-quarter there. I was wondering if you could dive in a bit more on some of the drivers there. And also just expanding on the segment, in general, if you could just refresh us as far as activity rig count in your area and kind of what gives you the confidence as far as the growth into 2018.
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Good morning. This is Michael Dunn. I'll take that question. In regard to the expenses in the Northeast, I will tell you, from an enterprise perspective, let's talk about that first. We look at improvements in our operating margin across the entire enterprise in each one of our operating areas. And we drill that down to the franchise level within each one of those operating areas. So we have set goals for the organization to improve those targets on our operating margin. In the Northeast specifically, obviously, we're seeing significant growth up there. We're adding a number of facilities, whether it be compression or pipeline facilities that includes additional employees but additional operating costs that come along with that, whether they be electric power for our facilities as well as the costs that go along with that. So we're seeing really strong growth in our revenues up there. And correspondingly, with that growth, we're seeing increase in our cost. Specifically in the Northeast, we saw the new compression facilities that came online, our new employees. I mentioned the additional electric cost. But we also had emergent work in West Virginia, dealing with longwall coal mines that are underground coal mines that we actually have to go out and mitigate the pipelines that are above those coal mines, so that we don't have any operational issues. So we target those, and we typically know where those are going to occur. And we work with the coal mine companies to mitigate that. But that does increase our expense there. And also avoidance of impacts from land movement in primarily West Virginia. We did have some emergent overhauls at our Fort Beeler facility as well that were unanticipated that increased our costs there. We did have a pension lump sum settlement too, that obviously is adjusted out of our GAAP earnings, but – our GAAP numbers, but those obviously affected us there. That actually lowers our costs going forward in the future but had a onetime impact on our business. So I would say, in the Northeast specifically, we are seeing a lot of growth and it is driving costs higher. And we do have expansions under way, not only in the Susquehanna Supply Hub, Bradford costs are increasing. But in the Ohio River Supply Hub, with our Oak Grove expansion that we're working on there as we speak, we'll see cost increasing there as those facilities come on line as well next year. So growth is driving cost higher, but certainly we're watching very closely operating margin associated with each one of those franchises. And we've had set goals established for our teams to meet or beat their objectives there. When it comes to rig counts, we are seeing a lot of improvement there. In many of these areas, the producers are anticipating the online of Atlantic Sunrise. And correspondingly, we're seeing a lot of drilling activity in anticipation of Atlantic Sunrise coming on. But the additional takeaway capacity that's been generated by third parties in the Marcellus, we also are benefiting from that as well. So we're seeing a lot of production growth that's anticipated, especially in some of the wet plays that we're associated with. And that's driving a lot of additional business for us, as I indicated. And our Oak Grove expansion is a great example of that.
Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks. And maybe just touching on Southwestern to build on there, if you could just update us there as far as how the ramp progressed during the quarter and how you see that kind of going into 2018?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Maybe just – this is Alan. I'll just add a little bit there. First of all, in the Southwest Marcellus area, Southwestern's been very active there. And just to remind you, we signed a contract with them last year. And the way that contract works, they basically inform us ahead of time when they intend to bring on new volumes. And as they do that, our capacity that we make available for them on the processing expand and their minimum volume commitment to expand, to stand behind those investments that we make. And we have seen them increasing those requests for service, which drive that up, and so a lot going on there. I would tell you that there's quite a bit of activity right now going on, connecting a lot of their pads. So I think they've been very successful out there. And we're thrilled to have them as a customer out there. And they continue to improve. So feeling good about that relationship. We also as you know have expanded our relationship with EQT in the Ohio River – Valley Midstream area. And they are being very active in driving some of the growth that we're seeing there at Ohio Valley Midstream as well. So finally seeing some real pull-through as the acreage out there has gotten into the right hands. And it's great acreage and was held by various counterparties. But the consolidation we're seeing out here in and around our acreage is really starting to drive a lot of activity and growth.
Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got you. Great. And just one last one, Discovery, I was wondering if you could provide a bit more color there and kind of your outlook and kind of ability to kind of redeploy or get more business there.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Sure. So just to kind of remind people there, the Hadrian field, which was a large gas-only field that came across Anadarko's Lucius platform, but it was an Exxon-operated field, Hadrian was. Two very large wells that were producing – I think they got up to almost 400 million a day of production off those two wells of dry gas that came across that platform. I'm not going to get into Exxon's business there, but we've seen that production decline off dramatically. And we don't right now expect that production to come back on line here for 2018. And so, they'll have to decide what they're going to do with those reserves. But, right now, we don't expect that to come back on anytime soon. That was about roughly, I think, in terms of impact to our expected 2018 numbers, it was about $95 million in terms of reduction of what we would have – or I should say definitely in terms of what we saw in 2017, it was reduction from 2017 to 2018 by that amount. That's net to our interest. We own 60% of the Discovery system. Lots of other prospects out there in the area. And frankly, we were running completely full on that system, both on the processing side and on the Keathley Canyon Connector, which is that line that goes up to the Lucius platform. But there are some very large RFPs that we're bidding on right now. So, we don't expect anything of that kind of significance to backfill that here in 2018. But there's a tremendous amount of prospects there in the Keathley Canyon area that were – gas takeaway solution for that area. So, we would expect to win that business. So, short term, negative; long term, Discovery, as always, is positioned in a great spot.
Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: That's very helpful. I'll pause there. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury from Bernstein.
Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning. I think you've said before that after Atlantic Sunrise comes on line, Chesapeake will be down to 10% of your EBITDA. I wanted to make sure that, that's about right? And as a follow-up, would you be willing to comment on your next one or two largest customers? Are they E&Ps or utilities, and kind of roughly what share of EBITDA they are?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Well, let's see. First of all, on the Chesapeake front, yes, I think your 10% number is fairly accurate as we move forward here. I would say, obviously, that's dependent on asset sales that Chesapeake continues to execute on. And so, with additional asset sales, that might drop lower. In terms of our largest customers, I would tell you, it's quite a mix there. Certainly, Cabot's been running up fast on that list with all the great business that we have within there in Susquehanna Supply Hub and then – and Atlantic Sunrise comes on. So, I think that's really going to drive that. But if you look below that, you'll start to see a lot of the big utility customers that we have on the Transco system. So, anyway, I think that's probably the right way to think about that. Obviously, Southwestern is emerging but not anywhere near yet, where we see Cabot as an E&P customer.
Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Got it. That's really helpful.
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Alan, you got anything to add to that?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: No. I think that's great. That's right.
Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. That's really helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up, a number of the Marcellus E&Ps are now discussing living within cash flow at least over the next couple of years, I guess. Has that impacted your growth outlook, or is it fair to think that the Northeast Marcellus is somewhat immune from that just because it's so takeaway-constrained?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I think, obviously, we stay very close to Cabot. And they've done a great job and been very disciplined, and, as you know, continue to build a lot of cash on their side. So, I think they will just continue to generate more cash as new markets open up, too. It's pretty remarkable to me to see what they've been able to do in such a very low price environment that they've been exposed to. And so, I think they are capable of operating in a very low price environment and continue to generate cash flow. So, as for Cabot, I would say that I think in terms of the moving down to the Bradford area, obviously, great reserves there as well, and that area is going to benefit from much better markets as well. And then, finally, in the Southwest Marcellus area, obviously, these higher NGL prices that producers have been experiencing in that area really driving cash flows for folks there. But I think, right now, we're seeing an intense focus by the players that are really beginning to consolidate these basins. EQT is probably the biggest example of that, but their ability to generate returns on even low prices, I think, is going to continue to drive the kind of growth. Frankly, we're better off as a gatherer. We're better off if that growth doesn't come in huge spikes that comes in a steady growth pattern, because it means less capital investment per free cash flow for us. So, we're pretty pleased with the current rate of growth that we're seeing. And it's right in line with what we laid out last year in our Analyst Day as we look (48:27) pro forma that we rolled out at the Analyst Day last year. We're pretty well staying right in line with that. And that's going to drive a lot of value for us if it continues on that trajectory.
Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Perfect. That answers my question. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Christine Cho of Barclays.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. I wanted to start off in the West. The volumes are good. Can you just remind us if the Haynesville contracts are higher margin than the other G&P areas in this section?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: No. I mean, the rates there, as you'll recall, we renegotiated those rates several years ago and we exchanged a lower rate for drilling obligations from Chesapeake. And we combined those two systems out there. So, I would say, our rates out there today are in line with the market. In terms of the operating margin that we have out there, it's probably in line. I think the benefit we have out there right now, Christine, is that we had quite a bit of capacity already built. So, you'll recall, we did a little expansion back in August of last year. But, overall, we've got the capacity sitting there, and these pads are pretty well built out, so we're not having to spend a lot of well connect capital. And our operating costs continue to be pretty low for the area, just because the systems already built out. And so, that's the kind of advantage you have when a system comes back, and you've already got the capacity built out for it. So, I think that's that margin that you're seeing.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I actually didn't mean relative to like market. I meant relative to the other areas in the West segment. So, are the Haynesville rates higher than, like your Niobrara, your Rockies, et cetera?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: No, they are not. But again, it's very dependent on the total services that we are offering. And so, what I was getting at there was that we've already had these operating systems up and running. And once they're a little more mature, we're able to really put pressure on our costs as opposed to when we're in a growing mode and we're having to add people and quickly bring volumes up. So, I would just say, because the Haynesville has been operating for quite some, our unit operating costs, they're pretty mature. So, if you wanted to get down to operating margin percentage there, it's probably pretty good on that basis.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then I wanted to go to your slide 8 in the presentation. The $425 million full-year contribution from Atlantic Sunrise and Garden State, I just wanted to clarify if these are gross or net numbers to you, as I think Atlantic Sunrise is consolidated in your financials, but the non-controlling interest line is below the adjusted EBITDA.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. No, you are correct. That is the gross number.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And do you have like a net...
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: That is what goes into EBITDA, and then there'll be a minority interest deduction number.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, lastly, WPX sold their San Juan acreage. And just wanted to see what kind of impact you expect to see from that, if any, and to confirm that the contracts will transfer over to the new owners.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. First of all, we haven't seen the contract shift yet, so obviously, we'll take a look at that as we do in situation like that. We've been able – always able to work with our customers to deal with credit issues, which obviously is the primary issue in any kind of exchange like that, but I would – so, too early to tell you on that. We haven't concluded that. I would say that we're continuing to see the acreage fall into the right hands, and it's very much a positive for us when we see acreage shifting around like this because, as you know, WPX has a lot of high-return investment opportunity in the Permian that is going to keep them busy for a long time. And so, moving this over to somebody who will bring the cost of capital that it needs in the Mancos oil play there is a positive thing. And we're really seeing that throughout the West. So, we just continue to see properties falling into the right hands, and we think that's a real positive for us.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. I'll leave it at that. Thank you so much.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Christine.
Operator: And from Goldman Sachs, we turn next to Ted Durbin.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. On the Transco rate case, I wonder if you can quantify what kind of rate increase you might be looking for? Are we talking in sort of the double digits in percentage terms, or maybe said another way, how much do you think you're under earning on your cost-of-service rates right now in Transco?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Ted, I would just tell you, that will be determined when we get done with the test period or base period, and so – that we're forming those rates, and when we get done, I think that ends here in May, I think, and that'll form the basis for that rate in August. But I would tell you, the numbers on Transco are big and it takes a lot (54:00) direction to move those rates very much. So, don't expect any major shifts in that rate one way or the other.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. That makes sense. And then, as we think about the O&M increases you've had in the Atlantic-Gulf segment, you talked about Transco and the higher maintenance capital we've had, should we think about what we're looking at in 2018 as a good run rate, or should we see a step up or step down as we look ahead into 2019? You've had your maintenance capital numbers stepped up decently well here in the guidance versus where you've run the last couple of years. Just talk about run rate operating costs, particularly around Transco, please.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Ted, thanks for the question. First of all, you could draw the conclusion – without seeing the details, you could draw the conclusion that our expansions are really driving a lot of that cost, and that's just not the case really. The cost is being increased as we go through the process of doing things that you might consider to some people would look like maintenance capital, but by the details of the rules (55:16) are not maintenance capital. So, for instance, doing hydro testing on pipeline and doing repairs, all of that, it winds up in expense. We have a lot of that to do on the Transco system. And certainly, because we operate in such highly populated areas, we are going to spend the money to make sure our pipes are safe. And so, that kind of cost, even though some might consider that maintenance of the system is really what's been driving our cost up here recently. And we've got a lot more work to do on that front. So, those costs will continue for quite some time as we do that. Now, the thing that's difficult about that is predicting what that cost is actually going to be, because when you hydro test the line, if you do see problems, you're having to forecast the rate of repair required, if you will, when you do either the internal inspection, testing, or the hydro testing, either one, you'd have to estimate what your rate of repair is, so that just becomes an estimate. And until you actually run the test, then you really don't know what your repair requirements are going to be. So, that becomes a little bit difficult to predict, much more difficult than just ongoing operating expenses of keeping a compressor station running or keeping the right of ways maintained and the measurement systems maintained on the pipeline. So, hopefully, that helps you understand, but I think bottom line is we've got high costs that are related to bringing the – making sure we've maintained the system adequately, and that will continue for some time here.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great. And then last one from me, just on CapEx guidance. $2.7 billion total, $1.7 billion at Transco, can you just bridge us what goes into that $1 billion difference? Is it more the Northeast and some of the OVM spending you talked about at the Deepwater? Kind of a little more color on where that $1 billion is coming out of?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Sure. First of all, as I mentioned, like the Norphlet project we're doing for Shell on the Deepwater, that's included in capital. But if you really got down to seeing the sources and uses, you'd see that being reimbursed even though we count that as capital. So, some of that is reimbursed capital that would show up as capital spending, but in fact, it gets reimbursed. And so, that's about maybe 20% or so of that 15% maybe. And then, in the Northeast, a lot of growth going on, and with the sixth expansion that I talked about in the Northeast as well as a build-out of the Ohio expanding the processing capacity in the Ohio Valley Midstream area. And then out West, the Wamsutter area is the primary driver for growth out West, as we continue to expand those systems. And I would tell you that probably the next area that we'll be looking to need to expand will probably be the Niobrara with the growth that's going on there. So, that probably will wind up being more of a 2019 issue perhaps, but maybe start spending on that. So, that's really driving most of it is actually in all three areas. The largest of those right now though is the Northeast in both the Susquehanna County area as well the Ohio Valley Midstream area.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Perfect. I'll leave it at that. Thank you very much.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Ted.
Operator: And up next is Shneur Gershuni from UBS.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning, guys. Maybe we can start off with the balance sheet and expectations on return of capital going forward. If I recall, when you did the restructuring early last year, you sort of seemed that there was a goal to reduce leverage by about $5 billion. You did the equity issuances, you've had some asset sales, and EBITDA seems to be recovering and so forth. Was wondering how far away we are until the agencies would view the consolidated entity as IG? And then, what your expectations are for returning cash flow with respect to WMB getting close to paying off its revolver in the second half of this year?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I'll take the last part of that. And I'll let John Chandler take the first part in terms of the balance sheet piece of that and the rating agencies. On the return of cash flow, I would just say, lots of different opportunities for WMB. We are excited about adding value to our shareholders with that excess cash flow. But as we've said previously, we're going to be looking for the best opportunity. And so, that can come in a lot of different forms. As you know, it's not a similar debate to Williams. But I would say, one of the areas that is also attractive is WMB making singular investments in new project opportunities as WMB is an opportunity as the opportunity slate for Williams continues to grow. That's not everything obviously, because we don't want to make things so convoluted between what's owned by MB and PZ, but we will certainly look for that, given how many really highly attractive projects we've got out there. And then, of course, the continued dividend raise obviously is a place to go with incremental cash. So, lots of opportunities on that front. And I would just tell you we'll see what the market looks like six months from now in terms of when we're up against that. So, stay tuned, but I'd tell you we're excited about using that capital to drive additional value for WMB shareholders. And, John, if you'll take maybe the question on the balance sheet.
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah, sure. So, as we exited 2017, WMB had about $270 million outstanding on its revolver, and we're generating around $100 million of excess cash flow every quarter at WMB after it makes its dividends. So, we'll continue to pay that revolver down. And that obviously puts us in the third quarter or fourth quarter when the revolver's gone, which will further bring our leverage down. But again, as Alan pointed out earlier in the call, with the spending on Atlantic Sunrise and the various other projects, our leverage will tick up somewhat as we get to the end of 2018, and then once we get the full benefit of Atlantic Sunrise will come back down again. And so, as I think about investment grade and as a consolidated entity with the $4 billion in debt that's up at WMB, I think we need – and when we talk about investment grade, when we say investment grade, we're really talking about mid-level investment grade, not BBB- but a solid BBB ratio. We think we need to be in the, probably, 4.5 to 4.75 times zip code of debt to EBITDA. And it's depending on when the rating agencies give us kind of full credit for Atlantic Sunrise, but I think in the early part of 2019, we can make a pretty strong argument about that.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Great. And as a follow-up question, you were talking about the Northeast earlier in response to a question talking about how Cabot is able to operate in the low-cost environment. And there were some other questions about how bottlenecked the Northeast is. But at the same time, Mariner East 2 is expected to come on line, Rover is expected to come on line, and so forth. In your conversations with E&P companies, how much do the IRRs for them to drill change as a result of these projects coming online? And once that hits, does that accelerate the opportunity for you to achieve what you outlined at the Investor Day about potentially investing $1 billion of capital in the Northeast at a 2.5 times EBITDA multiple?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Great question. I would just, say, Shneur, that the one thing that's a bit complex around that obviously is who has long-haul capacity that they hold or don't hold. And so I think that will tend to drive whether somebody is being very opportunistic in very short term and just drilling when the pricing is there. Obviously, they can turn these areas when the infrastructure is already in place, and they've got a pad sitting there, they can turn incremental production on very quickly when the pricing opportunity exposes itself. I think we're going to see more of that as the capacity gets built out. But I do think it's very dependent on if you've got long-haul capacity that you are constantly filling or you have a gas purchase contract for a good price that you can depend on. You can be more of an ongoing and less reactive mode, if you're a producer in that situation, versus if you're one that's just sitting, waiting for a price peak and hitting that. I think what we're seeing through the consolidation in the basin is more of the former example. I think previously, we had a lot of the latter example. And the big consolidators in the basin are making long-term commitments to either NGL takeaway or gas takeaway, as you mentioned, and that is going to position them for long-term drilling and is going to make their variable price point very different than somebody that doesn't have that takeaway capacity. And so I think we are certainly continuing to see expansion going. I think people are getting better and better at getting their cost down on the reserves. And so I think that's pretty promising for the Northeast in terms of volumes. I also think though there has been a pretty strong delineation, because people have got such a strong portfolio of opportunity that it's going to be awhile before people get to the lesser acreage. And by that, I mean the lower return acreage. I think it's going to be a while before people get to that, because there's such a great inventory of the very strong acreage in both Susquehanna and Bradford County in the Northeast, and then of course, in West Virginia and for our Southwest Pennsylvania for the rich Marcellus. So I'd say, feeling pretty optimistic. But I do think, to answer your question, it's very dependent on what it produces, a long-haul takeaway or their gas purchase contracts are out of the area as to how steady their drilling is going to be.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Final question. With respect to the Gulf of Mexico, and I understand there's the discovery dispute and so forth, but it seems like producers, and I believe you mentioned Shell, seem to be adding capital into the Gulf of Mexico, talking about tiebacks profitable at $40 oil. Do you see this as an emerging opportunity for Williams going forward? Just kind of wondering if it's a one-off or if it's something that we should be thinking about across the Gulf of Mexico.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I would tell you, we happen to be in the right spots. And so that's the good news in that we've got on top of the prospects that we talked about today, there's a lot of other opportunities that are emerging and quite a few large RFPs that we're responding to for big infrastructure development in the area. So I would say we have seen a resurgence. I don't think that it ever quite went away the way people thought it did in terms of the opportunity, because folks like Shell don't just turn on a dime on these kind of things. They've got a long-term commitment to the area. And they've been sitting on that well prospect for quite some time. But they've got to make sure there's room in the infrastructure, both on their platform and in our pipelines to get that gas and oil out of there. And so that's kind of what you're seeing managed. I think people are trying to lessen their big capital commitments and trying to utilize existing infrastructure as much as possible. And I think that's really the shift that we've seen. And I think you'll continue to see that, because if you can use an existing platform and you're not having to put billions of dollars in new infrastructure in, you can be pretty responsive to oil and gas prices. And I think that's what we'll continue to see out in this play.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Really appreciate the color today.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Shneur.
Operator: And our next question comes from Colton Bean of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.
Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.: Morning. Just wanted to follow up in the conversation around Northeast producers. So I agree in the consideration of pipeline capacity, but it seems like at least in the near term, there's been some consideration that producers may pull off volumes from local hubs relative to actually adding new production over the 2018 and maybe into 2019. So just wanted to get a sense of how you guys were thinking about that as you formulate your forecast for the Northeast?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah, well, I would say that we look at what requests come in from our producers to actually formulate our forecast. And as I mentioned earlier in the call, a lot of those come with obligations. So when a producer says that they want to increase their volumes or their capacity on our system, that comes with an obligation that stands behind that. So obviously, they've given that good thought and – before they make those kind of commitments. But that's basically what we generate our forecast off of. I would say, we have very little speculative drilling built into our forecast (1:09:35) off of that. But I would say, as we look into 2019, first, 2018 is strong with I think about a 13% increase from the fourth quarter to fourth quarter, so exit rate to exit rate. And so that's very identified right now in terms of where that volume's coming from. And as we look into 2019, we're seeing a similar pull-through. But again, so many of our contracts are either cost of service, which requires long-term planning, or minimum volume commitment-backed contracts. That's really what's driving our forecast.
Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.: Okay. Helpful. And then just to circle back to the West segment. So it looks like you're up about $250 million (1:10:28) in the gathering piece. So you mentioned the Haynesville, but then 8 of the other 10 – or I guess eight of the other nine were also up. Can you just frame, I mean, what the magnitude was? Was there any meaningful contributors there or predominately Haynesville?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Haynesville was the biggest I think behind that probably on a percentage basis. (1:10:51)
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: On a percentage basis, we saw pretty significant increase in the Niobrara. Although it's a smaller number, it's a big increase we saw. As we mentioned, the Haynesville and even some improvement in the Anadarko, though across the board, saw pretty good improvement across all of those. The Eagle Ford was up almost double digits there as well, so.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I think on an order of magnitude, I think, Haynesville and Eagle Ford were the two biggest drivers. But on a percentage basis, the Niobrara was pretty strong. And I would tell you, given the current activity, we expect that to continue to be a pretty strong percentage driver, even though on an absolute basis it doesn't have that much impact.
Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.: Got it. Okay. And just a final question here on maintenance. So relatively light versus 2017 guide. Is that tied at all to your conversation around the O&M spend and some of that transition from what you would consider maintenance CapEx to the operating expense line? Or just came in lower than expected?
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Well, I would say – this is Michael Dunn again. I'd say, it came in lower than expected across the board, really across all of our franchises. We anticipated some work that actually wouldn't likely shift into 2018 from the appearance of a lot of it. Was just a lot of that work that was in process, but just didn't get completed in the fourth quarter. So we are seeing some of that shift into 2018, which is not – that's pretty typical, I would say, as to what we see where we do have a shift at the end of the year in some of that work that we just don't get completed, and it shifts into the future year. But we really thought across all of our franchises where we had work that was anticipated to be completed, and we just didn't get it finished.
Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.: Okay. So with 2018 being flat versus the 2017 guide, implications that 2018 would have actually been down but some of that slipped to this year?
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: No. I wouldn't characterize it that way. In fact, we're seeing 2018 slightly ahead of where we've anticipated 2017 to come out. We're seeing a lot of work, as we indicated earlier, in our Transco system, but not only on the expense side, but on the maintenance CapEx side as well for integrity and reliability projects.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: So, yeah, to be clear we are expecting an increase in maintenance capital from 2017 to 2018.
Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.: But the guides are effectively flat? $500 million both years?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: We came in below that $500 million in 2017. So, I think, we came in at $440 million...
Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.: Yeah. That's correct.
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: That's right.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: ...in 2017.
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: So, I think one thing when you look to our guidance for 2018, we widened our distributable cash flow guidance, in part, because of trying to really fine tune around maintenance capital spending. I think the last couple of years, if you look at our performance versus our guidance, we come in below the guidance and it's just a matter of how much work you can get done. And typically we don't know that till we get towards the end of the year. So, we widened the guidance a little bit to reflect that.
Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.: Yes. All right. Well, thank you, guys.
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: And from Citi, our next call comes from Eric Genco.
Eric C. Genco - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Morning. I was just hoping to drill in maybe a little bit on the excess coverage at WMB and the shareholder return question. Is it fair to characterize it and say, if you got 1.36 excess coverage there that your first priority after you're done with the leverage pay down is would be projects that you needed to avoid, public equity issuance and other entity? But then is it basically – as people are sort of anticipating the potential for a consolidation of the two entities is it just a matter of looking at WMB's NAV versus its ownership of PZ? And if that is at a discount, should we assume that WMB buybacks move up the pecking order in terms of what you would like to do with that capital?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. All of that. There's, obviously, a lot of things to consider there. But, as you know, the Tax Reform, of course, pushes out the date by which we would be a cash tax payer at WMB, which is obviously one of the benefits of getting that tax stuff up (1:15:24) first. And secondly, ultimately, the tax rate that we're paying just got lowered as well. So, I would just say that, that driver is somewhat lessened as a result of Tax Reform bill as we look out there. So, John?
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: No. I think you're – I mean, obviously, and Alan alluded to this earlier. When we get to that point, we'll be making a relative return decision and if WMB appears undervalued, maybe we buy back WMB shares. If WPZ seems undervalued, maybe we buy back WPZ shares or maybe we co-invest in projects. Generally, as it relates to the buy-in of the partnership, now that the Tax Reform is understood, once our leverage gets right, I think, just generally, as it relates to that entity, I think we'll have to take a look at how the MLP space is doing in general. I think MLP is a tool to race capital over the long term if that market were strong, I think we'd have to ask, do we want to make it go away or not. And if the space is kind of just trending sideways, like – I mean, it's a little bit improved now, but generally trending sideways, then, you have to (1:16:32) leave it outstanding. So, I think it's a bigger picture than just that. I think it's a question about the strength of the space when we get there.
Eric C. Genco - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then, shifting gears on – and just a bigger picture-type question on Northeast. If Constitution were to never happen in some of these other pipes that are there, how do we think about the multiyear outlook for Northeast G&P? Because for the longest time and even now, we're waiting for Constitution to come on to basically debottleneck Susquehanna Supply Hub, and I believe, Bradford, to some extent. But if you don't get Constitution or some of these other things, are there other opportunities, or do we sit back and say, the volume increase from, call it, 4Q 2017 to 4Q 2020 in those areas is pretty much limited to Atlantic Sunrise's capacity?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Great question. First of all, I would just say, we have other projects ultimately. And, of course, we have a project called Diamond East, which follows our Leidy route and the expansion of our Leidy route. A lot of recent interest in that project. So, that expands capacity into Zone 6 in a pretty meaningful way as one alternative. And then, additionally, ultimately, we have some expansion capability on Atlantic Sunrise. So, I would just say, if the folks in New England area want to continue to buy their gas from Russia, they can, and the folks in the south will benefit from that. So, that looks like that's – what that's going to continue to be is lower-cost gas supplies for the growing industries in the south. And so, we'll see on Constitution. I think in the grand scheme of things, it's an important – it's not that big in terms of total volume takeaway from the area. It is important, I think, in terms of determining if the Trump administration's going to be successful in pushing for infrastructure development. And so, we remain very committed to that. But I would tell you in the grand scheme of things, the market takeaway, there's plenty of market growing to the south. And we were very well-positioned to be able to get that gas there through either expansions of Atlantic Sunrise or Diamond East, as I just mentioned.
Eric C. Genco - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Darren Horowitz of Raymond James.
Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Just a quick one for me. When you think about the EBITDA buildup, not just for 2018 but going into 2019 as well, and you think about it more on an EBITDA per Mcf basis, can you just help us understand how much of that buildup and progression is Atlantic Sunrise line contributions into the Susquehanna and Bradford systems in addition to Garden State versus maybe just more aggregate takeaway capacity alleviating basis pressure in the basin? And then, into 2019, how do we think about the construct of that EBITDA buildup versus what could be rising O&M expenses again?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Darren, make sure I heard that correctly. First of all, last quarter out on the buildup, the cost buildup that you see there in 2018 certainly would carry – that cost increase would certainly carry into 2019, but not a whole lot of incremental costs associated with bringing those projects online. So, as I mentioned earlier, it's more going to be driven by the maintenance work. And that step-up that you see in the prior year will carry in to the 2019 period as well. So, I think that answers that part. If would you try again on – I didn't quite understand the basis differential question.
Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Well, I'm just trying to figure out, like if you look at the gathering capacity in Northeast Pennsylvania, it's probably pushing at this point for you guys 6 Bcf a day. So, I'm trying to figure out as you guys kind of progress on that EBITDA per Mcf ramp that was laid out at the Analyst Day, obviously, incremental takeaway capacity by you guys and your competitors out of the basin is going to alleviate basis pressure. Based on your footprint, you're going to get your natural market share with regard to a step-up in volume, based on just easy capacity utilization. So, I'm trying to figure out how much of it is driven by the basis uplift and incremental volume across your assets versus what you guys are adding on a fully-contracted basis such that the EBITDA per Mcf could shift a little bit.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Got it. Thank you. That's very helpful. Thank you. Yeah, so, I would say, first of all, we do think that there is a lot more growth out of the area than, just for instance, Atlantic Sunrise and/or potentially Diamond East. We think obviously, if you're to look at Cabot's slide and all the different market and gas purchase contracts that they've done with power plants in the area, they've got a nice step-up coming from that. And so, I would say, they've been pretty smart on that. But I also would remind people that as these big takeaway projects come out of the Southwest part of the Marcellus or Mountain Valley, Atlantic Coast, as those come online and get attached to growing markets there, that will pool gas off of systems that serve the Northeast today that are in serving that local market. So, even the Northeast PA will gain some benefit from that takeaway capacity to the Southwest because you'll just see volumes start to be supplied from the Northeast rather than the Southwest on a local – in both power plant basis and local use. But in terms of our EBITDA margin, and what we're expecting in pull-up there, most of it is just coming – we have fixed the contract, and the EBITDA margin is just coming from our cost remaining relatively flat plus a mix of a higher portion of our volume coming from places like Ohio Valley Midstream, where we have a much higher margin per Mcf basis. And so, those are the two main drivers for us. But as I mentioned earlier, in terms of our volume forecast, it's pretty well driven by detailed plans that we have with – in fact, it is driven by detailed plans that we have with our producing customers right now, as we build out those systems and their obligations stand behind that. So, I would say, at least for the next couple of years, we have a very good read on what we expect those volumes to do. We have won some new business and are winning some new business in the Southwest area that will increase our processing volumes in the Southwest that would have been over and above our earlier forecast. But for the most part, our forecasts are just driven by our existing gathering contracts and the plans that we have with those producers today. And that, by itself, is driving that EBITDA margin uplift, if you will, that we spoke about at last Analyst Day.
Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: And we'll go next to Chris Sighinolfi of Jefferies.
Unknown Speaker: Hey, guys. It's Cory (1:24:15) filling in for Chris. And thanks so much for taking time, so much extra time to answer all of our questions. Just two really quick ones for me. The first one is just want to make sure we heard the Transco timeline correctly. So, that on slide 8, that $140 million walk from 2017 to 2018, that assumes July and service of compressor. And you said a few months after that, it would be the greenfield pipe portion that would start contributing?
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Right. Yeah. I can take a little bit of more filler on that. Right now, we're anticipating and targeting that our contractors are going to be mechanically complete on the pipeline portion in July. And mechanical completion means just that, the contractors are finished with their work and then commissioning begins with our teams. And with the compressor stations mechanically complete, the time between mechanical completion and in-service when you can commission those compressor stations takes a bit longer. There's just a lot more process, because you have to go through on the compressor stations to complete your commissioning activities, where it's a lot quicker on the pipeline systems. You're really just commissioning the valves and meter stations on the pipeline, but much more complicated on the compressor station. So, the compressor stations lag a few months there although their percentage completion right now is leapfrogging the pipeline. The commissioning process takes a bit longer with the compressor stations. So, that's why you see a little bit of a lag there on the compressor stations beyond the pipelines being mechanically complete.
Unknown Speaker: Okay. All right. That makes sense. And then, I'm assuming this was done on purpose, but there's no way you can bifurcate Atlantic Sunrise and Garden State for us, can you?
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: As far as a revenue impact, EBITDA impact, the contribution, yeah?
Unknown Speaker: Yeah. That EBITDA, that $140 million split. I don't know if you can for us.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I tell you what, why don't you call our IR team, and they can give you some detail. I think we have provided some information previously that'll help you on that.
Unknown Speaker: Okay. And then just last one from us is – and I apologize if I missed this, but the cadence of the dividend and distribution growth in 2018, the quarterly for PZ, the annual for MB, was that new?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Well, we've talked about the increase – the new piece that we laid out today was saying that we were just going to go ahead and just do annual increases on WMB versus quarterly distribution increases. So, that is new. The percentage of annual increase is staying the same, but the annual versus quarterly distinction is new.
Unknown Speaker: Okay. And just out of curiosity, the motivation for the difference there?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: I would just say, first of all, I think the MLP space is used to the quarterly raise and the quarterly distributions. And I would say, large more utility-like C-Corps are more annual raisers, and so we were just pretty well staying in line with what we see really out of the more pure market for WMB. And so, that's really the driver on.
Unknown Speaker: Understood. All right. Thanks so much again for the time, guys.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thank you. Okay. Go ahead.
Operator: I apologize. This concludes our question-and-answer session. Mr. Armstrong, at this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Great. Thank you. Lots of great questions. Thank you, all. Appreciate all the attention to the business. Really, well-positioned as we go forward here. I think the low gas prices that we're seeing particularly in the forward market are just evidence of the people's confidence in our ability to utilize and get low-priced gas out of the ground. We think it's a really positive thing for us, both on the LNG development and those markets as well as the development on gas fired generation, and I think we'll see some of that this summer, that demand start to pick up as well. So, really excited about how the fundamentals are supporting our business and especially pleased with the continued improvement in executions on our projects by our teams all across the Williams system. So, we thank you for your interest, and I look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you.
Operator: And this does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Williams and Williams Partners Third Quarter 2017 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John D. Porter - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Chris. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily. Joining us today is our Chief Operating Officer, Michael Dunn; and our CFO, John Chandler. In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials. And so with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thank you, John, and welcome everyone. I want to begin by introducing John Chandler to this call as our new CFO. He joined Williams in September and he's no stranger to many of you obviously. John enjoyed a long tenure at Magellan as CFO and he actually went to Magellan whom we spun it out from Williams. We're very pleased to be welcoming John back to Williams and you'll hear more from John later this morning. Of course, John is replacing Don Chappel who's retired from Williams, and I want to thank Don for all of his contributions to the company and we certainly wish him well in his retirement. As for the quarter, I'd like to start by thanking the team for another strong quarter of fee-based revenue growth driven by the project execution front as we continue to bring projects into service, on-time, and within our budgets. Importantly, we also continue to win meaningful new business which will keep our project execution teams busy for many years to come. The large scale advantage positions we've established continue to generate growth as evidenced by our strong results, with the year-to-date adjusted EBITDA up versus year-to-date 2016 despite the sale of over $3 billion of assets that generated $110 million of EBITDA in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and the impact of two hurricanes that shut-in volumes from offshore producers. We substantially reduced our direct exposure to commodities. And as a result, our current business' steady growth is both predictable and transparent as it is being driven by consistent fee-based revenue growth under long-term contracts. Our strategic focus on natural gas volumes continues to deliver results. So far in 2017, we placed four of our Big 5 Transco expansion projects into service, including Gulf Trace, Hillabee Phase 1, the Dalton Expansion, and the New York Bay Expansion; with the fifth of the Big 5, the Virginia Southside II project, expected to be placed in service during the fourth quarter of this year. The incremental capacity from our fully contracted Transco expansion projects going in service so far this year reflects a 25% increase in Transco's design capacity. And year-to-date, Transco's transportation revenues have increased $74 million, a 7% increase over last year, and this is even though most of those 17 projects are being placed into service in the last half of this year. So along with our successful project execution, I'm also pleased with how we've strengthened our balance sheet and credit profile, significantly reducing our debt and lowering our overhead expenses. In fact, year-to-date, in 2017 Williams Partners has reduced long-term debt by $2 billion and increased cash by over $1 billion. This reduced debt level and increased cash balance has positioned us to self-fund our attractive slate of growth projects using cash on hand, retained operating cash flow and debt without the need to issue public equity all while maintaining solid investment grade credit metrics and coverage. At the corporate level, WMB has paid down $372 million in debt, and total adjusted overhead expenses have been reduced by about $40 million when compared to the same period in 2016 as we were able to realize overhead reduction in several ways, including moving from five operating areas to three and closing the Oklahoma City office in June of this year. So let's look at the results for the third quarter of 2017, and looking at the GAAP results first. WPZ delivered $259 million in net income in the third quarter of 2017, and WPZ's adjusted EBITDA was $1.1 billion. Our current business segments, the Atlantic-Gulf, the West, and the Northeast G&P – so those assets that we've retained, the businesses we've retained – combined to increase our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter by about $13 million. However, the full WPZ comparison shows a decrease in our third quarter adjusted EBITDA results versus third quarter of 2016 of $88 million. Of course, this was driven primarily by the absence of over $100 million in adjusted EBITDA contributed from the NGL and Petchem segments earlier, and of course these were sold by the partnership and this included the Geismar Olefins plant which we sold in July of this year, the associated RGP Splitter that we sold in June of this year, and our former Canadian businesses that were sold in September 2016. I would add here that our third quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA increase from our current businesses includes an unfavorable impact of approximately $8 million from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and contract restructures that lowered the West area results. So those are both contract restructures that we did in the Barnett as well as in the Niobrara area. So we're about to roll out of those or the periods of comparison of those, but those certainly had impacts on the West. Looking to DCF for the third quarter of 2017, Williams Partners generated $669 million in DCF compared with $795 million in DCF for the third quarter of 2016. In addition to the unfavorable change related to the big asset sales, the DCF for third quarter of 2017 has been reduced by $59 million for the removal of non-cash deferred revenue amortizations that were associated with the fourth quarter of 2016 contract restructuring in the Barnett Shale in the Mid-Continent region. So we mentioned this reduction in last quarter's call as well, partially offsetting the unfavorable changes with a $37 million decrease in interest expense. Importantly, WPZ coverage for the quarter came in at 1.17 and puts us at 1.24 year-to-date. The cash retained due to this healthy coverage supports further investment in our high-return growth CapEx portfolio. So now we'll take a look at each of our segments, starting here with the Atlantic-Gulf. The adjusted EBITDA for the Atlantic-Gulf came in at $431 million, a $3 million decrease from the third quarter of 2017. The year-over-year comparisons were impacted by the short-term benefit we had in Q3 of last year where we were gathering and processing gas for a competitor's Pascagoula plant, and so that we had a big lift in the third quarter of last year as you all remember where we pointed out. And in addition to that, in the third quarter we had impact from both Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Transco's growth projects contributed $46 million in fee-based revenues incremental, so a very good top line quarter here for Transco, partially offsetting the increased fee-based revenues with increased O&M expenses associated with Transco's required integrity and pipeline maintenance programs. These increased expenses are something we've been expecting and planning for. But I would say, due to timing of work and invoices, the expenses were slightly more concentrated here in the third quarter as usual. So overall, for the year, we're on plan and certainly within our expectations as we provided guidance there, but we did have it pretty lumpy here in the third quarter. A lot of that is just because we have the ability during this part of the year, right before we've got lines tied up for winter service, we've got a period that we can get in and go and get a lot of that work done, and we certainly got a lot of that done here in the third quarter. So now turning to the West. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA came in at $426 million, down by $7 million versus third quarter of 2016. Fee-based revenues were down on an adjusted basis primarily due to contract restructures. And also, EBITDA from JV's was lower due to the Delaware Basin joint venture sale from the first quarter. So recall, in the first quarter of this year we sold our interest in a Delaware Basin JV to Western Gas. The structural impacts were partially offset by continued tight O&M and SG&A expenses, and so really proud of the team continuing to put a lot of pressure on our overhead costs and our own direct O&M costs in the West. Some good news I would tell you for the West, we did see increased volume sequentially. So when we look at the West, gathered volumes up 5% versus 2Q of 2017. You'll recall in 2Q we said we expected to see things turning that way as we were starting to see volumes come back mostly due to the strong volume growth we saw in basins like the Haynesville system, and we are seeing the big volumes in the Haynesville coming on out there and we're seeing this continue in the fourth quarter. I'll provide a little more on that just a moment. Now looking to the Northeast. Overall, for the third quarter, our Northeast adjusted EBITDA increased $26 million compared to the same period last year. The current year benefited from higher proportional EBITDA from our Bradford County JV. Our Northeast volumes were up over 0.5 Bcf a day, a growth rate of over 8% in looking at 3Q of 2017 to 3Q of 2016 on all these operated systems. So this overall gathering growth was driven by both the Bradford Supply Hub and the Susquehanna Supply Hub growth. This growth was partially offset by lower Utica volumes. But again, just like we've talked about a little bit in the West, we were pleased to see the Utica volumes begin to turnaround, with sequential growth from 2Q of this year. And I would just note on that. Most of that turnaround in the Utica is actually on our Flint system which serves the dry Utica. So now, let's look at year-to-date and take a look at what happened in our year-to-date results. In spite of the hurricanes and the removal of $110 million from our NGL-Petchem EBITDA, Williams Partners still delivered year-to-date GAAP net income of $1.21 billion and we delivered adjusted EBITDA year-to-date of $3.32 billion, an $8 million improvement from the corresponding period in 2016, primarily due to increased fee-based revenues, increased commodity margins, and an increase in proportional EBITDA from joint ventures and lower overhead expenses. Adjusted EBITDA from the retained businesses was up $118 million versus the same nine months in 2016 for our retained businesses, and so that is from the Atlantic-Gulf, West and Northeast G&P. So noisy as we got some of these asset sales coming out here on the year-to-date numbers, but overall really pleased to see the way our retained businesses are performing. Year-to-date coverage of WPZ is now 1.24, on the back of $2.1 billion in DCF. And this very solid coverage excludes the $175 million of EBITDA that is revenue amortization associated with the Barnett and Mid-Continent restructuring. So just to remind you on that, we include that earnings in the – obviously, in the EBITDA calculation, we included it in earnings but we pull that out of DCF. So now let's look at some of our recent achievements as we continue to build long-term sustainable growth in the business. Several of our recent achievements contributed directly to our performance this quarter, including two more of our five planned 2017 Transco expansions placed in service during the quarter; those would be Hillabee and Dalton. And on Atlantic Sunrise, we started construction and have already placed a portion of Atlantic Sunrise into early service on September 1 of this year, providing about 400,000 dekatherms a day of firm transportation service on Transco's existing mainline facilities, and of course that serve delivery points as far south as Choctaw County, Alabama. So we're really excited to be starting to see the Transco system turn around and be able to deliver volumes to the south. And I can tell you, that's very much needed as we're seeing a lot of demand growth occur in the southeast on our system. We are seeing exciting spurt of growth in the Haynesville. In August, we placed into service additional CO2 treating capacity. And as a result of customer activity and our increased treating capacity, volumes on the Haynesville system grew to 1.45 Bcf a day here in late October, and we now expect to see volume growth of over 30% this year in the Haynesville, making it our fastest growing basin this year across the Williams assets. Also, as many of you know, we also recently won new acreage dedications from Southwestern in West Virginia, and we agreed to provide up to 660 MMcf a day of processing capacity. And by the end of the third quarter, we were already processing an incremental 100 MMcf a day of Marcellus wet gas from this new dedication. And with the addition of this 100 MMcf a day, the exit rate for our 3Q 2017 OVM processing was approximately 540 MMcf a day, and Southwestern is rapidly growing their wet Marcellus volumes on this dedicated acreage, and we're really thrilled to have the opportunity to help them maximize the value of this prolific acreage. We've got a great relationship with Southwestern and the teams are working very well to maximize the value of that acreage. We also enjoyed significant achievements that we expect to contribute adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter. The Transco New York Bay Expansion project was placed in service here on October 9, and this was the fourth of our five Transco planned expansion projects. Transco continue to push new expansion opportunities forward as well, receiving a favorable environmental assessment on the Gulf Connector Project and applying for a FERC certificate for Rivervale South to Market, a new fully contracted 190 MMcf a day Transco expansion to New York and New Jersey markets. It's just another project that is supplying both power demand and replacing fuel oil with cleaner and more affordable natural gas in that region. And now let's look at what's coming soon. Our commitment to continued growth is highlighted on this slide. Again, Virginia Southside II is our fifth Transco expansion project this year, and so we're really excited to see that conclude and looking forward to that coming on some time here in the fourth quarter. We placed Phase 1 of the Garden State Project in service in September as well. That's kind of a little bit of a bonus project on top of the five, and we will be placing that full project into service in the second quarter of next year. So that project is going well too. We briefly touched on our Southeastern Trail Project last quarter. We were pleased with the results of a successful binding open season. However, we are pursuing an even more strategic opportunity that will serve those open season customers and provide a strategic expansion that will serve the broader industry with direct connection of low-cost reserves to these growing demand centers. So we certainly heard from the market that they needed the additional supplies, and we're trying to utilize that demand to make even more strategic expansions. So certainly not going to step over the top of the great opportunity we have there, but we are taking our time here to make sure that we make the very most we can out of that very valuable southbound expansion capacity on Transco. In the Northeast, our big Susquehanna Supply Hub expansion remains on schedule, with an expected in-service date in late 2017. This expansion done for Cabot should drive higher volumes in Susquehanna, even ahead of the Atlantic Sunrise project. And this area just keeps on delivering growth, and we are already planning the next big expansion for this area. In Wyoming, we were able to bring more volumes on to our Wamsutter system after placing our Chain Lake compressor station into service in October. And this is another project that was done on-time, and actually this one under budget to meet the growing demand of a key customer there in the Washakie Basin. And we're already exploring additional expansion opportunities for Chain Lake with two other customers in the region, and this is really an interesting area where we're seeing an emerging new play be developed in an old field in that area that was originally completed with vertical completions and a real opportunity up there now for horizontal application to that area. With regard to guidance, our guidance for 2017 EBITDA and DCF remains firm, as does our previous distribution and dividend growth rate. We plan to announce our 2018 financial guidance with our fourth quarter 2017 financial results, and of course that will be in the first part of 2018. So as I wrap up, I'd emphasize we're pleased with the execution and our clear line of sight on long-term steady growth. After substantially reducing our direct exposure to commodities, our current business' steady growth is being driven by consistent fee-based revenue growth via long-term contracts, and we expect 2018 and 2019 to be exciting years as we finally see the bottlenecks in the Northeast clear to let the value of our long-term strategy be realized both in the Northeast and on our Atlantic-Gulf systems. So really pleased with the way things are looking right now in that area. And then finally I want to, again, thank Don Chappel for his great work at Williams and I wish him well in retirement, and I welcome John Chandler to this call as our CFO. And with that, I thank you very much and we'll turn it over for questions.
Operator: And our first question comes from Jean Salisbury with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning. The deal with Southwestern was much more incremental volume in that area than what I had originally modeled. Without getting into too much customer details, can you speak to whether you expect tariffs on that contract to be generally in the range of your existing tariffs there or if you had to take a material reduction to get the deal done?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Good question, Jean. I would tell you that the pricing on that was pretty similar to our earlier pricing. I think the area that we did provide some incentive on was for the Utica volumes. But we do have a great service offer up there and we certainly offered that because we have existing capacity there with OVM. So I would just tell you we're very pleased with the pricing on that and provides us a very high incremental return in that area. Having said that, of course we've invested a lot of money in the first place up there so you would expect those higher returns. So overall, I think we priced it about like we expected. It's just that we've got so much latent capacity to use there, that we've got a big incremental initial cash flows that come off of that business as a result of the available capacity we have in the area.
Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: That makes sense. So in terms of the EBITDA per Mcf range, it's sort of similar to what you had said at the Analyst Day?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yes. No change. That is a positive impact of what we showed there at Analyst Day.
Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great, and that makes sense. And then as a follow-up. I know you probably can't comment too much more on Southeastern Trail. But is the way to think about it, that you have enough commitments for the low end of your volume options on the project and in what you're working on, is incremental volumes that maybe would go further on the system as well?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Maybe another way to think about it, I would just say we have a very attractive project that just utilizes the capacity on the system, and one that certainly rivals any other project that we have on the system from a return standpoint. But we really want to make sure, because there's very limited amount of that very precious capacity coming south, and the more capacity we do the more expensive it gets, and so it's kind of a reverse economies of scale on that just because it requires more and more capital investment as we expand that capacity. And so we want to make sure that we're getting everything we can out of that investment, including strategic benefits that would include connections to low-cost reserves. And so a great work by the team. We're really working well with a number of players on that. I would tell you I'm pretty optimistic, but the good news is we have the Southeastern Trail project if we choose to go forward with that. That is in hand and we're prepared to do that if we can't get the other deals done on a timely enough basis.
Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. That makes sense. So if you choose to do a larger volume project that would have higher costs, that you need to charge the same tariff to everyone, is that the balance that you're working on?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: No. It's a little more complex than that, but that's probably about as far as I want to go with it.
Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. No, it's fair. Thanks a lot. That's all for me.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Good morning.
Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Don, good luck in retirement. John, welcome aboard.
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thank you.
Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I wanted to start off with the O&M. It seems like there was a bit of an uptick this quarter in the Northeast and in the Atlantic. And I just wanted to see if there was anything to this, if this is one-time in nature or seasonal or is this kind of a new run rate. Any color you can share there?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Let me turn that to our COO, Michael Dunn.
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. First in the Northeast, a part of that was the true-up of a tax issue, and so I wouldn't say that that was obviously a run rate issue. But the majority of that Northeast was a portion of that as well as some additional work that we were doing for landslide mitigation that's not typical, and that's pretty lumpy work depending on when we see something we need to go out there and fix. So that's really what drove the issues in the Northeast. On the Atlantic-Gulf, and specifically on Transco, Alan touched on that earlier in his comment in regard to our integrity work that's underway there, and typically we see those costs every year rise in the third quarter because that's our opportunity to get the work done. And like a lot of our peers in the industry as well as our customer companies, there's a lot of integrity work underway across the U.S. on the natural gas infrastructure, and a lot of that's driven by either the regulations or the records reviews that a lot of companies are doing. And once you find issues within your records, and a lot of these pipes are quite old, and when you research those records you find that maybe you need to go out and do some hydro tests at some areas where you're not certain of the records covering the entire area where it was originally hydro tested. And so we've taken on a lot of that work this year and we would expect to see more of that work next year as we continue to go through those records as well as just our ongoing integrity management programs that we're undertaking across the assets. And that's really what we're seeing on the Transco system. I would say that quarter three is typically our higher quarter for spend, and you certainly can't extrapolate that across four quarters of a year to come up with an annualized number. It's pretty difficult if you look at our history, higher than third quarter.
Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: That's helpful. Thanks for that. And I just wanted to touch base on the Central Penn Line a little bit more. And any more thoughts or details you can provide around timing and if that could be something that comes online sooner or later or just any other details as far as that kind of mid-2018 in service I think you've talked about.
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. We're really pleased right now that we've started construction on the Central Penn Line, which is the key greenfield infrastructure for Atlantic Sunrise, and we are targeting at mid-2018 for completion of the work on that pipeline as well as our compressor stations. And I will tell you that obviously weather is a big factor there with the winter construction for the pipeline and compressor station, but we're off to a good start so far and we're still targeting, as far as our project teams are concerned, a mid-2018 in service date for the completion of the work. And then we'll be commissioning activities that occur after the mechanical completion of pipelines as well as the compressor stations. So as you are probably well aware, we typically risk-adjust the revenues that you would see coming through in our forecast. But right now, we're marching forward for a mid-2018 in service date for the facilities that we have underway right now.
Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: That's helpful. Thanks. And then just one last one. I was curious on your thoughts in what you're seeing with Northeast basis differentials and specifically some of the commentary we've been hearing from some of the producers regarding a potential volume curtailment given these tough differentials. Any thoughts you could share there?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. We certainly did see some degree of curtailment like we often do during the shoulder months, and prices certainly were very depressed because there was very little local load. So if you think about what drives the volumes inside the circle, if you will, or within that region, the weather pattern was very mild there, and so very little local load there this third quarter which will obviously put a lot of pressure on basis. I think in addition to that, we had a lot of people building up reserve and expecting Rover to be on schedule, on-time, and that's hard to plan for when it moved as dramatically back as it did. So you probably had a lot of capital investment ahead of that that was too late to turn it back. So we probably had a little more production, a little more gas-on-gas competition, without any real exit from the area, just kind of moved the circle out a little bit but not really in each market. And so I think that it's going to take some of the projects that Colombia has and then ultimately Atlantic Sunrise, and of course finally when Rover gets in the first quarter, gets out into some new markets, to really see that ease. However, we always see here in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, if we get some normalized weather, we will see the basis differential flatten out just because the local load will be coming on. And in addition to that, I would say we are seeing some new power plant load that'll be coming on next year. And so those are all positive things that are moving us forward towards better basis differential, but certainly the third quarter is pretty painful and we did see some volume shut-ins on our systems.
Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: That's all very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. First question is just coming back to the Atlantic Sunrise and the Central Penn Line now that you've gotten into construction a bit. I wonder if you can fine-tune your CapEx assumptions. We've thought of this as around $2.6 billion I think on a gross basis. Is that a good number for the project?
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. We still are holding at that number. We obviously keep some contingency within our project forecast to remedy any situations or issues that arise during construction. But we believe that's still a pretty good number.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. And then I know you're just starting to get this in service. But as you think about the 42-inch line I believe, is there an ability to increase the capacity beyond the 1.7 Bcf a day that you've put in there, and what are your thoughts on doing that as you see the demand to get out of the basin?
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: You know, as usual, we'll wait and see if there are enough demand for projects. We do have some other projects we're looking at as well, expanding out of the basin, and so I think it is a little bit to be determined. So if you think about other projects like Constitution, probably be determined, that'll probably be the next expansion. And so I think people would kind of wait and see on that. We also have another couple of other projects that we haven't provided any announcement on that we're working on, that could serve to get volumes out of the basin as well. So I'd say those probably go first and, as you know, we get the existing project we're working on built before we talk about expansions on another one, and so that's where we stand today. But in terms of its expandability, certainly physically there is expansion opportunity on the system.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. So that's helpful. And then I'd love a little bit more color please on the West. You mentioned the Haynesville really picking up and sounds like momentum into the fourth quarter. Is that the main driver of that 5% increase in volumes? And then how do we think about, call it, unit economics I guess if the Haynesville is where you're going to see an uptick as we move into 2018. Would that be positive or negative to your overall unit margins there?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Great question. I would say in the West that the Haynesville is probably just slightly above our average on unit margins against all of our other West gathering business. And so it's a very attractive basin for us to see growth, especially at the level it's been growing, so that's very positive. The other part of your question was other areas. I think we had five of our western areas that we saw sequential growth in, and so we are seeing some turnaround in some of those areas. I would say the areas that probably we would expect to see growth – have the most impact would probably be the Haynesville, the Eagle Ford, and the Wamsutter area, particularly as we get into 2018 on Wamsutter because there's a lot of activity going on in that basin that will turn that around as well. So but I think that's probably about the best explanation I can give you on that. So overall though, I think as we mentioned last quarter, we were seeing some of those areas bottom out and start to turn around, and that's exactly what happened.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Very helpful. I'll leave it at that. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Please go ahead.
Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Good morning. I just wanted to check on the Geismar supply contracts. It's a little bit tough to parse out through the financials. Should we look for that to start up kind of on July 6 with the commencement or the closing of the sale? And if so, can you guys quantify what the impact was there?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: I do not have that number for you. I think you can call Brett or John to get a little more detail on that. But you are correct, that that actual contract would've started there upon the sale of that asset. So, but bottom line, that plant is running well and we're serving with ethane volumes. Obviously a choppy quarter because of the hurricane, and we did have some impact on a couple of our pump stations on that system due to the hurricane. But overall, the relationship with NOVA is going very well and we're providing them a lot of ethane.
Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Got it. Okay. And I think you just alluded to kind of the 2018-plus outlook. But just in terms of the quarter-over-quarter step up on the processing side of things, was there a particular basin that really resulted in that, whether it's Niobrara, Piceance or was that more of a general uplift across the systems?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Well, yeah. You named two of the areas that saw some of that uplift. And as well as I mentioned, looking broader, OVM obviously saw a pretty good step up as well as the Southwestern volumes got added during the third quarter.
Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. So for the Western segment processing volumes, mostly those two in terms of Piceance...?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah, Piceance. We also saw WPX volumes in the San Juan Basin lift up a little bit as well. So we also saw some positive processing business from WPX as volumes raising in the San Juan Basin as well, so pretty well across the board. We saw a pretty good movement. Probably the one area that we didn't see much increase was in the Southwest Wyoming area, which is at our Opal facility.
Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Great. All right. Thanks for that. I think I'll leave it there.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Please go ahead.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning, guys.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Good morning.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: I was just wondering if we can sort of talk – I realize you haven't put out a 2018 guidance and so forth. But I was wondering if you can sort of talk about the board discussions with respect to returning capital to shareholders? You get to a point where your leverage gets in line to be able to do so. And I was wondering if you're looking at dividend increases at WMB or are you also considering potentially buybacks of WMB or even WPZ?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Let me have John Chandler take that, Shneur.
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: I think the answer is, yes. I mean, we obviously are generating today around $100 million of excess cash at WMB above our dividend. And as we look forward, we have about $300 million, I think, or $400 million on a revolver, so we'll continue to pay that down over the next several quarters. And then as we look towards our dividend growth in the future and the excess cash we'll have at the WMB level, I think our guidance is the same that we've given in the past that, yeah, we'll look towards buying in WPZ units, even perhaps co-investing in projects if those opportunities existed or buying in WMB or a dividend increase. With all of those things, I think are on the table. We haven't carved any of those out. We, of course, are watching tax code changes too, and we don't expect that to happen until quite a distance in the future as we think about dividend increases. So that would kind of, I think, control what we did on the dividend front, but I don't think we've ruled out any of those options that you mentioned.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Cool. And then just as a quick follow-up question. Do you guys see an opportunity to expand Overland Pass either on a small scale with pumps or something much larger in scale?
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. There's a lot of new production coming on both in our Wamsutter area, in the Niobrara, both the Wyoming and DJ portion of the Niobrara, and of course the Bakken volumes that ONEOK gathers as well. So a lot of incremental demand for NGL capacity out of the area. And if you add to that an expectation of the ethane market and demand market growing, and expecting them to have to pull on ethane from these regions that today, while they have ethane recovery capability, there's not ethane takeaway capacity out of the area because the NGL lines are full. I think all of that leads to some expansion in the area, and certainly Overland Pass is very well-positioned to capture that expansion. So yes, a lot of activity going on on that front, and I think a lot of people are a bit surprised by the amount of volumes that are showing up coming out of these areas.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Really appreciate the color, guys.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, everyone. I actually just want to start with some clarification questions. In the West, all of the wet areas, with the exception of Opal, contributed to the increase in processing volumes?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Well, I think we were talking earlier – Christine, we were talking sequentially.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right, sequentially.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Let us provide some detail for you on that, Christine. I think the bottom line, we did see the Piceance pick up, we have seen the Niobrara picking up. And looking at kind of beginning of the quarter and to end of the quarter, the pretty dramatic increase in the Northeast as we mentioned. I realize your question is just to the West. But, really, I think the majority of the increases in the West were pretty moderate in terms of processing volume, and that's with the exception of the Southwest Wyoming area.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then with the compressor station coming on in Wyoming and the opportunities to work with two other producers as you mentioned during prepared remarks, should we think that the G&P volumes here, like in the Rockies area, is going to continue to increase or is it just going to maybe stabilize decline so that it's flat? How should we think about that?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Well if you're talking about overall West volumes, so maybe just narrowing it to the Wamsutter area, we certainly expect some increase going into 2018 there and, importantly, a lot of liquids volumes on both the condensate side, which we gather, as well as the gas and NGL side; there'll be quite a bit of growth there. If you broaden that question to the overall West, then I do think that we'll continue to see volume growth in the Haynesville even though we're going to get up on limitations of our capacity there pretty quickly in the Haynesville. We'll be looking for expansion opportunities on top of that. We're going to see the Eagle Ford continue to grow, and we are seeing growth in the Piceance as well and the Niobrara. Of course, that is offset by places like the Barnett and the Mid-Continent and, to a lesser degree, probably continued decline in the San Juan Basin as well. So I think that's the picture I would offer you there. But overall I mean, the Haynesville volume growth is very impressive. I wouldn't expect to see another 30% growth next year just because we're going to be so tapped out on capacity on our side, but we would expect growth from 2017 to 2018.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then I don't know if there's much more you could provide. But on the Southwestern deal, can you just give some background on how did that came together? Was that a little bit of a competitive process or did one of you approach the other? And can you give us an idea of how many more opportunities like that are still available?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Well we already have a very extensive relationship with Southwestern there because recall that was – a lot of that acreage was former Chesapeake acreage, and so we were already gathering a lot of that acreage but we weren't processing it. And so because recall Access didn't have a processing arm, and so that gas was gathered into competitors' processing systems. And so our relationship with Southwestern that we've been working on, where we reform contracts out there and made them much more attractive contracts than what they had under the former Access-Chesapeake arrangement that we announced earlier in the year, I would say started that relationship off on the right foot. We also provide services to Southwestern up in Northeastern Pennsylvania, and we've been very successful there helping them find excess capacity in that area as well. So I would tell you, our teams have worked really hard. They have a very dependable and reliable relationship with Southwestern, and I would say they form some contracts that are very aligned to both parties' interest. But it really spurred off of the fact that we had the opportunity to serve them and serve them well on the gathering side already is really what enabled that relationship to expand.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for that. And then just last question. Overland Pass. Can you remind us what the contract structure is there? Is that just based on a nomination basis?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: You mean in terms of who gets curtailed and who doesn't?
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right. I just couldn't remember, like, when you guys started up that pipeline, if it was underpinned by some, like, level of MVCs or is it...?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: No. It's a tariff contract, and so it has FERC tariffs on it. And it has discounted rates from the original dedications that both ONEOK and Williams enjoy. In terms of the way the capacity is allocated, it looks back to prior periods to establish your allocation. So basically build allocation capacity with your flow rates, and so whoever's been in it the longest with the most volumes and the longest has the capacity allocation.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: And the next question comes from Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks and good morning, everyone. Just a few follow-up questions to what has already been asked. First on Overland Pass, my recollection was that to expand that system you wouldn't really need pumps. It would be a loop of the pipeline because of how the pipeline is geographically located. Is that correct?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Generally, that is correct, Danilo. That's right. There's a little bit but there's very little available. It's running pretty full already.
Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Do you have a sense, Alan, for what the investment opportunities could be for an expansion?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: We haven't put that out there. And I would tell you, there's a variety of options that our teams are pursuing right now. But it's a sizable investment but we haven't put a number out there on that.
Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And to the extent that that would go forward here, you would still be able to self fund your pro rata share with that growth?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yes.
Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And as a follow-up, I guess an extension of that question. Financially, you seem to have a lot of optionality here. Shneur I think asked a question with respect to capital allocation. Beyond considering a dividend increase or buybacks, what are you guys thinking with respect to M&A?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: I would just say we've got such a great portfolio right now of high-return investment opportunities, that anything we do has got to compete with that. And so I think we've got our heads down very focused on developing the business that we do have. I would say that in areas like the Northeast, there is a lot of value in the consolidation of some of the joint ventures in the Northeast and we continue to look at that as we have for quite some time, I would say. And we continue to have a bid-ask spread between us and the various partners up there. But ultimately, I think that's something that we would certainly like to see happen but we're going to be very disciplined in what that CapEx investment is. But I'd say that that is very right in terms of that happening. You've got motivated sellers and certainly a lot of value in consolidation on our side, particularly in terms of the reduction of capital investment required to serve the growing volumes in the area.
Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you so much. Those are my questions.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thank you, Danilo.
Operator: And the next question comes from Eric Genco with Citi. Please go ahead.
Eric C. Genco - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Good morning. Just as a clarification. You talk about the buybacks and such, and you mentioned during your comments that you're generating enough cash, you don't see yourself needing to access the equity markets. I know that's been the case for 2017. Is that something you foresee continuing into 2018 and beyond or is that too much of a stretch for right now?
Eric C. Genco - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: No, that is exactly – and previously we've said for the next several years. But I can tell you, and looking at our long range planning, we don't see a need for that. So we think we've got a growth rate that's very sustainable with the combination of both retained capital and debt capacity while maintaining some strong credit mix. So feeling very good about the capitalization right now and continuing to fund the growth that we have in front of us.
Eric C. Genco - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. And if I think about spending in terms of next year, and I recognize you may not want to give too much detail, but we've got basically the remainder of Atlantic Sunrise, we may see a start up of some of the Northeast supply enhancement CapEx I would guess – that's another big project – and then you had talked in the Analyst Day slides about a potential $500 million of annual growth capital in the Northeast. With the agreement with Southwestern Energy, is that something in the $500 million range next year do you think? And how does that fall out? Is there a sense that you can give us as far as maybe a dip in CapEx or how that looks going into 2018?
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: We're not providing guidance on that. But I would just tell you what we provided at Analyst Day, both in terms of those continued opportunities as well as the opportunities in the Northeast, continue to be pretty in line with what we're seeing in terms of growth opportunities for the future, so kind of steady as she goes and no big surprises there. I will tell you that we're in a very nice position to be allocating to the very best capital opportunities, and we're maintaining very high returns as a result of that. And so we do have a whole lot of opportunities, but we're being pretty disciplined about what we're investing in.
Eric C. Genco - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And then I guess lastly, I guess in the timeline, and maybe this is just sort of a theoretical question, but you mentioned about next year and how you're thinking about tax reform and how that could impact some of your decisions. At some point, do you reach a point where you say okay, we can wait on Washington and see how they come out with tax reform or are there options at some point in terms of a timeline where you say we might want to take an action and we don't necessarily want to wait for full clarification from Washington on tax reform?
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: No. I think in all cases, using tax code today and the amount of capital spend that we've got, we've got a fairly long window still, a period that we don't view that we'll have cash taxes at WMB. So I think we've got a long period that we can kind of wait to see this unfold. So hopefully that answers – we're not motivated to do anything quickly on that front.
Eric C. Genco - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: And the next question comes from Shere Craig (sic) [Craig Shere] with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Good morning, Craig.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Alan, you've talked about a number of incremental growth opportunities kind of in line with Analyst Day. Are you still saying in total with what's already disclosed and what is kind of out there on the horizon and the aggregates of 7 times EBITDA multiple on all the pending projects out, say, through the end of the decade?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yes. I would say the returns that we've talked about on Transco, in that range, and as well the very high incremental return I'm always quick to point out in the Northeast because we can't forget about the capital we had to invest to get those opportunities. But that is continuing to be the case in these regions where we have very strong competitive advantages. So I don't really see that changing at all right now.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Great. And can you comment on the potential size and timing of additional West segment Wamsutter system expansion?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I would say the Chain Lake expansion that we did was relatively small; I think it was right around $50 million. And so I would tell you the plans are getting bigger out there for some of the players out there. Their appetites are getting pretty big, and so we're watching that very closely and we're beginning to plan alternatives with the producers out there in the area. So I do think there's going to be continued investments of probably that size and larger as we expand the facility. But remember, we have a very large condensate handling business there already that can handle a lot of that, but we also have a lot of latent capacity at our Wamsutter processing plant. So just like in the Northeast where we've got these higher incremental returns, we're enjoying the same kind of thing in the Northeast because we have that latent capacity sitting there at our Echo Springs processing complex.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: I know you all asked the FERC to kind of take some proactive steps on Constitution. Any updates there?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Continued great work by our team. Chad Zamarin, who has been heading up our efforts there with the federal agencies, has had some very productive meetings and continuing to push the ball forward on that. And so I would just say stay tuned. It's a pure upside to our plan, but we're encouraged by some of the commentary that we've got coming out of there. But still a relatively long put when you're having to fight a state as hard as we're going to have to fight that state to win that battle. So plenty of fight left in this dog and I think we're well-positioned for what we've got. We will have a fight I suspect.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: In terms of timing to see how some of these steps kind of unfold, are you thinking that by first quarter we could have more substantive detail?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yes, I think that's a realistic timing if not before to know kind of the next step there anyway.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Great. And last question. Can you speak to the impact across your system from the recognizing of extremely nominal direct commodity exposures? But there's been much stronger propane pricing and we're hearing word of ethane recovery just starting to kick in in the fourth quarter here. Can you speak to the impacts of those across your system?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Sure. On the propane pricing, I would say that we do have some pretty attractive hedges in place here for the fourth quarter, and we've got a little bit going into the first quarter, propanes and some of our heavies. So I think we've got pretty good margins coming through on that. But as you know, it's just gotten to be such a relatively small piece of our overall business, that's not all that big. On the ethane front, I think we have about 50,000 barrels a day that we could be recovering that is not unrecovered. But as I mentioned earlier, some of that is back behind pipelines that are constrained like Overland Pass. Some of it is not, however, in the Gulf Coast, and so we could see some pull through. In fact we are seeing some ethane recovery but I think the margin will just be as high as it needs to get to pull the ethane in until we see ethane get really short, which I think we could see, and then it's going to have to drive a margin high enough to pull in and build capacity on things like Overland Pass for those barrels. So I suspect that's going to take a little bit for the market to really realize it's going to have to pay up for that ethane before it comes on. So we'd expect some to and fro in the ethane market as it tries to grab more capacity or more productive capacity. So some exposure but I would say we've got hedges on kind of in the mid-80 range on propanes here in the fourth quarter that will dampen some of that dollar of propane that you've seen it spike up to here and there.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Great. And just a final follow-on to that. More fundamentally from a volumetric standpoint, subject of course to the debottlenecking process in the Northeast, are you starting to see increasing interest from producer customers in the wet gas Utica and Marcellus areas that could kind of feed that very long-term opportunity discussed at Analyst Day?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yes. I think the areas that we're seeing right now that's most focused on is the dry Marcellus, the dry Utica, and the wet Marcellus. But probably I would say in order of economics right now because of the NGL whip that you mentioned just a while ago, we're seeing a lot of push into the wet Marcellus right now. And of course, the dry Marcellus is just such a terrific resource up in the Northeast, that we're going to continue to see that area grab any kind of capacity it can just because the margins are so high on that. I would say the one area that we've seen pull back a little bit is the rich Utica or the wet Utica is the one area we've seen pull back a little bit relative to the other opportunities.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Great. Appreciate the color.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. Just a follow-up on I guess the Southwestern contract. It sounds like you're using existing infrastructure to meet that contract right now. But do you think there is a potential to add, I guess, additional processing or frac capacity to meet that contract as volumes ramp?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: I'm going have Michael Dunn take that one, Sharon.
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Good morning. At our Oak Grove facility, we currently have one TXP unit there and a portion of a second one that was built a while back, so we have latent capacity in the first one that will be filled and we do think that TXP-2 will be under construction sometime next year as well to handle that capacity. So there is some incremental CapEx there but a portion of that's already been spent with the portion that was already built, so I would see certainly some capital expenditures contributed to that effort. There's still capacity in some of our frac there, so I think we're okay for now on that in that regard, but certainly would expect to see some processing capacity expansion at Oak Grove next year.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And TXP-2, is that another 200 MMcf?
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Volume? Yes.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Great. And just for the quarter, it looks like Northeast's CapEx ramped up pretty significantly sequentially. Was there a specific project tied to that spending?
Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. That's primarily some of the work we're doing for Southwestern with the agreement we had earlier this year. But the majority of it is for the Genesis expansion up in Northeast Pennsylvania to support Cabot in regard to their production coming online next year. So we would expect that that ramps up obviously in the fourth quarter this year as well. Just finishing up that work. We've got a couple of compressor stations under construction there as well as some pipeline interconnects and pipeline systems being built to support that expansion.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Sharon.
Operator: And our next question comes from Alex Kania with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Alex S. Kania - Wolfe Research LLC: Hi. Good morning. I guess this question is in regard to the West and related to the asset impairment I guess for the 10-Q. There is some discussion on a potential sale of some kind of assets in that segment. I was just wondering if you could give a little bit more color on that?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: John, would you take that one?
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Sure. I don't think we'd contemplate selling anything right now. We were approached I guess I should say on some assets in that market that made us look at some type curves again and re-evaluate the value of those Mid-Con assets. One comment I do want to make in that the write-down was a $1 billion write-down, but our estimate of fair value has not changed materially quarter-to-quarter for those assets. Those assets were actually written up, the book value of those assets were written up back in the 2014 to 2015 timeframe when we acquired the Access assets. Got it at a very different pricing environment, and of course that's materially changed today. So actually, during the quarter our fair value estimates for these assets have changed very insignificantly. What has changed is the overall view of undiscounted cash flows, and they fell a little bit below our carrying value that the assets carried on for our books, which made us write them down to fair value. So I just want to make it clear. We don't have a change of view relative to the assets for the quarter that they changed by $1 billion.
Alex S. Kania - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay.
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: At the end (01:04:30) cash flow. It's just happen to fall below that book value during the quarter.
Alex S. Kania - Wolfe Research LLC: Great. That makes sense. Thanks.
John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we have no more questions at this time. I would like to turn the program back over to Alan.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks everybody for the great questions. Really excited to see the kind of top line growth we saw this quarter from our retained businesses and very excited about the growth opportunities that are in front of us right now, and look forward to a strong fourth quarter here as well as we continue to see the projects that we've been putting online continue to contribute. So thanks for joining us and have a good day.
Operator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at anytime.

Operator: Welcome to the Williams and Williams Partners Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John Porter: Thanks, Alicia. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily. Joining us today is our CFO, Don Chappel; and our Chief Operating Officer, Micheal Dunn. In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconciled with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials. So with that, I will turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong: Great. Well thank you, John and welcome everyone. I'm going to keep my remarks fairly brief this morning so we can move quickly to your questions. I'd like to start by thanking those of you who attended our recent Analyst Day event. It really was great to reengage with a lot of folks and to layout our solid plans for Williams in the course we've chartered to deliver on this low-risk, sustainable growth and a very focused and clear strategy that we continue to execute against. I was also pleased to introduce our new COO, Micheal Dunn, at Analyst Day. He's really hit the ground running and is making a big impact on our operations through his commitment to execution and accountability across the organization. Within Micheal's organization, we recently announced the appointment of Frank Ferazzi as Senior Vice President of Atlantic-Gulf. And Frank replaces Rory Miller, who announced his retirement earlier this year. And of course, Frank's previous role was running our Eastern Interstate. So we've got a nice continuity there of leadership in that area. More recently, we've added some - another key player to our leadership team. Chad Zamarin came onboard as Senior Vice President of Corporate Development in late June. And Chad joined us from Cheniere and is focused squarely on the opportunities and larger strategic initiatives that we can drive from an enterprise level. So really excited to have Chad join us here and his energy level and he's got a lot of wood to chop and he's getting right after it. So excited about the new energy we've got here at the senior leadership team. We're also pleased with our efforts to drive cost out of the business, continually improve our project execution and we've made some strides on further improving our operational safety metrics. On July 6, we completed the sale of Geismar to NOVA Chemicals. That sale, along with the sale of the Canadian assets last year, removed a significant amount of commodity risk from our business, as you're well aware. And we now stand at around 97% of our gross margins coming from predictable fee-based sources that are aligned with natural gas volumes. This move also allows us to streamline the support services around the organization, as we really have narrowed our lines of business and we continue to grow scale within these fewer lines of business. So a lot of opportunity that we're seeing to really get focused on the natural gas transmission gathering and processing side of the business and getting some of those business that were more ancillary to that really does allow us to narrow the services that we provide around the organization. We also - we did use a portion of the proceeds in the quarter to pay - sorry, just more recently here, to pay off our $850 million term loan. And of course further strengthening our balance sheet which we've made tremendous progress on here in the last 12 months. The team executing on the Geismar sale did a great job and I really want to recognize their tremendous efforts; really excited about the way that transaction was executed by our team. We're also crisply executing on our 2017 project commitments. You'll remember, we talked about our key 5 projects that are coming online in 2017. Of course, that was Gulf Trace, Hillabee Phase I, Dalton, New York Bay and the Virginia Southside II project. We're chipping away at all these important projects. As you know, Gulf Trace came into service in the first quarter. And Hillabee Phase I which provides all of the supply for Sabal Trail, came online in early July. And then just this week on August 1, the Dalton capacity was placed in service to serve northern Georgia markets from supply points at the northern end of Transco. So really an exciting project there in that we're really starting to now provide capacity moving for the northern end into these growing southeast markets. And so more of those to come. But really excited to see that project come along - come online. Our line of sight of the future growth is evident as we target the second half of '17. And the in-service dates coming up for Virginia Southside II, New York Bay and also, we'll get Garden State Phase I in this year as well, it looks like. So in summary, if you kind of think about the $1.4 billion roughly in projects that we were going to be placing in service - in full-service, about 20% of that came on in the first half of '17. And now another roughly 55% in this July/August time frame. And then of course, the balance of that will be in the second half of '17. So great job by our teams. That is a lot of work that's been going on to execute on that with plenty of resistance in a lot of these areas, but the team's doing a great job of executing in the face of that. So let's look at the results for the second quarter of '17 now. We met or exceeded our business performance expectations in all 3 remaining businesses. And although the results were somewhat offset by Geismar's continued outage and lower margins, in fact, the go-forward business which excludes the NGL & Petchem, was up 6.6% over 2Q of '16 on an adjusted EBITDA basis. As you probably know, we will not have any continued operations or assets to be reported in the NGL-Petchem sector other than what will come through in the 3 - third quarter here as we wrapped up the closing for Geismar in third quarter. So really, the go-forward, you'll see those 3 business units and just kind of the tailings of the NGL & Petchem business there. Looking at - looking first at our GAAP results. WPZ delivered $320 million in net income in the second quarter. And once again, we demonstrated the long term benefits of our strategy as we delivered year-over-year growth on our adjusted EBITDA measure for now the 15th consecutive quarter. So a very nice drum beat we've got going there and we've got confidence in being able to continue that for many quarters to come. WPZ's adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion was a $39 million increase over '16, primarily due to increased fee-based revenues and an increase in proportional EBITDA from joint ventures. Distributable cash flow for the quarter was $698 million which was down over the second quarter of '16, primarily from the planned removal of $58 million in noncash deferred revenue amortization associated with our fourth quarter 2016 contract, where we restructured the Barnett Shale and some of the Mid-Continent region business as well. This is nothing new. We mentioned this reduction on our last quarter's call as well. But just to remind you, that amortization is flowing through our EBITDA, but we remove it on the DCF. Importantly, the WPZ coverage for the quarter came in at 1.22 and this puts us at 1.27 for the year-to-date. The cash retained due to this healthy coverage supports further investment in our leading growth portfolio. So now we'll take a look at each of our segments. We'll start with the Atlantic-Gulf, where continued strong performance, coupled with expected growth for the balance of the year, gives us confidence we'll achieve our prior guidance on both adjusted EBITDA and DCF. And our adjusted EBITDA for Atlantic-Gulf came in at $462 million, an increase of around $94 million or almost 26% over the first quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by an $88 million higher fee-based revenues coming from increased volumes through our Gulfstar One due to the Gunflint tie-back which happened in the third quarter of last year and stronger volumes from Tubular Bells and of course other Transco expansions that just keep coming online and into service and the steady drumbeat of those projects. This really is another proof point of our ability to deliver predictable, sustained growth from markets along Transco and further demonstration of our leading position out in the Gulf. In the West, gathered volumes were up approximately 4% versus the first quarter of 2017 after we adjusted for the Marcellus for Permian transaction. So after taking the DBJV impact out of there, that gives you that 4%. The seasonal issues experienced in the first quarter this year have lifted and we continue to place a sharp focus on cost and operational discipline throughout our Western operations which now includes the central - what was previously the central area as well. For the quarter, our adjusted EBITDA came in at $372 million, down versus 2Q of '16, primarily due to the Barnett and Niobrara contract restructures; and the Niobrara, that contract restructure really just affected how we record revenues in the Niobrara and in the DBJV sale and our lower volumes in that area. The declines were partially offset by a $14 million reduction in O&M and SG&A expenses. So really proud of the way the team continues to really push on the cost in the West. And now going over to Northeast G&P, where volumes increased in our Susquehanna and Ohio River Systems but declined on our rich Utica systems compared to 2Q '16. We talked last quarter about being at an inflection point on the Utica volume increases and we continue to expect a pick-up through the rest of the year. Specifically, we've seen pretty dramatic declines in the West - in the wet Utica, sorry, over the last 5 quarters, but expect the Chesapeake rigs to move back in and begin to offset previous declines later this year and into 2018. So quite a bit of movement going on within the Northeast and even within the Utica zone. But I'll remind you, relative to the wet Utica that while we have confidence in the wet Utica volumes coming back here as we're seeing the activity picking up. If they don't return, our fees would increase because those wet Utica volumes are under a cost-of-service agreement. And so, even though it's starting from a much smaller base, we have already seen strong and expected growth in the dry Utica. So remember, we have 2 basic systems there. We have the cardinal system that takes in the wet Utica volumes and then we have what we call - refer to as our flint system; that is the dry Utica. The dry Utica has been - has seen some really fast growth going on, but it's from a much smaller base. And - but the wet Utica has not had the benefits of any drilling for a long time. So it's pretty interesting to watch, in these basins, where in some areas we're still enjoying DUCs. And in an area like the wet Utica, we're really seeing what the raw decline really would look like. And I would tell you, I think that is an interesting macro picture for people to pay attention to. It's also important to remember that infrastructure constraints continue to limit the Northeast volume growth. And certainly, we're anxious to see a lot of these big projects come on, because we really think that's going to unlock a tremendous amount of growth. But we do see here in the third quarter, we've seen some pretty soft pricing in the third quarter. And certainly, that could have some short term impact and really cap the growth in our volumes here in the short term. But overall, for the second quarter, Northeast adjusted EBITDA increased $26 million compared to the same period last year. Increased Bradford ownership resulting from the DBJV sale primarily drove the increase, with Marcellus volume growth offset by rich volume declines we talked about earlier. Fee-based revenues remained relatively stable through the period. I'd also like to just comment, kind of a little more forward-looking on this. Our teams are having great success on the commercial front which I would tell you is following from a great operational performance in terms of reliability in the Northeast. And we're really excited to see what the next 12 months holds for this area. That is poised to grow rapidly. And I would tell you, it's looking like we may be able to pick up more than our market share of that growth as we look forward, given the great performance by our teams up there. As we go now to NGL & Petchem Services. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was affected by the unplanned downtime at Geismar in the March to April timeframe. We discussed on last quarter's call as well as a modest reduction in per-unit margins due to price movements on those products there. The Geismar transaction, as I mentioned, closed on July 6. So there's no gain on the sale in this quarter's result. But we expect a $1.1 billion gain to be recorded in the third quarter. So now let's move on to the next slide and take a quick look at our year-to-date results. We delivered GAAP net income of $954 million with adjusted EBITDA of over $2.2 billion, up about 4.5% compared to the same period in 2016. The year-to-date 2017 segment results generally reflect the same drivers we saw in the second quarter. The only exceptions - primary exceptions I would point out there is the typical seasonal issues that we see on big systems like Transco, where we have short term firm that we sell as well as interruptible volumes that flow on those system, relatively small compared to Transco, but we do see some fluctuation there. That is very typical and you can go back and look at any quarters - previous first quarter and second quarter and you'll see that movement. And also, our West volumes which we were pleased to see rebound from the first quarter after some freeze-offs in the Western operations. Coverage at WPZ came in at 1.27 on the back of 1.45 billion in DCF. And this solid coverage which excludes the $116 million revenue amortization, continues to grow and provide solid coverage that we can reinvest. So now let's look at some of our executional highlights for the second quarter. I've already touched on the first couple of projects here. And obviously, the Geismar sale was significant. But another area I'd like to emphasize is our growth in the Gulf. It's important to remember the strong competitive position of Atlantic-Gulf's offshore assets which really showed up here in the second quarter and some new volumes and some new business that we contracted that came on. And we continue to make progress on Atlantic Sunrise, where construction continues on the mainline facilities and we will see early mainline service revenues this September. Assuming timely regulatory approvals, we expect to hit our target in-service date of mid-2018. And with respect to completing the entire project, the long lead item is the greenfield compressor station work. As we've discussed in the past, the majority of the takeaway capacity could be available once the pipeline is in service, even if the greenfield compression isn't in place. And so that's really going to be a big game changer in the area as we bring on these - what we refer to as the Central Penn Line in the area. And in fact, we're in the final phases of permitting for the Central Penn Line and - which is all in Pennsylvania. And our team continues to work cooperatively with PDEP, with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and other agencies. I would tell you, we've got a very good relationship there. And we have worked hard to meet their very stringent and careful requirements. I would tell you, PDEP's being extremely cautious, as you would expect, in the environment they're operating in. But we found them to be very professional and diligent in their efforts. For all of our projects and operations, we try to differentiate Williams from our competitors in the way we listen to our landowners and the public and work hard to understand their concerns as well as the regulators. And we think over time, this trust that we continue to build pays dividends as our pipelines are going to be there for a very long time and we understand that and we go into it with that attitude. In fact, we just finished a public comment period in a round of public hearings for Atlantic Sunrise in Pennsylvania, in which a tremendous number of people stood up to support our project, including people from labor unions, business, manufacturing as well as local elected officials. To be sure, there is some opposition to the project, as you've picked up in the media. But we know the majority of Pennsylvanians understand how important natural gas takeaway capacity is to the future of the common welfare. In addition to our project - or progress on Atlantic Sunrise in 2017 Transco projects, as we've discussed, our Northeast Supply Enhancement project is progressing as expected as well. And in the West, we expect to place two gathering expansions in service for this year at the Wamsutter and Haynesville spaces. So nice example of high incremental returns in those areas where we've got a very strong presence already. And so nice to see some increased volumes to be coming on in those areas. Our Northeast G&P team is also working hard to place expansions in service by year end that will allow Cabot to meet its commitment to Atlantic Sunrise and other new takeaway arrangements that they have reported on. So as I wrap up, I'd emphasize, we're pleased with where we're here in mid-2017. And especially on our project execution, our solid performance and focus on execution this year positions us very well going into '18. And especially with the high incremental return projects we have coming down the pipe, in both the Northeast and now the Haynesville and Wamsutter Fields, we're able to fund our growth within a very comfortable credit metric along with our retained cash flow. Though in general, I would tell you, the U.S. really has a tremendous competitive advantage because of our abundant low-cost natural gas supply. Williams' advantaged position between these abundant supplies and growing natural gas demand is continuing to deliver tremendous growth prospects with better-than-industry-average returns. Our employees across the country are very passionate about driving value and building Williams for the future and doing it the right way. And on a personal note, I'm really pleased with the significant contributions of our new leaders and - are making here, as we continue creating low-risk, predictable growth for our shareholders. So with that, I thank you and we'll turn it over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll go first to Jean Salisbury of Bernstein.
Jean Salisbury: Can just remind us of the major permits to watch for, for Atlantic Sunrise to be on time for Phase 1 and Phase 2?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, sure. I'll have Micheal Dunn take that for you.
Micheal Dunn: Good morning. Right now, we're looking at 3 primary permits to finalize the permitting process. One is the 404 permit that the Corps of Engineers is processing. And the other 2 are from PDEP or for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. Those are 102, 105 permits as they're designated. All of these are water-related type permits and we've obviously finished all the public comment periods for all of these. And we do expect these permits to be in-hand in August and that would allow us to start construction certainly thereafter. So what will happen after we received those permits is, we would go back to the FERC and ask for a notice to proceed. And at that point, we would be able to begin construction on the project.
Jean Salisbury: Okay. And that's kind of a 1-for-1 delay, I guess. So if that gets delayed by 2 weeks, then construction start would get delayed by 2 weeks, basically?
Micheal Dunn: Well, yes. It would be a day-for-day delay. But we're pretty optimistic we're going to receive those permits here in the month of August. And FERC has been pretty generous in turning around notice to proceed requests for the industry fairly quickly. So we would expect to be able to start construction shortly thereafter.
Jean Salisbury: Great. And then, as a follow-up. As I'm sure you're aware, there have been a lot of rigs added in the Haynesville since the beginning of the year which should lead to volumes in the back half. You now get fixed fee on that, right? I'm wondering if the ramp has been more than what you expected in your guidance and kind of more than the minimum that you agreed with Chesapeake a couple years ago?
Alan Armstrong: They're a little bit ahead. But part of that obligations they had was a certain number of wells turn in line. I would say what's been surprising to us is not the number but really the performance that they've had on those wells, that they've continued to do better and better on. We do have a new piece of capacity coming on, on what's called our Springridge system. And so that'll add about 150 million a day of capacity. And it is needed, because there are volumes stacking up behind that. So we're excited to be turning that on here in the very near future. And that will unleash some volumes in that area. So yes, we're enjoying growth there and excited to see some of the well performance in that area.
Operator: We'll go next to Ted Durbin of Goldman Sachs.
Theodore Durbin: I appreciate the update on Southeastern Trail. I just wonder if you can give a little more sense of how much capacity you're marketing there, the type of capital you might be deploying, what kind of returns you're looking at on that project, please?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I would say, still yet to be determined. As we've reported in the past, we got some very valuable capacity there, a lot of demand for it from the market. And we want to make sure that we get the very best investments around that. So I would say, we remain excited. We haven't pinned that down. We do have a binding open season that's going to be closing here as we speak. But we're going to make sure that we get the absolute optimum value out of that, because that capacity southbound - that incremental capacity southbound within our main line or brownfield, if you will, is extremely valuable. And we want to make sure we get whatever other strategic benefits might come with that. And so that's what we're working on. So I would say, very optimistic there. But remain - we're going to be patient in making sure that we get the very best alternatives out of that last easy expansion that we have coming south there.
Theodore Durbin: Okay, that's helpful. And then, you saw an uptick in the West. Maybe I just missed the comments on your gathering volumes, sort of second quarter versus first quarter. I was wondering if you can give us a little more sense of the drivers there that are sort of offsetting what has been more of a declining area than a growing area?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, sure. Mostly I would tell you it was just recovery from some of the production and freeze-offs in general. But for instance, in the Barnett, we're starting to see and this is more recent, but we're starting to see Total. Remember, they had a roughly $40 million a year obligation for drilling dollars in the area. There were kind of late to get started on that just because they had a lot of issues to deal with as they took over as operator. But I'd say, they're really starting to get after that and we're starting to see some improvement from their investments there. So typically, Barnett has been a pretty heavy decline area and we're starting to see that be arrested. Mike, I don't know what other comments you might think to...
Micheal Dunn: Well, I would say, across the board, there were improvements in most of those franchise areas in the West, pretty significant in Eagle Ford, Haynesville and also the Southwest Wyoming. So we recovered from the problems we had, obviously, in Southwest Wyoming over the winter and saw a pretty good uptick there.
Operator: We'll go next to Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan.
Charles Barber: This is Charlie on for Jeremy. Just one clarification on the Petchem segment. So there will be just that first week that Geismar was still technically - before it was finally sold in that first week of July? And then, the RGB Splitter, that was sold, is that correct?
Alan Armstrong: That is correct. I think that closed June 30, so that won't even be in the third quarter.
Charles Barber: Okay, great. And then, just the maintenance CapEx. Obviously below the guidance. Just trying to understand on kind of cadence for 3Q and 4Q, similar step up that we saw in 1Q and 2Q, to kind of hit? Or is there - I mean, any reason why you would come in below that $500 million guidance?
Alan Armstrong: Well, I would say, we have a lot of work to do and it's somewhat dependent on our ability to get to that. But we'll be pushing hard to get that done. And so, I think, probably the best pattern probably to look at is previous year's patterns. I think, that's probably a pretty good indicator of the cadence that we have that's driven by both weather and loads on our systems. Said another way, we're - we have so much load on our systems typically that we have to be careful when we take them off line to be able to do the work. So those patterns are pretty well fixed and really wouldn't expect anything very different in terms of percentage per quarter that we're spending in there. So I'd say, it's probably the best guidepost to look at.
Donald Chappel: This is Don Chappel. Just to clarify on NGL-Petchem. You'll see, I think, as Alan mentioned, 6 days of operations at Geismar. You'll see the expected gain on the sale that we disclosed, an estimate of $1.1 billion. And then you'll see any other, I'll call it, miscellaneous cleanup kind of changes in reserves, things like that, that relate to that segment that'll dribble in a bit over time. But really, from an operating standpoint, it's really only 6 days of operation of Geismar. The gain on sale and then just, I'll call it, a dribbling, if you will, of any other adjustments or costs or revenues that might dribble through there.
Charles Barber: Great. And then, just real quick, lastly. The - during the Analyst Day, you mentioned, within the Atlantic-Gulf segment, the couple of projects that were in negotiations. Just any update there? I believe there was one that you touched on earlier. But I just - curious on the remainder of those.
Alan Armstrong: Yes, we're not quite ready to announce anything on those. So lots of expansion work going on. But - or development work going on. But I'd say, on the Transco system, it's pretty complex right now. A lot of opportunities that we're pursuing, but coupled with Southeastern Trail, there's - we're having to, again, as I mentioned earlier, we're really trying to make sure we're optimizing, because we understand how valuable these tranches of capacity are.
Operator: We'll go next to Colton Bean of Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Co.
Colton Bean: I appreciate the comments on Atlantic Sunrise and that there's still a few moving pieces to nail down there. But I think on Q1, you kind of referenced the variance in CapEx guidance as largely attributable to Sunrise timing. So then, maybe a better sense of how that progresses through the back half of the year. Can you guys refine that range at all?
Alan Armstrong: Well, I would say, we're probably, given kind of where the timing's working out, we'll probably wind up closer to midpoint of that rather than the low end or the high end of it. Because we're - the high end would've had us already under major construction. And the midpoint is about kind of what we're expecting and it looks like that's going to come out. So I would say, kind of the midpoint is probably a pretty good indicator right now.
Colton Bean: Okay. And then, on the West segment, so you mentioned the reversal of freeze-offs on the gathering side. We didn't necessarily see that for processing, so is there also a bit of a mix shift going on there in terms of rebounding volumes on the dry gas basins and maybe more of a flatter trajectory for rich gas?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, yes. We did have some shifts in the - at our Opal facility there. We had Ultra, where we reformed the contracts there. And then, on LINN Energy, they rejected a contract that we had. That also showed up in the first quarter. But they rejected a contract that we had out there. We're looking at being able to pick up some volumes in the area. But that really was a change, though. So one shifting from fee to commodity risk and the other was we actually lost the volumes there at the end of the fourth quarter.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll go next to Timm Schneider of Evercore.
Timm Schneider: My question, I guess, is a bit more longer term strategic. Specifically, if I look at your business model, right, you have, obviously, the natural gas pipelines which are, I'd say, best in breed; then you have the Gulf of Mexico and Rockies or West Gathering and Processing. As you look at your gross CapEx portfolio, I mean, the majority of that is centered around Transco. But kind of, over the next - and it's not near term, but over the next 3, 4, 5 years, what's beyond Transco? Or do you actually think Transco's going to be the pillar going forward here as well? Or is there other things that you guys are looking at in the portfolio? Basically, it's kind of like, everybody looks at Williams in the context of, "Hey, maybe they're a takeout target." I'm kind of thinking of it the other way around. Is there anything that you guys are interested in?
Alan Armstrong: Timm, thanks for the question. I would just say, we're very excited about the strategy that we have and opportunities that are coming along. We're really working to be the best operator in this space, in this strategy. And I would say, we're working extremely hard as a team to not just be good in the space, but great. And we think, as we continue to execute over time that, that's going to open up opportunities for us to continue to expand in our strategy. But I would say, it is blocking and tackling first and we remain extremely focused on that. And we have so much opportunity, as you mentioned, we have so much opportunity here that's right in front of us that we're really narrowing our focus on delivering on that. But certainly, we're paying attention to long term trends and where we need to be next. And I think, we've always done a good job strategically of positioning ourselves in the right place and we'll continue to do that. So - but I would say, there's a pretty intense focus right now on delivering what we have, because there's so much value to be created just delivering on what's right in front of us right now.
Micheal Dunn: Timm, I would add, if you go back to our Analyst Day, we talked a lot about the Northeast, where we have an opportunity to increase our revenues up there fairly significantly with less capital infusion into that, just because of the backbone systems that we've already built up in that area up there. So that's one of the areas that we talked about a lot at Analyst Day that we have great opportunities going forward.
Timm Schneider: Got it. And I guess, let me ask one follow-up on that. And I know the focus really has been - and you guys have done a tremendous job on this, kind of shifting toward - at the Mantle, that fee or that take-or-pay business model on the gas pipeline side. But would you be categorically opposed to looking at gathering and processing assets, if they have the right structure, right? So it's not commodity price exposure, maybe more fee-based, minimum volume commitments, stuff like that?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, no. We're not at all opposed if it's the right risk-adjusted return. We think we're very good in that space and we think we're a good operator in that space and have a lot of talents and capabilities. So yes, we'll certainly continue there. I would say that, even within the gathering and processing space in particular, it gets pretty hard to match the quality of our cash flows given our contracts and the growth opportunity that we have around some of our business. And so, I would tell you, anytime we're going to look at anything, it's going to be a mix of quality of cash flows. We've got a pretty highbrow mix of cash flows that I think's pretty hard to compete with, both in the current and in the forward-looking.
Timm Schneider: Got it. And lastly, I mean, if I look at your geographic footprint, are you guys kind of happy with the basins you're in right now? Or is there anything else that you'd like to be in? And obviously, there I'm kind of hinting at - you guys don't really have - you guys sold some stuff in the Permian. No scale there. Is - did we kind of - is it too late to get in there at this point in a big way? Or is there still some opportunities, if they were available?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, I would just say, first of all, we do have some pretty significant acreage dedication in the Permian that we think could be significant as the play develops. But as we've mentioned, we really don't have all of the vertical integration that a lot of the big players have in there. And frankly, we're not - we don't - we're not interested in paying the kind of multiples that have been getting paid to get in there, because you're not just betting - I mean, there's no upside left when you pay those kind of multiples. And so, I would say, we've seen that as pretty pricey. But we certainly are taking a look at it as it could impact gas volumes. We have a lot to offer being the Transco system and being able to distribute those volumes to market. And so we'll continue to keep an eye on any opportunity there and certainly see both the Mexico markets and the LNG markets along the Gulf Coast as something that we're well-positioned to serve and - however we can use our assets to gain competitive advantage towards those alternatives, we're certainly going to be having an eye to. But I would just say, I - there's a lot of well-hill players in that basin. And I think, our - the question we have is, how do we use our skill sets to help take care of some of those volumes. But I think, going head-to-head on the gathering and processing - upstream gathering and processing out there is - looks pretty pricey right now.
Operator: We'll go next to Craig Shere of Tuohy Brothers.
Craig Shere: Just looking for a little more color around what governs the potential time gap between the greenfield Central Penn Line for Atlantic Sunrise being in service and the compressor station? And if I recall from Analyst Day, the pickup, when you - the month of revenue pickup when the compressor's online is about $11 million a month. Is that correct?
Alan Armstrong: I'm going to turn that to Micheal Dunn here.
Phillip Wright: So let's start with what we hope to put in service this fall with some main line facilities that we have underway right now. So we would expect to start seeing some revenue you heard Alan talk about earlier from that, in the September time frame. And that's really reversals of our compressor stations on the Transco main line as well as one greenfield - sorry, one brownfield compressor addition at one of our existing stations. That does not get us capacity all the way back into the Northeast PA basin, though. So what we would anticipate, once we get the Central Penn Line completed and that would be about 2 months or so ahead of the greenfield compression in the Central Penn Line. So we would have 2 months there of about 1.2 Bcf a day of capacity that would come out of the basin there that would certainly create an outlet for our customers up there. And then ultimately, the compression coming on line puts us at about 1.7 Bcf a day. So assuming that we get a construction start date this fall, we think it's about a 10-month construction for the entire project. Optimistically, we could get the pipelines in service a few months before that on the greenfield and be able to put about 1.2 Bcf a day in service on that project.
Craig Shere: Okay. So it's really just logistics and construction? There isn't a separate regulatory permitting issue related to the compression?
Micheal Dunn: No. No, there's not. I mean, ultimately, we go to FERC in a few weeks once we get the 102 and 105 permits from Pennsylvania, the 404 for the Corps. We asked for a notice to proceed for the entire project. It's just the timing of the schedule, it just takes longer to build a greenfield compressor stations than it does the greenfield pipeline.
Craig Shere: Understood. And then, any more color around what's going on at Constitution?
Alan Armstrong: I would just say, we continue to expect something coming out of the Second Circuit there. But I would tell you, we were very encouraged by the D.C. circuit ruling on Millennium. And then, basically telling the - that the New York DC had waived and that they should go to the FERC for their permit. That was very instructive, I would say, relative to Constitution. And so we're excited about that. We continue to work with the staff in the White House to move things along, because we think they have the rights to move things along on that project. So it remains a two-pronged approach. But I would tell you that the last month or so here has been encouraging in terms of how the court ruled on the Millennium project and the attention that that's gotten in - within the White House staff. So anyway, just continuing to push on that. Nothing moves very fast on that front. But continue to be encouraged by what we're seeing there.
Craig Shere: Could you still see potential favorable 2017 announcements?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, my patience has been strained, obviously, as long as we've been pushing on that. But yes, I would expect to see some action here in '17 still. So I feel pretty good. Now we've got a lot of work to do to then get the system installed and get through all of the very final permitting issues. But remember, we already have our certificate from FERC from that. And so, I think, the political environment is ripe and I think we either get some help from the courts which there's some probability, but it's a little bit unusual for a court to overrule an agency like that. But we think we've got a very good case in that regard. But I'd probably say, I'm more optimistic about the pathway through both the core and the FERC to gain approval with the White House's assistance on that.
Craig Shere: Great. And last question, Don, I just want to confirm for the third quarter, there's going to be no cash tax drag relating to that Geismar sale up at the C Corp, is that correct?
Donald Chappel: Craig, we do not expect a cash tax drag related to the Geismar sale. There could be a modest amount, but right now, it's expected to be 0 or a very modest amount.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Christine Cho with Barclays.
Christine Cho: I just have one question. We've seen some consolidation among producers in the Northeast. It's pretty fragmented up there. So I'm sure we'll continue to see some consolidation as well as acreage changing hands. There's also a whole bunch of producer-sponsored MLPs on the gathering side. Are you seeing any initial signs of any of these guys wanting to monetize? And then, separately, what do we - what do you think we need to see for the opportunity for some of your partners wanting to get out of the JVs they're in with you on? Are we waiting for pipeline capacity on the gas and NGL side to come on? Or is there any other gating items that we should be aware about?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, Christine, good morning and thanks for the good question. Yes, I think the consolidation is well underway. I think that EQT and Sclotterbeck really, I think, onto a path that's important in terms of being a low-cost manufacturer in the basin and they certainly have, with the Rice transaction, would have a tremendous position up there. And I think, we'll continue to see that, where people are really focused on those areas, on the one hand. On the other hand, I would tell you, in some areas, there's just so much remaining drilling locations. For instance, for companies like Cabot, they just have so many remaining locations within the large acreage position they do have that they've got plenty of scale to execute at a low cost in the area. So I guess, I would say, I do think we'll continue to see consolidation, but maybe for varying reasons up there. On the Midstream side, I do think that we'll continue to see consolidation as well. As you point out rightly, there's a lot of private equity that's had money up there and it's probably getting a little stale and a little ripe, because they've been in those positions for quite a while. And typically, the way they're rewarded is, the management teams have them anxious to get out at some point in time and it's certainly usually inside of 5 years. So I do think, there's going to be some pressure up there. But I think, there's probably just deltas and bid-ask right now between people's expectations and what the market might allow for. And I'd say, we're just in the process of seeing those bid-ask spreads close in on themselves. So that's kind of how we'd describe that. But I definitely think that we'll see some shift going on up there just like we always do in big, fast growing basins. There's a lot of people to start with and then, the big players tend to consolidate because they've got the right scale, they've got the right cost structure and they've got the right market outlets. And those tend to drive the volumes to those systems. So I think, we'll continue to see some pretty sizable consolidation here in the next 18 months in the Northeast.
Christine Cho: And as a follow-up, when I kind of think about the Northeast, obviously you talked about Cabot. Your gathering should benefit when Atlantic Sunrise comes on. In Southwest PA, do you think the bigger bottleneck is gas pipeline capacity that needs to come on for you guys to see your volumes increase? Or do you think it's more NGL takeaway, like Mariner East?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, the NGL takeaway issue is more an issue of price, right? Because you can clear your barrels. It's a matter of what you get for them by getting them out of there. Versus on the gas side, it's an absolute issue because there's no alternative other than the gas pipeline. But of course you have rail and trucking to get liquids out of there. So I do think the price improvement on NGLs will be welcome to the basin. And that could have some impact. But I clearly think, the biggest issue right now is on gas takeaway, because it's a point of diminishing return on the gas. If you turn any new gas on, not only does that gas get underpriced, you just put price pressure on the other gas that you have in the basin. And so it's a very constrained and finite point in terms of getting gas out of the basin. And so I think, to answer your question, I think gas is probably more important than the liquids.
Operator: We'll go next to Eric Genco, Citi.
Eric Genco: I was just wondering, on Constitution, I'm just trying to remember, if you were to get a Millennium-type decision, how long would it take to put the pipe into service? And can you remind us if there's some seasonal issues? And what type of barriers would be to starting construction and birds nesting, et cetera?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Mike, you want to take that?
Micheal Dunn: Yes. So right now, we would anticipate the earliest we can get that project in is early 2019, so probably second quarter 2019. And there are quite a few windows. But backing into an opportunity to get released this fall, that would put us in the first half of 2019. For an in-service date.
Eric Genco: Okay. And then, in terms of the cost savings in the West, it was pretty impressive. I just wanted to ask, where do you think you are in terms of like what inning? And if could you expand a little more there? And do you think there's more to come in that segment? Or maybe other areas? And just, how that's been going for you?
Micheal Dunn: I'm sorry. Could you repeat the question?
Alan Armstrong: Mike, the question was on cost savings in the West and whether we're - should expect to see a continuation of that improvement.
Micheal Dunn: Yes, thanks for that question. Our team's doing a great job out there taking cost out of their business. And I think, we will continue to seek those opportunities and find opportunities to continue to take costs, not just out of the West business, but the rest of the business where it makes sense. And there's still opportunities there. We have a lot of consolidation, for example, in our measurement systems that - where we had the legacy Access and the legacy Williams measurement systems, for example, that we're consolidating. And we'll be able to continue to take costs out of the business in that fashion. So there's opportunities just like that all across our business. And certainly in West, we'll continue to do that.
Eric Genco: That's great. And final one for me, I just wanted to ask if you've had any recent conversation with the rating agencies? Or if you have any plans to kind of, post the Geismar sale - I realize it was announced a while ago, but just didn't know what the schedule was there.
Micheal Dunn: We're in regular conversation with the agencies. So yes, we update our model and discussions with them and obviously that's a major milestone. So we'll continue those conversations. What they do with it, who knows. But we think our credit is improving steadily and we're hopeful that they'll agree.
Operator: That is all the time we have for questions. I would like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing comments.
Alan Armstrong: Okay. Well, great. Well, thank you. Very excited about the quarter and excited about how we're positioned here for the next 12 months and got a lot of exciting things ahead of us continuing to come on. So I appreciate your continued interest in the company and hope you have a great day. Thank you. Bye.
Operator: That does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Please standby, as we are about to begin. Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Williams, Williams Partners First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John Porter: Thanks, Amy. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily. Joining us today is our CFO, Don Chappel; and our Chief Operating Officer, Michael Dunn. We also have the leaders of our operating areas on as well. In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconcile with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation material. So with that, I will turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong: Great, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Glad you could join us today. And I plan to keep my remarks pretty brief today to allow as much time as possible for your individual questions and also recognizing we have our Analyst Day coming up next week on May 11 in New York City. The first quarter of 2017 demonstrated the resilience of our business as we continued to show meaningful growth and stayed on track for our 2017 guidance, despite the impact of some significant third-party outages and production freeze-offs in the Rockies. Our natural gas focused strategy continues to be on the mark as we differentiate ourselves by delivering consistent and sustainable growth on the back of low-cost natural gas demand. Overall, I'm pleased with this quarter's progress. So let's get started on Slide 2 and take a look here at the first quarter. Starting with WPZ's GAAP results, we saw a sharp increase in net income due to higher investing income on the Permian for Marcellus transaction that we completed in the first quarter. Apart from the increase due to this transaction, our ongoing business performed very well, generating an increase in operating income of $141 million compared to the first quarter of 2016. Moving now to adjusted EBITDA and DCF, WPZ's adjusted EBITDA grew over 5% compared to the first quarter of 2016. This marks 14 consecutive quarters that we generated year-over-year growth in this measure. We delivered $752 million in DCF for the quarter, which also was up over the first quarter of 2016 and provided a strong coverage ratio at Williams Partners of 1.33. And now let's take a look at how each of the segments did versus last year. First of all, the Atlantic-Gulf delivered another solid quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $48 million or almost 12% over the first quarter of 2016, now reaching up to $453 million for the quarter. There were a couple of third-party incidents on adjacent pipelines near Paradis, Louisiana, and Corpus Christi, Texas, that did impact our results, although there was no direct damage to our facilities from these incidents. Both events affected volumes on our Discovery and Markham systems, respectively. Atlantic-Gulf, despite this, Atlantic-Gulf increased fee-based revenues by about $43 million for the quarter, and this increase was primarily driven by new projects that we brought online in 2016. And our Gulf Trace project was put in service during the first quarter of 2017, so again, really another great quarter here for Atlantic-Gulf. Let's move on to the West, which now includes the predictable Northwest Pipeline system and existing Rockies G&P assets to which we've now added the Conway and Overland Pass Pipeline, as well as large-scale gathering systems previously located within our Central Operating Area. The broad-based portfolio underpinning the West, along with a sharp focus on cost control, delivered stable first quarter adjusted EBITDA versus 2016. Overall, the West adjusted EBITDA came in within 3% of the first quarter 2016. We did see lower fee-based revenues, mainly as a result of contract changes and 21% lower volumes in the Barnett area. The Barnett field was impacted by really little to no spending on the production over the last year by our previous customers there. So we're excited to see the impact that the new operator in the area, Total, $40-million-plus annual investment will have in the restoration of this production. And they really are just now getting started on figuring out exactly the best places where to place those dollars. And so, we're really excited to work with them and increasing production there. Despite a mild winter throughout most of the U.S., though, the West experienced some extreme weather in January that caused widespread production freeze-offs in the Rockies. We have seen a pretty good rebound in volumes as things have thawed and several rigs have returned to the area. In fact, already our overall volumes in the West are tracking 2.4% higher than the average during the first quarter of 2017. On the other side of the coin, we experienced record throughput volumes on Northwest Pipeline, as a result of the cold weather in the West. To summarize, stable performance continues in the West with Barnett stabilization, recovery in the Rockies and some growth in areas like the Haynesville, Eagle Ford, Niobrara, and potentially, even the Wamsutter field. we look forward to as we get into 2017 and 2018. Now let's move on to the Northeast G&P, where year-over-year operated gathering volumes were up nearly 5%. And if you adjust for the sale of a couple of isolated gathering systems last year, they gathered about 90 million a day. Volume growth would have been closer to 6.5% on that same comparison. So overall, Northeast G&P adjusted EBITDA increased $2 million compared to the same period last year of - and so $227 million as increases in the Bradford, Susquehanna, Ohio River systems were largely offset by decreases in the Utica. And so overall, our mix of revenue shifted a bit where - to dry gas, where our total revenue per Mcf is a little bit lower than it is in those rich gas areas. We think our Utica production is currently at an inflection point to where we'll see growth in the volumes going forward. We're also seeing a pickup on well-connect request across most of the Northeast, as producers prepare for takeaway capacity coming online. And now, I'd like to make a few comments about our NGL & Petchem business. As you know, the streamlining of our operating areas, we've shifted certain assets from NGL Petchem to other segments. So the first quarter of 2017 results now just include the Geismar olefins plant and our propylene splitter near that same facility. The first quarter saw overall improvement in prices and margins for propylene and ethylene. These results were offset by lower production volumes, primarily due to an unexpected failure on the local utility provider system on March 12. This power failure caused a shutdown of our Geismar plant. Once the repairs were made, the plant was restarted here on April 18. So as a result, Geismar only contributed about $37 million of adjusted EBITDA for this first quarter of 2017. Overall, our NGL & Petchem Services segment reported adjusted EBITDA of about $49 million for the quarter. And now, let's move on and discuss some of the projects and operational developments for the first quarter. First of all, we brought Gulf Trace into service on time and under budget. It's one of the five key Transco pipeline system expansions that we expect to place in service during 2017. It even contributed fee-based revenues here in the first quarter of nearly $9 million. So as you know, the Gulf Trace serves the Cheniere's Sabine Pass LNG export facility in Cameron Parish, Louisiana. A picture of that facility, in fact, is on the title slide of today's presentation. And in addition to Gulf Trace, we made significant progress on other projects as well. Construction on the Garden State project is now underway, and we started construction on the mainline facilities of the Atlantic Sunrise project. We're continuing to work on the remaining regulatory approvals for this critical piece of natural gas infrastructure. And just this week, we updated the final permitting data required for the PA DEP 102 state permit and the PA DEP 105 permit. And that update is actually in the process of being delivered as we speak. So great work on the team's part of getting all that new data pulled together and getting those permit applications updated. We submitted an application for a permit certification - sorry, or an application for a FERC certificate for our Northeast Supply Enhancement project, which is a nearly $1 billion fully contracted project that will increase the supply of natural gas to the New York City area by about 400 million a day. Natural gas demand on our systems continues to build. As evidence of this fact, we saw records on two of our major interstate pipeline systems, Transco and Northwest Pipeline during the quarter. We also experienced record gathering volumes in the Northeast G&P, where we achieved a quarterly gathering record of about 6.9 Bcf a day. This represented a 7.5% volume increase for our operated gathering volumes comparing the first quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2016, so really nice jump from the fourth quarter here on - in the Northeast volume. And we hit record natural gas liquid transportation volumes on our Overland Pass Pipeline system serving the Rockies. All of this occurred despite a relatively warm winter in many areas of the country and particularly in the Northeast. We also closed on the Permian for Marcellus transaction, bringing our Bradford Supply Hub average ownership to about 66% as we continue to increase our presence in this prolific supply area. In terms of increasing our focus on predictable fee-based revenues, we announced on April 17 the agreement to sell the Geismar olefin facility for $2.1 billion to NOVA Chemicals. This sale is expected to close this summer. I want to thank the team that's been working on the Geismar transaction and also the team that operates the plant for their persistence, diligence and their continued focus on safe operations. This transaction is one of the last remaining components of de-risking Williams' revenues from direct commodity exposure. After Geismar closes, around 97% of our gross margins will come from predictable fee-based sources. Among those predictable sources will be the new long-term supply and transportation agreement with NOVA that was highlighted in our April announcement of the Geismar sale. Williams Partners' subsidiaries will provide feedstock to the Geismar plant via our Bayou Ethane pipeline system in the Gulf Coast. And looking to the balance of the year, we expect to bring the Hillabee Phase 1 project and the Dalton system into service as planned in mid 2017. We anticipate that the New York Bay and Virginia Southside 2 projects will come online in the fourth quarter also as planned. It's certainly been a successful quarter on the execution front and we're really optimistic about what's coming in terms of growth projects. So before I wrap up, I want to remind everybody about our Analyst Day next Thursday, May 11, where you'll see that we're on a clear and predictable path to continue delivering leading EBITDA growth in our sector. We'll discuss in more detail the drivers that will allow us to continue delivering DCF growth while sustaining strong cash coverage and credit metrics. We'll also discuss how the financial repositioning we've executed will enable us to capture high quality fee-based growth opportunities that are going to be funded through a mix of low-cost debt and retained cash flow. And our operational leaders will be highlighting the significant opportunities ahead for Williams, and especially how our competitively advantaged asset-base is so well positioned to deliver sustained growth through high return organic investment opportunities that are now before us. I'm also looking forward to introducing our new Chief Operating Officer, Michael Dunn. He's already hit the ground and running, and he'll be presenting next week. So that concludes my prepared remarks. Now, I'd like to pass it over to the operator, so we can address your questions. Operator, let's take our first question.
Operator: Thank you. [Operating Instructions] We'll take our first question from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is Charlie [ph] in for Jeremy. Just wanted to follow up on the Atlantic Sunrise, I know you said you're in the midst of getting the second permit - state-level permit. Were there any other requirements there? I thought I remember there being one from the Corps of Engineers. And then just a second separate question, just on the growth CapEx guidance, $2.1 billion to $2.8 billion. Can you just remind us, kind of what may cause us to hit the upper-end or lower-end of that guidance range?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, sure. I'm going to have Mike Dunn take that permitting question here in just a minute. On the capital piece, the primary variances there is the timing of the Atlantic Sunrise and how soon we're able to get started on that project. But as well some of the Northeast construction that - and the gathering system that feeds into that is a bit variable as to timing as well. So it's not really a question of how much in terms of projects really, it's just the matter of the timing of those projects. And, Mike, hope you'll take the question on Atlantic?
Michael Dunn: Sure. Thanks, Alan. Good morning. The Corps of Engineers, we do have a 404 permit update to provide to them and that will occur later this month. That's very similar to the PA DEP updates that we're providing to Pennsylvania. In that, we're just following up with additional information. And that should be a permit received from the Corps of Engineers shortly after that. We do expect permit receipts from both PA DEP and the Corps of Engineers in July, assuming everything goes well. But that's been a pretty large undertaking for our teams to make these updates, but very proud of their effort in getting those submitted this week as we anticipated.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks. And just one more real quick, shifting over to G&P volumes in the Northeast, just can you give a little more color on the Utica volumes that kind of caused that shift to more dry gas exposure?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, I'll may be have Jim Scheel hit that portion.
James Scheel: I think we've been pretty consistently talking about - Chesapeake has moved rigs out of the Utica, specifically the Cardinal wet gas area, over the course of the last couple of years. Alan referenced that we've kind of hit an inflection point with no drilling. We've seen natural declines that have caused us to drop from our high of about 1 Bcf a day to just under 700 Mcf as we go into the first quarter. We anticipate volumes ramping up. Chesapeake is moving in additional rigs. Some of that reduction, though on the wet-side has been offset by new drilling in the dry Utica. And we see that volume increasing.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you.
Alan Armstrong: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Christine Cho from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Christine Cho: Good morning, everyone.
Alan Armstrong: Good morning.
Christine Cho: I wanted to start in Marcellus. We've seen a competitor JV with a producer for some processing plants. And on your acreage, we've seen one producer acquire three or four of your customers, and can probably become somewhat sizable with respect to production. And they've also talked about wanting to be a partner in processing. Is this something that you'd be interested in? Some color on how you think about the strategy in the Northeast going forward. Like, how you evaluate whether or not to get an upfront volume commitment on your processing plants in exchange for acreage lease like we saw with the prior deal, that may cap your upside versus taking on maybe a little more risk in having more upside, especially given the deleveraging you've done to date?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, thank you, Christine. We're always happy to work with customers that have things to bring to the table. And we certainly have continued that effort in the OVM area, and really excited to see the kind of development that is going on. We're getting a tremendous amount of well-connect requests that are probably coming in a little faster than we thought. And so, we do think that processing capacity we have available in the OVM is very valuable. And so we want to make sure that we maximize the value of that in whatever transaction that we do. But, really excited to see all the activity, excited to see EQT out there, really getting active on some of that acreage that was somewhat fallow or especially underfunded, and so I think there's some real big promise coming into the Ohio River area, as a lot of new activity is occurring in that area.
Christine Cho: Okay. And then moving over to Barnett, there's been some talk about directing stack gas volumes to excess capacity that sits on Barnett plants. Could this be an opportunity for you or are there contractual or logistical impediments that would prevent you from doing this? Then, if you could actually remind us what the residue gas and NGL pipes are out at the back end of those plants, that would be great too.
Alan Armstrong: Yes, Christine, we don't have any processing capacity in the Barnett. All we have there is gathering, compression and a dehy. So, we don't have any processing facilities there in Barnett, so really not in a position to take advantage of any of that in the Barnett, if I understood your question correctly.
Christine Cho: Okay. And then last one for me. Have you disclosed how much capacity and how long the long-term contract is going to be with NOVA?
Alan Armstrong: No, we haven't. We haven't disclosed that as yet. We'll be providing some more detail around that at our Analyst Day coming up.
Christine Cho: Okay, what's the...
Alan Armstrong: I do think we've said - Christine, I do think we've said that it's for the full requirements of the plant.
Christine Cho: Okay.
Alan Armstrong: And that historically has been 50,000 to 55,000 barrels a day, depending on whether we're in ethane or propane or depending on if we're cracking all ethane or not.
Christine Cho: Okay. And what's the capacity of the line? It looks like you are doing an expansion that was supposed to take effect second half of this year.
Alan Armstrong: Yes, that's very dependent on where the - where the ethane is coming in. And remember, we also have ethane supply points coming in from our Baton Rouge frac, as well as - at Port Allen as well from our parity system as well. So we can actually pick up ethane from three different points to supply under that contract. And so - but the capacity is very dependent on where that production is coming in. But we did complete a pretty significant expansion earlier this year. And so, we're well positioned to supply the Mississippi River with ethane.
Christine Cho: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: And next from Goldman Sachs, we have Ted Durbin. Please go ahead.
Theodore Durbin: Thanks. Maybe we can start with Northeast Supply Enhancement, that project; so $1 billion of CapEx. Are the returns sort of similar to what you guided to on some of your other projects? And then, just remind us of the in-service date there. I think it's 2020, but what - thinking about timing there.
Alan Armstrong: Rory, you want to take that?
Rory Miller: Yes, I would say the multiples - we are going to do a little bit - I think updating you in Analyst Day on the multiples of some of these historical projects that we've been doing. But I would say, this is kind of in that same sweet spot. It's been a good position for us to be in. We've been able to leverage our existing system. And so the returns have kind of stayed in that range for projects where we've had some brownfield scope to them. That - I think in terms of in-service, I thought that one was in 2020. I don't have it right in front of me. But that like we've been doing on all of our projects, the stated in-service dates are going to be more of a P90 [ph]. And, of course, our target in-service date we're going to be trying to beat that if we can.
Theodore Durbin: Great. And then on your other - your Southeastern Trail open season, maybe just - can you talk about what exactly you are doing there? It looks like the backhaul - how much capital associated there? And then how do we think about that relative to this sort of displacing existing contracts or are there actually a meaningful revenue uplift on Southeastern Trail?
Rory Miller: Yes, on Southeastern Trail, this would be a capacity that we're selling that would either be latent in the system itself, because it is flowing north to south, or we'll be adding new facilities to provide that capacity. We are right in the middle of the sausage-making [ph] right now on Southeastern Trail. We did have an open season. And although I'm not going to get into the details of that, I would tell you that the requests far exceeded what we have capability to offer. So we're going through the process doing all the technical work, trying to understand what's the most efficient way to expand the system and take advantage of some of that latent capacity. And then, we'll be generating rates, going back to the customers. Having iterative process to settle in on an actual capital size, capacity, and then get the deals closed. So we're probably right in the middle of that process. I don't think it's a week or two. It's, say, we're more at the midpoint in getting that sorted and settled.
Theodore Durbin: Got it, that's great. And then, if I could just ask one more. I think, Alan, you sort of alluded to this notion that you do have strong growth over a multi-year period. I guess, I'm wondering where your head is on providing multi-year guidance. I know you used to do that. You've kind of backed away from that. But kind of maybe even just a little bit of a preview of what we should look for at the Analyst Day next week?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, I think what you're going to see is particularly in - from each of the OA leads, you're going to see the drivers of growth and the leverage. For instance, the operating leverage we have in the Northeast and what volumes mean to us in terms of EBITDA there. You'll also see a little more portfolio of the kind of opportunities we're pursuing in - along Transco system. And then finally, you'll see some - in Don's presentation, you'll see some of the drivers of growth into 2018 as well. So we're not going to be providing guidance like we used to, but we are going to be putting some pretty specific terms out there on what those drivers are and give you a lot better opportunity to make your own assessment.
Theodore Durbin: Okay. Great. Thanks. I'll leave it at that.
Alan Armstrong: Okay. Thank you. Thanks.
Operator: And we'll hear next from Faisel Khan with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Faisel Khan: Hi. Good morning. It's Faisel from Citi. Just a little more clarity on - hi, the Geismar feedstock agreement, are you doing anything different in that agreement than what you were doing before for Geismar? I'm trying to figure out if there is a net uplift to your cash flows from your logistics - provide a logistic contract versus what you were doing before?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, that's a really complicated answer to that, Faisel. But, let me just say that we did have - and before, we did have both the cost of operating the pipeline and we had revenues. A lot of that just showed up, if you will, and coming out of the margin of Geismar. So it's a little bit complicated when you think about trying to pull out the Geismar revenue. I will say, though, that we do expect a pretty modest uplift in revenues from that transaction as a result of it. So we'll provide a little more detail and color on that at Analyst Day, but it is a positive for us. And it will be showing up now as third-party fee-based revenue and dropping all the way to the bottom line, where previously it kind of would have been buried in that Geismar margin.
Faisel Khan: Okay, got it. And then on the balance sheet now with the sale sort of under way, what's your expectation for consolidated debt-to-EBITDA by the end of the year for the entire company?
Alan Armstrong: Don?
Donald Chappel: Faisel, we don't have an update for you today, but obviously, it's coming down. I think, we indicated that we would use the proceeds from the Geismar sale to pay off the $850 million term loan and prefund the CapEx that's still the plan. You can run the numbers. We'll provide some additional commentary next week, but we don't have any guidance update per se.
Faisel Khan: Okay. And then last question from me. Can you give us an update on all of the legal battles that are taking place, one with - [your first one] [ph] with Energy Transfer, how that - when do you expect sort of a decision or how's that going. And then also on Constitution, how is that appeal process sort of trending?
Alan Armstrong: Sure. First of all, on the ETE piece, there was a hearing around the process and discovery process on that a couple of weeks ago, I guess. And so that - in that, the judge came back and said he wanted to consider that a little further in terms of, what that discovery process, and so there's motions coming forward on that. So that wages on, if you will. On the Constitution piece, we continue to work with the administration on that, continue to feel good about that. And as well, the court process continues on Constitution as well. And so Constitution, we feel like is an upside to us, but we're optimistic that there's a lot of people, including the unions have been a big support for us on that, labor unions, who really want to see projects like that go forward. And of course, the state of New York's denial on the 401 certificate for Northern Access for National Fuel also turned the heat up a little bit on this issue as well, and so - which appears to be a pretty similar situation. And so I would say that the pressure is mounting on the issue, and you've got projects there that are both important to New England and to New York as well as important to jobs and getting some of the regulatory morass out of the way of getting the infrastructure built, all of which is a top priority for the administration. So, feel like we've got a lot of people on our side on that, and we're going to continue to push forward on it.
Faisel Khan: Okay. But there's no date on the appeal process, when that will conclude that for Constitution?
Alan Armstrong: No, there's not.
Faisel Khan: Okay, understood. Thank you.
Alan Armstrong: We are thinking it's in the not-too-distant future, though, so but if things go like we would expect them to.
Faisel Khan: Okay, understood. Thank you.
Alan Armstrong: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.
Craig Shere: Good morning.
Alan Armstrong: Good morning.
Craig Shere: Picking up on Faisel's questions around the long-term feedstock agreement using the pipeline heading into Geismar. If I understood, there was a possibility that pipeline might be sold as a part of the Geismar asset divestiture, could you talk through the thinking behind retaining the asset and signing a long-term agreement, and maybe its impacts from a tax standpoint and long-term accretion benefit towards Williams?
Alan Armstrong: Well, it's certainly very positive for us. We're really excited about the transaction because it did allow us to obtain very reliable, long-term fee-based revenues out of the transaction. And so we're really excited about what that looks like and the terms of that contract. So we think that was a very smart transaction in that regard. There's really nothing much more complicated than that, frankly, about the transaction other than the fact that it allowed us to retain some fee-based revenue. We do have other customers on the system, and we think that system is extremely well positioned to continue to expand as our customers expand. And so we're really excited to be able to serve NOVA. And of course, they've got big plans for expansions in the Gulf Coast. And we want to be there and be a good reliable provider to them and grow with them. So I would say, it's really nothing more than continuing to have stable fee-based revenues, and taking and retaining a bit of that, if you will, out of the Geismar EBITDA.
Craig Shere: Do you see expansion upside on the pipeline system there within - announced maybe within the next couple of years? Or is that very hazy longer term?
Alan Armstrong: There are some opportunities as some of the projects expand there in Beaumont-Port Arthur area, but we don't have anything that we're planning to announce here in the near future.
Craig Shere: Okay. And one question on the quarterly impact from those third-party outages affecting discovery in Markham, what would you estimate the proportional EBITDA effect of that was?
Alan Armstrong: I don't know that we've disclosed that. I'll tell you more specifically what it amounted to, is it took quite a bit of volume out of Markham that gets fed up from some of the Eagle Ford volumes that gets fed by a competitor's pipeline into Markham. So it took some of the volumes out of Markham, some of the rich gas volumes coming into Markham. And on the Discovery system, even though it didn't impact our volumes, it actually shutdown the whole system for, I think, four, five days, six days. So we lost six days to discover in the quarter, which is pretty significant. And so - because it wasn't just the processing and fractionation facility, it took the whole facility - the whole system out for a bit. So anyway, great job by our team of helping the third-party there safely recover and getting our Discovery system. We were able to move some volumes around and keep some of our customer volumes flowing, but it certainly impact our revenues pretty significantly on Discovery in the quarter.
Craig Shere: Understood, looking forward to next week's Analyst Day.
Alan Armstrong: Great. Thank you. Good to see you, Craig. Thanks.
Operator: And from U.S. Capital Advisors, we have Becca Followill. Please go ahead.
Becca Followill: Good morning, guys.
Alan Armstrong: Morning, Becca.
Becca Followill: On the Northeast Gathering, the unconsolidated volumes were up about 11% yet equity earnings were flat. Was that due to what you talked about, Alan, with the shift to dry gas versus wet gas and the lower margins? Or why don't we see a pickup in the equity earnings there?
Alan Armstrong: I'll ask Jim Schell maybe to take that. Do you follow that question?
James Scheel: Yes. I guess, just going in. We didn't really have a decline of 11%. We had some systems that were off. But overall, on our consolidated volume, from a - let me…
Becca Followill: Well, actually, Jim, I said that its unconsolidated volumes were up 11% yet...
James Scheel: Oh, upward, eh?
Becca Followill: ...yet equity earnings were flat. So why the disconnect?
James Scheel: Yes, again, that really goes back to the base story that we just talked about, which is the Utica volumes were down primarily, and those were offset by higher volumes in the dry gas areas, primarily around Susquehanna Supply Hub and Bradford. And so, those balanced out effectively from an EBITDA perspective, and we were able to overcome those volume declined on an EBITDA basis.
Becca Followill: Okay, thank you.
Alan Armstrong: Remember, Becca, the Barnett system shows up in that unconsolidated numbers, and so growth on Bradford.
James Scheel: The Bradford area.
Michael Dunn: Yes. And then, UEOM is the big Utica system that's in the unconsolidated that would be part of that lower Utica volume story.
Becca Followill: Okay. So it's the wet versus the dry gas margins then?
James Scheel: Yes, that's exactly right.
Becca Followill: And then on the West, you talked about a couple of things impacting you, one being weather in the West, talking about volumes being down 8% year-over-year, one was the West and the other was Barnett. Can you quantify how much of that was Barnett?
Alan Armstrong: I don't think, we're showing that level of detail what we did report, and I think, we'll follow that through, but we did show a 21% decline, as I mentioned in my comments, in the Barnett.
Becca Followill: Okay.
Alan Armstrong: So it's a pretty significant decline in the Barnett.
Becca Followill: Got you. Okay. That's all I needed. Thank you, guys.
Alan Armstrong: Thank you, Becca.
Operator: And from BMO Capital Markets, we do have Danilo Juvane. Please go ahead.
Danilo Juvane: Thank you, and good morning. Most of my questions have been hit, but I did have a couple of follow-ups. So on the Atlantic Sunrise pipeline, the second half starts on the mainland, have you quantified or will you quantify at the Analyst Day what that EBITDA impact will be?
Alan Armstrong: We have not given detail on that. I would say stay tuned for our Analyst Day, and we'll give you a little better idea there at the Analyst Day, kind of the full package on that.
Danilo Juvane: Thanks. I appreciate that. And secondly, on the West segment, there was, I think, a G&P contract restructure with a producer. Did that have anything to do with the shortfall relative to last year?
Alan Armstrong: Well, again, the Barnett, it certainly did, because we were fixed on our MVC, based on what the cash we got paid last year. So that restructure in Barnett was the most significant. There was - so - of the restructure, that was the biggest [ph].
Danilo Juvane: Okay.
Alan Armstrong: And sorry, on - maybe I didn't understand your question. On land energy, we did have them reject a processing contract that we had in Opal as well, so it's a fairly low margin contract, but they [saw our planned input volumes of correctly] [ph] in the West.
Danilo Juvane: Okay. But to your point, the biggest driver was the Barnett restructuring?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, right.
Danilo Juvane: Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.
Alan Armstrong: Thank you.
Operator: We'll now hear from Chris Sighinolfi from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Christopher Sighinolfi: Hey, Alan, good morning.
Alan Armstrong: Good morning.
Christopher Sighinolfi: Just had a couple of follow-ups. I appreciate all the color on the supply agreement to NOVA. It's helpful. I was just curious, given you cited that the 37-day outage in the quarter was attributable to a local utility provider issue, just curious, and maybe it's a moot point with the sale pending, but is there any recovery on that, if you believe the third party responsible for it?
Alan Armstrong: We wish, but no, there is not any avenue for recovery on that.
Christopher Sighinolfi: Okay. And then, second, just sort of more thematic, but I'm assuming this will be addressed at the Analyst Day. I know, we discussed it in the past, but just we appreciate any updated thought on, we hear a lot this earnings season and over the last several weeks and months about producer activities in sort of prolific shale plays that may have high associated gas cuts coming with them. And just what that might mean for domestic natural gas supply demand and in turn, what that might mean for Transco expansion opportunities into the Southeast Gulf Coast markets. I'm just curious if that is a legitimate concern for sort of your legacy avenue of growth? Or I guess, if you could speak at all about sort of the appetite for the next tranche of expansions beyond those that we know. Is there any change in counterparties view on what they've been asking you guys to construct for them given that change in producer activity? Or is it consistent with what you've been experiencing to date?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. No, I think people - if you're thinking about - if you're a buyer of natural gas, if you're a big LDC, you're converting over to gas off of coal or if you're building an industrial facility, likely, if you're in that pathway, you really want to connect to something that's a long-term low cost supply. And so, we continue to see that dependence and people really looking at those low cost supplies as something that they would much prefer to connect with, either through long-term gas purchase contracts that we've seen quite a bit of where a producer knows what they can produce and the cost they can produce at. I think if that's the business you're in, you really want to be focused on something that's not at the whims of oil prices in terms of development. And so, I think that what we're seeing is a very consistent theme, which is people continuing to focus on the very low cost resources and being able to contract through for those for their long-term dependence on that fuel. So I'd say things remain very healthy there, and we continue to see a lot of demand. As Rory pointed out on our Southeastern Trails, we're kind of sometimes shocked by the degree of demand that we're seeing in trying to get gas out of these very low cost resources into these growing markets.
Christopher Sighinolfi: Okay. Great. Thanks for the color this morning, and look forward to next week.
Alan Armstrong: Excellent. Thanks, Chris.
Operator: From Raymond James, we have J.R. Weston.
J.R. Weston: Hi, good morning. You mentioned during the prepared commentary that positive weather impact on the Northwest Pipeline's throughput for the quarter. Just wondering how to think about the progression there for the rest of the year? And then, I think in the 4Q materials, there's kind of some mention of some longer-dated projects up in that region. Just wondering, if there is any type of update there.
Alan Armstrong: Yes, sure. I'll take that first, and then, I'm going to turn that second part of that to Walt. But on the first, the good news, the bad news on these fully contracted pipelines, there is just not that much variability, did see a little bit of uplift in IT revenues on Northwest Pipeline, but when you have these fully contracted pipelines like Transco, Northwest and Gulfstream, you just don't see much movement from quarter to quarter other than a little bit of IT revenues, because they're fully sold out versus some of the pipelines - some of the other interstate pipelines you see that are more dependent on actual volumes flowing. And so, our volumes are up, which is healthy, because it says that there is demand growing consistent with what ultimately leads to expansions. But in terms of what the revenues we take in, it really doesn't move all that much, as you can see looking at history. And Walt, maybe you'll take the question on the longer lead projects.
Walter Bennett: Sure. Thanks for the question. In terms of projects on Northwest Pipeline, we do have two projects that we're pursuing right now with our customers that are increasing lateral capacity to serve them, and we're going to give some more detail around that on Analyst Day. But that will be a little bit of an uptick as those get billed in terms of increment lateral fees, and that has really essentially optimized all the capacity on the existing mainline capacity in Northwest Pipeline. And so, beyond that, what we see is that, as additional demand comes on then we're going to be also looking at working with our customers on increasing mainline capacity on Northwest, which will be a good uptick in revenue on Northwest. And we'll be providing some more color around that on Analyst Day.
J.R. Weston: Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you. I guess, just one more for me kind of switching gears quite a bit. But just with the Geismar transaction announced now, and then with all the other positive steps that you made over the last year or two, I was just kind of wondering what else is going into the equation moving forward, even just anything kind of from a thought process perspective, as you're looking at the dividend, the distribution growth outlook and especially at WMB, where the guided range is a little wider fairway at 10% to 15%?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Well, obviously, as we continue to execute well, that would move us towards the upper end ultimately on that, as we continue to execute well. But I think in terms of the question around what we do with excess cash, certainly, the first thing we've talked about is taking down the revolver debt at WMB. That's really about the only thing we can easily take out in terms of debt at WMB and well on our way to doing that. But beyond that, we'll determine when we come to that point, and we've got that down, then we'll determine what we think the very best use of that cash is from a shareholder perspective. And so that will be a consideration towards the back end of the year likely.
J.R. Weston: Okay. Great. That's all I had. Thank you.
Alan Armstrong: Thank you.
Operator: And from UBS, we do have Shneur Gershuni. Please go ahead.
Shneur Gershuni: Not bad. Hi, guys. Just a couple of questions. And I think they're kind of a bit of follow-ups. For starters - and I think Chris kind of touched on this a little bit here, but when you've got the amount of gas that's coming out of the Permian Basin, and sort of starting to impact spreads and so forth, how do we think about the competitive nature of the Marcellus, which needs to obviously move gas down there? Do you think basis does contract and presents an opportunity? Or is there a risk that that step up that we're all hoping for doesn't materialize, because of all the production downstream? When I look at spreads further out, it looks like it does contract, but I'm kind of interested in kind of your thoughts about it.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I think certainly, with all the new pipeline capacity that's underway and systems like ours that are fully contracted, the pipeline capacity is getting built. As you'll see in our presentation next week, there's also a lot of power gen demand coming on for the Northeast as well, right, within the circle of pain, if you will, where people are trying to take advantage of all that low cost supply in the power generation market. So we think very positive things in terms of demand for the Northeast is coming. And I think, as I mentioned earlier, I think the big long-term gas demands really want to try to take advantage of the low cost - big low-cost supplies. And even if you get out on the outer end of ranges that I've seen of around 5 Bcf a day of incremental growth through 2021, it's just not near enough to really stay up - from the Permian - it's just not near enough to stay up with the kind of demand growth that we're seeing in the balance. And so, we'll hit that next week in some detail, but I would just say that the kind of demand we're seeing come on is really going to take a big low cost gas resource like the Marcellus and the Utica that people can count on that production being there through the valleys and peaks that tend to occur in the oil business. So we think the Marcellus and Utica certainly established itself as the supply basin for a lot of this incremental demand, and it's really the only one that can come on with that kind of scale.
Shneur Gershuni: That definitely makes sense. And then, you completed some offshore investments last year. Just wondering, if you can sort of give us a sense of how they're running at this stage, right now. Is there a further ramp? Just any color on how we think about how they're doing and where they're going at this stage.
Alan Armstrong: Rory, you want to take that?
Rory Miller: Yes, I'll take that. Maybe starting with our Keathley Canyon Connector, that facility is running fully loaded. The South Hadrian gas field and Lucius are making up most of the volumes in there. But it continues to run fully loaded and our downstream plant at Larose is running right at nameplate capacity, so great performance there. I would say over in the Eastern Gulf, some other noteworthy projects that we've had over the last couple of years are our Gulfstar project. And I also would characterize that as a bit of a slow start. The operator had some challenges - downhole challenges, but some subsea or a downhole valve litigation that was all part of that. But the fields actually, the Tubular Bells field and then the tieback that we made at Gunflint, those are really starting to line out and produce nicely. In fact, a couple of days ago, we hit 50,000 barrels a day through the facility. It's been averaging a little bit below that, but it's performing very well. I would say this year, it's really hitting its stride, performing better than it did last year. The other thing, I'll mention, we had a tieback to our old Devils Tower bar with a field called Kodiak that was a one well tieback. And they recently recompleted into another zone, so it's being co-mingled. And they almost doubled production out of that well, so really good performance over in the Eastern Gulf. Of course, there are always declines, but I feel like this year, the operations have - not only on our side, but on the producers side has kind of hit their stride, and we think that's pretty solid.
Shneur Gershuni: Cool. Thank you very much guys. Appreciate the color and look forward to further update next week.
Alan Armstrong: Great. Thanks, Shneur.
Operator: And we do hear from Brandon Blossman with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. And he's next.
Brandon Blossman: Hey, guys.
Alan Armstrong: Good morning.
Brandon Blossman: A couple of quick ones. One, hearing some producer - renew producer interest in Powder River Basin development, any thoughts in terms of trajectory for you guys going forward there?
Alan Armstrong: I'm sure, Walt, you want to hit that.
Walter Bennett: Sure. Yes. We have seen renewed interest in that area on our Jackalope system. And this year, this has been included in some of the guidance and some of the public statements, but - and anticipate a number of wells coming on in that area with some two or three rigs that are going to be working that hadn't been in the area previously, and also exploring some new formations, [suffix, the turner department] [ph]. So that brings some optimism to that area, and we're looking forward to seeing the results of those wells. And hopefully, we'll have a strong growth trajectory from there.
Brandon Blossman: Well, thank you on that. And then, broader picture. So Gulf Trace, under budget, any thoughts about where we are today and expectations for the future in terms of pipe or labor costs inflation?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, good question. I would say on our major projects that we have right now, we're under construction. And some of the big projects like the NESE project that Rory talked about earlier, pretty unique labor set there, because you're right in very heavily congested area and you're in some of - quite a bit of that work is actually in Raritan Bay in offshore. So pretty unique contractor set that will be on that project. But overall, I would say our team has done a really good job of anticipating a lot of increase in construction and have done a good job of getting out in front of that in terms of contracting. So feel pretty comfortable there right now in terms of how we're positioned, but certainly, we could see some pressure in the large diameter market as some of these big projects like Mountain Valley and Atlantic Coast Pipeline start - and Rover start to take hold.
Brandon Blossman: Perfect. Thank you. That's all from me.
Alan Armstrong: Thank you.
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Porter, at this time, I would like to turn the conference back to you and the other speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Alan Armstrong: Great. Well, thank you all very much. I appreciate everybody joining us today. Really excited about the way the team is executing and really excited about the prospects ahead of us and we look forward to talking to you about that next week. So thanks again for joining us.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Williams and Williams Partners Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John D. Porter - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Tony. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily. Our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to questions, and we also have the leaders of Williams' 2016 operating areas with us: Walter Bennett leads the West and Central; John Dearborn leads NGL & Petchem Services; Rory Miller leads Atlantic-Gulf; and Jim Scheel leads the Northeast Gathering & Processing area. Our Engineering Services leader John Seldenrust is also with us. In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconciled with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. These reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials. We're planning on keeping our call to about an hour. If we miss any of your questions, feel free to follow up with Investor Relations later on today. And with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Great. Well, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We're glad you could join us today. Let's jump right in here on slide two where we have an overview of what we're going to talk about this morning. We'll discuss our full year 2016 performance and also provide some perspective on where we see the business going and why we believe Williams is so well-positioned to continue on our growth trajectory. And first, I'd like to recognize our teams across the Williams Companies for the strong performance that was turned in for 2016. They endured a lot of uncertainty and change but just kept on delivering both great performance and execution against our projects. Cash flows, as a result of their efforts, were up and we exceeded our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year. Our performance reflects the decisive actions we began taking in early 2016 to focus on cost reduction, strengthen our financial position and align our workforce to execute against our more narrow strategy. Very importantly, we continue to bring major new projects into service and make projects on others that are now permitted. We closed the sale of our Canadian assets in 2016 and we announced a restructured win-win gathering agreements in the Barnett and MidCon regions with Chesapeake. And we also announced the start of a process to monetize Geismar, which is on schedule. We also completed a board refresh process that saw the addition of seven new board members. We're very excited about the counsel and involvement of our entire board of directors that bring years of energy company experience and a solid track record of building and sustaining growth for stockholders. Throughout 2016 and 2017, we continued to make progress in debt reduction, and we're also enabling the funding of significant growth portfolio of WPZ at the same time. And just this month, Atlantic Sunrise reached a major milestone with its FERC certificate, and we continue to make progress on both the regulatory and construction planning fronts for this important project. There is significant support for the project from both business, industry – general industry in the area and as well big labor organizations who realized the value of the Atlantic Sunrise system to both Pennsylvania and to the U.S. economy. But Atlantic Sunrise really is just one example of projects we're pursuing as we transform our asset portfolio to deliver fee-based predictable and stable cash flows from connecting prolific supply basins to growing markets. On that note, we announced a transaction last week to increase our ownership in a Bradford County PA gathering operation. I'll discuss that a bit later, but we're very excited about the way that transaction worked out for us. So, with the unique advantage position we're in across both demand and supply markets, we believe there is additional value in WMB and WPZ pricing, given our strong adjusted EBITDA growth since the oil price collapse at the end of 2014. And I'll show some detail of our perspective on that at the end – towards the end of this presentation about our growth versus our peers and our valuation against our peers. So, with that, let's move on to slide three and discuss our overall full year 2016 results. Here, we look at the full year results for WPZ on GAAP measures of cash flow from operations. We were at about $3.7 billion, up nearly $1 billion on cash from operations. On the full year 2016 GAAP measures, we delivered net income of $431 million at PZ, up over last year due to lower non-cash impairment charges, a little bit of help on commodity margins and of course increase on fee-based revenues. On the non-GAAP measures, we look at 2016 adjusted EBITDA is up in every segment, all five of our segments here for 2015 (sic) [2016] with a total overall increase of 8%, I think, really demonstrating the strength of our natural gas-focused strategy. And our DCF was also up about $151 million or 5.4% versus 2015, giving us a coverage ratio of 1.01 times. And of course, this is measured against the higher distribution rate of 340 a unit. Our ongoing cost reduction efforts across the company are contributing to our strong performance, even as we brought new assets online. So we're continuing to grow the business, but as you look at our operating costs, we've been able to lower those in many areas and keep those flat in areas that we're growing. You can see some of the key drivers for the full year results by various operating here on slide three, but let's turn over to slide four and I'll provide some color on each of the areas as we look at the 4Q 2016 results. So, looking here at slide four, the simple headline here is, we do continue to deliver growth across the business here in the fourth quarter. And our CFFO for the fourth quarter was up nearly $1 billion, primarily driven by the Barnett contract restructuring as well as growth in our modified EBITDA. Again, on the GAAP measures, similar story. Net income of $145 million was up over last year, once again due to lower non-cash impairment charges. And in the fourth quarter, EBITDA growth on adjusted EBITDA, we saw a growth of 5% over 4Q 2015. DCF for the quarter was down about 3% versus 4Q of 2015, and this is primarily driven by increase in maintenance capital and an increase in interest expense. Of course, we're beginning to take that interest expense down. Overall, coverage for the fourth quarter came in at 0.92 times due to higher maintenance capital spending and, as I pointed out, the increased interest. But for the year, the coverage again was 1.01 times. So, now, let me provide some perspective across all of our five operating areas. And just as a reminder, this would be the last time you hear about all five because we are consolidating those into three areas, which will be the Atlantic-Gulf, the West, and the Northeast G&P as we go into 2017. So, looking at Atlantic-Gulf, we continue to deliver growth both year-over-year and in the fourth quarter. For the year, adjusted EBITDA was up $112 million with the increase driven by free-based revenue growth and embedded fee-based revenues in our Discovery JV. Of course, the Discovery JV was driven by natural gas volume growth from the prior year as we brought on some of the big systems in the deepwater. Great job by our Discovery team of continuing to operate safe with tremendous growth in their business there. We saw higher fee-based revenues as well, but we had a nice lift from the Pascagoula opportunity in the second half of the year. And just let you dial that in a little tighter, we think that was about $24 million in the fourth quarter that came from the excess volumes coming in from the Pascagoula outage there in the fourth quarter. The Gunflint revenues were up as well, and we did see a partial offset of these increases due to some outages for well work-overs and repairs on the Tubular Bells field that flows into Gulfstar. Overall for the year, cost related to new assets being placed into service and maintenance and modernization on our existing systems offset some of the fee-based revenue growth. But pretty impressive cost controls allowed a large portion of the revenues to be recognized in EBITDA. This Atlantic-Gulf team really has been managing tremendous growth and continuing to reign in costs the same time. But I also would point to the fact that they also have tremendous amount of new business that they're developing at the same time. So, his team really is managing a lot of growth and doing it in an operationally prudent manner. So, very proud of the Atlantic Gulf team and their efforts there. Looking to Central. The adjusted EBITDA increased $13 million to $912 million for the full year. In the fourth quarter, Central's adjusted EBITDA decreased by $25 million to $194 million. This adjusted EBITDA was unfavorably impacted by approximately $23 million due to a one-time year-to-date true-up of amounts previously recognized during 2016 related to Barnett Shale Minimum Volume Commitment, and that was caused by of course the Barnett restructuring and recontracting that occurred during the fourth quarter. Moving forward, we're looking forward to working with Total to improve the performance of this important gas sale through their $40 million per year drilling commitment to the area. And overall, the restructuring has been viewed positively, and we think we're on track here to deliver steady continued growth in this area. And so, really excited to get to work in an area that's really been neglected for quite some time as it wasn't an area that was attracting any capital from Chesapeake. Just to note about the Haynesville now, that's an area which is further advantaged if the Northeast takeaway capacity is unable to supply most of the coming demand in the Southeast U.S. So, we view our position here as very strategic. And I would just tell you, I think, as we look at production here in the U.S. right now, and we see that continuing to fall, it's going to be really hard for – as prolific as the Northeast is, it's going to be hard for it to make up all of the production decline that we're seeing across the U.S. without the infrastructure coming on here in 2017. So, we really believe that anywhere that has low cost reserves and existing infrastructure like the Haynesville are very well positioned here as we head into 2017. So, let's look at the Northeast. In 2016, our Northeast G&P delivered a $43 million increase in adjusted EBITDA. These increases were due mainly to fee-based revenue growth as well as strong focus by Jim Scheel and our team there on cost reduction, including a reduction of $36 million in our O&M expense. So, that team is really making the Northeast, which was just on a growth tear there for quite some time, getting these big systems built out. And his team now is very focused on really getting our unit cost in line and continuing to be able to reign in costs there. So, really impressed with the way the team has come together there. As we've discussed, the Marcellus and Utica areas really hold the key for America's energy future, and we're working very hard on increasing not only our gathering position there but also making sure we're connected to all takeaway capacity to unleash this tremendous resource that will supply low cost, clean natural gas resources for decades to come. We did see some impressive volume uplift at the end of the quarter and set records on several of our big dry gas systems in January as local load and the REX 3 expansion gave this bottlenecked area some relief. So, a little more on that later, but really seeing here towards the very end of the fourth quarter and in January, we're finally seeing some volume response to price up there. And for the West operating area, the main story of 2016 was remarkably steady and predictable cash flows across the year with a very slight increase in adjusted EBITDA for the full year. The results were positively affected by a strong focus on cost controls and lower O&M and SG&A expenses. So, great job to Walt Bennett who leads that area for us as well and his team that really continue to put pressure on cost and at the same time really driving our focus on process safety across all of our big gathering systems both in the West and now in what was previously the Central area. We can report that producers in the West seem a little more hopeful than they've been recently. So, we're cautiously optimistic based on some of the activities we're seeing out there, most recently in response to both better gas prices and better NGL margins for the Rockies. The fourth quarter volumes were a bit impacted by weather-related freeze-offs, and we continue to see some impact from weather here in the first quarter. On the NGL and Petchem Services area for the year, NGL-Petchem adjusted EBITDA was up $163 million, so a very nice increase over 2015. We had a significant accomplishment in 2016 when we completed the sale of our Canadian business. And as reflected in the quarter and year-end results, it was one of the big strategic moves we made to focus the business on our core capability of gathering, transporting and handling natural gas. As you know, we're in the process of selling the Geismar facility and an anticipated announcement here in the first half of 2017. But I can tell you, the process is moving ahead as planned, and we expect final bids in late first quarter. The Geismar facility ran well in 2016, but we did have an interruption in production late in the year as we took the facility down to make some repairs, which resulted in about a 12-day outage during the quarter. This is a plant that's very strategically located on the Mississippi River, and we're really focusing on safe and reliable operations there as we're in the sales process. And it's a plant that is very well positioned to serve both Louisiana and the global market. Our other business, Conway and OPPL continue to generate very steady and growing cash flow. So, that area that doesn't get a lot of focus will now be included in our West, but great job of our teams there continuing to deliver cash flow growth in Conway and OPPL. Moving on to slide five. We regularly show how we are doing against the long list of projects and deals that support our very clear strategy. It's a really good measure of progress as we continue to steadily deliver these large complex projects and deals. It's critical to keep our eye on this list of high-priority items as it is a pathway to growing high-quality, predictable fee-based revenues. And we think it's a great list for our investors to keep their eye on as well. I think any objective observer would have to agree that progress is being made as we pursue tremendous demand growth on Transco, which is both the largest and the fastest-growing pipeline system in the U.S. But we also are preparing for the tremendous follow on in volumes as the demand builds and the Northeast is called on to meet this very identifiable growth that's right before us. So looking at some of the recent developments, first of all, the Transco's Atlantic Sunrise, I mentioned earlier, we did receive a FERC Certificate on this 1.7 Bcf a day system. And we're continuing to now work with the State of Pennsylvania to get our final permits for that project. All is going well there, and the team is really excited about moving ahead with the construction after a very long permitting process there on Atlantic Sunrise. On the Gulf Trace system, this is a system that most of the construction was done in Louisiana, and it's a 1.2 Bcf per day expansion to serve Cheniere Sabine Pass LNG export terminal, and this was placed in service ahead of schedule and under budget. And really nice, I would tell you, I think a nice break for our teams that are used to building in areas that aren't so friendly. Nice to see what they can do in an area, in an energy-friendly state like Louisiana and Texas. So great performance by and great execution by our team there, I'm really excited to have that in service so early. And it is now up and flowing. Also, several other expansions that are under construction, the 1.6 Bcf a day expansion in total, 448 million cubic feet per day for Dalton, 818 million cubic feet per day for the Hillabee Phase 1, 115 million cubic feet a day for the New York Bay system, and another 250 million cubic feet per day for the Virginia Southside 2. All of these projects are scheduled to be completed this year. So in total, five big Transco projects are scheduled to be placed into service this year. I might say, just because I think that sometimes it's hard to really put all this growth in perspective, that just the projects that I mentioned here brings on about 4.5 Bcf a day of expansion capacity on Transco, and I'll remind you that, that is all 100% contracted. So we do not have volume risk against that 4.5 Bcf a day. Pretty impressive when you think back to 2010 with Transco being about a 10 Bcf a day pipeline back in 2010. So again, great work by our team, both capturing business and growing that system. And speaking of growth, Transco did set another delivery record for peak day and three-day average deliveries of 13.7 million dekatherm per day and 13.6 million dekatherm per day on January 7 through to January 9. And so these are measured as we deliver gas into our customers, and really impressive considering we had a fairly moderate winter here in 2017. That sounds something really easy to roll off my tongue is to talk about hitting that kind of peak day on a system. But I'll tell you, it takes a tremendous amount of coordination and focus on operational excellence by our teams to reach brand-new levels of delivery off of this massive system, especially impressive when we have so much construction and maintenance going on, on the system to be able to coordinate those. So I think a lot of times, we all take for granted the extraordinary work that our workforce do to keep up with the kind of growth and volume and construction going on, but our Transco team has been doing it and doing it in stride. Looking out west, our Northwest Pipeline, very quietly, our team moved ahead out there and got a rate case settlement or pre-settled rate case with FERC. And though that's been filed now with FERC on January 23, those new rates will be effective on January 1, 2018. I'll also note here that Northwest Pipeline set a monthly record for deliver in January of this year as well. So that was a whole month of January record. So new monthly record. In the Central area, Barnett, the new gathering agreement course executed on November 1 with Total, and really took the risk, of the collection risk we had on those MVCs, and exchanged it for large cash payments received at closing. We also improved our counter-party credit rating and received drilling capital commitment from Total. So a lot of activities starting out there, really excited to work with Total, that area has really been neglected, and certainly it's a very important gas resource to the nation and one that we think ultimately is going to get called on here as the demand picks up here in the U.S. For our Marcellus-for-Permian transaction, this is really an important transaction for us. Great work by Frank Billings and the team to get that deal closed, and it really puts us in an area we really like. And in fact, the Bradford Supply area where these two systems that we acquired additional interest in, just set another record on February 10 of 2.725 Bcf a day, and that means for the Northeast PA, so this is just for our two big dry gas systems up in the Northeast PA, we exceeded 5 Bcf a day on that same day on February 10. So just to put that in perspective for you, on just two of our systems and in just two counties, we gathered over 7% of the entire U.S. production. So really starting to point out how incredibly important the Marcellus is, and these big dry gas systems are up here. So we're really excited about the acquisition there in Marcellus. And I think it's a great trade for Western and Anadarko as well. So a great example of a smart trade between two companies. On the Northeast G&P volumes, daily volume records across the northeast systems with strong winter pricing. And so as I mentioned, we continue to see great records hit, Northeast PA was the most impressive of that. But I think as we enter into the fourth quarter here, we start to see some capacity open up in the southwest part of the play, and in the Utica we're going to start to see some increased volumes there as well. So on the coming soon list, of course we have the Geismar process, that final bid from the late first quarter. But I also, one thing is not on the page that I'd like to mention here, is that we just announced the new open season on the Southeastern trail project. And this is a project that will run from our existing Pleasant Valley receipt point near Dominion's Cove Point Pipeline in Virginian, down to the south, the location is far south as our existing station 65 Pooling Point, which is a very liquid pooling point in Louisiana in St. Helena Parish, Louisiana. So another project, it's great to see this list of 20 or so projects who we're pursuing, start to come in fruition. But we're in the early stages of this project, but we've seen great evidence of continued strong customer interest, and pulling supplies off of Transco to meet their growing demands. So let's now move on to slide six. So just little bit of overview on the transaction we did there in trading out of the Permian system. That was a non-operated Delaware Basin joint venture. It was a joint venture with Western Gas and of course Anadarko then as the parent. And so we traded out of that area. And I'll tell you, it's certainly an area that has a lot of growth. It also had a tremendous amount of capital load against it. And so we're trading into an area that has tremendous free cash flow and growth that'll be associated in volumes as that area gets opened up to new takeaway capacity. So we think the timing of this transaction was really good, and very much meets our strategy. We also took in $200 million in the trade, and again, we're very excited to continue to double down on our focus on natural gas and natural gas market fundamentally. If I move on to slide seven and look at the financial repositioning that we've done recently. We're really excited about this, and I just want to highlight some of the real positives that came out of this transaction. First of all, we really are getting to the point – no external equity financing need against our existing business plan. Certainly, the market risk, it's always easy for us to ignore market risk and market access risk. But I'll just remind you where we were a year ago in terms of access to the market risk. So we're really excited, I think that's a key risk to take off the table so that both we as a company and investors can really focus on our business performance, which we think has continued to be strong despite some ups and downs in the equity markets. On the coverage side, a really interesting note here, and one I think that's being missed as people look at comparison of WMB to other entities, and we just point out here that the Williams economic coverage of 1.7 times is expected for 2017. Of course, that's driven off of the 1.3 times coverage at MB, plus 74% interest in the 1.2 times coverage at WMB. So we'll provide some detail on that in the back. But pretty impressive in terms of the kind of coverage that we're building that support to WMB dividend and yield. Looking at the strengthened credit metrics for both PZ and WMB, we note here the amount of debt that we've taken down here in the fourth quarter of 2016, as well as the first quarter of 2017. And we continue to really bring this down pretty dramatically, and in fact, if you look at where we were in just five months now with lower PZ debt by nearly $2.5 billion before asset sales, and WMB debt reduction down $75 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, and an additional $500 million expected here in 2017 as we execute our plan. So really bringing that down rapidly, and certainly that was a goal of a lot of the transactions that we've been taking on. The PZ cash cost equity reduced by 50%. We now have a top quartile yield amongst our MLP peers. And while we don't have any plans to use that cost of capital any time in the direct future and within our existing business plan, we think it's very important to have that low cost of capital because just as I pointed out, we continue to find new places to invest money in new projects. And we think for the long term, having that little cost of capital is exactly what we think matches up with this low risk growing cash flow profile that we have at PZ and WMB. And so speaking of low risk cash flow deposit, if we look at slide eight here, very impressive look at our EBITDA growth at 8% year-over-year, EBITDA growth, and that is going to continue as we continue to invest about 68% of our 2017 capital in the regulated pipeline. And so we're really excited about how steady this growth in EBITDA has continued to perform. And that's with things like the sale of our Canadian assets as well in there. And so really think this perhaps gets overlooked a bit by investors in terms of how steady and predictable the cash flow growth has been. And as we look at slide nine, really I think a very interesting picture here. So let me just quickly explain this to you. On the top chart there, you have the EBITDA growth. Now, this begins in Q1 of 2015. And why Q1 of 2015? A couple of reasons; one, that is right at the first quarter after the crude oil price collapsed in November of 2014. It also was where we consolidated and merged ACMP's operating numbers with us. So this is a nice, clean look at WPZ EBITDA growth. And then you can see below that our peers, you can see the peers listed down there in the footnote, and you can see the dash lines are peers that haven't reported yet, but that's their consensus EBITDA. So under any scenario here, I think it's safe to say that we have continued to perform extremely well against our peers in terms of EBITDA growth. But if you look down on the slide below there, we don't really feel like that's being reflected in our valuation at WMB, you can see us trading there as eight out of nine peers, and in terms of the enterprise value to EBITDA. And so we really believe that if we continue to execute, continue to show this growth in EBITDA, we're going to move up that slide. I really think, if you look at the fundamental underpinning of our business plan, I don't think we should be anywhere but over towards the far left on this slide because I do think we have the most identifiable growth. I think we've got very solid financial picture underneath this now. And so we really, as a team, are very focused on moving this EV to EBITDA multiple over to the left, and we certainly think we deserve that. So just in closing here, just to tell you, it really is hard to believe in the natural gas demand growth, and not believe in these kind of value that Williams is going to continue to generate. So we feel very strong about this natural gas fundamentals pictures. Obviously, we're continuing to double down on that through the transactions that we're taking, and we believe that even with the fairly mild winter that we've had this year, we're going to continue to see a need for natural gas market growth. We're certainly starting to see the LNG starting to pull. We're seeing supply is not really reacting yet. Certainly here through the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2016, we really haven't seen supplies react yet, but we know that they've got to, to keep up with all the tremendous amount of demand growth that's contracted for on our systems. So we're going to be continuing to stay very focused on the strategy. We're going to continue to keep ourselves well positioned, right in between these very best supply basins, and the very best market growth. And we think that the advantage of our footprint will continue to shine over time, and the continued growth in opportunity that continues to fill in our pipeline of opportunities is going to continue for some time to come. So with that, we thank you very much for your attention this morning. And we'll turn it over for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. We'll go first to Brandon Blossman, Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everyone.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Good morning.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: I guess, let's start at Atlantic Sunrise, Alan. What determines, or what's the timeline look like from here? Is there a risk that the project slips from current in-service targets, and what would drive that risk?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Sure. Thank you for the question. Really, the primary risk at this point really remain around the permitting risk from the State of Pennsylvania. We've been working very closely with the state. They've been very cooperative, and they very much understand that we're going to do things right, and they are really doing a great job of keeping things on schedule on their side. So we're feeling very good about the work going on there with the State of Pennsylvania. Certainly, the Manor East 2 and the PennEast approvals this last week are good evidence of them continuing to execute on their side. So we're very thankful for the work that's going on with the pay depth there. They've got a lot of work on their plate, but they've continued to keep pace with us on our work. So that's probably the next big step, if you will, for us is to get that 102 and 105 permits from State of Pennsylvania. We still need to get the 404 permit from the Corps of Engineers as well, but feel like that's moving along very handily as well. And of course, they've been heavily involved in the FDIS (35:28) all along. So that's all part of moving that permit ahead. So really don't see any major risk on those two, but that is probably the risk that I would point to in terms of timing risk at this point.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: So base case, it sounds like you still think that you can hit the in service targets that you set out there.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I think, of course, we still have it risked in our model. We still have it pushed out six months from that target date. But I would tell you, obviously, as we continue to click off things like the FERC Certificate, we continue to reduce the risk and the contingency that's built into that schedule. But right now, we still have it in there. But obviously, every permit we check off will start to pull that back. So I feel very comfortable about where we are, I would say, and feel good about being able to reach that target. But we all know that building pipelines these days is difficult, and we don't want to forget that as we lay out a financial forecast.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Fair enough. And then a follow on related to the Bradford system. How should we think of that as it evolves with Atlantic Sunrise coming online? Is there more capital to be spent? Has it been fully capitalized? What do volume trajectories look like over the next two years call it? And then earnings flat as the cost of service system, I believe, or should we expect uplift there?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. You know it well, the very little incremental capital required because most of the big systems have been out, so it's really just well-connect capital, there will have to be activity to keep up with that, but the capital there, load, is very small. And it is, you are correct, it is a cost of service system. And so even though we may see some volume increase and pick up and some incremental capital, the base systems are cost of capital. I will say however though, that the positioning of those assets, and the opening up of those markets does allow us to bring in third parties to those systems. And so we do think that that will provide an opportunity for us out there to continue to expand our presence in the area. But generally, fairly moderate growth in earnings because of the rate base nature of those assets.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Perfect. Good color. Thank you, Alan. That's all for me.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We go next to Jean Ann Salisbury, Bernstein.
Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning. I wanted to ask more about the Southeastern trail project, Mountain Valley and Atlantic Coast are interconnecting to Transco. Is this targeting those volumes, and how much capacity do you have down there that could go south bound, like maybe 3 Bcf/d or so?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I would tell you that the amount of volume is – I mean, we can build and build and build, where we get – have to get beyond the existing right of way and the existing capabilities of the pipeline the more expensive it gets. And so the first 400 million, 500 million cubic feet a day of capacity is fairly inexpensive. And as we get beyond that gets more expensive. And so we're trying to make sure that we get the very best value for that, and that we know what the right size to build is. I think the biggest challenge we have, frankly, is really picking that right size. It's not whether or not there is a project there, it's a question of making sure we pick the exact right size, and we get the very highest return available to us based on that. So said another way, the larger the project may get, the lower our return may get. And so we've got to pick, really, what the perfect project is there. In terms of who those volumes are coming from, I would tell you the market will decide that. And certainly, that would be an area that could pick it up, but it's looking like there's demand well in excess of that in terms of the market demand. So I'm not going to get real specific on that, and the open season, of course, will tell who's going to pick up that incremental capacity. But that's, of course, the purpose of the open season.
Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks. And then secondly, you've had kind of talk to a lot of investors about the IDR transaction last month. I'm just wondering if there's anything in hindsight that you would have done differently or anything that you think investors may not have necessarily seen the same way that you and the board did.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. Well, I would just say, I think we really are focused on the long-term benefit of sustaining growth in the business. And getting the IDR put away, I think, what was going to continue to be a level of uncertainty about whether or not that IDR could be met, how much waiver was going to be. So we felt like there's a lot of market inefficiency that was going to come with that. We also felt like we needed to move quickly to both take down debt. And importantly, I think probably this is the piece that you can have varying opinions on, is getting ourselves in a position where we're not having to be reliant on access to the markets over time and the volatility of those markets. We certainly saw that, that really damaged us last year as we had a lot of growth obligations, a lot of capital obligation, and yet we were having to issue debt at a very high cost, and the equity markets were extremely expensive as well. And so we feel like getting that risk out in a way that we can fund all this great capital in front of us is a really nice way to lock in margin between our cost of capital and these great projects that we have. So I would say, it's probably a delta and thinking about the risks that are out in the markets long term, and very much a focus on a sustainable model that can grow dividend for years and years to come.
Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks for that. That's all from me.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Next is Shneur Gershuni with UBS Financial.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning, guys.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Good morning.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: I was wondering if we can sort of shift focus a little bit here and talk about the sales process that you have ongoing. I kind of guess I have a two-part question here. You've had a couple of recent asset sales. Is there anything left besides just Geismar in that process? And then has the sales exceeded or they in line with your expectations. And I guess, what I'm really asking is how should we think about that $2 billion target that you put out there? Could you be above that number at this stage with how you perceive it thus far?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah, Shneur, thanks for the question. First of all, one thing I want to remind people is, is that target that we put out there is a $2 billion after-tax number. And so I think we've been pretty clear on that. But that is what we've said and will continue to say. And I would just say that the Geismar process is going very well, and gaining confidence as the days go by on that. And so I feel very good about that. In terms of other assets, I would tell you that there are some other assets in and around Geismar. For instance, some of the pipeline, the NGL and Petchem pipeline systems in the Gulf Coast, that will not be all that strategic to us. And so I think we're going to be kind of in a mode, Scheur, of looking at opportunistic purchases of assets. And so whether there are players that have great synergies with some of our assets and are willing to put some of those synergies on the table to be the right buyer, then I think that's going to be the kind of sales that we're going see, and whether that's Mid-Continent, the stuff that's in the central region today in the Mid-Continent area, or whether it's the NGL and Petchem liquids line, it's really going to be a matter of somebody that might be a better buyer for those assets. So I don't think we're going to be in a must-sell mode at all. I think we're going to be very much in an opportunistic mode, and looking to see if somebody can make better use out of the asset than what see it. And so I think that's kind of the two areas you should think about. And to whether or not we'll blow pass that $2 billion number is very dependent on how hungry the market is and how nice the pricing we could get.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And just a couple of follow up. Once Geismar is sold, I believe you've talked about your commodity exposure would be around 3% going forward. So kind of the recent spike in NGL prices shouldn't necessarily have much of an impact. But when you think about the impact on your producer customers, are you seeing economics improving in some regions as a result, are there some green shoots where customers are starting to step up? And maybe in some specific areas, possibly the Eagle Ford and the Northeast, I was wondering if you can sort of give us the land as to where you see opportunities and where things are going to roll from here?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I think it's very interesting to me right now looking at the natural gas picture. And we continue to see U.S. production continuing to fall. And yet, the market doesn't seem to be responding all much that yet. That is going to come home to roost. But I will say that when we did see some length in the market in 2017, we did see some activities in the west. We start to see a few rigs come back in the west. Walt and his team has done a great job of capturing business out there as that's occurred. And we also saw quite a bit of activity in the northeast. I think the number of pad connections that are being requested right now in the northeast is really catching my attention, and Jim Scheel and his team have been doing a good job of capturing that business. So I'd say it's more than green shoots in places like the Northeast because those are firm add requests. But it's going to have to come on stronger, I think, in what we're seeing so far to arrest the kind of production declines that we're seeing in the U.S. right now. And so yes we're seeing some resurgence, but I don't think it's enough, frankly, because I think we're kind of got spoiled leaning on DUCs and tie-ins with existing – of new production during 2016, and we've kind of been lulled to sleep on the fact that our productions continue to decline pretty dramatically on U.S. natural gas. So I feel, I think 2017 is going to be a very interesting year for U.S. natural gas, and I definitely think we're going to have to see some resurging activity in the Northeast, in the Rockies, and we have seen some resurgence in the Haynesville as well.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Great. And one final question on constitution. Given the recent changes in Washington, do you see the odds of success increasing with this project? Are there things that we should be looking for out of the FERC, or should we be focused on the state in this scenario?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: I'm very, very encouraged about Constitution as we sit here today. I think it's becoming very evident that it's a critical pipeline in terms of serving gas demand and power generation needs for the northeast. That issue is getting louder and louder, and it's going to continue to be because there's no way to ignore it. In addition to that, I would tell you, the labor unions who obviously have had a pretty big voice in the Trump administration are very much on our side, and I think are going to be really pressing hard on the administration on that issue. And so, I think, there's a lot of people with their hands in the air right now in DC, and trying to get attention drawn to their particular projects or their particular issues they need to resolve, and we're certainly one of those. And I think Constitution is going to be a great example of one that can bring jobs and critical infrastructure. And so, I think, it's extremely well positioned to get some attention at the Federal level, and hopefully we'll be able to work something out with the state and do that in an amicable way. But I think there are several avenues that that can be impressed at the Federal level if the state does not want to cooperate.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you very much. Appreciate the color.
Operator: Next is Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning. If I can just talk about the – I think, in your slides in January, you talked about 20 prospective projects that are not in the backlog right now. Can you just talk about the returns you would expect to get on this? I think, you're building your current backlog at around 6 times to 7 times EBITDA build multiples. Is that kind of what you're looking at for the next wave? And then, if you can give us some sense of the capital there, again, I think of $100 million to $200 million. So, if we get them all, are we talking $2 million to $4 million or could the number be higher than that?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. So, just few things here. First of all, as I mentioned, the Southeast trail project is a good example, the one I mentioned we have an open season on. We'll be able to – I don't need to make this sound too easy, but we basically will be making decision between size and return on that project. And so, the larger it gets, the lower our return will go. But at the smaller level, we can make a very high return. So, obviously as we look at our cost of capital, that's a critical analysis for us to look at. But I would say, we certainly have the opportunity on that project to be in the 6 times to 7 times level, maybe even higher than that. But then, you also have projects, for instance, on – big projects up in the Northeast that are fully cost of service, so like the Rockaway Beach lateral – sorry, the Northeast Supply Enhancement project. Some of those projects are cost of service projects. Hillabee is a good example of a cost of service. We make a lower return on those projects because they are – I mean, we don't have any construction risk on those projects. And so, those are more in the 8 multiple level but, I would say, probably the mix is probably more like 80% of higher return and 20% at our fully cost of service projects that are out there. And in terms of the size, yeah, that number is probably about right. I think, we certainly see capabilities of continuing to invest in the $2.5 billion range for quite some time on an annual basis based on these projects coming in.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's great. Very helpful. Thank you. Next question. So you've got these targets out there for leverage for 2017. I guess, I'm wondering what the targets are beyond that, if you can help us both on WPZ standalone and then WMB consolidated?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Don, do you want to take it?
Donald R. Chappel - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Hey, Ted. It's Don. No, we haven't disclosed the specific targets. But certainly, we want to be squarely solid within our ratings. So, I'd say, somewhere in that 4.0 to 4.5 is kind of the right zip code. And again, we're trending down, and I think that's directionally where we're heading.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: 4 to 4.5 for WPZ. And then, for WMB?
Donald R. Chappel - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Again, we have a sort of target out there. We have disclosed that we plan to pay down some debt, $500 million this year, and we would expect some excess coverage again in 2018 that would enable us to pay down some additional debt. So, that consolidated leverage would be coming down at the same time as PZ leverage.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then, again, with the big change in the restructuring, just economically WMB is of course much more dependent on what WPZ does. I guess, again longer-term, what are your target coverage levels for WPZ? Is there any reason why you would retain excess cash flow there and not pay it up in distribution that would then come up to WMB?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: I think it's prudent to maintain some excess coverage to fund your capital as well as to provide a buffer against risk, whether it's delays in projects or anything else. And we think that the market provides attractive valuation when the market doesn't worry much about coverage. So, I think, we'll plan to maintain a sufficient amount of coverage that the market doesn't worry about it, and as well to provide some level of funding for capital.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. And then, a last one for me. You've sort of spoken about the Northeast gathering business and kind of the uplift you could see. It looks like we've got better visibility now on Rover maybe and Rainleaf (53:51) and some other big takeaway projects. How much of an impact does that have on your volumes in the Northeast there, Southwest Pennsylvania and the Utica?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Really excited about that project pushing ahead, really excited about any and all takeaway projects just because we've got so much leverage in the Northeast in terms of our gathering systems. So, excited to see that getting off of high center. And yes, I would say, the areas that are going to be enhanced by that, certainly the dry gas Utica is going to get a nice pick-up off of that. That's where a lot of that gas will come from as well as the Southwest Marcellus area as well. And so, we're starting to see a lot of those assets fall into the hands of better capitalized and really great operators up in the basin there in the Southwest PA area. And so, we really think we're going to see some big pull when Rover comes on. We saw a little bit of improvement from REX 3. We see TETCO M2, Zone M2 trading up a little bit over the Northeast Pipeline index as that opened up. And so – but I think, with Rover coming on, we'll see a lot of people preparing to meet their obligations on Rover, and we're excited to see our volume get a lift off of that.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. I'll leave it at that. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Tom Abrams with Morgan Stanley.
Tom Abrams - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, thanks. Just a follow-up on that balance sheet questioning. If you could start from scratch, would you have any debt at the MB level?
Donald R. Chappel - The Williams Cos., Inc.: I think it's a theoretical question. So I'm not sure how to answer that, because we...
Tom Abrams - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Well, let's put it this way. As time goes by, why wouldn't you just continue to pay WMB down to towards zero?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Again, I think that's a policy question I think the board will have to take on in time. I think, right now, we're focused on paying down debt with our excess coverage. I think, beyond our guidance period. I think we'll have to wait and see what direction the board chooses to take. Just to kind of point out, we do have a revolver balance that is efficient to pay down. We don't have bonds that are due, so anything we do in the bonds would be open market purchases or tenders, which would likely be pretty inefficient. So, again, I think, the near-term focus will be paying down the WMB revolver.
Tom Abrams - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right. And then, also on, I recall, a month or two ago that your taxpayer status was out – no taxes to 2025, maybe 2024 with the Geismar sale. In slide 12, you have a footnote there about – at least through 2020. I just wondered if that's the nature of your new guidance, or if something has changed in the general picture.
Donald R. Chappel - The Williams Cos., Inc.: I think, our prior guidance was, we do not expect to be a cash (56:55) payer through 2020. Beyond that will be a function of future capital investment. I think, we do have significant capital opportunities to invest, which would provide a tax shield beyond 2020. But we've not provided any guidance beyond 2020.
Tom Abrams - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Next to Faisel Khan at Citi.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Now, Alan, with most of the restructuring now out of the way, and sort of the balance sheet sort of getting close to where you guys want it to be, how are you thinking about acquisitions, either bolt-on acquisitions or larger transactions or are you even thinking about these sort of opportunities at all?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Faisel, we certainly are. We're certainly looking at areas up in the Northeast where there are some great synergies between various operating systems up there. And so, we certainly have got our eyes on that. I think that the market vantage points have to come together to get to a trade there. But certainly there's a lot of operational synergies to be had up there. And as any basin does as it matures, those opportunities come together. And so, I think, right now, we're continuing to focus on honing our unit operating costs being as low as we can where we are, but with an eye to the future for what kind of capital efficiencies can be gained between us and some of the systems that we have joint ventures in. So, pretty excited about the way the Northeast will roll up there. But I'd say, that's probably the primary area that we've got our eyes on, because we see so much operational synergy. It's not necessarily a financial transaction for us. It's really just the improvement in operating cash flows that we think we can get out of those areas. So, we'll continue to look at those, but obviously we have to come to a meeting of the minds between the buyer and the seller to get there.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then, last question for me. Just – after the financial repositioning announcement you guys made on January 9, is there any significant change to your deferred tax asset from doing that transaction in terms of what we'll see in the 10-K when it comes out?
Donald R. Chappel - The Williams Cos., Inc.: No, but we did pick up a higher share of the depreciation deductions. So, again, depreciation deductions are now 74% claimed by Williams versus the 58% that we had previously. So, we will pick up somewhat higher shield.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Understood. Thanks.
Operator: To Jeremy Tonet at JPMorgan.
Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning. Thanks for sneaking me in the end here. And just wanted to touch based on the Central segment that had stepped down a bit quarter-over-quarter. And I was just wondering if you could dive into that, maybe a little bit more granularity? And let us know if you thought that could be bouncing back a bit in the first Q, also knowing that you had sold some of those assets there?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I think, Jeremy, probably the primary issue there was the $23 million impact that was a pretty complicated story there. But we basically were taking a charge from the fact that we booked the MVCs from prior periods. And so, once that MVC was paid down, so there's a $23 million one-time impact there in the fourth quarter that certainly impacted Central that you wouldn't see on an ongoing basis. I don't know, Walt, do you have anything to add to that?
Walter J. Bennett - The Williams Cos., Inc.: No, I think, there were some volume declines, but I think we'll see if that's holding pretty flat going forward, additional activity will keep it – any declines at bay.
Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great, thanks. And then, maybe just touching on the West transaction a bit there, if you could give a little bit of color as far as how you think the volumes are trending there or any synergies that you can bring to that asset with your increased ownership or other plans you might have?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Not a whole lot of synergies to be gained further there as we sit here today because we are the operator already on those assets. Certainly, I'd say, we're extracting all we can there today. So I don't really see a big pick-up in synergies. I think, really the big story there is, as Atlantic Sunrise and other projects and hopefully Constitution now start to open up that Northeast PA to market see volume growth outside of just the current JVs that we have that can utilize some of our presence in the area. And so, I think that will be a real positive for us as that area gets exposed to the market. We're very convinced that that area is going to have to come alive in a big way to keep up with the market demand once the takeaway infrastructure is built. So, we're very bullish on the area. But there's not really a whole lot to be said about operational synergies that we're not capturing.
Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: That's helpful. That's it from me. Thanks.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. Mr. Armstrong, at this time, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any closing or additional comments.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Okay. Well, thank you all very much for joining us. Really pleased to report another strong quarter. And again, just want to thank the organization here at Williams and employees for their dedication to continuing to perform so well despite a pretty rocky year. I would tell you, we are all very excited and looking forward to 2017 and really putting the focus on growing the business as we deliver some of these big projects here in 2017. So, thank you very much for joining us. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Williams and Williams Partners Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John D. Porter - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thanks, Dana. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Earlier this morning, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily. Our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to questions, and we also have the five leaders of Williams' operating areas with us: Walter Bennett leads the West; John Dearborn leads NGL & Petchem Services; Rory Miller leads Atlantic-Gulf; Bob Purgason leads Central; and Jim Scheel leads the Northeast Gathering & Processing area. In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to generally accepted accounting principles. These reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials. We're planning on keeping our call to about an hour. If we miss any of your questions, feel free to follow up with Investor Relations later on today. And with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Great. Well, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We're glad you've been able to join us this morning and we look forward to discussing our third quarter results here this morning. As you can see from this quarter's results, our organization is firing on all cylinders, and it continues to capture opportunities as we execute against our proven natural gas focused strategy. We're very confident about where we stand today, and our team is aligned and excited about all the great prospects that we've got in front of us. We've been taking decisive actions to enable steady predictable growth in our EBITDA by steadily increasing our fee-based revenues, lowering our cost and positioning our portfolio of assets to capture growing natural gas volumes. We're making progress on many fronts as we work to execute on our strategy to drive predictable long-term sustainable growth. We've brought new projects online, renegotiated some win-win contracts with Chesapeake and expect to close on a new agreement in the Barnett soon. And we also completed the sale of our Canadian asset, and as you're aware, we also have now kicked off a process for our Geismar asset. That process is now in full swing. On the cost savings front, since our cost reduction efforts were initiated at the end of the first quarter this year, we've seen approximately $76 million of lower adjusted cost and expenses at WPZ versus the prior year, and that's all while continuing to add additional new projects and grow the business. Specifically, we've seen WPZ's total cost and expenses decline from 55% of 2015 adjusted EBITDA to 47% in 2016 for the first nine months. So, an important metric that we're taking into account there, and continue to push that cost component down to a lower percentage of our overall adjusted EBITDA. We continue to implement steps to further lower our cost by streamlining our organization, and to-date, head count has been reduced by a little over 13% since the beginning of this year. So today, we'll walk through our results and provide some perspective on where we are relative to guidance and financial performance. Our results here in the third quarter certainly validate the hard work of our teams across Williams. We'll also provide some update on the Atlantic Sunrise project and highlight some of the key growth drivers that are now on horizon. So, let's move on to slide two. Here as you can see, Williams Partners delivered net income of $326 million as measured by GAAP, and in terms of adjusted EBITDA, every segment of WPZ contributed to the 8% improvement over the third quarter of last year. Our DCF for the quarter was $795 million, which was an increase of 5% over the third quarter of 2015. As we've been doing consistently, we delivered fee-based revenue growth and we continue to benefit from the aggressive cost reduction activities we've been working on this year. We achieved a coverage ratio of 1.08x at WPZ for the quarter, which excludes the benefit of $150 million IDR waiver that was associated with the sale of our Canadian asset. And as you all know, that sale was finalized, I believe on September 23. Overall, the quarter's results continue to demonstrate that our strategy is on the mark, so let's just touch briefly on a few of the operating areas, first of all, in the Atlantic-Gulf. The Atlantic-Gulf continues to deliver solid results as we put projects into service that are capturing more and more of the demand on the Transco system. Our adjusted EBITDA came in at $427 million for the quarter compared with $414 million for the third quarter of last year. And for the year, Atlantic-Gulf's adjusted EBITDA increased $53 million so far year-to-date, primarily due to fee-based revenues from offshore operations and Transco's new expansion projects. The quarter also benefited from incremental volumes that came into our Mobile Bay system from the Destin Pipeline System as we were providing service to volumes that were stranded behind enterprise's path to do a processing plant. We did see increased operating expenses related to pipeline testing activities as we continue to proactively focus on safety and regulatory programs along our Transco pipeline. Obviously given the tremendous growth on the Transco system, we continue to focus on and ensure the safety and reliability of this critical piece of infrastructure. And so, solid results in the Atlantic-Gulf. As we'll see later, lots of things coming down the pike to prepare for the tremendous growth in this sector of our business. Moving on now to our Central, Northeast and West. I'd like to cover our non-regulated midstream set of businesses here because we continue to see some common themes emerging across all of these operating areas. First of all, we have grown their adjusted EBITDA versus the prior year for both the quarter and also year-to-date. As you can see from the chart on the slide, Central is up about 7%, Northeast up 3% and West up 3% on the quarter-to-quarter comparison. All three of these businesses reported lower operating cost during the quarter. Our leaders and teams are very focused on preserving operational cash flows in today's slower supply growth environment, and we continue to see the benefits of that show-up in our results. A specific note about the Northeast because I know there's always a lot of extra interest in this particular area. We continue to see steady to slightly increasing volumes there, but this area remains in significant need of incremental takeaway capacity and market in the area. We believe that both the local and the national demand growth is going to really unlock the area over the next couple of years. But in the meantime, we're staying very focused on the cost containment and achieving the best results for our customers. Getting all of this critical new midstream plays as well has us positioned for when this tremendous low cost resource really comes on in the next couple of years, and we really do believe that the natural gas demand that we're seeing on the Transco system will call on these constrained supplies once the infrastructure that connects that comes online. The unleashing of this resource and expected dramatic growth in the gathering volumes from this area represents tremendous upside beyond the more visible demand side growth that shows up in our CapEx. On the NGL-Petchem side, we saw an increase in adjusted EBITDA driven by higher olefins margins and strong operational production levels. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased by $51 million to $136 million in the third quarter of 2015. And as I mentioned earlier, we also completed the sale of our Canadian asset, and we are off and running in a big way on our process to monetize Geismar. This Geismar facility and the complex there really is a great asset, and we believe it's a good time to be in the market with the asset. There's a lot of very smart players in this segment, and a recognition of just how well placed this efficient plant is in the Mississippi River market. So, let's move on now to slide three. As we've been saying, our natural gas focused strategy is proving out and our year-to-date performance certainly validates that. Year-to-date through third quarter of this year, WPZ delivered $286 million in net income and nearly $2.3 billion in DCF, up 8% over the same period last year. And we also achieved a year-to-date coverage ratio of 1.04x at WPZ here so far in 2016. I'm also pleased to report that we expect to exceed our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance and also expect to hold coverage above 1.0 times as measured for all of 2016, even with the expected seasonal increase in maintenance CapEx that we generally see in the fourth quarter. As you can see, all of our operating areas are ahead of where they were a year ago, and you can see the results of our focus on increased fee-based revenues, cost reductions, and the full production and higher margins coming through at Geismar. Let's move on to slide four. This is a list of a lot of what's going on, and I'm not going to go through each of these items. But really the important thing is, here is this long list of accomplishments that the team continues to execute on. And so, what's really impressive about this is all of the activity that we've got going on that's driving our growth for the future. Just to mention a few here, highlight a few. First of all, look at the number of projects that we began construction on in this quarter. And so, Dalton, Hillabee Phase 1, the New York Bay expansion, and Virginia Southside 2. Our teams really have pushed through the permitting gauntlet on these projects and are now really focused on safely constructing these important expansion projects. We also have a number of projects that were already under construction. Moving down on the list, the Geismar process, as I mentioned earlier, we have launched that process, and we're really excited about the degree of interest we're seeing there. And then finally, on the coming soon part down there, in addition to all the projects that we've got going on, we are making a move to simplify our organization further here in 2017, and we're moving from five operating areas to three operating areas, which is going to enable some further cost reductions over and above those that we captured here in 2016. Moving on to slide five, a picture now of Atlantic Sunrise. Lots of questions, of course, coming out of the announcement from FERC that they were pushing back their approval by about two months. So, Atlantic Sunrise is a very key piece of energy infrastructure that is going to drive, not just jobs in the Northeast and particularly Pennsylvania, but really the overall national economy, as these low cost, very strong gas supplies here in the Northeast are going to enable manufacturing, power generation, and a lot of new trade around the world, for markets around the world for our low-cost natural gas here in the U.S. So, the Atlantic Sunrise system really does have a unique advantage, in that it's one of the few of these major projects that takes advantage of the existing Transco infrastructure and by building the segment that we have that's just new pipeline in Pennsylvania, all contained within the State of Pennsylvania. We're going to be able to reach markets in a very significant way all the way into the Southeast markets where there's a lot of growing demand, be it coal conversions, natural gas power generation, the industrial markets and, of course, the LNG facility at Cove Point there is an important market for those supplies as well. So, we announced on last Friday that we expect to begin a portion of service during the second half of 2017 and that we've revised the targeted full in-service date for mid 2018. I would note that, as we have previously, that our financial plan further risks (13:50) the cash flows by approximately six months, and we've already adjusted our growth capital guidance to reflect this analysis. We revised these dates because FERC now anticipates the completion date of the FEIS for Atlantic Sunrise will be pushed back to December 30, 2016. This adjustment will allow more time for the agency to complete a general conformity analysis and review two minor route alternatives. Additionally, we're focused on expediting the work required to obtain other key permits within the State of Pennsylvania. To provide a little more context on this, the construction schedule on a project as large as Atlantic Sunrise is very tightly sequenced. Even a minor two-month delay on one aspect can have a ripple effect on other components of the project schedule, some of which are dependent upon lining up with a narrow environmental schedule. So the good news is, we've got about 96% of the survey work done, that means the landowners are cooperating with us in a way to get the survey work done. And we are pushing ahead to get the remaining 4% of that done. So, a lot of activity going on to get the survey work done. Of course, if you think about the way these windows work, the field survey work has to be done in a period where there's not any snow on the ground, and so that does put some risk into our schedule that, obviously, is the reason that we push some of this back. Because, if we don't get those surveys done before snowfall, and it certainly looks like that's not going to be the case, then we've got to wait to get those final surveys done once we've seen things thaw out there. So, that really is what's driving some of that scheduled push-back. So, again, seems like a simple two months, but it does complicate things, in terms of getting those surveys done in a timely-enough manner. I will say this about Atlantic Sunrise. This is a situation where the regulatory agencies are being very cautious, given all of the environmental opposition, and it's been focused around pipelines of late. We think that's prudent, and I would tell you that Governor Wolf has been very steadfast in his support for the project, and really all of the critical energy infrastructure project in Pennsylvania, and he continues to be clear in his support through that, with his legislature and with other elected officials in the state, and we really do appreciate his cooperation, as he has a lot of issues to balance. But we certainly support the Governor in making sure that the resources are developed in a way that protects the environment and the health of the citizen. And we share his commitment, and look forward to our continued work with the PADEP there, which is the regulatory agency in Pennsylvania, to meet all these objectives. So, feeling very good about the degree of cooperation and support that we're getting from the State of Pennsylvania, but it's just a matter of people being very cautious in the environment that we're operating. With that, let's move on to slide six. You can see here the key growth drivers for 2017. Of course, the obvious stuff is the full year impact of a lot of these projects that came on mid-year, and then a lot of new projects that will be coming on in 2017 that you can see listed here. And then, of course, the full year of cost reduction efforts will show up in 2017 as well as likely some additional contributions from the streamlining that I mentioned earlier. Another consideration, of course, is just the impact that a normal winter would have on the Northeast local market demand for the regional consumption there in the Northeast. And so, if you think about that, there's two ways for gas to move out of those gathering systems in the Northeast. One is the takeaway capacity and we're certainly anxious to see the latest REX expansion come on here towards the end of this year. But in addition to that, we also have the regional consumption and with the very mild winter we had last year, we are hoping to see some incremental demand that would drive gathering volumes in the Northeast as well. Moving on here to slide seven, really excited about the strengthening of our board and what's going on here in the third quarter as we've added five new members to The Williams' board and we're in the process of recruiting two additional members. The five new members are certainly energy industry experts and each brings significant experience and have unique perspectives they're bringing to the table. I can tell you firsthand that the new directors, Steve Bergstrom, Steve Chazen, Peter Ragauss, Scott Sheffield, and Bill Spence have hit the ground running and are very engaged in helping us maximize shareholder value. They're working with the rest of the highly-qualified and independent board to keep the management team accountable and focused on our execution as that continues to deliver shareholder value. I do want to take a moment here to just recognize three members of the board who have chosen to not stand for reelection at our Annual Meeting in November in order to support our ongoing board refreshment efforts. And that is Joe Cleveland, John Hagg, Juanita Hinshaw, and really all three have given tremendous service to Williams over the years. They've been involved with us and we're extremely grateful for their leadership, commitment to the company and to our stockholders. Williams' stockholders can certainly be confident that this independent board is working diligently on its behalf and we, as a management team, are really excited about that. With that, we'll move on to slide eight. So, today the premier natural gas asset base in the nation is delivering fee-based revenue that amounts to about 93% of WPZ's gross margin. There's tremendous demand growth occurring and continuing to come down the pike, and Transco is the energy lifeline that physically connects Williams to that growth. The team has delivered continuous growth and the third quarter of 2016 is no exception. We believe that the natural gas focused strategy that we're executing on has us exactly where we need to be today and well-positioned for a large degree of upside in the future as the natural gas market grows on the back of this very low-cost resource base, and we'll really draw on the Northeast and drive strong growth in our volumes in the Northeast, as that occurs. We're continuing to capture fee-based opportunities. We're reinvesting in Williams' Partners and we've taken swift, decisive actions to strengthen the balance sheet, reduce risk, and focus on driving shareholder value. So, once again, we thank you very much for joining us today. And, with that, let's move on to questions.
Operator: Thank you. And we'll go first to T.J. Schultz with RBC Capital Markets.
T.J. Schultz - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. Thanks. Maybe if I can just start with Geismar, just any color at this point on your bent toward an outright sale or to try to convert to a tolling structure. And then if you could just discuss what type of counterparties you're engaging with under each scenario, that may be helpful, too. Thanks.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Sure. Thank you very much for the question. We remain open. We're going to look to whatever the best value is in terms of those two opportunities. I would say on the sell side, of course, it's going to be a party that we're confident that can close the transaction swiftly and puts a very best value proposition on the table. As to the tolling arrangement, a little more dependent on the personal nature there because I think somebody we would be involved with for the long term and, of course, it would have to be somebody with a strong credit to stand behind the obligations of the tolling agreement. So, I would just say we remain open to both, but we'll have to see what the best value comes through there. I will say really long, long and large list of parties engaging with us on that, and we're really excited to see the way that asset is positioned in the market right now.
T.J. Schultz - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. I guess, just one more on Atlantic Sunrise with that push-out, kind of two parts. I guess, first, with that risked I think in your financial plan by six months, do you essentially have that full service in your plan for the beginning of 2019? And then the second part, just given that timeline or even if we assume it comes online in mid-2018, I guess, the question is just really around the DRIP or more WMB support, does that change the timing or how long or what degree you would need to keep participating? Or is there any other support you may need in 2018 as you kind of – keeping that IG rating at WPZ?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Great. Thank you very much for the question. I'll take the first part of that and I'll turn the second half over there to Don for the financing side of that. In terms of the schedule, I think couple of key things that are coming through in the change in the schedule. First of all, really excited to be announcing that we're going to be able to bring on the mainline portion of that project, which is obviously really important in the Northeast, to take gas out of the Northeast down into the Southeast markets that we'll be able to do that in the second half of 2017. So, that's pretty exciting. Then there's another section that we likely would be able to bring on, which would be the pipeline, the new pipeline itself that would come on second and as soon as it was constructed would come on second. And then finally, and this is where that final date that we talk about would be the compressor stations that are on the new pipeline, not the existing but brand new compressor stations that would come on to add some incremental volume to the project. And that part would come on six months after the mid-2018 so whether you want to call that, end of 2018 or first part of 2019 is going to splitting hairs a little bit there perhaps, but that is what our expectation are. But I think very important is the amount of volumes that we can bring on with the first section coming online in the second half of 2017 and then later the pipeline section that would be carrying gas out of the Susquehanna County and Bradford County areas, and that would be coming on ahead of that final section, which would be in our risk financial segment would be either very end of 2018. And so, I think in terms of the clarifying that our team is very focused on bringing this mid-2018 date to reality. But, as always, we put further financial risk into our plan to allow for all the regulatory uncertainties that all of us in the pipeline industry are facing these days. So, with that, I'll turn it over to Don to talk about the financing side.
Donald R. Chappel - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Alan. Certainly, the target date change or our financial plan date change related to ASR reduces the 2017 CapEx and related financing needs somewhat. We're not making any, I'll call it, formal change in our financing plans at this point as we continue to drive our credit metrics up or improve, I'll say it that way, in an effort to ensure that we have strong credit metrics, we get credit from the agencies, and we continue to delever WPZ and WMB. But nonetheless, the fact that there's less of a bubble in 2017 I think is helpful in terms of 2017's financing plan. But I think, as you point out, it does push some of the capital into 2018. As to how we'll finance that, we're not prepared to provide any guidance on that today.
T.J. Schultz - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thank you, guys.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: We'll go next to Brandon Blossman with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everyone.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Good morning.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Just a quick follow-up on Atlantic Sunrise. So, I guess, one, it's (27:39) to say that the vast majority of the permitting or regulatory risk resides with the greenfield portion of the pipe and not the new compression stations on the mainline, is that correct?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: That is correct. And just to be clear, most of the work on the mainline is just turning around. And for those involved in the project, they'll scold me on this when I say just, but it's a matter of redoing a lot of the station piping on those existing compressor sites that is required at the second half of 2017 in-service for the mainline.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: And then as we think about second half 2018 in-service for mainline reversals, how should we think about EBITDA associated with that? And in terms of contracts or counterparties and who can actually flow on that portion of the line?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Of course, we'll be working through that. I would tell you that we've seen a lot of strong interest and people have started to acknowledge that that likely would occur, and that's what we've done in the past as well. When we've had projects come on that have involved mainline, we opened up that capacity, as it's been made available. So, we don't have any specifics on that yet in terms of how much that EBITDA would be, but it will allow for some pretty significant flows to the South coming out of the mainline in Southeast Pennsylvania area there. So, other big interconnects coming off of other pipelines will now have a way South. And I think if you think about how the demand would look, all you need to look at is Zone 6 on Transco versus the Southeast market, you see that differential there, and you would see the amount of demand that would be available for that capacity. So, we're not going to pin that down yet because we haven't finalized the negotiations for that but, obviously, there's plenty of demand for that service.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Thanks, Alan. And then switching gears back to Geismar, obviously, a very good quarter, Q3. Last quarter, Q2, you had said or mentioned that at least to some degree you're holding back inventory to sell onto Q3 on expectations of better margins. Obviously, you got that. Just in terms of capacity factors in-quarter for Geismar and inventory levels, are you thinking about anything like that again for Q4, in terms of holding back some production?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: I'll turn that to John Dearborn, who is on the line with us.
John R. Dearborn - Williams Partners GP LLC: Yeah. Thanks, Brandon, and thanks for your interest in Geismar. Geismar has been running extraordinarily well, very reliably, and we're really pleased to be able to deliver ethylene again reliably to the market, and we've proven that out now for a year. As to your specific question about inventory, we came out of the first quarter with about 30 million pounds of inventory. We sold our full production during this past quarter. We held some inventory coming through this quarter with an expectation that – we pushed that expectation out into the fourth quarter, because we still do have a belief that some of these crackers that have been challenged in the third quarter will remain to be challenged in the fourth, and we may still see some better margin. So we actually, coming through the third quarter, built a little bit of inventory here on hopes that now the fourth quarter is going to give us a little bit of a better return on that.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you, John. Great color. That's it for me.
John R. Dearborn - Williams Partners GP LLC: Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thank you, Brandon.
Operator: We'll go next to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Maybe just on the earnings, if I could start with Atlantic-Gulf. You had a big step up in your non-regulated fee revenues versus what you did in the second quarter of 2016. I'm just trying to figure out the drivers there. Is this the new run rate? And then, I think you mentioned you got more volumes on Destin as well, because of Pascagoula being down. Maybe you can give us a number there, on how much that impacted you?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Sure. Thank you for the question. Certainly, the big driver for second versus third quarter and 3Q was having both the Tubular Bells business online, and remember, that had 30 days of shut-in in the second quarter as we tied in – as we did some of the work for the tie-in on Gunflint during the second quarter. So second quarter was abnormally low because of that big shut-in. But here in the third quarter, both Kodiak, Gunflint, and Tubular Bells were all producing. And so some improvements are going on out there. In fact, we've completed the mechanical completion on the second phase of the Gunflint capacity out there, so a lot of important work still going on out there in terms of enabling further flows. So, that was a big driver. Then, as we did mention, the Pascagoula plant was down, and our team went to work very quickly to make some big offshore interconnect in the July timeframe, June and July timeframe, that enabled us to bring that gas in very quickly. So great work on the team's part of getting that work, first getting it permitted, and then very quickly bringing it on. So, that didn't just fall on our laps, it was great work on the team's part to get that in. We expect that, I think, enterprise have said they expect to start bringing Pascagoula back up in December now. And so, we would expect to get a couple of months in now here in the fourth quarter from that. And, in terms of impact, I don't think we specifically said how much that was, but you can see some of the impact to our volume, I think it was about 200 million a day, maybe 210 million of volume that's come in to the system from that. Just to get an idea of what that's done to gathering volumes in the Eastern Gulf.
John R. Dearborn - Williams Partners GP LLC: Alan, some of that shows up in fee revenues, some of that shows up in liquids margin as well. So, it's not all impacting fee revenue, I might just point that out.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thanks, John.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then, if we can just talk through your renewed Barnett gathering agreement. Some of the parameters or assumptions you are making to get to that $240 million loss of undiscounted cash flows, I think you put in the press release. So, there are volume assumptions behind that. Can you quantify what percentage of Henry Hub the new gathering agreement's at? Maybe what other things we should be thinking about in terms of rig count or what not to get to that number?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Let me have Bob Purgason take that, please?
Robert S. Purgason - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Let me just kind of recap what we've done. Is right – we traded the minimum volume commitment numbers for, in essence, a percentage-of-NYMEX contract. For competitive reasons, we're not ready to say what percentage of NYMEX that is, but it's set to, in fact, hopefully incent the drill bit. In addition, we have contractual obligations for the producer there to spend certain amounts of money on drilling and recompletion work during the next two years of the contract. So, we're anticipating that we'll at least lessen the decline, maybe even get some pick up, depending on what the completion technology does today. And it's really – the cash difference that we indicated was the difference between that absolutely no MVC and what our projected volume and revenue difference was during the period through mid-2019, when the MVCs ended. On a present value basis, we picked that up and it's a present value neutral transaction to us, but we did have a slight cash difference in the next two years.
Donald R. Chappel - The Williams Cos., Inc.: And this is Don. I'll just add that the price assumption that we had, I think, when we put out the disclosure was basically forward strip prices at the time. And a modest amount of arresting of the decline. So, again, the drilling that Bob described would slow the decline somewhat.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's great. And then, just a follow-up on Atlantic Sunrise. So, are you in a position where you can tell us the amount of volume you'll actually move on these, sounds like three phases, the main line and then the new pipeline and then the compression, or are you still working through that?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yes, we are. So, we haven't detailed that out yet. We are working on that. I would tell you that, of course, the mainline will be prepared for – move all of the volume South of the project, but it's got to have deliveries from the North, pressures from the North to be able to do that. So that'll be somewhat dependent on what comes in from other interconnects in terms of really getting down to a specific volume coming from the Northeast. So, said another way, it's not going to be finite because we don't know exactly what the other interconnects are capable of delivering into that. Secondly, the pipeline portion, what's called the Central Penn and we just referred to as Northcentral Penn coming out of Susquehanna County, that pipeline will be capable of delivering a very large portion of the volumes from the North without the compression during most of the year. And so, in other words, just depending on other operating conditions on the pipeline, but it will be a very substantial portion of the available volumes from the North.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. But you're not upsizing the site? In other words, the 1.7 dekatherms a day I think, that is still confident for (37:59).
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: That is correct. That's right.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. That's it for me. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Shneur Gershuni with UBS.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning, guys.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Good morning.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Just a couple of quick clarifications to some of your earlier responses. When you had said that there was a lot of interest in Geismar, does that mean that the data room is now open and people have actually expressed interest formally or is it just more in conversations?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: No. The formal. We have opened that and we're in the process of getting all the NDRs (38:38) resolved, but that process hasn't actually kicked off.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Great. And then in some of your responses about the Atlantic-Gulf performance, I was wondering if I can ask the question in a different way. The level of EBITDA generation this quarter, does that fully reflect the run rate for the new plants that came online, Kodiak and so forth? Or is there a little bit more to step up there as well too?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. We always hate to get ahead of the producers and their announcements of volumes out there. But I would tell you, I think, Hess has been pretty clear that they've been doing some rework on their wells out there on the Tubular Bells field. And as well, as I mentioned earlier, we did in the quarter complete – get to the mechanical completion part for the Phase 2 of Gunflint – for Gunflint, which allows additional capacity for both Gunflint and Tubular Bells out there. So, we would expect to see some improved volumes coming on here into the fourth quarter and first quarter of next year from those prospects.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And one last final question. Alan, you guys have been fairly successful in bringing down cost for over a year at this stage right now if I sort of think about it. Your head count is down 13% I think you said earlier in the call. Should we think about this kind of level of O&M and SG&A as kind of the go forward rate? Or do you see incremental opportunities to bring down costs further on a go forward basis? How should we think about this sequentially I guess is my question.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thank you. First of all, I'll talk about the kind of the two issues that balance that. First of all, on the overhead and management side, our team is very committed to continuing to put pressure against the overhead cost side of our business, as well as the direct operating expense. When you go into an area, for instance like the Northeast, and you are rapidly growing things, it's very hard to really streamline your operations and really focus on cost reduction, at the same time you're trying to build up staff, training people and get your operation safe and reliable. And so, that business, as it's gained its scale and its footprint is very well positioned and out to really take out some cost, likewise our Central area has just done a tremendous job there because, if you think about the pattern of growth and build out that had gone there for several years, that has slowed down in terms of that pattern of build out. And so, the management team has done a great job of redirecting their focus as a management team on safe and reliable and even more cost efficient operations. And of course, out West, that team has taken that on kind of as their mantra and they're very, very focused on constantly lowering their unit cost. So, that's really driving a lot of that in terms of the cost reduction. I do think it's sustainable on the one hand. On the other hand, I would tell you that as we go into the pipeline operations, a lot of need to make sure that these pipelines are maintained extremely well. And I always tell people, I think that's a really terrible place to try to save money is in the place of doing a great job of maintaining your assets safely and particularly in these critical areas along the Transco and Northwest Pipeline and Gulfstream routes. And so, that's an area that I think, as you've seen a little bit in this quarter, we had a lot of hydro testing and repairs on the Leidy system and quite frankly we're not going to shy away from improving the system there whenever we have an opportunity to do that. And so, that's the cost side that will probably continue to pressure us up on the one side, but I think on the cost efficiency side and overall day-to-day cost, we'll continue to have opportunity to push that down.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Cool. All right, Alan. Thank you very much. Really appreciate the color.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Faisel Khan with Citi.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Good morning. Just a few questions. First, on the balance sheet, you guys are clipping away as you're revolving your debt balance at the WMB level, looks like $260 million a quarter. How long – I guess, what's the game plan for the pay down of debt at the MB level? How far do you want to take that debt level down?
Donald R. Chappel - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Faisel, this is Don. I think the amount that we're able to take it down in the quarter was aided by the Canadian proceeds. So, we don't see that same opportunity over the next several quarters. We do have a plan to, I would say, that continue to chip away at The Williams debt. But it'll be at a modest pace for the foreseeable future.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Got you. And then the $250 million investment in WPZ common units, were there any other third-parties that participated in that placement?
Donald R. Chappel - The Williams Cos., Inc.: That was a private placement. It wasn't offered to any third-parties. We'll take a look at what the DRIP program that will be upcoming here in the very near future. We'll see what that holds.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then on the cost of the Sunrise project, was there any change in the cost given the slight pushback in the timeline?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: No. We still are maintaining our cost targets on that front.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then, if I look at – going back to your, Alan, your comments around the volumes that will come online in the second half. So, is it fair to say that on the Leidy Southeast line which is, I guess, 0.5 Bcf a day that you'll be able to flow that entire volume down South in the second half of 2017? I think that's what I was trying to figure out if you're getting towards, but maybe I got it wrong.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. It's kind of hard to know exactly who will take that space on the main line. So, anybody that's got gas trapped in Zone 6 that can get in into the system. So, you have, of course, you have the big Texas Eastern TEMAX project that connects just north of this point. And so, there's a lot of – the expansion goes just north of that point. So, there's a lot of big interconnects like that that could supply gas into this and it'll just be a question of who wants to – where the gas is the cheapest I suspect as to where – whoever takes that capacity and utilizes that capacity, which would likely be the existing holders of the capacity for the full project. I suspect that given in the money that will be, I would be surprised if they don't take that. And if they do, it's just going to be a matter of where they buy the cheapest gas in the area to move it south.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And just how far south was that move, I guess from Station 210 or 195, and how far south will you be able to move it in the second half of 2017?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. So, that will be the full expansion that goes all the way to Station 85 at its further extent. And of course, one of the big delivery points there is to the Cove Point delivery point is one of the big takeaways for that. But the capacity kind of as designed goes all the way to Station 85.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Got you. And the last question from me. Just on the MVC in the quarter, I guess if I look at the adjustments or the add backs, that add back is a cash item or a non-cash item that's being actually added to adjusted EBITDA?
Donald R. Chappel - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Faisel, in the quarter, that's a non-cash item, so it's, I'll call it, a contractually expected MVC. Now, that will all be settled as we close the Barnett transaction with that $754 million payment.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Got you. Great. Thanks, guys.
Donald R. Chappel - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yes.
Operator: We'll go next to Darren Horowitz with Raymond James.
Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Alan, considering the currently expected Northeast takeaway project in-service dates across the board on the east side of the Marcellus and Utica, what impact do you think that's going to have on basis differentials over the next few quarters, specifically Dominion South, TETCO M2 versus Henry Hub? And more importantly, how do you think the Northeast market gets further rationalized regarding the amount of marketed pipe capacity versus that big growing magnitude of supply growth that's waiting on pipe to get out of the basin?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I think that's such a complex issue because it's very dependent on where the gas is. It's very dependent on what outlet markets each of that gathering volumes. I would say some of the big players that have done a great job, and I would include Cabot in that group that have done a great job of going out and finding incremental markets, whether it's local power generation that's coming on and have really used their scale to go out aggressively and capture some of those markets will be the parties that are advantaged. And so, this isn't the first time we as an industry have seen something like this. We saw this in the Rockies back when we had a $2.75 basis differential, and it worked itself out over time. People started to think it was never going to – we were never going to come over that barrier. And, today, we sit there with basis differentials of around 5%, often less in the Rockies today. So, I think we'll eventually get there. But it is a complex question, just given all the number of projects that are coming on and the interconnectivity of the pipelines to be able to address that. So, I would say that I think the Southwest markets probably are going to be picking up hopefully the REX expansion here in the very near future, which will be helpful to that area. And then, I think Atlantic Sunrise will be the next big adder to that area as we unload all that gas trapped up in Zone 6 on Transco with those projects coming online. And I do think that will – to your question, I do think that Atlantic Sunrise coming on will improve the Dominion South basis just because you got so much capacity between coming over on the TEMAX project that will have a chance to move South as well. That's pretty well trapped up there in that Zone 6 area today. So, I think it's going to take time for all these projects to come on, but I do think that we will see that basis collapse pretty substantially as we get into 2018.
Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then as a follow-up, just quickly on the discussion around Zone 6 on Transco, thinking about, as you mentioned, all that gas trapped behind the pipe. Over the next few quarters, what do you think that means for potential IT opportunities either back-haul initiatives at better economics or maybe just incremental EBITDA pull-through from walk-up shippers that are trying to arb basis? How do you think that plays out specifically for Northeast G&P profitability over the next couple of quarters?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. I think the market need to take advantage any time there is any little opportunity. And I would tell you, I think the market has been in this situation long enough now up there. It's probably rooted out most of the easy stuff in terms of little IT. Now, Transco is a good example of that where we've had Leidy limited on capacity here most of the summer. And that just got released and so that was held back because we had some pressure limitations on that pipeline that we needed to do some inspection before we returned to full pressure. We've done that. And so, that's a big – will be a positive in terms of incremental volumes out of the area. I actually think the biggest driver for incremental volumes out of the area is going to be the local load, as we hopefully have a more normal winner in the Northeast. That's actually going to allow for the local load to absorb some of that gas. And if that occurs, there will be some incremental IT opportunities on days when we could move the volumes out of the system because we've got good pressures and good load in the area. So, I think that's what you – probably the biggest driver for incremental IT is probably local load in the basin.
Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: We'll go next to Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital Markets.
Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks. Most of my questions have been hit. I had one quick follow-up. On Geismar, as you sort of further the strategic alternatives here, do you have a sense for when you will choose to go either way, with a toll or a sale?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Again, it'd be sometime when we see all the bids in the door, but I would expect that'd be towards the end of the first quarter, probably, before we would know which way we were going on them.
Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Good morning, Sharon.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: I was wondering if you could touch on, I guess, the new G&P contracts in the Powder River Basin and the potential impacts on cash flow, as well as any discussions about re-contracting in the Eagle Ford with Chesapeake?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah, sure. I'll take the Eagle Ford question, and I'll let Walt Bennett take the Niobrara question. On the Eagle Ford, I would just say that there's a lot of talk about that, but I think from our perspective, we're pretty happy with where we sit there. And we think that there's good business to be had by increasing volumes in the area which will, of course, serve to lower the rate just through lower volumes. And so, there may be some opportunity as we found in other areas, there may be some opportunities for marginal improvement there. But I think, from our perspective, we like the business out there and are anxious to see Chesapeake continue to be more and more successful, as they have been in their technical accomplishments out there. And so, we're excited to continue to work with them to see those volumes expand. And I'll turn the Niobrara question back to Walt.
Walter J. Bennett - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Sure. Thank you, Alan. So, on the Niobrara contract that we have agreement of terms on now, and we're working to finalize that into a definitive agreement. The way to think about that is that that will keep EBITDA near-term pretty steady for that gathering and processing system. And what we did in the agreement with Chesapeake is really aligned both the interests of Chesapeake and Jackalope, which is the JV between Williams and Crestwood, to make sure that it was incenting development of some of the other formations there. So, we got dedication of additional formations that we didn't have previously, and it allows Chesapeake to go out and explore those economically and see what the upside may be. So, as I said, it will be pretty consistent for EBITDA in the near term, and then there's definitely potential longer term as those new zones get explored, and hopefully Chesapeake is very successful at that.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks. That's helpful.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Great. Thanks, Walt.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: And just another question in terms of guidance. Given the strong quarter as well as your project updates, any change in 2016 guidance, as well as your leverage targets and potential distribution growth target for 2018?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. No, we haven't put anything out beyond 2016. And as I mentioned in my comments, we do expect to exceed the earlier guidance that we put out for 2016, but we haven't put a specific number on that. I think our business, if you look at how steady we've been in growing the business, I think it's fairly predictable here as we go – within a fairly tight range as we go into 2016 – or sorry, as we end 2016 – but we certainly expect to beat the earlier guidance for 2016. And we'll be making some decisions about when we announce the 2017 number, but certainly would intend to do that by the time we announce the fourth quarter where – either at the time we announce fourth quarter results or before that, for 2017. So, that's about all we have to offer on that.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Good morning, Craig.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: On Geismar – and I appreciate the update on the timing on that. If you did go up for a sale versus long-term tolling, how do you envision the impact on the DRIP with that? Could you materially reduce the amount of equity being raised through 2017?
Donald R. Chappel - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Craig, this is Don. I think it would depend on the sales price, and we would likely have a conversation with the rating agencies as well. So, obviously, we can lose EBITDA in the process. But qualitatively, the EBITDA is margin EBITDA, so just depending on where margins are. So, I think that will be something we'll decide once we see what the numbers look like from the process, and then take a look at what we think that means and have a conversation with the agencies.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Well, on that note, Don, obviously, given your enterprise multiple, a Geismar sale would be cash flow dilutive, but nobody is going to give those cash flows based on margins at the same kind of credit that they would, all these fee-based projects you're bringing on over the next couple of years, that could be being built at similar multiples. So, how much credit do you see the rating agencies giving you in terms of just derisking the business with the Geismar sale?
Donald R. Chappel - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Craig, I think that's unknown at this point. So, I think that will be dependent on kind of where margins are and really the rating agency point of view. So, you'd have to stay tuned for that. I think that's something that we'll know as we get closer to the end of the first quarter.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. And last question. Any updates on the broader industry M&A process?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Craig, no updates on that. I will say in terms of your prior question, we'll be down to around, I think, 2.5% of our business if we execute on a Geismar sale as well as the Canadian sale will be down to around 2.5% of our gross margin coming from direct commodity margins. And so, we would expect that certainly deserves some attention by the rating agencies. And so, I appreciate you pointing that out. But no, we don't have any updates on broader M&A picture.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Becca Followill with the U.S. Capital Advisors.
Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC: Good morning, guys.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Good morning.
Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC: Just back on Atlantic Sunrise, can you – I know you talked a little bit about volumes. Can you talk about when you start getting paid when the contracts kick in on the project? Does it wait until the entire thing is done or at least the portion that's without the compression in Pennsylvania?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: No, Becca. The way that would work is that – and as we've done in past situations, it would just be putting capacity and early in-service and people could elect, if they chose to, to pay the full contracted rate for the project to – for that portion of the service that's made available early. So, that's the way that works.
Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC: So, you're saying that you wouldn't get the contracted volumes until mid-2018 and it would be IT in the interim?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: No. The same service would be made available. Of course, that goes through a FERC process, just to be very clear. So, it's kind of not prudent for us to predict exactly how the FERC would (01:00:46). But in previous situations, we've been able to sell that service for whoever wants to take that firm available capacity in the earliest since they have a limited service, they don't have the full extent of the service available to them. Again, that is subject to the FERC's determination on that as we would apply to put portions in service early.
Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC: And then can you clarify, in the Pennsylvania portion of the line, how much capacity the compression adds?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: That's very determined by the pressures on the downstream system and whether the system is operating full design pressure. If the system is operating at normal operating conditions, it would be pretty substantial in getting up near 80% to 90% of the volumes. And on below normal days, even higher than that without that compression (01:01:49).
Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC: I think I'll follow-up because I'm unclear on that answer. And then, do you have any – how much volumes are shut in on your system in the Northeast in Q3?
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: No, we're not providing that this quarter. And mostly just because our customers have not wanted us to be advertising what that is for the benefits of their markets and we certainly want to be respectful of that. I will say, back on your earlier question, it's simply a matter that you have a pipeline in service, the compression is designed to make sure that you can have adequate pressures on the system and deliver at full design situation. So, when the pipeline does go into service, but you may not be at full peak design demands on the system, obviously, you can move more gas when you're off peak. And so, that's the reason that's not a simple question. I mean, it's very dependent on what the operating conditions are on the pipeline at the time.
Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Alan for any additional or closing remarks.
Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.: Okay. Well, great. Well, thank you all very much. I do have one thing to add here, just a congratulations to our team that has been working so hard to gain closure on the Barnett transaction with Total. So, we do have a new large customer there in the Barnett via Total as that has closed here this morning. And so, congratulations to our team that has worked so hard to get that closed and we're excited to be working with Total to improve their returns and volumes on that system. So, thank you all very much for joining us and look forward to speaking to you in the fourth quarter. Bye.
Operator: Again, that does conclude today's presentation. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Williams and Williams Partners Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John D. Porter - Head-Investor Relations: Yeah. Thanks, Keith. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include yesterday's press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily. Our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to questions, and we also have the five leaders of Williams' operating areas with us: Walter Bennett leads the West; John Dearborn leads NGL & Petchem Services; Rory Miller leads Atlantic-Gulf; Bob Purgason leads Central; and Jim Scheel leads the Northeast Gathering & Processing area. In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to generally accepted accounting principles. These reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials. There are a lot of calls today. So we're planning on keeping our call to about an hour. If we miss any of your questions, feel free to follow up with Investor Relations later on today. And with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Great. Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We're certainly glad to have you here this morning. And we've got quite a bit of information to go through, and we do have a tight timeline. So I'll try to move through this pretty quickly and then turn it over to Don for some comments, and I'll come back and close. So I'd like to start off today just telling you something I'm very proud of relative to Williams, and really that is how this organization has stuck together and despite a lot of the upstairs issues and a lot of the distractions has remained very focused on executing our strategy, which our entire team is very excited about and just couldn't be more proud of the way the organization has really rallied and is absolutely all in on executing what we think is by far the best strategy in the industry. And so this focus that we've had certainly showed up here in the second quarter and we continue to see some great execution on all these projects that we have coming to fruition and tremendous amount of work going on up and down the system right now, particularly, on the Transco system, as we expand that out to meet all the growing demands there. So I would tell you that as well in addition to the employee base, I would tell you very thankful for the board and their commitment and very active engaged board right now, working very hard, overseeing the execution of our plan and our strategy and very much appreciate their engagement as well. So the plan for today's call is to walk you through our strong second quarter results and then discuss our execution on key initiatives and growth projects. Don Chappel will discuss the immediate measures that we're implementing to enhance value, strengthen the WPZ credit profile and fund a significant portfolio of really big large scale fee-based projects and all while maintaining flexibility to review financial and operational plans. So we're going to – these measures, you'll see as we go through the DRIP program for Williams Partners. And as you've seen in our earnings release, we're also announcing a dividend reduction at Williams and the new level of our dividend will allow Williams to retain about $1.3 billion annually and that will be reinvested back into Williams Partners. So really think this is a great answer for bringing us the right cost of capital to go invest against all these great growth projects that we have as the natural gas market and the demand side continues to expand out. Moving on to slide two here, we'll talk about the quarter. As you'll recall, in the first quarter of the year, we launched several actions to address the realities that we had as we saw a lot slower growth going on in the key supply areas as the demand side was building out, but the production side really was starting to see some pretty reduced activity even in the best basins here in the nation. So, as a result of that, we really focused on two things that we talked about in the first quarter. One was our asset sales, and we talked about getting our asset sales done with in excess of $1 billion in asset sales, and we also talked about cost reductions. We made great progress on both of those in the quarter. First of all, we expect here in the third quarter now to finalize an agreement to sell the Canadian business, and the expected proceeds on that in excess of $1 billion, as we told you, and in addition to that, Williams Partners' share of that sale is expected to be in excess of $800 million. On the cost side, really terrific execution on the team's part here, and we went after those costs right at the end of the first quarter. We took some action. We continue to take action across the organization and showing up here pretty dramatically, here in the second quarter, with $55 million lower O&M and G&A expenses than we had in the second quarter of 2015. And I would tell you that's even on top of the growth in our business. And so we've certainly been adding assets and growing the business, and despite that we were able to bring our costs in. We continue to find opportunities to reduce costs further and so we're really excited about the way the organization has responded and the great progress on this front. And more importantly for our investors, we're pleased to deliver the adjusted EBITDA at WPZ of $1.065 billion. And this was about a 6% increase over the second quarter of last year, and this is the now fifth quarter in a row delivering adjusted EBITDA of more than $1 billion. And so, certainly, despite the challenging market conditions, our business of moving natural gas continues to expand, and we continue to take advantage of that. We also had strong quarterly performance in our distributable cash flow at WPZ, which came in at $737 million, which was up 5% from the same quarter last year. And very importantly, our cash distribution coverage was 1.02 here in the second quarter, which is exactly what it was in the first quarter of 2016 as well. So I mentioned back in May that Williams has delivered a strong – a long string of quarters with year-over-year increases in what we now refer to as adjusted EBITDA. We used to call it segment profit plus DD&A. But if you look to that and compare it into the prior year's quarter, we now have 11 consecutive quarters where we've shown improvement in that. And that, of course, is despite a pretty significant decline in unit commodity margins over this period. Of course, that's been driven by our fee-based revenue growth and our ability to continue to control cost in this environment. So with that, let me highlight some of the strong performance delivered from the operating areas this quarter. I'd note that all five of our areas are showing year-to-date improvement and, however, here just starting with the quarter, you can see Atlantic Gulf actually came in a little bit lower than the second quarter of last year. But I would tell you this is really for good reason and according to plans as we had a month-long shutdown of the Gulfstar tie facility, which allowed us to get the Gunflint tieback made. That tieback was made – done very safely. We had over 1 million hour, man-hours of work, making that tie-in, and we had zero reportable incidents on that effort. So great job by the team getting that work done safely. And here, as we look into the third quarter, we're going to enjoy both the Tubular Bells facility coming back or Tubular Bells Field coming back on Gulfstar as well as Gunflint, and we also enjoyed Kodiak a bit for the quarter, but we'll see that come back here as well. Moving onto the Central and Northeast and West, really going to combine all three of these because it's really kind of the same story. Steady as she goes business and the improvements were primarily driven by the team's ability to go after costs during the period. So continued very, very well positioned as the natural gas market start to pull on these areas, but nice to see the growth at 5%, 8%, and 2% better in the Central, Northeast, and West, again, driven mostly by lower cost and volumes holding up very well despite the pressures on gas prices. So a great job of the teams continuing to operate low cost and in a safe manner. In the NGL & Petchem area, our second quarter GAAP results were affected by a held-for-sale non-cash impairment related to our Canadian assets, and we reported $419 million decrease in segment performance as measured by modified EBITDA. But as we look at the adjusted EBITDA, that actually increased by $47 million or a 142%, which reflected the higher fee-based revenues. That was a lot driven by the Horizon project coming on up in Canada, olefins margins and lower operating costs in this segment as well. Geismar actually saw a very strong operational production levels and we did have a little bit of lower ethylene prices during the quarter, but our sales volumes, you'll know, were quite a bit lower or lower than our production volumes if you get into the details there. And so we did hold back some inventory during the quarter as we expected the ethylene prices to improve in the third quarter due to a number of extended outages on turnarounds from a lot of the competing plants in the Gulf Coast. And we're fortunate enough to have called that right and we have seen a price improvement here in the third quarter. And of course, that benefit will show up here as we sell off some of that inventory from 2Q in 3Q. Moving on to slide four, every quarter we review a list of our key milestones and, for me and the leadership team as well, it's an opportunity to highlight how the teams across Williams are executing. And if you're a regular participant on these calls, you know we just keep adding milestones quarter-after-quarter. So let's take a quick look at the 2Q list. And I would tell you this list, as I said, just keeps expanding in terms of the number of opportunities off Transco. We did receive FERC approval for the Garden State Project and so this is to increase some new demand in New Jersey, the New York Bay Expansion, and that's an expansion right on top of our Rockaway Lateral last year, another expansion on that for $115 million a day, and we did receive FERC approval for that as well. Virginia Southside II which is serving a major new gas-fired power generation complex there in Virginia, and Virginia Southside I is in service. This is another expansion on that project as well already and we received FERC approval for that during the quarter. The Northeast Supply Enhancement, really exciting project, really big investment for us, and that's $400 million a day expansion that's going to continue to take on new gas demands up in the very far northern reaches of our system. And so, we did close a binding open season on that. That project's moving ahead, again a very large investment for us. And then in addition to that, we have a lot of projects that are ongoing. We have the Gulf Trace project that is under construction, and construction is going very well on that. That's mostly a Louisiana area project. We also expect here in the very near future FERC approval for the Dalton lateral. So that's a big lateral that goes from the southern part of Atlanta up to the very northern reaches of Georgia, and we expect to begin construction on that in the fourth quarter. So lots of new things going on here in terms of construction across all of these projects. And our cost reductions are ahead of plan as I mentioned earlier, and we're continuing to find even more ways to increase those cost savings. In terms of coming soon, things that will drive us here in the near term, happy to report that our Rock Springs facility, another expansion off of Transco to a power plant in Maryland. That was brought in service August 1. Most of that work was done, completed back in the second quarter, but per the contract, ready to go in service here now August 1 and is in service. On the Gunflint tieback as I mentioned, that's – really will drive our third quarter pretty substantially, and so we're excited about that. And so we also have, I would tell you, some other drivers here for the third quarter. We'll get a full quarter of Kodiak up and flowing. We also are enjoying the – some additional incremental volumes that came onto our system as a result of the Pascagoula plant outage, and so we'll see a nice improvement on influx of volumes into our Mobile Bay systems as well for that period. So a lot of great things that are coming together here for the third quarter. Moving on to slide five, this is just a look now at really the – some of the big investments that we've got going on and you can kind of see by year how those pile up. So a lot of what I just mentioned, but this kind of shows what it looks like in terms of cumulative capital that will be placed in service. And so, I think the really big takeaway that investors should have here is this is very clear and identifiable growth in our business that's coming from all these fully-contracted projects. So we've got a couple of billion dollars this year, a little over $3 billion next year, and about two-thirds, a little more than two-thirds of that is coming from these big regulated projects and they are going to really drive growth well beyond 2017. So, next I'm going to turn it over here to Don to talk about the new program, the new financing plans. But before I do, I just want to remind you, it really is important that our investors understand how critical the expansion of natural gas markets are to our strategy, and we are very confident that that's occurring, certainly all the projects that we've listed on Transco. But we think those are going to continue to come and are going to come on the backs of low-price natural gas and, ultimately, all of that demand pull is going to pull out of the great basins that we're exposed to on the supply side. So I would say for the next couple of years the growth is going to be coming largely from the demand side, but when that demand shows up the volumes have to flow behind that and we're extremely well positioned to capture that on the back end. So with that, I'll turn it over to Don to talk about our new financing plan.
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Thanks, Alan, and good morning. I'll just run through the slide six fairly quickly. It hits a number of the points included in our press release. And again, these actions were designed to enhance value at both WPZ and WMB and strengthen the credit profile and maintain investment grade ratings at WPZ as well as fund the significant portfolio of fee-based growth projects at Williams Partners. It totals about $5 billion in the 2016-2017 timeframe with the vast majority of that being Transco related. So first, Williams announced that it planned to reinvest $1.7 billion in WPZ through 2017. That reinvestment is funded by retaining cash flow that was previously paid out in the form of a dividend. The dividend reduction totals $1.3 billion annually, a 69% reduction, and the new dividend level at $0.80 represents about a 3.5% yield in terms of where we've been trading here the last couple of days and we think that's a level we'll continue to attract investors that are interested in a meaningful dividend. WPZ will maintain its current $0.85 per quarter, or $3.40 annual, dividend through 2017 and then expect to resume some level of distribution growth in 2018. As I mentioned, we expect our actions to significantly improve the credit profile, again, with $1.3 billion of cash being retained by Williams and reinvested into WPZ. That is a very strong credit positive that we think the agencies and debt investors will take note of. The estimated growth capital – let me back up here a second, again, that will reduce the external funding needs for WPZ. It will enable deleveraging at both WMB and WPZ and really targeting having WPZ below 4.5 times by 2018 and, again, with a commitment to maintain those investment grade ratings at WPZ. And, again, I mentioned the $5 billion of growth capital, which is $1.9 billion in 2016 and about $3.1 billion in 2017, with 68% and 77% in 2016 and 2017 respectively, related to Transco. So we're delighted to have the ability to grow our Transco franchise anchored with demand payments with strong counterparties and we think that will add a lot of value over time. WPZ intends to fund the growth by a number of means here, as Alan mentioned. We plan to sell the Canadian assets during 2016, plan to sign and announce in the third quarter and close the transaction in the second half of this year with combined proceeds to PZ and MB totaling more than $1 billion and PZ share being more than $800 million. We're establishing a distribution reinvestment program, or DRIP program, that will be available for all common unitholders, and we're hopeful that we get some public participation in that. And Williams does plan to reinvest $1.7 billion into WPZ through 2017. The third quarter distribution that Williams receives will be reinvested in WPZ via a private placement transaction because the DRIP program is not going to be available quickly enough, and then the contributions or the reinvestment thereafter will be through the DRIP program. WPZ would also plan to access the public equity market to the extent it has a need through its ATM program or other means as well as access to public debt market, also as needed. And, again, to the extent that we get public participation in the DRIP program, that would reduce the need for ATM or other equity. I'll pause there and turn it back to Alan.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Great. Thank you, Don. And so just a few things to wrap up here real quick before we go to questions. Certainly, I don't think there's any argument around the industry that we hold the premier natural gas asset base in the nation and we see that continuing to deliver growing fee-based revenues. The fee-based revenues now is about 93% of WPZ's gross margin, and you're going to continue to see that grow. And so we're excited to see that, again, first on the demand side and then pulling the supply basins along with it. With the financial measures that we've announced, we'll be driving significant reinvestment at WPZ, and that's going to stabilize the investment grade ratings and improve the coverage at PZ as well. And so we certainly are on a path to continue delivering steady growing result for our investors. And I want to say once again before we close here just how pleased I am with our organization. I'd tell you the team really does understand our strategy, they understand what's critical to us, and really lots of energy around the organization right now excited about showing what we're made of and showing how we can deliver against this exciting strategy and plan and execute on this multi-billion-dollar project backlog that's going to continue to drive our growth, especially along our big interstate pipelines here for the next couple of years. And we believe that our natural gas focused strategy has positioned Williams as the company for long-term steady growth. And so with that, thank you again for joining us, and we'll move on to questions.
Operator: We'll go first to Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for all the detail today. I wanted to start with the $250 million that MB will be buying. How should we think about the price at which WMB will be buying that and the private placement of the common unit? And is the parent primarily funding this with the $200 million, give or take, of proceeds, of its portion from the Canadian asset sale?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Christine, good morning. The discount is something we're not prepared to speak to today, but I would say it will be in the range of customary discounts. We think it will be attractive to WPZ. We're unable to talk about the DRIP program today because we would be getting ahead of our registration statement. So we'll have to be patient on that. And our intention would be to have a discount that is consistent with the discount that would be available to the public once the registration statement and the DRIP program are activated. As to the $250 million of cash, or the $200 million of cash in the current quarter, that would be funded from the WPZ distribution or the Canadian asset proceeds.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then the DRIP program, like you guys say, goes through 2017, how confident are you that this won't have to be extended, especially in the event Atlantic Sunrise is delayed from the late 2017 in-service date? Is this generally something you're comfortable with because the CapEx generally drops off in 2018? Just some thoughts there would be helpful.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Christine. First, I'll just say that, again, Atlantic Sunrise is currently moving along as planned, but if there were a delay, that would also significantly reduce the capital spend in those periods as well. So you'd see some reduction in DRIP program requirements or equity requirements just generally. As to 2018, we're not providing any kind of guidance on 2018 today, so again I'll ask that you be somewhat patient on that.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, I guess if I was to go by what you said and continue to operate under the assumption that Atlantic Sunrise does come in on time, then it does look like you guys may have to rely on the ATM just given the big CapEx next year. And the WPZ cost of equity is still pretty high. A lot of your peers have gotten rid of the GP in some way, shape, or form, whether it's the parent buying in the LP or the LP buying in GP. Can we just get some updated thoughts from you guys on this trend and whether or not at some point you will have to evaluate the same in order to be competitive with these peers?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: You know what I would say today that I think we announced a series of actions today, but in terms of other potential actions, we always are looking at other possibilities, structure change or otherwise, and you've seen us take a number of actions in the past and we'll continue to evaluate the possibilities again as we continue to move forward. So I wouldn't rule anything out, but at the current time I'd focus on the actions we've taken and we really don't have any commentary really on anything else that we're looking at.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you for the color.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Thanks, Christine.
Operator: We'll go next to Jean Salisbury with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Just a couple of quick ones. Can you provide an estimate of the EBITDA from the Canadian assets for sale? I know it's very sensitive to NGL prices, but a range would be helpful.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Jean, I don't think we have disclosed that. I can tell you that in the current environment that there's not a tremendous amount of cash flow there in the current environment with propane being so heavily depressed there in Canada. Of course, that was the purpose of the PDH project, was to take advantage of that, but it's not a meaningful amount of EBITDA here in 2016.
Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And can you say how much CapEx you've put into the PDH plant so far?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: I don't think we've singled that out yet.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I'm sorry, Jean, I don't think we've disclosed that, and we're right in the middle of that sales process or getting that finalized. So I'd prefer not to disclose that. Thank you.
Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. No, no problem. And then, as a follow-up, a number of news reports have come out that Chesapeake is close to selling their Barnett assets. Have you had any discussions with them about what it would mean for their midstream agreements there?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: I would just say we're always working with Chesapeake on ways to improve our relationship with them, and certainly we're interested in trying to get the drill bit to work there in the Barnett, which would improve volume today we have those MVCs that protect our cash flows there, but certainly would like to see the drilling activity and development activity increase there. So we are working with Chesapeake, we always are working with Chesapeake on ways to improve that, but we're not in position to be able to disclose anything on that today.
Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, great. That's all for me. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital Markets.
Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks and good morning. As you guys sort of think about the dividend in 2018, should we think about the potential rebasing as something that is gradual off of the $0.80 number or will you sort of have a hard rebasing at that point?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Danilo, I don't think we have much in the way of guidance there, but certainly several factors. WPZ expects to increase its distribution somewhat by 2018. Obviously, we're not quantifying that today. And then, secondly, over time we would expect the reinvestment to diminish or be eliminated and a combination of factors will be considered as Williams determines what its dividend will look like. So, again, really not in a position to provide any guidance on that today, but I think it'll be something that we look at all the factors and make a decision as we got closer to that time period.
Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks. And just to clarify on your Canadian asset sales, are those proceeds after-tax?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Those are pre-tax proceeds. We do not expect a tax burden in light of the high tax basis on those assets.
Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Last question for me. You guys realized a lot of cost savings during the quarter. Can you quantify how much you expect to realize here for the balance of the year and maybe also even through 2017?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, sure. Thank you for the question. We do think that the level that we have now is sustainable. These are not kind of one-time, these are more systemic kind of cost reductions. Our head count from the first of the year is down about 12% and our team has done a really great job on the supply chain side of things of lowering our costs there as well. So these are things we've worked hard to not just – not as simple as just head count reduction, but also process improvements across the organization. And we do think that we're reducing costs in a way that's sustainable. And we are looking for some things to simplify the organization looking forward as well. And so we're hopeful to continue to improve on the cost savings beyond what we have today as we get into 2017.
Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Please go ahead.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning, guys.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: A couple of questions. I guess, the first one is kind of a multi-part question, but when you think about restarting the dividend in 2018, is there a net debt to EBITDA target on a consolidated basis that you have to achieve first, or do you just sort of think that the way you – if you're on the right glide path, that that would allow you to restart that? And then, secondly, is it only going to be dividend increase, or are you thinking about share buybacks? And then, finally, would you be interested in calling some of the WMB debt, or would there be premium issues and so forth? I was wondering if you can sort of talk about that in context together?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Yeah, a lot of questions there. I would say that we would like to, again, hold WPZ at investment grade stable levels. We would like Williams to be not more than two notches lower than that, and also have Williams credit profile strengthening as well such that Williams begins to come back to investment grade levels over a multi-year timeframe here as well. Having said that, I think we would certainly be looking at all of our options, but at this point, I would say that we would look at all the options, whether it's dividend, share buyback or debt reduction. But again, I think we'll have to see exactly what the facts and circumstances look like, what's the best use of capital as we approach 2018. I think right now we've got a pretty clear path and plan through 2017. But 2018, I think we don't want to get ahead of ourselves and really start to lay out too much until we get a little further down the road.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And then as a follow-up, and I realize you guys have been very busy and announced a lot today, but when you think about Geismar in terms of the options that you have for it right now, what is the appetite in the marketplace right now for a tolling arrangement? When I think about the amount of M&A that we've seen in the chemical sector, some of them seem to be short ethylene capacity. Do you see yourself signing a potentially longer term tolling arrangement with one of those guys or when you think about the M&A appetite that's out there for chem assets, do you think about possibly selling Geismar as well, too?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I would say that we certainly are exploring what the tolling market looks like out there. We've kind of done that almost piecemeal in the past, kind of one customer at a time and we are looking at doing more of a process. Really if you think about, there's really two groups that would be the counterparties of those tolling agreements. One would be the market. So the parties that are selling the ethylene and have that supply, and that's a fairly consolidated group on the river. And then on the other side of that you had a multitude of buyers that really are dependent on Williams as a merchant provider in that market. So that's the downstream derivative buyers. And so we really are trying to determine which party is the better counterparty for us on that between the supply side versus the market side of that. So I would say we've moved from doing that in a kind of – I wouldn't – in a piecemeal manner, one party at a time, to kind of looking at it in a more aggregated process, and so we will be pushing ahead on that for the balance of the year.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And then, finally, there was an earlier question about the Barnett and Chesapeake. It's my understanding that the recent activity in the Barnett is more about an oil target. Would that be a benefit to you longer term? I was wondering if you can sort of talk into context as to what the targets are there and why folks would be interested in potentially acquiring the asset?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I really couldn't help you too much. I think the window that's there is primarily a gas window that we're involved with, with Chesapeake and the acreage that we have. But there's just a lot of – if you think about how old a lot of those completions were versus modern technology today, there is a lot of improvements that don't require the kind of capital to drill, but just a lot of improvements that can be done with everything that the industry has learned about completions. And so we think there's some pretty low-cost incremental gas production to come out of the basin. And so we think putting ourselves in a position where we're helping encourage that is good for us long term. And so those are the kind of things that I think we would be looking for, for that basin.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thank you very much, guys.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.
Operator: We'll go next to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Just on the CapEx guidance here, I just want to confirm, first of all, how much have you spent on Atlantic Sunrise, if anything? And then, do you have full completion of the project in your $3.1 billion through 2017?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, let's see, on the capital, I don't think we've disclosed that. So we have spent money, it always takes a lot of money upfront on a project like that, and we've been very successful on the right-of-way acquisition piece of that. And so that's where the permitting and right-of-way acquisitions where majority of those dollars will go, but team's done a terrific job on that front and so we're doing very well on that. In terms of the timing of the capital, certainly the $3 billion in 2017 includes Atlantic Sunrise. I will tell you that, as we've mentioned before, team is very focused on that 2017 in-service target. But I would tell from you a financial plan standpoint – I think this has perhaps brought some confusion, from a financial plan standpoint, we always give ourselves, on all of our projects, we give ourselves some room so that we're not expecting cash flows and we can absorb some delays if they do occur. So I would just say on the planning and the project management side, we are full bore into making that 17-date, and things are going well in that regard. But from a financial planning standpoint, we put a more conservative date in there for expected start-up.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. That makes sense. And then, I think, for Don, you had mentioned in your prepared remarks 4.5 times debt to EBITDA at WPZ in 2018. Can you just confirm does that have a full year of Atlantic Sunrise, is that sort of an exit rate type of metric, and do you think that's the number you need to get to, to stay IG with the agencies?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: I'd say – first, I'd say that I said less than 4.5 times. That would be an agency adjusted number, so it wouldn't be right off the books, but it'd be an agency adjusted number. It has a partial year of Atlantic Sunrise, I think as Alan mentioned. We build a contingency into our financial plan for potential delay in all of our projects. And we just wanted to be clear about that. So it's partial year that's included in our 2018 numbers.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. That makes sense. And then just in Northeast G&P, the volumes there, it looks like they're down sequentially. You've spoken, I think about price related shut-ins. I'm just wondering if you're still seeing that, and is it more a northeast Pennsylvania or it is now more widespread across the basin, what you're seeing there?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I'll ask Jim Scheel to chime in on that, please.
James E. Scheel - Senior VP-Northeast Gathering & Processing: Yeah. So right now we have about 700 million a day shut-in. And you're correct, the majority of that is in northeast PA, specifically in and around the Bradford area. As you can recall, our volumes are down somewhat, but you've got to remember this is a shoulder month where we really haven't had much cooling impact until the last month of the quarter.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. I'll leave it at that. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good morning, and congratulations.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Craig.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: So, Don or Alan, can you comment on the updated cash tax outlook at WMB over time with this updated plan? Also, any prospects that you envision as far as cash flows for the size of excess coverage at WPZ through 2017? And any thoughts about the combined range of potential public DRIP and ATM proceeds that you might look for through the end of 2017?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Craig, cash tax rate continues to be at or near zero for extended period of time in light of the heavy capital investment and significant NOL that we have. In terms of WPZ's cash flow and coverage, we've not put out a number on that. I think you can calculate that based off what we have put out. And, again, we've not defined the size of the public DRIP or ATM program. But again, I think given the data we have put out, I think you can probably come up with some pretty good estimates yourself.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Are we to anticipate some cash tax drag before the end of the decade?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: I think that's unlikely.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: We'll go next to Faisel Khan with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey. Good morning. It's Faisel from Citi. Just want to go back to some of the equity funding statements you made for WPZ. I understand that looks like it funds the equity portion of the capital program. I take it, Don, that the rest will be sort of funded with debt on the – incremental debt on the balance sheet?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Well, Faisel, I'd say, we have a pretty limited amount of debt in this plan. As you know, Transco issued $1 billion of debt back in January of 2016 when the market was not very attractive. But the amount of debt being issued in this plan is pretty modest. There are some debt retirements that are coming up. So we'll obviously be issuing debt to fund debt retirements. But beyond that, it's pretty limited given that we're in the process of delevering.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then, in terms of the distribution coverage, I know you're around one times. What do you think the right target for distribution coverage is? I mean, you still have some cyclical cash flows in the portfolio of assets and you've got some concentrated counterparty risk. I'm just wondering, what's the right coverage ratio at PZ and that is comfortable for you and the agencies?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: That's a great question. Again, I think it'll be a function of the amount of commodity price or other risk that we have in the portfolio. And I would say that it's somewhere going to be between 1 and 1.2 times. But these are general range of coverage that I would expect over time, again, depending on facts and circumstances, but obviously it could be a bit different from that.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And did the agencies get a chance to preview this plan, and does this take at least one or two of them off the negative watch do you think?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Well, we did preview it with three agencies and it will be up to them to determine their point of view.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then just on the – you guys used to publish your – sort of your sensitivity commodity prices. I just want to make sure that the historical sort of guidance you used to give us on the sensitivity is still sort of intact?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: I would say that – I don't know anything offhand that throws it off, but our volumes have changed somewhat since that date. So I wouldn't want to say that it's up-to-date, but I think directionally it's in the right direction. I think we'll look to provide some updates in the future date as to what those look like. But again, we've had some movement in volumes, so I wouldn't want to say that that's as precise as it used to be, but nonetheless I think it's still something that is useful.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I think probably the main delta looking forward, of course, would be the Canadian asset sales because those are very commodity sensitive and so that would probably be the big change in your model looking forward.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Understood. Now, Alan, last question from me. On the corporate governance plans, as you go into sort of, I guess, a November proxy, what's the plan in terms of number of board seats and the sort of independent Chairman role? I mean, what's the plan from a corporate governance and sort of corporate structure perspective?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, sure. I would tell you we are out recruiting and going through the interview process. We've got Spencer Stuart helping us with that effort. And it's gone very well, very impressed with the kind of candidates that we've seen and that I'm very excited about, frankly. And so we are looking to add a few really great candidates in that regard, and I would say stay tuned on that. It's moving ahead pretty quickly. But we are anxious to hear if there's any other candidates that surface as part of the – from outside of the board, the Spencer Stuart effort. We're always anxious to hear that feedback as well. So again, things are going well. We're excited about adding the board today is very stable, very engaged, but as always we're looking to add to the quality of our board.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Any independent Chairman spot?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Today Kathleen Cooper is our Chairman, and would expect that to remain the case.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.
Operator: We'll go next to Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC: A lot's been hit here, so apologize if these are sort of second-tier type questions, but just curious on a couple of things, Alan. First, I guess, the time profile of your appeal process on Energy Transfer, if there's anything you can tell us as a guidepost for that, when we might put it sort of formally behind us?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: We're hoping to see that expedited, but would just say that it moves through the Delaware courts at a pace that – I would expect that it's going to drag out too terribly long, but I don't really have any specific dates for you on that. I would just remind people that the focus there is for the damages. And we certainly are – our outside counsel is certainly very focused on that. I would tell you the management team has got their head down to really execute on the plan before us, and so fully expect our outside legal team to be successful in going after those damages. But I would tell you the management team's focus is just head-on on the business before us.
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC: Understood. Thanks for that. And then, I guess, just a final question for me. With regard to the MVC accruals that you make, are you asking the counterparties to post collateral for those? How does that process, I guess, work? And then, as it relates, how does – in your conversations, Don, I guess, previewing with the rating agencies, how did they think about those cash flows as it pertains to your leverage and the defense of IG down at WPZ? Thanks.
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Chris, we do not get any credit support on those. They're contractually due, so the counterparties require to pay those. Obviously, in the event of a credit event, that's a different situation. But absent credit event, they're contractually due, and they have been paid timely every year. And we would expect those would continue to be paid to us in full and timely. So it's really not a worry, except in the event of a credit event. And in terms of the agencies, I think the agencies view it the same way so that they would view it as certain cash flows, except with an assumed credit event. So that would be some stress-testing around that.
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. I'm just wondering if you could provide some more details on your underlying assumptions for 2017 in your financial planning, especially when you think, I guess, targeting that debt leverage of 4.5 times and below? Just wondering what are you expecting for 2017 commodity prices, as well as is there any anticipated deterioration in the Chesapeake cash flows?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Sharon, we're largely using strip prices, so I'd say something that's very much in line with where the current market is. And in terms of CHK cash flows, we're not expecting a significant amount of drilling activity from Chesapeake in light of the fact that they have a number of priorities for the use of their capital including some debt reduction. So again, I think we have what appears to be a fairly realistic plan at this point, and we'll see how things play out.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. But no change in terms of the gathering rate for the MVCs at this point?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: No.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then to achieve, I guess, the 4.5 times or below, are you assuming ATM equity or additional asset sales in 2017?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: We are assuming ATM equity, and the amount will be dependent upon the amount of public participation in the DRIP. But between public DRIP or public ATM equity, we are expecting to tap that. We are not planning any additional asset sales at this point, certainly to the extent that there were any, that certainly could reduce the needs in that area.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And just a question about 2017 growth CapEx, you provided guidance of $3.1 billion. The bulk of it is Transco spending, but just wondering if you can give some color on the other areas of investment for the remaining balance.
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: I'd say it's Gathering & Processing assets throughout our system. I would say with the Northeast as a factor there just to meet growing production needs, particularly as this new pipeline capacity comes online, there's some gathering expansions that have to occur as well to fill those pipelines. So I think that's probably the biggest portion of that.
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: And we also have in that – other than interstate, we also have some investments going on out in the Permian as well. So in the joint ventures out there as well as in some of our operated facilities in the Permian, there's quite a bit of committed expansion and capital going on in that area as well.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. And just I guess in terms of expected timing, when you would provide more details on 2017 guidance?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Well, we haven't determined that yet, Sharon, in terms of when we would provide more detail. Certainly, you can see on slide five of the package that we produced today, you can see the projects and the amount of capital we expect to be placed in service in 2017. So that can give you some idea of the amount of growth that we expect for 2017. But we haven't determined exactly when we would lay out guidance for the 2017 period.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you.
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Darren Horowitz with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning. A couple of quick ones. The first, Don, what's the average return threshold across the projects in the backlog for next year? And I'm just curious, when you look at the current cost of equity, where you think the cost of equity is going to be as well as the current cost of debt, any opportunities to high grade or defer that capital commitment in order to alleviate some of the financing burden next year?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Darren, great question. Something we look at all the time. I'd say our pipes projects tend to be in the low-teens, un-levered returns. And we think the cost of capital for those is pretty low too from the standpoint if you were to really isolate that business and say what is the perfect cost of capital for that business. So I think you'd be looking at pretty low debt costs there and a pretty attractive equity cost as well I'd say. And I think that's exactly the kind of business that investors are pretty enthusiastic about and probably lowers our cost of capital overall. So we think all of those Transco projects are just really right down the sweet spot. So while we could lay off some capital there, it's not desirable, I think, from our perspective. The rest of the returns on some of those investments tend to be fairly high because they're incremental returns on existing asset bases. So, again, we'll continue to look at those and see if there's capital that is not earning a sufficient return or otherwise can be deferred or laid off. But at this point, this is the plan, but we'll continue to focus on that in an effort to maximize value creation opportunities for both PZ and Williams.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: I would just add to that. As you think about the returns on projects like Atlantic Sunrise, great project, great returns, but in addition to the returns we get on a particular project, something like Atlantic Sunrise pulls all the way through the system. So you heard Jim talk about the 700 million a day that we have shut-in up there as – and that capital is already there, the gathering system is already there. So to the degree we unlock those constraints and systems like that, we get a very high increment in cash flows because we would see the gathering volumes pick up there as well. So, really, those projects are really important to us in terms of incremental cash flow.
Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So, Alan, if you think about it in that context just meaning that those projects are sticky because they've got, if you will, more intrinsic returns, just based on how vertically integrated they are, if you balance that with your funding plan, how do you guys think about – and I know this is tough to answer, but how do you think about balancing the equity issuances that are needed through the ATM beyond WMB's investment in WPZ, and the headwind that leaning on that ATM could have on PZ's equity cost of capital, maybe challenging some of those returns?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. No, we certainly look at it that way. And I think the way you are describing you should look at it, with just kind of on the incremental cost of capital is the right way to think about that, and that is the way we think about it. So I completely agree with that assessment. I would just tell you I think these projects are pretty powerful in terms of what they do for us going on the increment. And we have trimmed a lot of capital out of the plan. But I think as WPZ investors see the amount of coverage that we have and see the kind of growth that is out before WPZ with all those big capital investment, I think we'll see some very constructive positioning for the PZ units. And so I think that will be a positive. But, again, I think the kind of returns that we're talking about, are powerful and we'll overcome that over time.
Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then last question for me. Don, Alan, in your eyes, what's more net present value accretive? Is it a meaningful leverage reduction in the near term where you can return to a larger dividend reset with a de-risked cash flow profile, or is it a more moderate dividend restatement and greater operational cash flow being reinvested in the business for theoretically greater returns like you just talked about over the long term?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Darren, I think we're comfortable with the plan that we laid out here today based on the facts and circumstances we have in front of us, and obviously we'll continue to look at the changing landscape, including how we're valued and the cost of capital and make decisions from that new baseline. But we're certainly very focused on the cost of capital, very interested in reducing spending where we don't see a good spread between the return on capital and cost of capital as well, but all consistent with supporting our franchises. So we'll continue to balance those points and try to find the path that we believe will create the greatest long-term value.
Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Darren.
Operator: And, ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude the Q&A portion of the call today. I'd like to return the program to Alan Armstrong for closing comments.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Well, great. Well, thank you all very much. Appreciate all the interest. We're really excited about the platform that we're sitting on here for growth and very excited about really moving this business to a much more predictable set of cash flows and continuing to execute on these projects that are just coming in one after another as we expand out the business, and then ultimately the pull-through that we'll get on our supply side. So we couldn't be more excited about strategy, very thankful for a very dedicated organization that's fired up about executing on the plan. And we appreciate your confidence and interest in Williams in the future. Thank you.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Williams/Williams Partners First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John D. Porter - Head-Investor Relations: Thanks, Doug. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include yesterday's press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily. Our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to questions. And also, we have the five leaders of Williams' operating areas with us: Walter Bennett leads the West; John Dearborn leads NGL & Petchem Services; Rory Miller leads Atlantic-Gulf; Bob Purgason leads Central; and Jim Scheel leads Northeast G&P. In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to generally accepted accounting principles. These reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials. Over the past many months, we've taken many questions related to the merger between Williams and Energy Transfer. The focus of our call today is our first quarter results and business outlook, so we're not going to take questions on the pending merger or other related matters. With respect to the pending merger, I will mention that the Williams' board is unanimously committed to enforcing its rights under the merger agreement entered into with ETE on September 28, 2015, and to delivering the benefits of the merger agreement to Williams' stockholders. Williams is committed to mailing the proxy statement, holding the stockholder vote and closing the transaction as soon as possible. As always, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team for questions you may have, and thank you in advance for your cooperation on that. There are lots of calls today, so we're planning on keeping our call to about an hour. If we miss any of your questions, feel free to follow-up with Investor Relations later on today. And with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Great. Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We do appreciate what a busy morning it is and so let's move right on to slide two here. First of all, our first quarter 2016 results certainly underscore the strong fundamentals of our fee-based business model, and we're excited as Williams to play a critical role in getting abundant low-cost North American natural gas into the growing markets and delivering volume-driven growth to our stock and unit holders. In fact, we're pleased to say that on an adjusted EBITDA at Williams for the first quarter was up 15% over last year and up 16% at WPZ. And this was despite a number of smaller non-cash expense items that totaled approximately $17 million that we did not adjust out of this calculation. The WPZ DCF performance was up 14% to $739 million in the first quarter, giving us a coverage ratio of 1.02x at PZ, excluding the benefits of the IDR waiver. This quarter is especially noteworthy as it marks the 10th consecutive quarter that we've delivered year-over-year increases in what we now refer to as adjusted EBITDA, or its predecessor description, segment profit plus DD&A. Throughout the business we've continued to aggressively manage our costs and align our work force with the realities of low commodity prices and reduced producer activity in the supply basins. And we made additional tough decisions at the end of the first quarter, which included reducing our overall work force by 10%. But even with market headwinds, our focus on fee-based revenue has allowed us to product strong cash flow despite a 16-year low in NGL prices. And as we look forward, it is exciting to see all of the natural gas demand-based projects ramping up as they will be a major part of our growth going forward. We expect continued growth from our portfolio of large-scale demand-driven projects and our fully contracted natural gas transmission business coming on in the balance of 2016, 2017 and 2018. And in this period towards then, we'll begin to pool on the supply basins that we are already so well-positioned in today. Now, we've talked a lot at Williams about the unique position between prolific supply basins and the tremendous demand pool markets that we serve, especially along the Transco system, but we're not the only ones talking about it. In fact, SNL Financial published a story just this week and encapsulates the great position we're in. The headline is the Southeast's growing appetite for natural gas will change market structure. And that probably sounds familiar if you've been following Williams for a while. And as this article points out, more than 50% of the supply in the Southeast currently comes from the Gulf, but that the Southeast will experience significant demand increases here in the near future and all the way through 2030 when a whopping 60% of the power generation will be fueled by natural gas. And if you look at the geography of this demand pool, it's hard to miss the fact that our Transco system runs through the heart of this area. And to bring this tremendous market demand growth story back to the nearer term, we said at our Analyst Day presentation last year that we've already captured more than a third of the 22 Bcf per day of demand increases along the Transco corridor, forecasted between 2015 and 2025 by Wood Mac. And to continue meeting this demand, we've announced plans last year to increase the capacity on our Eastern interstate from 10.8 Bcf per day to more than 17 Bcf per day by the end of 2017, and that by 2017, we expect to double the capacity of the Transco system from its 2010 level. So as you'll see when we discuss our projects in this presentation, Williams is strategically positioned like no other company in the natural gas sector to meet this tremendous demand pool and experience significant fee-based growth. As we move on to discuss the quarterly performance in our operating areas, I want to remind everyone that this is the first quarter in which we've consolidated our legacy Access operations in the Marcellus and Utica into our overall reporting for the Northeast gathering and processing, and we've moved the remaining legacy Access areas into what we now call the Central Operating Area. With that, let me highlight some of the drivers of our solid performance in each of the operating areas this quarter. First of all, once again, the Atlantic-Gulf is delivering strong results as we capture more and more demand fees for providing natural gas transmission capacity on the Atlantic-Gulf systems. Adjusted EBITDA was up $64 million to $399 million over the first quarter of 2015. And this came from – really from two primary areas. First of all, we saw $28 million higher fee-based revenues from higher transportation revenues on Transco. And these were associated with various expansion projects that came on during 2015. And then, in another $28 million higher proportional EBITDA from our Discovery system and our Discovery system continues to benefit from the great successes that producers like Anadarko and Exxon have had in the Keathley Canyon area. And of course, that feeds into our large Keathley Canyon Connector system that we brought online in 2015 as well. We'll touch on this a bit later, but you'll see that the hits keep coming for the Atlantic-Gulf in terms of successful permitting activity and bringing growth projects online. Additionally, the bulk of our growth for the balance of 2016 will come from the Atlantic-Gulf, with three new projects coming online over the next three months. Our Central Operating Area, which I mentioned now includes legacy Access operations outside of the Northeast, reported adjusted EBITDA of $226 million for the first quarter of 2016. And this was compared with a $218 million for the first quarter of 2015 as we repositioned those assets. Revenues were virtually flat year-over-year, while lower expenses drove the improvements. The $226 million represents 100% fee-based businesses with essential infrastructure in large scale natural gas basins in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma. In the NGL & Petchem Services area, we reported an adjusted EBITDA of $57 million for the first quarter compared with $7 million for the first quarter of 2015. Although olefin margins started off very low in January and February, they really rebounded in the month of March, and as crude oil prices improved and many ethylene crackers began going offline for maintenance in late March and in April. So we continue to enjoy nice margins here in the second quarter. The increase in the first quarter of 2015 adjusted EBITDA was due primarily to $60 million higher olefins margins at Geismar, with a full quarter of production compared to very intermittent production that we experienced in the first quarter of 2015. I would also note that the adjusted EBITDA in this segment for PZ included $16 million unfavorable foreign exchange activity in the period as well. In the Northeast G&P, we reported an adjusted EBITDA of $219 million for the first quarter of 2016 and this compared with an adjusted EBITDA of $196 million in 2015. And these results improved primarily due to a $16 million increase in fee-based revenues driven by gathering volumes, primarily in the Utica, and $13 million higher proportional EBITDA from our equity method investments. And this was mostly due to our increased ownership in the Utica East Ohio system. Price-related shut-ins averaged 900 MMcf a day for the quarter. This is always something people have a strong interest in, so we estimate we had about 900 MMcf a day. That was not 900 MMcf a day every day, but on average. We saw some worse days and some better days in that as producers turned production on and off responding to both load and prices. These shut-ins were seen across the Bradford County areas, the Susquehanna area and a significant revenue impact felt in the OVM area. But I would like to speak to the fact that this really does represent a great growth opportunity for us without any additional capital spending, so the gas is there, the infrastructure is there. And as debottlenecking continues in this area, we'll see that cash flow come back on. One thing to note is just recently we completed our New York loop that feeds into the Millennium Pipeline. So this was our segment previously referred to as the Laser Pipeline that we acquired and we did complete a loop. And, this, along with the compressor addition at our Dunbar Station, should add about 140 MMcf a day of incremental capacity this year that will provide for takeaway. There's a number of other small improvements like that going on as people debottleneck their takeaway opportunities out of this area. In the West, our performance this quarter was stable by any measure as we've been focusing on cost control to offset the significant decline in unit NGL margins that fell from $0.34 per gallon in the first quarter of 2015 to $0.22 per gallon in the first quarter of 2016. Margins did improve dramatically at the very end of the quarter and we continue to enjoy much better margins here in the second quarter. To be clear, our West group continues to post remarkably steady EBITDA despite a challenging environment for our producing customers in the Rockies and 16-year low NGL prices in the West. Overall, we think our commodity exposure represents significant upside as prices rebound. And the Rockies are very well positioned to respond to growing natural gas and ethane demand as well. So let me move over to slide three now and talk about our growth projects. And certainly I'll start this off by noting there's been quite a bit of media coverage around the State of New York's denial of our 401 Water Quality Permit with the Constitution Pipeline. We obviously don't agree with the decision and believe that there was significant amount of politics involved that went into that decision. Some of the resulting media coverage certainly echoes that sentiment. We work hard to do things right by the environment and we work hard to cooperate with regulators and land owners. And so we're always disappointed when those efforts where we really do try to do the right thing seem to be ignored. The Constitution partners are assessing the path forward and we're committed to building this critical piece of infrastructure. It's certainly important to economic development and jobs in Upstate New York, and a reliable supply of natural gas is critical if New York is going to continue its transition from coal-fired power generation to the natural gas use. It's also critical if the entire New England region is to benefit from U.S. natural gas as it also transitions away from retired nuclear plants and coal-fired generation. However, while the recent headline may have been about Constitution and the state permitting process in New York, we've been making significant progress on a number of projects during the period. First of all, the Transco Garden State project, we did get FERC approval for this 180 MMcf a day expansion that'll serve a local distribution group in New Jersey. Also, the New York Bay Project, FERC issued an environmental assessment for this 115 MMcf a day expansion. And that is expected to come on in the fourth quarter of 2017 as its in-service date. Moving to the South then for a minute, the Transco Dalton project, which is a major expansion into some natural gas-fired power generation in Northern Georgia, the FERC issued an environmental assessment for 448 MMcf a day expansion, and that is also a 2017 in-service date. On Northwest Pipeline, our Kalama Lateral, we did receive a FERC approval for a 320 MMcf a day project to serve a proposed methanol production facility in that area. And moving back to the South on Transco, the Hillabee Expansion, which is an expansion on our system that will serve the Sabal Trail pipeline to the south. That project was also approved and construction will begin on that soon. In the Gulf East, we reached agreement with Shell and Nexen to provide deepwater gas gathering services to the Appomattox development. Really excited about that project and the team's done a great job of keeping that project very low risk to us and taking advantage of our rather expansive infrastructure in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. So great work by the team there and a great piece of business we'll pick up there that is very low risk, given the existing investments we already have there. On the Canadian offgas processing, the Horizon offgas project was fully placed in service in March of 2016. And that project has continued to run very well and so congrats to the team on there for bringing that up online. I would note that despite the fires in the Fort McMurray area, and I'll just say we are doing everything we can as Williams to help out the community and our employees in that area from that tragedy, but I would say that the CNRL-Horizon plant remains online in that area. Williams has a strong proven track record of permitting approvals and we continue to make significant progress across our entire portfolio of projects. One of the reasons we've been successful is that we've been able to work alongside governmental agencies and community partners to support environmental mitigation and cultural preservation where we have operations and are building projects. And in fact, New York is no exception, where just last week Williams was awarded the Lucy G. Moses Preservation Award for our work to restore historic hangars at the Floyd Bennett Field on Long Island, which now houses metering and regulating facilities that are part of our Rockaway Lateral project. In fact, this award is the highest honor given for historic preservation in New York and provided a win-win solution for both Williams and the National Park Service, which has been trying for years to fund this restoration. So all-in-all, I think the list we've just reviewed demonstrates our continued strong execution on putting growth projects into service and let me touch on a few that are coming soon beyond that. First of all, on Atlantic Sunrise, we're excited that Atlantic Sunrise is targeted to receive its draft EIS from the FERC this month. It's a project that's going to help unlock tremendous value in the Marcellus like never before to serve growing demand markets. And it's on track for receiving its state and federal permit and clearances. And in fact, really important note here, it has already received its 401 Water Quality Permit in Pennsylvania. So this project is – really, the pipeline part of this project is all in Pennsylvania and we have received the Water Quality Permit, same permit that has us held up on Constitution we've already received in Pennsylvania. So appreciate the great work by both our permitting teams on that as well as the cooperation we get with the State of Pennsylvania. In a project we call Rock Springs, which is a new power plant that we're serving, that construction is going to be complete late this month and commissioning will happen very soon after that. This will be in service – placed into service because of the customers' needs being on August 1 of 2016. So our construction on this project is actually significantly ahead of schedule of the planned ISD. So congrats to our team on that project and that is another significant power plant load that we've picked up there in the Maryland area. Kodiak tieback, this is the fourth third-party tieback to the Devil's Tower platform and it did achieve its first oil on schedule in the first quarter of 2016. However, due to some higher pressures in the reservoir, they've currently – the producer has shut that in to accommodate putting in some more robust production facilities to handle this impressive reservoir, and we expect that to restart – or that restart to expect here in late May. On the Gunflint tieback, a really large important project for us, and we expect first Gulfstar One – this first Gulfstar One tieback to commission in June. The work is actually going on as we speak there during the month of May and so we'll be turning that back over to the producers here in June for commissioning. This is going to contribute significant cash flow growth as this big tieback for Gulfstar comes online. So with that, let's move on to slide four. Our pathway to growth in our fee-based cash flows is very clear as it is dependent upon a large number of already contracted large-scale projects serving the growing market for natural gas. For 2016, the major projects are already largely constructed, with final commissioning activities occurring here in the second quarter, as I just mentioned. And so, just looking at the changes here from 2015 to 2016, first of all, we're going to get the benefit of the full year contribution for projects that came on during 2015. You see that list on this slide. We also then have the Rock Springs project that I just mentioned, Gunflint, Kodiak and the CNRL-Horizon project, which is already online, contributing here into 2016 as well. In comparing 2016 to 2017, further growth's going to come from all these projects being on for a full year, plus the Dalton Project, which is the very large expansion in the Northern Georgia; the Hillabee Project that serves Sabal Trail; the Gulf Trace Project, which is under construction right now; and as well as various G&P expansions, particularly in the Northeast. As we look into 2018 versus 2017, you would see the full year contribution of those projects we just mentioned as well as partial contribution from the projects listed here. And probably in 2018, we would expect as the pool comes from some of these large projects that would come on in 2017 like Atlantic Sunrise, we would then expect large pool to start to occur in our supply basin. So really excited to see that area that we've worked so hard to position ourselves really come alive into 2018, as the natural gas demand starts to affect those areas. Beyond 2018, we certainly would have a long number of projects that we're continuing to develop. And you can see some of these here that are already fully contracted; the Gulf Connector, a project to increase – sorry, the Gulf Connector, which is an LNG project, and then another project to increase reliable service in the New York City area that we're really excited about and we'll have more news on that in the not-too-distant future, and then our Hillabee phase two. Moving on to slide five, going to sum things up today. Our first quarter results really demonstrate the resilience of our strategic focus on natural gas. Approximately 93% of the WPZ's gross margin year to date is coming from fee-based revenues and we expect that number to continue to increase. Significant new assets are supporting strong cash flow growth. And while investments in our growth continue across all these areas that we've mentioned today, we certainly are continuing to see growth in the Atlantic-Gulf segment via the Transco expansion and sequential growth in the Marcellus and Utica volumes, which are constrained by market access, but again, we're ready to drive huge growth there because we've already invested in all the major infrastructure in that area. So you should expect to see less and less capital investment in that area, but poised for growth as the demand projects begin to unlock the power of that basin. So once again I'd like to make a specific point about the connections between Transco and the Northeast. Everyone familiar with natural gas knows that Transco has always delivered gas from the South to the North, but that to really unlock the vast supplies in the Northeast, its flow will have to be reversed in many areas. And this is a point made in the SNL article that I mentioned earlier. Reversing this flow is exactly what we did in 2015 with the Leidy Southeast expansion and particularly at our Transco Station 180. It's exactly what we're doing today and it's exactly what our growth projects will continue to exploit over the next few years. And as these projects unlock the tremendous value of America's natural gas resources, they're going to continue to drive volume-driven growth for Williams and our investors. So let me wrap up here by saying that Williams is the best-positioned natural gas focused company in terms of our strategic balance. Our strategic position between the demand pool business and our significantly advantaged presence in key supply basins will drive continued growth and deliver solid returns despite swings in markets and commodity prices. We've seen the success of our strategy reflected quarter after quarter. And with the significant growth projects we have coming down the pike, we expect to stay on this very positive trajectory as this clean and abundant resource continues to grow our market share both here at home and abroad. So as we move to questions now, I just like to ask you to keep your questions focused on our first quarter 2016 results. We know there's a lot of interest in other topics, but that's what we're prepared to talk about today, so we'd appreciate if you'd keep your questions focused on that. And so, operator, if we could move on to questions, please?
Operator: Thank you. And we'll go first to Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Please go ahead.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning, guys. Just keeping my questions focused on Williams as it stands, your leverage reduction plans you've talked about in the past, asset sales was something that's mentioned. I was wondering if you can talk about what other options are on the table. Some of your peers executed a dividend cut. Has the board considered a temporary cut in WMB's dividend policy to accelerate deleveraging? I was just sort of wondering what paths you're considering in terms of moving forward with that.
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Shneur, this is Don Chappel. Good morning. Great question. I think our comments are consistent with our comments from last quarter. Again, we're very much focused on asset monetizations to fill the gap. The boards will continue to look at dividend policy. We certainly understand all the levers. But at this point in terms of the financing needs, it's really primarily related to asset monetizations. And as well, I'll just comment that we remain committed to seek to maintain our investment grade ratings.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: And does the recent improvement in Chesapeake's credit outlook, or I guess the way the bonds have traded, does that ease some of the pressure on the leverage reduction?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: We don't see it that way. Again, I think we're focused on getting our leverage metrics or keeping our leverage metrics at investment grade levels.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And then a follow-up, ethane has been a big question as of late. I was wondering if you can comment on how your Northeastern assets will benefit from, I guess, what's been emerging but nascent recovery in ethane? And I guess if you can also comment on the other side of your business about Geismar margins, could that potentially be a drag if it recovers, or would you expect ethylene to go up faster as well too?
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Great questions, Shneur. Let me hit the Northeast part of that question first. Our exposure in the Northeast is really as a service provider there for the most part and we are recovering ethane in there as a service to our customers there. So we enjoy throughput through both our processing and our ethane transportation systems up there and those came online I think in the end of the second quarter last year. So we continue to see improvement from that, but we really don't see too much in the way of margin exposure there, if you will. So most of our revenues there come from just the transport. The area that we're obviously more exposed to is in the Rockies and where we do have rights to the ethane there. And I'll couple that now with the question on Geismar, which is, what if ethane goes up? That's the really nice thing about our portfolio is that we're rarely exposed from natural gas through to ethylene because we're actually long ethane in our portfolio. So if ethane prices go up, we're actually going to see more margin because our length in ethane is bigger if we're in full production and, of course, we would be if ethane prices went up. Our length in ethane is bigger than our short on the Geismar side, so it'd actually be a net positive to us if we were to see that occur.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Is it fair to conclude that if ethylene went up faster, then it would be a double benefit?
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: That's right. So really, the spread that you should think about us really is natural gas to ethylene when you think about our full exposure.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Great. And then finally on Constitution, start date's been pushed out. It certainly sounds pretty political and so forth. What's your confidence in the new start date that was put forward? Do you really think that there's some options on the table that you can reroute or do something to address some of the concerns and get this project back on track?
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I'm very proud of our team. I think we did everything right there. I think we took great measures to address all the issues that were raised with us and I think we have extremely strong evidence in that regard. And so I am hopeful that science and the facts will win out in that process. And that's certainly what we're counting on. And so I think this is a little bit unprecedented from our perspective where we felt like we've dealt with all of the issues in a very meaningful manner and took very extreme measures to meet all the conditions that were requested of us. There are times when you get things requested of you and you just can't live with them because they might be too expensive or something, but that isn't the case here and we felt like we met all the conditions that were raised to us. So I think as the facts unfold on this, I think they're going to weigh in our favor. And so I think that's how we feel about it. Now, it's early in the process and we're still weighing those odds certainly. But I would just tell you as a partnership and as the operator, I've really been very closely involved in watching what we've done and our team has worked extremely hard to do the right thing. We've re-routed and re-routed and we've made changes after changes after changes to meet the conditions. And as far as we were concerned, we had asked and asked and asked and been told over and over that we had met all the things that had been requested of us. So that sat with the Governor for right at a year after we had been told that we had met the conditions. And so, we'll see. I certainly wouldn't tell you that we know for certain what that looks like, but we do think the facts are very much in our camp on this.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: So there's a way to formally appeal and it not get so political? Or does it involve you having to make another change and then go through the same process again?
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think the facts as we've laid them out, certainly if whatever the issues were raised to us such that we could address it, we'd be happy to. But I think at this point, it's really a matter of dealing with the facts that are in the permit application and taking that forward through the legal process. So that's the way we see it as we sit here today.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thank you very much, guys.
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Shneur.
Operator: And we'll go next to Brandon Blossman with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Please go ahead.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Good morning, gentlemen.
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Don, realizing that there's still a lot of moving pieces here, but with Constitution pushed out, presumably you have a decent line of sight on what 2016 growth capital looks like. Is the financing of 2016 and maybe even 2017 fully contingent on the outcome of the asset sales? And so is that a sequencing event, or is there any incremental color you can provide on debt versus equity needs incremental to those asset sales?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Right now, again, we're focused on asset monetization as the financing source above cash flows. And really, no plan at this time to issue equity in light of the still relatively weak equity prices and no plan to really issue debt other than revolver borrowings.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: And any color on timing around those monetizations?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: We're proceeding to explore the opportunities and I would expect we'd have something to talk about this summer.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay, fair enough. Thank you. And then, Alan, on the head count trim, the 10% reduction, is there color available on the strategic impetus there? Clearly commodity prices are bad. But on the other side of the equation, demand actually is quite good. Your growth projects are still out there and arguably to be added to over the midterm. How does that workforce reduction play into the need to have folks on the ground in terms of incremental projects and that sort of...
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, thank you. That's an excellent question. And I would tell you that really the changes that came about – and I agree with your point that, despite commodity prices, that's not really necessarily that driver. But what we did see was we saw a dramatic slowdown in the growth in the Northeast. And so all of the efforts that we had around expanding our systems in the Northeast and to a lesser degree some in the Central area have slowed down because the number of rigs that have pulled back. And if you know, we dramatically reduced our capital budget. And so, as we reduce that capital budget, it takes a whole lot less administrative effort to support all of those growth projects. And so that's really the areas that we trimmed, the growth in the supply basins. And frankly, we have been growing the company at a pretty big clip just with all of the activity going on, and $4 billion to $5 billion in growth capital a year. We have been growing the company very quickly. So it was a good opportunity for us to sit back and reset our staffing appropriately to both the slower capital investment rate and less producer activity in those supply basins. And so that's what we've accomplished. But that's a great question. Thank you.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: And thanks for that color. And then just somewhat related, more micro question, Atlantic Sunrise, the wording in the data book changed a little bit quarter-over-quarter, but it sounds like the permitting process is going at least as planned, if not slightly better. Anything to read into that?
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No, I don't think there's anything really to read into that. I think that we are excited about the way the permitting process is going and we just want to make sure that we remain conservative enough in that effort. And we certainly are encouraged by some things that we've very recently been able to work out in some of the permitting activities. And so we're encouraged by that, but want to make sure that we're being realistic about how the permitting activities go. But as we sit here today, I mean, at this very moment, feel very good about the way the permitting activities are proceeding right now.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: That's all for me.
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.
Operator: And we'll go next to Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. I just wanted to touch upon the asset sales again. Can you guys – have you guys determined if Gulfstream would have to be sold if the deal were to close due to FTC issues?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Christine, there's no settlement at this time with the FTC, so I really can't comment on that. So – but we are exploring multiple asset sales to determine the path forward. So we have a couple of options or a few options.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then just – you guys touched upon this, but it's been a while since I've focused on the West operations. So can you remind me how the G&P contracts are structured there? Is it essentially all POP or is there some keep-whole still there?
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Let me have Walt Bennett answer that for you. Walt?
Walter J. Bennett - SVP-West & Management Committee, Northwest Pipeline LLC: Sure. There's a combination of contracts and the majority are definitely fee-based, but there are some keep-whole contracts and percent-of-liquids as well. And so I think the way to think about it would be about – there is some commodity exposure at about 30% of the contracts.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then the ethane rejection that's going on in that region, is it about 25,000 barrels per day? Am I in the ball park?
Walter J. Bennett - SVP-West & Management Committee, Northwest Pipeline LLC: Well, we are now actually – we are recovering small amounts of ethane, just doing a partial recovery. And the way to think about the – if we were in full recovery would be to essentially just double the non-ethane production.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay.
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So if you look at the operating data for the quarter, I mean we had somewhere around 245 million gallons of non-ethane production. And that's effectively about the same amount of ethane if we were in full ethane recovery, that's about the amount. So that can give you a pretty good picture on what our ethane rejection is.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, and then just another question on kind of Geismar. When I kind of think about the Petchem backdrop with the new crackers coming on and the feedstock cost of ethane rising, isn't it possible that ethylene prices won't rise and maybe not keep its historical correlation to crude? I mean have you guys thought about whether or not maybe this asset belongs better inside a more integrated Petchem with downstream capabilities?
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Certainly, we think that the offsetting exposure we have on the ethane is valuable to the assets, but we have made some progress back in this quarter. We made some progress on going into some fee-based business, so some ethane plus agreements for that and we continue to work on that. So I was excited to see our team pull out across the line strategically. That's where we've been trying to get that asset to and the team made some good progress on that in this quarter.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. But nothing else to kind of give us? It's still early stages.
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Yeah. I think – again, I think we're working hard to that. It seems reasonable from our perspective that if somebody's willing to go build one, a cracker, that we can sell them the capacity at a much lower cost. And so that's the basis of that marketing effort and we are having some success on that front.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.
Operator: And we'll go next to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good morning.
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Morning, Craig.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Can you elaborate on the size or relative size thus far of the ethane plus contracting for Geismar 1 and maybe the timeframe you envision for this becoming more material to derisk that asset?
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: John Dearborn, you want to take that question, please?
John R. Dearborn - Senior VP-Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams Partners GP LLC: Sure. Thanks, Craig. At this point, we have a part of one of our contracts with a – one of our larger contracts with a customer that is now fee-based. And I would expect that you should see us moving in the market further toward the third quarter of this year. We might have some more to be able to tell you about perhaps some further progress on our initiative to sell more fee-based ethylene at Geismar.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Great. That'd be wonderful to hear progress on.
John R. Dearborn - Senior VP-Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams Partners GP LLC: Yes.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: And some updates on the latest in Northeast shut-ins and curtailed gas and expectations that maybe the FERC may finally step up and exercise some authority to get Constitution over the finish line?
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Craig, I would just say that I suspect there will be a lot of people involved in trying to help resolve that. I think certainly, the Federal Government understands how critical that is. And I would even tell you the State of New York, the New York ISO and the power generators in New York and the businesses there understand how incredibly important that project is. So I think we'll have a lot of people weighing in on our side of that argument for obvious reasons. And so I think that'll happen. But I would say despite that, there's a number of projects that are continuing to expand and bring incremental volumes out of the area. And as you heard us mention, our New York loop on the old Laser Pipeline, which is now complete, as well as some compressor addition that we're doing to increase the capacity on that, that'll add about 140 MMcf a day. And there's a couple of power plants in the region that will also work to add incremental load in the area. And so we think that kind of debottlenecking will continue to go on. And meanwhile, we're ready to really express strongly the facts on the Constitution piece, and hopefully, that'll win the day.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Great. And last question, I understood that WPZ's a bit depressed and you've got asset sales that will fill any needs in 2016. Heading into 2017, do you see a longer line of potential monetizations? And any thoughts on the opening up of the capital markets recently for some of your stronger Midstream MLP peers, albeit at somewhat hefty issuance costs?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Craig, it's Don. Thanks for the question. I think it's a bit early to comment on 2017. Again, we have a lot of options and we'll continue to evaluate what the market offers us as the best possible option and act accordingly. So, again, we'll continue to focus on growing the business and keeping our credit metrics in line and, again, look for the best opportunities as we go through this 2016 period.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. You talked about the 10% head count reduction. Just wondering if you can maybe quantify the potential savings from your cost reduction efforts and when you expect to realize the full benefit?
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Sharon. First of all, as we mentioned, we made that cut right at the very end of the first quarter. And that's about – our head count prior to that was around 6,900 in terms of our head count, so that's about 690 in terms of reduction. And that was heavily weighted towards some of our E&C space as well as in our areas of overhead with a lighter reduction in our field operating force. And so that is – you can think about that as – if you do the math on that, you can think about that as a little under $100 million of reduction, but we still are working to take that down further through some other activities and particularly on our supply chain side. And our team there's doing a fantastic job of continuing to bring in lower cost as we take advantage of a reduction in that space. So, overall, we're excited about the ability to reduce, particularly in that supply chain area. And we certainly never like to go through any kind of work force reduction around here, but I would tell you that the team did a very nice job administering that and proud of the way the organization held its head high through a difficult time there.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: That's helpful. I guess looking at the gathering volumes in the Central segment, it looks like the volumes were relatively level sequentially after declining for most of 2015. Can you maybe provide some color on the relative performance of some of the regions in the segment?
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I'm sorry, is your question specifically on the Central?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Yes.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah, on Central volumes.
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Sure. Bob, you want to take that question?
Robert S. Purgason - Director: Yeah, Sharon. As you pointed out, we've had a good, stable first quarter. And we're still seeing some declines in the Barnett and the Mid-Continent, as you would expect and consistent with other activities. It's offset by Haynesville predominantly, but Eagle Ford's kind of holding in there strong, too.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay, great. And any update in terms of negotiations with Chesapeake on the rates?
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sharon, I'll take that. I would just tell you that we continue to work hard with them to look for win-win opportunities. And, again, we're pleased to get to do that with Chesapeake and consider them a very big and important customer. So we're always looking to find win-wins. We don't have anything specific to report on this quarter however.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: And just a last question on the 2016 CapEx guidance. Any change I guess in that level, given the progress of some of your key projects and maybe the delay in Constitution?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Sharon, really no change in our overall capital plan for 2016.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. This is more of just a modeling question. But in the NGL segment, looks like your operating costs jumped up a bit this quarter relative to the last two quarters, $94 million versus running around $71 million. I'm just wondering if that's the new run rate or were there anything sort of one-off items this quarter?
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: John, can you take that, please?
John R. Dearborn - Senior VP-Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams Partners GP LLC: There should not be any very unusual ongoing matters here in the first quarter. I guess the only thing I think of and I'm not sure the numbers you're referring to, I haven't looked back at the charts here, is whether this FX impact is in those numbers. That would be non-recurring into future periods.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay.
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I would just add to that that we did have quite a bit of cost in our startup of our Horizon facility and the new Redwater facility that goes with that in the quarter. So, some of that step-up is from the startup of that new facility in Canada, the CNRL Horizon facility.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. And then I guess for Don, can you just give us a number around the leverage metric you're really looking at post the asset sale? Is 4.5 times the bogey, or 5 times or 4 times, just where you're trying to get to? And then are the agencies going to give you any forward credit for some of maybe the bigger projects that you're working towards?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: I would say that we're working on ensuring that our leverage metrics, rating agency adjusted metrics are below 5 times and trending lower. And we do point out the sizeable investments we're making in projects will go into service in the future. And I think that's more a qualitative point with the agencies versus the primary metric that they look at.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then it was somewhat answered already, but any thought from the WMB side of things of providing support, whether it's IDR waivers or other things as you're in the higher capital spending portion here?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Yeah, I'll just comment that we're in the middle of a planned merger. And in light of that, we're not going to comment on those kinds of issues.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understood. I'll leave it at that. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks. Good morning. Most of my questions have been hit, but I just wanted to expand on the Geismar question. So with the incremental cracking capacity coming online, don't you see pressure to ethylene margins going forward even though you have the gas to ethylene spread?
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I would just say there is a number of derivative projects coming on as well and there's been some major outages recently from a couple of big international plants where there were some unfortunate events at some large plants overseas. And so we do think that there is a lot of ethylene capacity coming on. We also think there's a lot of derivative capacity coming on with that as well. And the U.S. really is positioned to continue to grow in its market share on a worldwide basis. And as well, something we're keeping our eyes on very closely is the ethylene export as the world continues to take advantage of the U.S.'s very low-cost natural gas-based olefins. And so we're keeping our eye on that and I think it's a reasonable question. John, I don't know if you would add any color to what I just stated there?
John R. Dearborn - Senior VP-Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams Partners GP LLC: Yeah, the only thing I would add there is I think it's important to recognize that we're in a turnaround season now that's going to be prolonged through the remainder of this year, which certainly is going to I think keep supply constricted a bit. The U.S. ethylene industry continues to produce at record levels each quarter and so we see it growing, but it's growing at a relatively slow rate. And I guess I would also be expecting that, as we contemplate these plants coming on in the future, the world market for ethylene continues to grow at a reasonable pace. And so long as the U.S. remains able to export, which I think Alan just indicated it would be and we believe it would be, that these plants will likely feather-in more reasonably than you might expect. Big bumps of ethylene coming on, that could have deleterious effects on the market. It will have some impact, but I do believe the plants will come on in a more feathered fashion over this next couple of year period.
Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks.
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I would just follow that just to say that remember as you run that math, remember to look at our length of ethane because if you're correct that we have that much new ethylene coming on in the U.S., the ethane margin and our assets that handle ethane are going to enjoy that as well. So, as you look in your model and try to look at that model, you need to make sure you appreciate the length that we would have if ethane were to get soaked up by all that ethylene cracking.
John R. Dearborn - Senior VP-Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams Partners GP LLC: And then add to that, Alan, some incremental pipeline of revenues we'd enjoy as well.
Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got you. Got you. Thank you. My second question, if I could. With the emerging NGL fundamentals, how do you think about getting to downstream business? Before a couple years back you had the Blue Grass initiatives. As you see these fundamentals strengthen, is that something that you're thinking about potentially getting to again, say, a year from now?
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I would just say we have so much on our plate right now taking care of the natural gas demand side of the situation that when we think we have such huge competitive advantages on that front that that's really where our focus is going to be for the time being. Now having said that, we do continue to build out some of our purity systems in the Gulf Coast where the Gulf Coast continues to take advantage of very low cost NGLs and the Petchem expansion going on in the Gulf Coast. And of course, that's been a long-term strategy of ours to be taking advantage of the need for logistics movement around the Petchem industry, and so we will enjoy that. But I don't see us looking at any very large scale investment opportunities in the space that you reference.
Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. That's it for me. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we have ran out of time for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Alan Armstrong.
Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Great. Well, thank you all very much. Appreciate all the great questions. As always, I know it's a busy day and so we're just very excited to be in the space we are on the natural gas front right now and are really seeing our strategy really starting to pay off for us. And appreciate your continued commitment to the company. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Williams/Williams Partners 2015 Year-End Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John D. Porter - Director-Investor Relations, Enterprise & Planning: Thank you, Angel. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include yesterday's press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily. Our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to questions. And also we have the five leaders of Williams' operating areas with us: Walter Bennett leads the West; John Dearborn leads NGL & Petchem Services; Rory Miller leads Atlantic-Gulf; Bob Purgason leads Access Midstream; and Jim Scheel leads Northeast G&P. In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to generally accepted accounting principles. These reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials. Over the past many months, we've taken many questions related to the merger between Williams and Energy Transfer. The focus of our call today is our fourth quarter results and business outlook. So we're not going to take questions on the pending merger or other related matters. However, before we discuss our fourth quarter and year-end 2015 results, I can provide a brief update on the transaction. Williams' Board of Directors is unanimously committed to completing the transaction with Energy Transfer Equity per the merger agreement executed on September 28, 2015, as expeditiously as possible and delivering the benefits of the transaction to Williams' stockholders. Completion of the pending transaction remains subject to the approval of Williams' stockholders and other customary closing conditions. Integration planning is underway. As previously discussed in Energy Transfer Corp. registration statement on S-4 filed November 24, 2015 with the SEC, ETE and Williams received a request for additional information and material from the FTC pursuant to the HSR Act review. On February 1, 2016, Energy Transfer Corporation received additional comments from the SEC related to the first amendment of the S-4. Certain requests made by the SEC relate to information that will be included in ETE and Williams' 10-Ks, which the companies expect to file the final week of February 2016, so next week. Therefore, the companies now expect to file a second amendment of the S-4 shortly after filing those 10-Ks. With that update, I want to reiterate that we won't be taking questions regarding the pending merger or other related matters. As always, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations teams for questions you may have. Thank you all in advance for your cooperation. And with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. This is going to be a fairly brief presentation, we do want to – we will take a look at the fourth quarter results and also drivers for the full year. We'll offer our perspective this morning on one of our very important customers, Chesapeake, and a lot of concerns have been raised there. And we'll look at upcoming drivers that'll drive 2016 along with our 2016 capital plan. And then, finally some thoughts on the strength of our strategy in this difficult commodity price environment. We're very pleased with the way our business is holding up and as well, the kind of opportunities that continue to come at us in our effort to continue to connect these low price natural gas supplies into growing demand markets. So with that, let's look on slide two here. We recorded another strong quarter demonstrating our continued project execution, reliable operating performance and the resilience of our business to grow despite sharply lower commodity prices and what turned out to be a very mild start to the winter here in the fourth quarter. Even with the reduced producer activities in the supply areas, we enjoyed continued growth in fee-based revenues, primarily from demand-driven projects and expansions that were brought into service during the year. Our continued focused on a clear strategy, project execution and cost management are evident in our results. And very importantly, despite the pressures impacting the industry, we once again saw the dramatic growth in our fee-based revenues offset the impact of continued lower commodity prices. In fact, our adjusted EBITDA was up 25% over 4Q 2014, and our full year adjusted EBITDA was up a total of 26% despite very low NGL and olefins margins. In fact, I think impressive status across all of our system. Just on our gas gathered volumes, we were up off a very big number in terms of our total gathered volumes. We were up 6% on total gathered volumes for the year despite a lower producers activities and a lot of very significant curtailments that continue to exist. Looking directly at the fourth quarter, the WPZ DCF of $718 million produced a coverage ratio of 0.99x and, of course, this is before we would – if you were to include the substantial impact of the $209 million IDR waiver. This would lift our coverage up to 1.39x. And of course, this is not insignificant and certainly provides support for funding our 2016 growth capital program. Highlights for the fourth quarter of 2015 to the fourth quarter of 2014 comparison, I'll just give you the highlights here. First of all, fee-based revenues were up $139 million or 12% and that was driven primarily by Atlantic-Gulf and with a lot of fee-based assets that came online during the year and as well as growth at Access. Our olefins margins were up $43 million to $71 million, and this was strong operating performance at our Geismar plant with low per-unit margins due to low olefins prices. So, great results on the operating side at Geismar and actually across all of our NGL & Petchem Services during the quarter, but relatively low olefins margins there in the fourth quarter. The proportional EBITDA of equity method investments were up $37 million or 22% and most of that was coming off of our Discovery asset where the Keathley Canyon Connector continues to perform very well. There was a little bit of maintenance during the period, but those volumes remain very strong out there on that system. NGL margins were down $45 million or 52% and NGL prices now in the fourth quarter were 13-year low. And the full year 2015 NGL margin was only $160 million, which represents less than 4% of our consolidated EBITDA during 2015. And I did want to make a note have here on the impairment. We took some very large impairments in the fourth quarter, and these were largely a result of dramatic decline in the market value of WPZ and some tests required there up against the full market value and in the fourth quarter. So that was the value of WPZ in the fourth quarter and then the implied market values of the investments and associated goodwill. So looking at the total market value of WPZ up against the implied market values of our investments and associated goodwill. Of course, as you'll recall, the impaired equity method investments and certain of the impaired goodwill relate primarily to the acquisition of Access Midstream Partners, which we were required to book a significant $2.5 billion gain in 2014 and this reflected our purchase price allocation to these assets in 2014. So, as you'll recall, we had a big gain in 2014 associated with that acquisition and a lot of that goodwill then was taken out with this new test against the market value. And so, now, just a few thoughts on the result by segment. Atlantic-Gulf had another great quarter, up $122 million all on fee-based revenues and so very impressive growth continued there in the Atlantic-Gulf. And for the full year, Atlantic-Gulf was actually up $453 million and a lot of this is coming off of projects like Gulfstar One as well as the Transco expansion projects, and again the Keathley Canyon Connector on our Discovery system, so tremendous growth there in our fee-based revenues. This was offset a little bit by lower NGL margins, of course, but overall really very impressive performance. You might have noticed as well that Atlantic-Gulf had a little bit of higher cost in the fourth quarter and most of this was just related to – we had some repairs on the Leidy Line, as well as some additional testing required by the regulators there. And so, we continue to work on the Leidy Line there where we had a rupture on that line earlier in the year. And so a lot of continued work there that shows up in our O&M expense. On the Access or what will now be the Central OA, we reported fourth quarter of 2015 adjusted EBITDA of $351 million and that was compared to $325 million, and a lot of this was just driven by a continued growth in the business. But we did as well have an increased ownership interest in the Utica East Ohio Midstream joint venture that helps drive some of that as well. On the Northeast G&P, flat fourth quarter 2015 to fourth quarter of 2014, but a 30% growth year-over-year. So, we were at in 2014 full year was $276 million and we were up $80 million to $356 million here in 2015 and for the full year. So, really driven by continued increased service fees at Ohio Valley Midstream, higher overall volumes and those were offset by some higher operating expenses, including some line repairs that were required earlier in the year as well there. Really important note here, we did sign a new gathering agreement with an existing customer during – here very recently and we were really excited about this that it's going – we do – it does produce a lower rate for the customer, but we've got some incremental volumes that are coming on associated with that agreement as well as some much larger acreage dedications that came with that. So, really excited about this new agreement. And we're not counting on any new drilling anticipated here for 2016 on that. And even without that new drilling, we expect our revenues to be held flat for 2016 despite the lower rate just because there are some new volumes that come to us as a result of transaction and some new wells – or some new production that's being tied in. So a lot of similar story in the Northeast where we continue to tie in production that's already been drilled. We're really not relying in the Northeast. We're really not relying on new drilling rigs out there. We're really just relying on tying in, continued tie in of production. But the real key force there will be when we start to see some of the takeaway projects take hold because that clearly is the constraint out here. It's not a matter of rigs running in the area; it's simply a matter of seeing some these big bottlenecks open up and then us tying in a lot of this already completed production and seeing that flow for us. In the fourth quarter – sorry, on the NGL & Petchem side, really great operating results for NGL & Petchem from an operating standpoint, but we did have lower unit margins during the period. So really pretty good operating stint, both in Canada and Geismar in terms of volumes, but again very low unit margins. Just to remind you there, for the year, we were $216 million lower, but this was due to the lack of the insurance proceeds and about $89 million lower commodity margins. So a big step down, but again most of that was just due to the loss of some assumed business interruption proceeds that we booked in 2014. In the West, great continued focus on cost management in the area. We were off about $15 million versus fourth quarter of 2014, and that was really driven by $27 million lower NGL margins as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. And again, I'll remind you, NGL margins are now at a 13-year low. But really proud of the team out there and their continued focus on cost management and able to continue to generate very significant EBITDA despite low prices. Moving on to slide three, this is a really important slide here we wanted to show you. We certainly had a lot of questions about Chesapeake and our relationship and a lot of focus by investors on the credit risk related to Chesapeake. And so we really wanted to just take this opportunity to walk everyone through some facts and some of our perspective as a midstream service provider that plays a critical role in getting the natural gas production from a wellhead to marketable condition and location. So, first, I note that we have a very strong relationship with Chesapeake. We appreciate them as a great operator in the nation's very best shale resources. They have some of the very best acreage in large contiguous blocks, and we are very pleased to have the opportunity to serve them as a key customer and one of the best large scale operators from our perspective. So, I tell you, we are constantly impressed with the way this team continued to be able to lower their cost and work out creative solutions with us and other parties, and really thankful for the relationship. They are paying their bills in a timely manner as usual and including, we just recently got paid for the minimum volume commitment related to the Haynesville, and we fully expect them to pay the MVC invoice on the Barnett when it's due. It's not due yet. But we're excited about continue to work with them on that and fully expect that to come through as well, just as they paid the Haynesville on time. So, from our view, they continue to reduce their costs and operate efficiently and effectively to maintain liquidity. And nevertheless, though, we are mindful of the credit risk that these continued low prices pose for many producers, including Chesapeake. And so here's how we think about the risk. First of all, we have long-term dedications with strong contractual conveyances of interest in unproduced gas. We like our argument that we hold a current real estate interest in unproduced gas and that our covenant running with the land not subject to the rejection and bankruptcy. We certainly are following current bankruptcy cases like Sabine where the general question is at issue, but people should understand that the ultimate outcome in individual cases will turn on specific facts and circumstances. Regardless, even if the court were to rule we don't have such legal rights, our gathering lines are physically connected to Chesapeake's wellheads and pads and we provide a very critical service, conditioning and connecting Chesapeake's production to points where they can then choose the best markets for the long-haul transportation alternatives. In exchange for the dedication of production, we invested capital to build gathering lines that are uniquely positioned to serve Chesapeake's well. So all these systems were built out specifically for their needs and generally at their direction and to the size and scale that they needed to be able to produce volumes on a projected basis. In most cases, there are not other gathering lines nearby because these are big contiguous areas and these systems were built specifically for their production. And in many cases, our pipelines have been built on populated places such as beneath the city of Fort Worth and it would be very costly for others to replicate our gathering lines. And the rates of return that we generate from these investments and assets are very typical for a midstream provider. Likewise, our gathering lines have been in place for some time and thus the reserves behind them are now partially produced. To continue to produce such gas, Chesapeake and its creditors, if it ever came to that, would want and need to utilize our gathering lines to deliver gas to the markets. So, such gathering lines are very distinguishable from long-haul transportation service because the intra- and interstate pipeline initiate service after the gas has already pooled at marketable points. Producers then have many options to receive cash for their products other than transportation on any one particular interstate pipeline. If it did come to a bankruptcy, a producer can argue that it can reject certain types of contracts and we believe gathering contracts such as ours are not the type of contracts that would be rejected. But even if a gathering contract were allowed to be rejected, a producer and its creditors would continue to need the gathering service to be able to produce gas and create revenue. If a producer rejects the gathering contract in a bankruptcy, the gatherer will no longer be obligated to provide the gathering service. Furthermore, rejection of a contract is all or nothing. Therefore, the analysis of the risk of any producer's bankruptcy is best analyzed contract by contract and really understanding that the particulars of the services being provided and how unique those services are that are being provided. As any prudent midstream service provider would do, we have studied each of our Chesapeake contracts and considered the value of Chesapeake's reserves, our physical connection to their wells and their alternative options for delivering gas to market, and we believe that we understand much better than anyone the real value of our assets if it ever came to a bankruptcy process. But let me be very clear on this matter, we have great confidence in Chesapeake in their assets and more importantly, in their tremendous operating capabilities and management team. Thus far, they have continued to do all the right things in very difficult circumstances and we look forward to helping them be very successful for years and years to come and we have great confidence in their ability to do that. We will continue to find win-win solutions that align our interest and to support them where we can in their asset sales. And as you can see in the table on this slide, Williams' scope and scale of gathering in all of the key natural gas basins is significant. And there are significant non-Chesapeake working interests in basins as well that also give us confidence and the continued cash flows from these assets. So, overall, we'd just tell you we are very proud of our relationship with Chesapeake. We're very impressed with them and – but we also don't have our head in the sand and we are looking very closely to these alternatives. And we feel very strong about our position if it ever were to come to a bankruptcy. Moving on to slide four, this is just an overview here of some of the recent developments and what we see coming soon. First of all, I want to reiterate that the demand side of the natural gas market is really driving our capital investments and you can just see that as you look at some of these projects, the Transco Leidy expansion just came in and that – first part of that started up on December 8. And then we continue to bring segments on in-service through the month of December and now here in January, we are fully completed with all segments in service now for the Leidy Southeast expansion. Great work by the team under some difficult circumstances, but really great performance by the team that manage that project. The Transco Gulf Trace project, this is a project to serve the Cheniere's Sabine Pass LNG facility. Construction is underway with a target in-service of first quarter. 2017. We'd just tell you it's nice to be able to be doing construction in more friendly environments like Louisiana and the teams did a great job of bringing that project board as well. The Transco Gulf Connector project, which is the new long-term contract we just announced for 475 million a day of new expansion service that will also serve Cheniere's Corpus Christi and Freeport LNG facilities, that would be in 2019. And then just a note here quickly on the Marcellus and Utica volumes. The real story going on in the Marcellus and Utica is that we are seeing both growth in available production. So, what do we mean by available production? We mean the production if there were markets available that could actually be flowing. We continue to see that grow behind our systems and we also saw significant price-related shut-ins in the quarter. So this bottleneck, if you will, continues to grow in size with available production growing up behind a very constrained outlet and lower-than-usual regional demand in the areas. But I think it's important to know that we now have over 33% of the gathered volumes in the area and this really leaves us with great exposure once the bottlenecks are cleared. And I think what's really important to note there is that we're not relying on drilling capital for those volumes. All we need is some of those bottlenecks to open up and we'll have volumes flowing without the need for a lot of additional drilling capital. And so, this is very different in most areas of the country where there's a lot of concerns about producers not having the capital to drill. In this area, it's just a matter of the infrastructure being built out in front of it. And then, finally, our Geismar plant. Really proud of the way the team operated the plant and we exceeded our production expectations for the quarter there and are off to a good start here in 1Q of 2015 as well there – or, sorry, 1Q of 2016 as well. Just looking forward some things that are going to drive us looking forward. The Canadian Offgas Processing business, the Horizon project that you've heard us talk about quite a bit. That plant is now the Fort McMurray plant, so that's the plant that actually extracts the liquids out of the offgas is now rolling and it has began extracting liquids, but that will be a process here over the next three weeks or so to get that up to full production. And then, finally, we've got to some remaining work at Redwater to be able to fractionate all those liquids and we expect that to be coming on in March. So a lot of new revenues that will show up there on WPZ as those volumes hit both the pipeline and the Redwater fractionators. And then I'll remind you that the margin side of that business is left at WMB at the Horizon facility upstream. As well our Kodiak tieback, this is a tieback for Devil's Tower platform, and that project is being brought online and has been in the testing phase here for the last couple of weeks and is just about to begin to really add some very significant cash flow here in the first quarter. And then, the Gunflint tieback, which we expect to come on now in the second quarter, which will be our first big tieback to the Gulfstar One project and this is – will also be contributing very substantial cash flow growth with very minimal additional capital investment on our part. We do expect the Gulfstar production to be a little bit higher in the first quarter than we saw in the fourth quarter due to some well workover work that was going on out there, and so we're excited to see some of the benefits of that work that will start to improve things here into the first quarter and beyond. Last year, we announced plans to increase the capacity on our Eastern interstate pipeline from 10.8 Bcf to more than 17 Bcf per day by the end of 2017. And in fact, by 2017, we expect to double the capacity of the Transco system from its 2010 level. So once again, these projects just keep coming and we've got great transparency into our predictable growth and it provides clear evidence that Williams has a truly unique position in terms of our asset footprint, especially in challenging market times. Our backlog of project remains robust and the demand side project just keeps coming at us with amazing pace and consistency and, in particular, along the Transco system. These are fully contracted demand pull projects and we will continue to high-grade these opportunities as we balance constrained funding sources up against continued robust backlog. So, our issue is not a matter of backlog, we have plenty of great investment opportunity; it's really a matter of getting lower – better funding sources and low cost funding sources to supply all these opportunities. So, we're in a envious position of having plenty of opportunity and again just a matter of getting those funded appropriately. Moving on to slide five. So as we said before, much of the attention in the industry is focused on producer shut-ins and commodity prices. We remain focused on serving and capturing the growing demand for natural gas. This focus is especially important in the Northeast where we're working to unlock the tremendous value of the Marcellus and Utica areas by providing market access via the Constitution and Atlantic-Gulf projects. Our strategic remains intact and the underlying fundamentals of our business are strong despite reduced producer activities in the supply areas. And just a few weeks ago, we announced our revised business plan to address the realities of our current market environment while continuing to invest in our business. In addition to significantly lower operating expenses in 2016, the revised 2016 plan includes growth capital funding needs of around $2.1 billion, which is about $1 billion or 32% less than our previous plans. The plan includes $1.3 billion for Transco expansions and other interstate pipeline projects. And the non-interstate pipeline growth that's embedded here totals about $700 million, and this is primarily reflecting additional investments across our gathering and processing systems where capital spending for gathering and processing in 2016 will be limited to really new producer volumes, including mostly wells that are already drilled and completed, but that are waiting connecting infrastructure. So, as I said earlier, we're really not depending on a whole lot of drilling here in 2016; we're really just focused on connecting and getting volumes that are already connected flowing. Moving on to slide six here just to close out. First of all, the fourth quarter results certainly demonstrate the resilience of our fee-based assets. Approximately 93% of PZ's gross margin were from fee-based revenues. The continued growth in Atlantic-Gulf segment continue to be driven by great expansions on our Transco system, as well as our deepwater volumes. And sequential growth in the Marcellus and Utica volumes really was impressive; in fact, total operated volumes in this key region were up 8% as you compare the fourth quarter to the third quarter. While the total volumes in the regions, so not just ours, but looking at the total industry production, actually declined a little less than 1%. So again, total region declined a little less than 1%, but our volumes were actually up by 8%. So really continue to grow our market share in this very important region. Our 2016, WPZ business plan really did address the realities of our current market environment and continues our investments in growing the demand side of our business. Certainly, we continue to high-grade our opportunities and a lot of that capital is going towards really important demand-driven infrastructure projects that serve long-term natural gas needs of local distribution companies, electric power generation, LNG and industrial sources. And so, just to reiterate, this quarter's results and our continued strong backlog of projects are a direct reflection of our strategy to uniquely position Williams to connect the best natural gas supplies to the best markets regardless of significant market swings and cycles. And so, as we move to questions, I'd like to highlight what John mentioned in the opening. The Williams' Board of Directors is unanimously committed to completing the transaction with Energy Transfer for the merger agreement executed on September 28, 2015 and delivering the benefits of the transaction to Williams' stockholders. Beyond that, though, we're only discussing our fourth quarter and year-end results and we ask that you keep your questions focused on our results. We will not take questions related to the pending transaction between Williams and ETE or related matters, and we thank you in advance for your cooperation for that request. And so now, operator, let's please move on to questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question will come from the line of Christine Cho of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. I was wondering if we could start with any insights that you guys have from your talks with the rating agencies and your commitment to the investment grades rating at WPZ, given all the agencies had taken action before your press release detailing reduced CapEx. Any color on how they feel about your CapEx cut, deferrals, your Chesapeake exposure, your asset sales, et cetera? Also, if you could talk about where they would like to see your debt/EBITDA ratio to get to? I mean, are they still okay with that 5 times?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Christine, this is Don. Good morning. Great question. We've been in regular dialogue with S&P and the other agencies. And I really can't speak for the agencies, but I think we've had a very constructive conversation and I think they appreciate the strength of our business, as well as some of the challenges ahead, and we're continuing to work with them and look forward to their decision. And again, we're very much focused on maintaining that investment grade rating, but obviously it's their call.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. I guess in that context, you stated at least $1 billion of asset sales in the first half of 2016 in the original press release. What kind of asset sales are you assuming? And I'm curious to know if you started the process for this and what type of parties you're talking to. Is it utility, midstream guys, financial guys? And should we expect to see any announcements before the deal closes or do we need to see the deal closed first?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I would say that we're preparing for the asset sales. We've not launched anything as of this date, yet we're confident that we can sell the assets and generate the liquidity that we previously outlined kind of in the second quarter. But at the same time, we're not identifying the assets at this point. We don't think it's in our interest to do so. We have quite a few assets that we could in fact monetize, so we're going to keep our options open, but we remain confident in our ability to do so. The merger does not need to close. So we'll execute on that either before or after the merger, depending on the exact merger timing.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, I just wanted to touch upon the bankruptcy comments that you guys had. Alan, you talked about with respect to a rejection, it's all or nothing. And so, I'm curious to know, let's say, the bankruptcy court says that these contracts cannot be rejected, does that mean legally, you guys aren't required to mark to market the rate at all or let go of the MVCs or is that debatable?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. No, that is right. It is everything. Those contracts are all-in-one and it's all the terms of the contract, so there isn't ability to cherry pick the terms the contract.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you so much.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question will come from the line of Brandon Blossman of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Please go ahead.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Good morning, gentlemen.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Alan, I'll start off on a bright note. Transco expansion projects, some puts and takes in the backlog, but it looks like, by and large, that looks like on track for a multi-year period. Would you care to contrast Transco's projects with others that are on the project list across the board and the peers in terms of likelihood of going ahead and maybe benefit on an incremental basis to Transco as some of those more heavily producer-backed projects that don't show up in 2016 and 2017?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think we really don't have those risks in our projects right now. They're fully contracted and they're very secured credit standing behind those contracts. So we really don't have that kind of risk in the projects that we are utilizing with Transco. And so there are a lot of producer-pushed projects out there with very different kind of credit rating standing behind them, but in our case, we feel very strong about the credit and the term standing behind our projects. And there's certainly great push to move ahead with those and a lot of volumes packed up behind those systems ready to flow if and when we get those projects completed.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: And this is looking into a crystal ball, but do you think there's any possibility of some incremental counterparties that are on projects that may not go forward that would eventually accrue to the Transco system?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, perhaps. The only thing I would say to that is there would have to be expansions likely because we have a really clear idea where all those volumes are going to come from that are supporting those projects that we have and they're completely sold out. So it would have to be in the form of expansions beyond what we have today.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Fair enough. On the gathering and processing CapEx more than cut in half, is there any incremental risk to or possibility to that $700 million getting cut further for 2016?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, to a certain degree. For instance, some of that capital is out in the Permian, and in that case, we're going off of the operators' indication on how much capital will be spent out there; operator being the operator of the midstream assets. Most of that's non-operator investment for us and so we're depending on both the producers and the midstream operator forecast of that and that continues to be a moving target in many basins. So I would say in those areas, those more oil-driven basins could be some movement down. I would say in the areas like in the Marcellus or the Utica, we're managing that very closely and trying to optimize the timing of the capital right in line with the opening of new projects coming out of the area. And so there's probably some room to optimize, if you will, and the way some of that capital until the projects are specifically coming on time. So, we could see a little bit of that slip, but a lot of that is already underway and the work is ongoing.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. Actually, that's helpful color. And then just finally from me on that last point, Marcellus and Utica volumes. You said you saw some shut-ins fourth quarter. Any indication that those are coming back online with winter demand in the first quarter?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We saw a little bit pickup and we certainly saw interest from producers who shut in and were bringing back online. So we actually have seen some people taking advantage. We've seen some these cold weather surges. What you have to really remember about the demand in the Northeast there is it's driven by two things. First of all, its capacity to get out of the region and that's pretty fixed. In other words, those pipelines are completely full getting out of the region and so that doesn't move a whole lot. But what does move in a regional demand based on weather loads in the area where gas is consumed in the region. And so that'll be either driven by cold weather, which we've seen a little bit here in the first quarter, or it'll be driven by very hot weather in the summertime and those are the two things that will drive the variable. Until some of these projects – new projects come online, that will be what drives the volumes in the Northeast. There's plenty of gas ready to meet that demand as it opens up.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Alan. Appreciate it.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks.
Operator: And your next question will come from the line of Ted Durbin of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Appreciate all the color on the Chesapeake contract. I guess I'm just wondering about – it seems like I'm sensing a tone change from you around your willingness to renegotiate the contract. I think you'd already done the one in the Haynesville. Does that now change your view there? And there's an argument out there that such as commodity prices that's pressuring Chesapeake it's also the above-market gathering contracts. I just love your thoughts there.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. No, our – I'm sorry if I gave you that impression. We continue to work with Chesapeake in areas to help in negotiating and I would say nothing has changed on that. Our relationship with them is very strong. And the concept of the rate – we keep hearing this above-market rate and I think what people need to remember there is that the rates get set based on the capital that we spent and the returns that are very normal returns in the market. And so, we hear this term above-market rates a lot of the time, but in fact, really the returns that we're generating are very normal. What's occurred that caused the rates to go higher in some areas is where the volumes haven't shown up, but we're still the asked return on our invested capital is very normal for the space. But certainly no indication – or no, I didn't mean to indicate that our tone with Chesapeake has changed. We're simply – and I want to make really clear on this, all we're trying to address is all the concerns that have been expressed by the investors and media, not necessarily our own. We've always kept an eye on the issue as we do with any big customer, but our relationship with Chesapeake and our confidence in them remains very high.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Appreciate that. Maybe just a couple of other ones from me on Chesapeake issue. What is the returns revenue or EBITDA you're earning right now in the Barnett, in the Haynesville and then can you give us a sense of the overall contribution from Chesapeake to your EBITDA?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We'd take on that first part in terms of our return. Yeah, those returns were set kind of in the mid-teen range on all of those assets and that's what we continue to try to seek out like in our renegotiations in the Haynesville and so forth. We continue to seek out that type of return there. So, that really hasn't changed. The overall contribution of Chesapeake to our EBITDA, I'll have Don maybe take that one.
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. I think it's around 20% plus or minus. It depends on the period, but somewhere in that zipcode. I think 18% was the most recent.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. That's helpful. And then lastly from me on the financing side, you did the Transco bond recently. Is that another tool that you think like you can use more, I hate to call it a stand-alone leverage at Transco, relative to other financing sources that are out there?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. I think our plan is to keep Transco in the sweet spot for its rate-making purpose. So we are not inclined to put more leverage on Transco. Now, Transco has a lot of growth so, certainly, it'll naturally absorb some additional debt as it continues to build out its projects. But in terms of just adding leverage to Transco, that's not our plan.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. That's it from me. Thank you.
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Becca Followill of the U.S. Capital Advisors. Please go ahead.
Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC: Good morning. Few questions for you. One, can you quantify the lower OpEx that you're looking for the reduction in terms of dollars for 2016? And then the second one is on the contract that you recently renegotiated with a customer for lower rates in exchange for higher volumes. Are you looking at doing other of the – more of those with customers that are not Chesapeake?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Becca, I will take the second half of that and I'll let John take the first part of that. As to the contracts in any negotiation, that was a situation where the rate from a legacy cost of service contract was so high that there was no way the reserves in the area would ever be produced and so it was a matter of rate being even in excess of the price of gas. And so, this was a matter of actually getting the gas flowing and assuring ourselves that the gas would continue to flow in exchange for some additional volumes and additional dedication in the area. So, whenever we have opportunities like that that we can bring increment to our gas – or, sorry, our cash flows as we look on a long-term basis, we certainly will try to take advantage. And there are plenty of win-win opportunities out there to increase our cash flows to get gas flowing that's not flowing today. Obviously, we have to be cognizant of the fact because I mentioned earlier that there is only so much gas that's going to get out of the region. And so we want to maximize those revenues on our system because we realized that when Mcf starts flowing in one place, it likely means that it didn't come off a competitor system; it would come off of our own system. So we certainly are cognizant of that issue and the strength getting out of the basin.
John R. Dearborn - Senior VP-Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams Partners GP LLC: On the cost question, Becca, we've not put an exact number out there, I guess, for significant cost production that we're committed to. We're already implementing some of those cost reductions. We'll continue to implement additional cost reductions prior to the merger date. And then, we would expect even more significant cost reductions to follow the merger. So the merger date is a variable in that, as well as our joint planning with the ETE team in terms of such cost reduction. So we're not prepared to put a number out there at this point, but we will as we get further along in the year.
Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC: Understand. Thank you. And then just to go back to the question on the rate reduction, are there producers – because we get these questions constantly, are the producers actively requesting rate reductions from you guys in order to help them out through this period?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Certainly that's the case, Becca, and I think what our decision is, is what benefit do we get out of that. Again, we have to look at it knowing that there's only a certain amount of gas that's going to get out of the region. And so, we have to determine what the benefit that they're willing to offer in exchange for us lowering the rate up against current prices in a way that provides the cash margin. So, we understand people's cash margins very well. Truly no secret in terms of what that looks like to producers because we get it from so many different people. And it really just boils down to who's got the best offer in terms of exchange for us in terms of us being incented to see their gas flows over somebody else's.
Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC: Got you. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question will come from the line of Selman Akyol of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Good morning.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: First question I guess for Don. Going back to sort of the credit rating agencies discussion, you said you look forward to a decision. Can you say when you expect to get a decision from them?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I can't give you their timing. I think, again, you'll have to speak to the agencies on that. But again, we've been working collaboratively with them to provide the information that they need to make their rating decisions.
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: All right. And then just in terms of the related shut-ins, just wondering if you could just put a quantity to that in terms of how much has been shut in on your system?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I'm going to ask Jim Scheel to chime in and give some specifics on that if he could, please.
James E. Scheel - Senior VP-Northeast Gathering & Processing: Sure, Selman. As we began the fourth quarter, we had just under 1 Bcf a day shut-in primarily, as we've already talked about, due to lower pricing coming out of the summer and some lack of takeaway capacity. As we begin the year, we probably have right at about 1.1 Bcf a day or perhaps a little bit more shut-in behind the system as we've seen producers continue to complete wells but throttle the production due to price. So it's kind of hard to know until we see a full flow, but we're estimating right at the 1.1 Bcf. And really just to put that in perspective, if that was all flowing, the Northeast would go from about 6 Bcf a day to 7 Bcf a day and our incremental EBITDA would probably increase by about $180 million to $900 million, overall.
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: All right. Thank you. That does it for me.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Sharon Lui of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, good morning. You indicated, I guess, there are several projects slated for in-service during the first half of 2016. Can you just remind us what's the potential cash program for projects like the tie-ins?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I don't think we've provided – I'm looking at John here.
John R. Dearborn - Senior VP-Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams Partners GP LLC: Yeah.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think, Sharon, we provided specifics on those, but I do think we've said that those are significant. And so you can look to the kind of revenues that we get off of facilities like Devil's Tower and Gulfstar One. And you can think about that from a volumetric standpoint as both the Kodiak tie-in that comes into Devil's Tower and the Gunflint tieback comes on to Gulfstar, but they're certainly very significant. Of course, just like any deepwater wells, they come on gangbusters and decline over time, but they will be fairly significant in terms of cash flow additions when they start up.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you. And then, I guess just following up on Christine's question about discussions with the rating agencies and the distribution policy, just your latest thoughts on whether a distribution reduction would be an option you would take to defend the investment grade rating?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sharon, this is Don. We have a number of options. Obviously, we pointed at cost reductions, asset sales, potential partners on some of our projects to reduce capital needs and a variety of other tools. We certainly are mindful of the fact we've got significant cash flow that goes out in the form of distributions, but again we don't have any further guidance on that but that's always an option.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And maybe this question is for John. In terms of looking at Geismar, I mean ethylene prices still remain pretty depressed. Just wondering what's your outlook for the balance of the year in terms of ethylene and propylene prices.
John R. Dearborn - Senior VP-Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams Partners GP LLC: Yeah. Thanks, Sharon, for the question. As we take a look forward, I think it's rather well-known in the industry that there's a rather large turnaround season ahead of us here in the second quarter. And so, on the ethylene side, we think that's going to be up favorable to margins during the second quarter. But then as we look at the ethylene industry overall, in North America this past year, we set an all-time new record for ethylene production. And of course, our ability to export ethylene and ethylene derivatives is somewhat yet limited by bagging and terminalling particularly in the polyethylene case. And so we would expect that the second half of the year on ethylene reverts back to margins more akin to what we're experiencing today. On the propylene side, likewise propylene refinery turnarounds are happening right around now. They get those done in expectation of gasoline production for the summer season basically. And so, we have a rather stable outlook on propylene at the moment through the rest of the year.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question will come from the line of John Edwards of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
John Edwards - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. Hi. Just wanted to clarify – going back to Chesapeake and how things work in a bankruptcy scenario. We're just curious with the MVCs then, would those stay or would those go? Or are they separate from some of the contracts? I mean, any color you can provide on that would be helpful.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, sure. Just to be clear, those MVCs are part and parcel to the agreement. There's no separate agreement; it's all one agreement. And in a proceeding – any proceeding, the final decision there would be for the creditors to decide if they wanted to accept or reject the contract. And so that's how that would go. And it's all or none in terms of they don't get to again decide anything. So I know there's been a lot of talk about the MVCs being at risk, but that's somewhat – I'm not sure what's driven that assumption by the investor base, but that's not the way it works. And as well, the market-based rate issue, while that might occur during a short-term period, during the proceedings, there might be an ability to take something to market rates if all the other protections that we talked about were to fail. Then it would just be during the interim period prior to the settlement of the proceedings.
John Edwards - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. So, I mean as a practical matter, would there be the possibility to renegotiate those and then submit it to the court for approval? Or is it just literally simply it's all or none, take it or leave it?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. No, John. I think if there was a reason for us to negotiate, then, yes, that could be part of a settlement. But the decision really is to accept or reject. And really, our point is if the contract is rejected, then we no longer have an obligation to provide service. And because these assets are built uniquely for these reserves, the ability to duplicate these assets would be, from our vantage point anyway, in most of these cases just would not be feasible to build or duplicate all these facilities in these very heavily – particularly places like the Barnett where it's very heavily populated and very expensive to build in, especially when you've got less reserves than you started with to build the assets in the first place. So, anyway, it could come down to a negotiation if there was value to be shared between the parties in a better contract, but our point is just that there isn't any ability to just separate. If somebody accepts the contract, they accept the contract in its whole. And if they reject it, then they take the risk of not being able to get their product moved out of the basin.
John Edwards - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. And then just following on the contracts that are up for renewal or renegotiation. So following an earlier question, I think it was Selman that was asking it and the answer was – $180 million to $900 million is the amount that I guess would be – I mean, is that a renegotiation or was that just the amount that's due to shut-in? So just for you to clarify on that.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Oh, sorry, this is on Jim Scheel's. No, I think I can clean that up. All that is – Jim was saying, if the existing shut-in gas that's already contracted that's sitting behind our systems today, because it doesn't have anywhere to go, it's constrained in terms of bottleneck. It's already connected to our systems and ready to flow, so there's no additional capital required by anybody, but what has to happen is the markets in the downstream long-haul have to open up. And if that were to open up, that's the amount of – that $180 million is the amount of incremental income that we would see, or EBITDA.
John Edwards - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): All right. That's helpful. And then just last question along those lines. In terms of contracts that are in current discussion or renegotiation, is there any kind of EBITDA-at-risk figure you can provide to us or how should we be thinking about that?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. No, we really – so far in our negotiations, we've been able to hold our EBITDA steady under these contracts. And, of course, that's extremely important to us so we haven't backed up in these negotiations. We haven't backed up our EBITDA that we're getting in the current environment. So that hasn't occurred and we wouldn't expect it to.
John Edwards - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. That's super helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And gentlemen, there are no further questions. At this time, I'd like to hand it back over to Alan Armstrong for closing remarks.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Very good. Again, thank you all very much for joining us. Really pleased with the way the business continues to operate in this difficult commodity environment, and very excited about the amount of growth projects that are out in front of us that are consistent with our strategy of taking advantage of seeing these low price natural gas really develop a lot demand. And so, we're very excited about where we sit and we appreciate your interest in the company. Thank you for joining us.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your line and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Williams/Williams Partners Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John D. Porter - Head-Investor Relations: Thank you, Michelle. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website, williams.com. These items include yesterday's press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily. Our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to questions. And we also have the five leaders of Williams' operating areas with us. Walter Bennett leads the West; John Dearborn leads NGL and Petchem Services; Rory Miller leads Atlantic-Gulf; Bob Purgason leads Access Midstream; and Jim Scheel leads Northeast G&P. In our presentation materials you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to General Accepted Accounting Principles. These reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials. With that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Great. Thank you, John, and good morning everyone. Thanks for being on the call with this early this morning. Before we discuss our third quarter results, I'd like to provide a brief update on the transaction we announced with Energy Transfer on September 28. We are on the path to completion and we expect to file the proxy statement soon. The transaction will then be subject to SEC review and regulatory approval and is expected to close in the first half of 2016. With that, I want to reiterate that the focus of today's call is going to be on our financial and operational results for the third quarter. And I ask that you please keep your questions focused on our results, and I want to thank you in advance for your cooperation on that. So we are going to hold tight to that. And so, now, just some brief thoughts on the fundamentals relevant to the third quarter and the industry in general. Overall, I have to say, it really was a great third quarter for us from an operational performance perspective, a project delivery perspective, and progress towards future growth. We remain very focused on execution, on cost management, and taking advantage of the great asset positioning that our strategy has delivered, and I think this focus really showed up here in the third quarter. Importantly, despite the fundamental pressures on our industry from dramatically lower commodity prices, we've continued with very substantial growth in our adjusted EBITDA and DCF, so really, really showing the strength as we continue to see prices erode and some really dramatically low NGL prices in the quarter, but our strategy of continuing to invest in these big fee-based projects is really starting to overwhelm those lower prices. And so that's not to say we aren't feeling some of the effects of the low commodity prices directly in our commodity margins and indirectly via the volume shut in on some of our gathering systems, particularly in the Northeast. However, because of our unique position, we continue to deliver strong results and we see strong growth ahead from our projects, especially on the demand or market side of our business as the U.S. industries and the international markets look to take advantage of North America's abundant and low-cost natural gas supplies. The North American producers continue to really amaze us and continue to innovate and deliver production at costs levels that no one thought was possible even a year ago, and while this has led to painfully over-supplied markets in the short-term, it continues to lead the way towards growing demand and expanding prosperous markets for natural gas and natural gas derivatives. And so, over the long-term, we think we're really seeing a supply-led expansion, and I know that people are getting impatient about that, but I can assure you, as you look through our backlog of projects, it's very evident to us that that capital is going in place to pave the way for growing demand. So the current barrier to the success that we speak of and look forward to really is the low-cost access to these expanding markets and that's in the way of pipelines primarily, but also other infrastructure required. And we are certainly building out this capacity, it is not just important for Williams, but for the industry, and it's also important for the North American economy. And we really are very excited to be taking on these important challenges at Williams and see it as a critical next role in really delivering the tremendous value that the North American producers have developed via their innovation and continue the learnings in developing our low-cost resources here in the U.S. So with that, let's move on to slide two. Overall, our strong third quarter results underscore the effectiveness of our strategy to connect the best natural gas supply to the best markets with all this fee-based infrastructure we continue to invest in. This accounted for more than 90% of our gross margin during the quarter and will continue to be that for quite some time. And the tremendous efforts by our teams to deliver the continuous string of large-scale infrastructure projects required to realize the fruits of the strategy. Once again, we showed our ability to deliver substantial growth in EBITDA and DCF despite much lower commodity prices; and in fact, four segments of our five segments realized substantial growth and our fee-based revenue, which was up over $200 million in the quarter, overwhelmed the dramatic drop in commodity margins from the third quarter of 2014. Additionally, our DCF of $754 million delivered a 1.04 coverage, and that's even without recognizing the benefit of the $209 million IDR waiver for the quarter that was associated with the WPZ/WMB merger termination. So let me now drill into the drivers for this 21% improvement in EBITDA for the third quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2014 comparison. First of all, big congratulations to our Atlanta-Gulf team who delivered $414 million for the quarter, up 53%. Even more impressive was that this was in the face of dramatically lower NGL margins in the Gulf Coast, and the drivers for this strong performance were a lot of projects continuing that were brought on earlier in the year, things like Gulfstar One, Discovery's Keathley Canyon Connector, but also a full quarter on new Transco projects, including Rockaway Lateral in New York. In addition to that, the team also delivered a new project during the third quarter, which was the first phase of the Virginia Southside lateral, which our team delivered on time; and we also were able to get some early revenues from the mainline services associated with the Leidy Southeast project, and that we brought in those revenues well ahead of schedule. Of course, the Leidy Southeast lateral is not yet online, but the mainline portion for gas flowing from that lateral, we were able to bring some of that on early. So great job by both our commercial team and our project teams in continuing to deliver (08:32) on that. And as you'll see on the next page, you'll see a string of projects that Atlantic-Gulf continues to grow as we provide capacity for the demand side of this growing natural gas market. At the Access level, $351 million of adjusted EBITDA. That was up 9% on – this is really driven on fee-based revenue growth, of course, and we saw both the mix of volume growth and contractual benefits across multiple areas provide steady growth in EBITDA despite challenging commodity prices in those basins as well. Specifically, the increase in adjusted EBITDA between 2014 and 2015 was driven by higher fee-based volumes and contractual support from the minimum volume commitment agreements, as well as the increased ownership interest in the Utica East Ohio Midstream. And so, as you'll recall, we transacted on that earlier in the year, and so that delivered here for us in the third quarter as we stepped that up. And this was despite that area being impacted by very low commodity prices in this basin for both gas and NGLs. And so we did see some shut-ins in that area that were fairly significant in the third quarter, but we've seen a lot of that production return to service now, headed into the fourth quarter. In the Northeast G&P, $87 million, up 28%, also on higher fee-based revenue and this certainly during the quarter – a few things to note here, price-related shut-ins from our producers did dramatically impact the fee-based revenue growth on our gathering volumes, but this – we still managed to grow those volumes by 13% despite some very large shut-ins in the quarter. And as well, our volumes processed. So the inlet volumes to our (10:34) processing plants actually grew by over 40% and NGL production was up 2.5 times last year's production; thanks to new processing facilities that were installed in the first quarter at OVM. Of course, the NGL & Petchem, I was glad to see a solid quarter of operations from the expanded Geismar plant, and the team hit some very impressive production levels during the quarter as they really started to learn what they could do with the new facility there, but unfortunately, the ethylene margins that we realized during the quarter were much lower than we had expected earlier. But again, from an operational perspective, some nice performance coming from the team there. Canada also had strong production levels with propylene sales being up 29%, but also suffered weak pricing in the propylene area there as well. The NGL services side had a strong operating quarter as well. And so when we speak of that, that's our NGL transportation and storage piece that's in our (11:40) NGL & Petchem unit. And actually saw the NGL transport volumes on our Overland Pass Pipeline go up by 59%. So overall, a big step up in adjusted EBITDA from $22 million to up to $85 million for this business unit in the quarter. And then, finally, while the West saw a 28% decline in its adjusted EBITDA to $161 million really driven by dramatically lower NGL margins, it really was a good operating quarter in terms of the team doing everything they could to deliver the best numbers. And we really saw that show up in the way of lower operating costs, and the team was able to hold our fee-based service revenues flat versus third quarter of 2014. And so really, really great effort by the teams out there to keep the volumes continuing to flow out there and continue to reduce our costs. The NGL unit margins that we realized in the West actually were at a 10-year low, as we saw NGL – sorry, we saw NGL sales fall by over $70 million this year in the 3Q versus 3Q comparison. Total volumes on Northwest Pipeline were up 14% and this is due to both the increased use of natural gas for power generation in the Northwestern states as well as some basis differential spreads that were existing between prices like ACO (13:21) and the Western states. So really a good sign. I'll tell you, (13:23) when we see volumes pick up, even though they're interruptible and people taking use of the capacity, when you see that kind of increase in our throughput volumes on the system, that's always a good sign for long-term firm (13:35) sales, which is really where we make our money on a pipe like that. So moving on to slide three here, just a picture here of the continued delivery of projects and great job of our team continuing to put these projects into service. We said back in the first half of the year that the demand side of the natural gas market is driving our capital investments, and I want to touch on some of these projects here. First of all, the Transco Virginia Southside, as I mentioned earlier, was placed into service in September of 2015, and, of course, we look forward in the fourth quarter here to see the benefit of a full quarter there rather than just the one month. I also would just note there, really impressive execution by our team who really had some very difficult obstacles to overcome in the construction in that area, and I won't bore you with all of the details, but I would just say that the ability to deliver that on schedule given some of the obstacles that the team faced there was very impressive, and I want to recognize the great efforts there. On Gulfstar One, we continue to see strong fee-based contributions to EBITDA. Lots of work going on right now out on that platform to tie back the Gunflint prospect and to further improve production from the existing completed wells. On the – moving to the Discovery facilities, continue high utilization on the KCC system. We continue to see record volumes on that system and the team is doing everything they can to maximize throughput, because there is a lot of throughput wanting to get through that system right now. And as well, we're seeing a lot of exciting growth on the horizon for this investment as well. And so really excited about the future for Discovery out there, both in the current and in the future. On the Northeast G&P, on our gathering processing in the Northeast; we did execute the Pennant JV. And just to give you a little bit of color on that. That's a joint venture that really allowed us to take advantage of some large dedications that we had up in the area and that were some legacy acreage dedicated into that (15:59) we had up there and we were able to combine those acreage dedications with some players that already had some flowing production in the area as well as already had a lot of the capital invested in some new infrastructure up there. So really excited about the work that our team did there to take advantage of our acreage dedication and find a way to work with partners in the area. That's a very capital efficient way for us to monetize some of those big acreage dedications up there in Northwest Pennsylvania and Northeast Ohio. On the dry Utica side, of course, we announced a significant increase in the dry Utica acreage from Chesapeake in the quarter. But we also are really excited to see some significant dry Utica wells showing up in the OVM area, so right there, just to the East of the Ohio River, right in our backyard there in OVM, and really seeing some impressive wells that are being completed on the same pads that were earlier developed for the Marcellus-rich area, and really this is a common story here for the Northeast; just tremendous resource potential up there, and an ability to produce a lot of gas at very low cost. But we sit here and – as a whole industry – and really are anxious to see the new takeaway into the structure (17:17) goes into service. And I'll just tell you, there is a lot of growth potential for the future up here and really just dependent – not really on improved prices from where we are today really, just access to those markets both on the gas and the NGL side. So really, really excited to see the opportunities continue and the growth for the future up here just continues to expand its horizon for us. On the Haynesville, the 2016 and 2017 MVC cash flows were unchanged via our contract renegotiation with Chesapeake and we were able to extend our dedication through 2035, and also brought in a very substantial additional drilling commitment, which will drive those increased volumes beyond the end of the MVC obligations there in 2017. So great job. I know there has been a lot of debate out there. But I'll tell you, from my perspective, any time we can hold our current cash flows – commitment to cash flows via those MVCs and expand the Horizon and help a customer continue to grow for the future and us enjoy that growth with them, I think that is a win-win. I'm really proud of the team and very excited to continue to work with Chesapeake on finding ways that are mutually beneficial to our organizations. At Geismar, the expanded plant, as I mentioned earlier is meeting our production expectations, and it actually – even though some very hot periods will tend to lower our throughput capability, we hit some pretty impressive numbers relative to our expectation in production for the quarter and expect to see that continue here into the fourth quarter. We also announced the fee-based off-take contract that we executed for the Alberta PDH facility and we are moving to the next phase of project development, and we do expect the FID or the final investment decision in the third quarter of 2016. But I would tell you, a lot of great work going on there by the teams and really it's hard work to make sure we know (19:42) exactly what our estimate is going to be and that we execute that project in a flawless manner. So a lot of time and care being taken on the front end to get that right, exactly how we ought to be taking on a big project like that. In addition, looking forward, I want to touch on just a few projects that are going to come on later this year. First of all, the Transco Leidy Southeast expansion. Really important, not just for the cash flows that that project will deliver, but as well, because it's going to provide additional gas takeaway of about 525 million a day coming out that'll be in service in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our Canadian Offgas Processing project, a project we refer to as Horizon; we expect that to be mechanically complete here in the fourth quarter of 2015. We don't expect any meaningful cash flow from this asset until first quarter of 2016 as we'll be starting this up in the dead of winter up in Fort McMurray, Alberta; and if you've ever been up there in that part of the year you know what I am talking about. So great job by the teams really trying to push through to get that project completed and we are looking forward to bringing that big project on line and into service well during 2016. And then finally, our Kodiak tieback to our Devils Tower platform, is expected to come on in the fourth quarter of 2015. And a lot of times this gets left off of our project list just because we're not spending the capital on that, so it doesn't show up as a major project where we're being reimbursed what capital we are spending, I should say. But it is a very meaningful additional to our cash flow. And so it really is an exciting project for us and continues to show that our deepwater strategy is alive and well with Devils Tower moving into its, I guess,12th or 13th year now of operation. Once again – I think there is a very extensive list and I'm proud of our teams for the progress they continue to make and the growth they're delivering, and Williams really does have a truly unique position in terms of our asset footprint and the kind of projects that we continue to string together. Moving on to slide four, you can see here a list of demand-driven projects. It is very significant. So while most of the attention in the industry for the past year or so has been focused on prices, production curtailments and shut-ins; we've really been focused on serving the growing demand side for natural gas and we expect to see that continue. And as you can see from this chart, much of our growth potential for the future is on the demand side of the business. We think that's critical to expand out into those key markets and we're really pleased to be positioned the way we are. Our focus is especially important in the Northeast where we've got many producers up there that are really, really critical to them to get access to those markets, and we take those obligations very serious to get those developed and working hard to overcome continued regulatory and political hurdles that exist in getting all this big infrastructure in place up there. And so in the Northeast, while we, as I mentioned earlier, we did have quite a bit of gas shut-in in the third quarter, it really is a great opportunity for us as we continue to invest out. In fact, if we touch where we're (23:31) invested in in these assets in the Northeast, we're exposed to these assets that gather nearly a third of all the gas being produced up there. And so as we are able to develop our own infrastructure for takeaway as well as peers in the industry, we're going to see some tremendous growth that does not depend on additional drilling rigs because there's – not only is there a lot of gas shut-in for economic reasons up there today, we also have a tremendous amount of drilled and uncompleted wells and a big inventory of that, that again is just waiting on the right price signals not from the Henry Hub kind of natural gas prices but they are locally in the area. So we're excited to be working to get our customers exposed in that area. Moving on to slide five, to sum up some of the things that we went over today. I would reiterate that the quarter's results were a direct reflection of our strategy to uniquely position Williams to connect the very best natural gas supplies to the very best markets, and I really think it's hard for anybody else to make that claim in terms of how we're positioned in the natural gas market there. Very unique in that regard and we've worked hard to get there. The fact that we're delivering record quarterly DCF and record adjusted EBITDA through some of the tough headwinds for the industry is a real testament to the teams at Williams that are out there every day executing on our plan, working hard to deliver results for our shareholders. And we remain very focused on executing against our natural gas focused strategy and are very pleased with the results we've delivered here in the third quarter. And importantly, our backlog of projects continues to grow as we see the demand side of the natural gas story continue to develop. Sustainable low-cost reserves only serve to fuel the story of demand growth and we're excited to be a part of what will be a tremendous growth of the future. So with that, we'll move to the Q&A session. And I'd just like to remind everyone that the purpose of today's call is to discuss our operational and financial results for the third quarter of 2015, and I ask that you please limit your questions to these topics. And I want to thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation on this. I know there's a lot of interest in understanding the transaction, but we're going to be limiting our comments today to the Williams operations and our performance here for the third quarter and drivers for the future. So with that, we'll turn it over to questions. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Brandon Blossman of Tudor, Pickering, Holt Company (sic) [Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.] (26:49) Please go ahead.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Good morning, Alan; everyone.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Let's see here. There is quite a bit. I guess just a little bit of bookkeeping; in terms of project timing in the Northeast, any incremental color on Constitution and getting that kicked off?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure. We've gotten through all the work with DEQ with New York and that was kind of our final barrier up there. We are working with the Governor's Office to understand what – the cause of delay of getting that permit out, but that is kind of the final issue that we're waiting on. And so we're working to understand that. A lot of great work going on by the teams there to get the – past the requirement for the New York DEC (27:46), but we think we've gotten there. So really just up against getting the Governor's Office to sign off on that and then we'll be in a position to get that done for the fourth quarter of 2016.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: And so still on track for that timeline?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: The new Edmonton PDH facility, any color in terms of just how competitive that market is? Obviously, that's a much needed project in that region. Are there other folks competing for similar projects there? And just across your footprint, do other PDH units make sense, and what's the competitive landscape for those types of projects?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Great question. Well, I'd tell you that, that PDH project is very, very unique from our perspective, and that it's taking advantage of very low-cost propylene that's already in the area as well as the propylene that we would make with the new PDH facility. And so we, for quite some time, wanted to see polypropylene unit and downstream derivatives be developed in the area, because it's just a logistics game. So today a lot of that propylene is going into the Gulf Coast being converted into various derivatives, in particularly polypropylene, and then being railed back up into the Midwest market. And so this project takes advantage of that low-cost propane there in the basin and low-cost propylene that comes directly off of those big delayed cokers in the oil sands and then just transports it in directly into those Midwest markets and also will have access to international market out of places like Port of Vancouver. So really excited to be teamed up with the Goradia Capital Group and a huge marketer of derivative projects – derivative products around the world, and really excited to have them as a partner there. And I would tell you, the next available project to us is clearly a PDH 2 facility there and they're very interested in that and we certainly have plenty of product, as we continue to expand our upstreams oil sands operations, we've got a lot of propylene that we want to find a better home for than having to be railed into the Gulf Coast. So I would just tell you it really is a logistics play for us. We're not depending on the kind of propane basis differential that we've been living on up there, but we do expect the propane to be long there in Canada for quite some time and we really look to all kinds of alternatives for other uses of the propane and other logistics for the propane and really excited PDH is a great answer up there, especially with somebody coming – partnering with us to develop the derivative business for us. So exciting opportunity, not just for us, but really for the province of Alberta and allows them to take advantage of their very low-cost resources in that basin as well.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Awesome. Got it. Thank you. Very interesting.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you very much. (31:17)
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Christine Cho of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, everyone.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: My first question has to do with CapEx; year-to-date, it's been trending a lot lower than the guidance we got five months ago. And I'm guessing most of it is due to lower than expected spending in the Northeast and for the Access assets. Is the run rate of spending that we've seen for the first three quarters a good indicator for what to expect in fourth quarter? And how much of the spending would you say has been delayed? And is this more of a timing thing into 2016? Or is some of this stuff indefinitely postponed until pricing signals improve, like you've mentioned?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Christine, I would actually say – I'll separate that. The maintenance capital piece, a number of drivers on that, but we still have a lot of maintenance capital work out in front of us. And just so you know kind of how we forecast that, a lot of that maintenance capital is invested in the inspection and improvement of our pipeline system. And so we go through the smart pigging process and we basically have to estimate the number of repairs or anomalies that we'll find when we do that inspection; and so that's how we do that. When we don't have as many anomalies show up or as many repairs required, then we don't have as much maintenance capital to spend. And so we still have quite a bit of inspection in front of us for the balance of the year and we would expect that maintenance capital continue to be pretty strong going into the fourth quarter. But clearly, it's a matter of us estimating at the first of the year (33:07) the amount of work we think we're going to have. And when we don't find those anomalies, then that's the money that we put back in our pocket, so to speak. But we have a lot of work out in front of us for both the third quarter and – sorry, into the fourth quarter and into 2016. On the growth capital side, that is somewhat driven by things like we would have hoped to have been started on Constitution by now, for instance. And so that is projects like that. But there are a lot of projects that we actually are seeing lower costs come in. And so, up in the Northeast, for instance, on our build-out in the Susquehanna County area, the capital – the team has been doing a great job up there, bringing in costs lower and as well on Atlantic Sunrise; we've continued to enjoy cost savings on that big project as well. So I would say the delay component is probably -that's built in there, is probably Constitution, and but there are some pretty substantial savings that are coming through in our numbers as well.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. And then on the heels of that, it looks like you funded all the CapEx with debt in third quarter. I'm assuming you couldn't really tap the ATM PZ (34:24) while undergoing a strategic review, but how should we think about CapEx funding between now and closing of the deal at the parent? I realize that IDR waivers are going to help some, but can you tap the ATM markets given the uncertainty around the future of PZ (34:37)? And even if you could, I'm assuming you don't want to when the units are yielding 11% and credit metrics are high. So how should we think about this? Because I would think that you can't solely lean on the balance sheet for the next six months to nine months.
Donald R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Christine, this is Don. Good morning.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Morning.
Donald R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: First, I'd say that I think the cost of equity capital is unusually high as a result of the high level of uncertainty regarding the energy industry right now. We expect that that will settle down, and in time here that the market will certainly reward the advantaged companies relative to those that are less advantaged or disadvantaged and cost of capital will make more sense as we move forward. We have a variety of options ahead of us, and the ATM is certainly one of those and we'll be balancing obviously cost and risk and – with a combination of debt and equity to finance and keep WPZ at investment grade ratings.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Can you go into further detail about alternatives to the ATM?
Donald R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Christine, I think the alternatives we have are probably the same as most of the other industry participants. So I'm not going to delve into the variety of options because there are many, but I would say there are a number of options, and we'll evaluate all of those in an effort to find the lowest-cost solution while balancing risk and maintaining those ratings. And again, I would say that obviously WPZ has a supportive parent as well.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Last question from me, can you quantify how much gas was shut in in the Northeast for third quarter and for how long? And then, also, Alan, you mentioned that there is a lot of wells waiting on completion. Can you quantify that behind your acreage as well?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we're certainly not going to pinpoint anything for – which producers and so forth on that, but Jim Scheel, if you'll take that question generally?
James E. Scheel - Senior Vice President, Northeast G&P: Sure. For the third quarter in the, what I'd call the dry Northeast, we had a significant amount of volume shut in in the Bradford and Susquehanna Counties. We probably had about 350 million a day in Susquehanna and upwards of 400 million a day in Bradford, so pretty significant for the quarter shut-ins. Again, these are all price-related shut-ins. As you look at the OVM area or the Ohio River Supply Hub, we had about 150 shut-ins starting the middle of the quarter. We'll see that as we look at our reduced volume growth year-over-year in that particular area. And then, we saw shut-ins also of about 300 million in the Utica, those have come off. Those are – we are now flowing at full rate. In fact, this weekend we had a Bcf production at the Utica Supply Hub for the first time. So right now we have about 900 million shut-ins. As Alan indicated at the very beginning of the presentation, there's a number of other opportunities for us to grow volume besides the shut-in volumes including uncompleted wells, and that's true both in the Northeast portion of the Utica as well as – I mean, the Marcellus as well as the wet Marcellus in the South. Those give us a great amount of potential for future volumes. And as we look at our rig counts, we see those holding relatively steady as we go from 2015 to 2016, probably actually seeing a – although it'll probably stay at 15, it could go up by a couple of rigs over the course of that timeframe. Does that answer your question?
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Thank you so much for all the color. Congrats on a good quarter.
James E. Scheel - Senior Vice President, Northeast G&P: Thanks.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Donald R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning.
Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Just wanted to follow up on that last point there a little bit if I could. As far as the 900 shut-in that you talked about, is there – do you have any visibility to that coming back online as far as, is there certain price points or other kind of regional de-bottlenecks you think that could help get that flowing, or any color there would be great?
James E. Scheel - Senior Vice President, Northeast G&P: Alan, would you like me to take that one?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Please, Jim. Thank you.
James E. Scheel - Senior Vice President, Northeast G&P: All right. Sure. Obviously, we've talked about Henry Hub pricing and the basis differential, as I think you're aware. The basis differentials from the Northeast to market pricing have been significant. Many of our producers have been seeing realized prices in the $0.70 price range and that is pretty significant. But we have a number of opportunities, those of you remember at Analyst Day, perhaps, there are a number of projects including Constitution, Atlantic Sunrise which we're driving that are going to help bring the critical infrastructure we need to really unlock the value of these resources for our producers. In addition to that, you've got (40:19). You've got Leach. You've got Mountaineer. There are a number of industry solutions coming as we look forward into 2016 and 2017 that will help narrow those basis differentials and really unlock value for our producers in order to not only relieve the shut-in gas, but also really drive up the production rates. I think as we see that come on – we've already seen the Leidy expansion which is half a Bcf a day of incremental production coming on line that will help alleviate some of that as we go forward. But I – although we're not giving guidance as it relates to future year volume growth, I would just say, as we see that basis differential come down we're – if our producers saw the $2 pricing, we would see just tremendous volume growth in the Northeast. And then, finally, we need to look at winter pricing and weather-related issues as we go into the winter of this year, could also help improve some of those differentials and increase our Northeast volumes.
Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks for that. So it sounds like some of these takeaway solutions, probably, at least a few quarters off, if not a big longer, so takeaway won't necessarily help in the near-term, but if weather can improve that basis that could potentially be more of a near-term catalyst to help you guys out there?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I would just add to that. Thank you for the question. I would just add to that, certainly, as Jim mentioned, in the near-term, we have the Leidy Southeast, that's 525 million a day. So that's pretty substantial. Because a lot of that Northeast volume is gathered by our system, we should expect to see some of that relief parlayed (42:17) directly to our gathering assets up there. As well, I would just say, as you mentioned, we are in a fairly warm shoulder here and certainly in the cold – not just for the sake of gas prices in the Northeast, but as well for NGL prices and particularly propane, we'll see some relief during the winter like we always do as that propane is called on to deliver local markets rather than it being transported from the South, the way it used to be.
Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks for that. And then just looking at Atlantic-Gulf. It was quite a nice quarter all take (42:56). And I was just curious were there any kind of weather or one-time benefits that helped with the quarter there? Or did the quarter really perform in line with your budget and this is kind of a new run rate to think about there?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I'll take it. I don't know if we have Rory on line, he may want to provide some more detail, but – no, it really was just a matter of these big projects really starting to mount up and it really was a matter of having a full quarter. There really wasn't any seasonal issues. In fact, volumes on Transco on a, just a throughput basis were actually a little bit lighter and that's just based on moderate weather relative to last year's moderate weather. And remember, we don't really make the – Transco doesn't get driven up/down (43:43) all that much by seasonal just because all the capacity is sold out firm and so it really doesn't move with throughput (43:53). But the answer to your question is, no, there was nothing seasonal about it, it's just these big projects are starting to pile up (43:59).
Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks. That's it from me. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Shere of Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good morning. Congratulations on a nice quarter.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning. Thank you.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good to be above one times coverage.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. It is.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: So on Christine's CapEx question, Alan, you referenced some cost savings in Susquehanna and at Atlantic Sunrise, and I'm just wondering is the bulk of that kind of project-specific with good execution or just across the board are we starting to see industry-wide material and labor cost deflation?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I would say in the case of the Susquehanna Supply Hub, a couple of things: that team has really worked hard to take advantage of the scale of the installation of our compression and our gathering lines up there, and they've worked very hard with the Access team to really pull together our very best thoughts about the way to put infill compression, and so that kind of thinking is really starting to pay off for us out there, and just a real intense focus on tight project controls and execution. So without any doubt in my mind in the Susquehanna Supply Hub area, it is better execution by our team and years of focusing on better projects execution really starting to pay off up there. And that really – it's really nice to see the teams bringing the best ideas of both organizations together and really showing up in a tangible way there. On Atlantic Sunrise, I would just say that given the uncertainties that we've seen in putting in these big infrastructure projects – we've built in quite a bit of contingency into these projects, and as we deliver those projects we are able to – and start to have some of those things quantified, we're able to reduce some of that contingency. What we also did see is, as we announced earlier, we did see some lower cost on materials particularly pipe and so it's a little bit of both on Atlantic Sunrise, I would argue.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay, great. And where is the current state of Geismar utilization?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: John Dearborn, you want to take that please?
John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Sure. I'd be glad to, Alan. Thanks. And Craig here is where we are. You'll notice in our results we're reporting that Geismar's running at – we sold about 404 million pounds this quarter. I'll remind you that that's WPZ's share of Geismar, so Geismar actually sold more closer to – or produced closer to 450 million pounds, between 450 million pounds and 460 million pounds in this quarter. We have been running a bit of propane as a feedstock as we bring the plant back into operation. And so there's about another 18 million pounds of propylene that we've been producing there. Net-net, when you add all that up and make some adjustments and simplifying assumptions, so you can calculate a utilization rate we, over the quarter, ran about an average of 98%. But let me take you a little further on that. We're extraordinarily pleased with the Geismar team, the Geismar family there, because they have been setting production records that are yet in excess of that and we have a bit of upside yet to be found in that. We have two transformers that are yet scheduled to be replaced in next year that could help the team to further hone or find some increments. So I would say setting the expectation, we have a little bit of upside yet on volume out of Geismar, but it's running extraordinarily well here during this quarter and we're really grateful of the team and all the efforts they put into restoring the safe and reliable operations of that unit.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: That's great, John. I know it's been a long road there and it's terrific to hear such a good quarter in terms of execution.
John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, The Williams Cos., Inc.: Appreciate your comments. Thank you.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Last question is the PDH project, still somewhere in the neighborhood of perhaps $1 billion investment or almost then – picking up on the answer to Brandon's question, is there any thought about the gap in timing that could be for a second PDH project after the first one is online?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: I'll go ahead and take that real quickly. As to the costs, we're not going to disclose that until we go for our FID on that. And so really good work done by fine-tuning our estimates. And we do think it's a good time to be building up there, but we've certainly looked around the industry and seen what's going on on several of the other PDH projects and have been careful to take note of that as we continue to refine our estimates up there. So I would say that we've had kind of two things. On one hand we've been taking note of some of the project cost across the industry on that; and on the other hand, we are seeing favorable conditions in Alberta, but we really don't want to book that, if you will, into our estimate, and are hopeful that will provide some upside on our costs there. So big investment and we'll be providing – we're not going to be providing that number just yet until we get to the FID report, at least further along. On the gap in timing for PDH 2, really good question. That's a difficult issue, because you don't want to change scope in the middle of your project. I would tell you we have done a lot to make sure that when we do put in the PDH 2 or if we get to that decision that we've got all the space and auxiliary and the planning both on the propylene side and on the polypropylene side thought through, so I would just say we're making investment thinking about the future for PDH 2. And we do think the returns for PDH 2 project would be very attractive, but we're really just trying to keep our focus tightly on the scope of PDH 1 to start with. So I'd just say we're not ready to bring forth a PDH 2 decision just yet, but we are planning for the future.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Understood. Congratulations again on the quarter.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Darren Horowitz of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Alan, just one quick question for you. I realize you're still evaluating like you said that scope of PDH 1, but as we're trying to put some numbers around the profitability of the volume commitments that you announced in addition to obviously the low feedstock cost, is the biggest influence at arbitrage (51:44) between the level of currently produced refinery-grade propylene and where you see the demand growth for PGP and the derivatives? And that's the big driver? Or as we start to model this, do you see maybe the domestic PGP and derivatives demand significantly increasing, or maybe more margin opportunity like you said for international export? I'm just trying to figure out the drivers as to how we should think about the profitability of this plant and possibly PDH 2 over the next couple of years?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Good question. I would say really the party that will be having the lion's share of that exposure obviously would be our partner who would be in the business of marketing that product, polypropylene product, and certainly that's their expertise. And I think they're really excited about the markets they think this very low-cost supply can get into. From our vantage point, we're going to be very focused on producing propylene at a low cost and into that contract that is a fee-based contract. And so that's what we're going to be very focused on. And while we do have some exposure to the profitability over the time of that, primarily our focus is going to be on just driving volumes at a low cost and selling them to a fee-based contract.
Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Ted Durbin of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Ted J. Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. I would love to ask about the Appalachian Connector project. You mentioned the fact that producers are really interested in getting their gas uptown and it seems like a good solution, but there are some competing projects that look like they're along the same lines there. So just wondering if you – what the discussions are with producers, their willingness to commit to volumes, any range of sort of CapEx or return you might expect on a project like that?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I would just say we've been looking at a number of alternatives on that project. The thing that we – the two drivers, I would tell you is, this continued demand for natural gas in the Southeast and power generation markets and Transco being so uniquely positioned to be able to expand cheaply out of Station 165 to the South. And so that's a huge carrot, if you will, that we have uniquely available to us and we're using that to bring forward the very best project for the market. So I would just say it's pretty fluid, but that's a very – almost immovable opportunity, if you will, that is uniquely ours and provides us an ability to enter into the very best project but we want to make sure we can maximize that value after all the other investments have been made. So that's the first piece of that. Second piece of that, I would say, is that the kind of volumes that we're seeing from the dry Utica are just continuing to impress us and some tremendous volumes up there that we think are going to – cost is going to continue to lower on, and those are the drivers. So I would just say, we think the need for this project will be out there and we think we've got some unique positions that allow us to maximize the profitability when we do decide to invest in that project.
Ted J. Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you for that. And then a little more housekeeping here, but the – now, that we have Geismar up and running, the operating costs in the NGL & Petchem Services, is this sort of a good run rate that we saw in the quarter; or is there any other puts and takes there as we think about it going forward?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: John, you want to take that please?
John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, The Williams Cos., Inc.: Sure. Glad to do that. Great question and thanks for it, Ted. I guess the run rate, if I thought about the earnings in the absence of any commodity price volatility, the earnings would be a reasonable run rate to look at for the business coming through this quarter. As I think Alan mentioned, Geismar is contributing. NGL services had a reasonably good quarter for NGL services in Canada with its commodity exposure, was probably third on the list there. As you're looking at the costs, we may have experienced some costs in this quarter that are just slightly higher than we would have expected for particularly the Geismar unit, but that would be on the order of just a few million dollars, so I wouldn't expect the costs to be hugely different going forward as the run rate goes, Ted. Hope that answers your question.
Ted J. Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Perfect. That's it from me. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Ted.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Becca Followill of U.S. Capital Advisors. Please go ahead.
Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC: Good morning, guys.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Becca.
Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC: (57:17) on the Chesapeake recent negotiation on the Haynesville MVCs, can you talk about what happens in a low gas price environment? Do they have an option for an outpay (57:26) or do they need to continue to drill into that agreement?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. I don't want to be too specific, but, first of all, for 2016 and 2017, as we mentioned earlier, our cash flow from the MVC has not changed, so there really is no change on that. And relative to the obligation to drill, that is a firm obligation and there isn't any out for pricing (57:51).
Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC: And then post 2017?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well 2017, that's when those MVCs ended naturally under the contract, so (58:03).
Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC: Okay.
John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, The Williams Cos., Inc.: And the design of the drilling obligation was to ensure that the volumes as the 2017 period ended were at a relatively high level.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. So that really was really great trade for both of us on that. We allowed them to bring – combine those fields and allow them to put the best economics to work on their capital, but in exchange to that we both got a longer-term and better expectations for volumes and growth (58:39) in the future. So really (58:40) to find a winner and a loser on that, but I would just tell you from my vantage point, and believe me we've studied it hard that really, really is a win-win. And it only makes sense that there is, because when you're forcing people to make uneconomic capital decisions and you allow them to make better capital decisions you improve the lot (59:00) for both parties.
Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC: Thank you. And then can you talk about discussions with them? Are discussions continuing to maybe renegotiate some other of these contracts?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: I would just say that we're – we think those were the bulk of the opportunities, but we'll continue to look for opportunities if there are growth opportunities. And so always, always happy to work with them, great relationship developed there, and we're very, very thankful to have them as a customer. We think they're a great operator and have been very fair to work with. So we'll continue to look for opportunities, but we don't have anything immediately to offer on.
Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC: Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Christopher Sighinolfi of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC: Hey, Alan. How are you?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning. How are you?
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC: I'm great. Thanks for all the color this morning. A lot of it's been a hit already, but just maybe two questions from me. The Gulf Connector project, looks like the proposed capacity there came down quite a bit from where you were before. Just wondering on any color you could offer on that project, either costing-wise or counterparty-wise your thoughts on initial versus maybe future expansion opportunities on the side then (01:00:23)?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Sure. Thanks for the question. Rory, would you take that question please?
Rory Lee Miller - Senior Vice President, Atlantic – Gulf Operating Area: Sure. Yeah. Good eye there, Christopher. Those numbers did change a little bit quarter-to-quarter. When we initially had that open season we had requests for much more capacity than we could handle, so we moved forward with two parties, and one of those parties has stepped out and decided that they are not going to pursue signing the agreements and making the commitment. So we've reduced the size of the project. Now, that's kind of the bad news. The good news is, some of those – one of the other players that wanted to get in, but couldn't is now going to have an opportunity to come into the project. So the project is going to be a bit smaller but the returns actually go up on the project. So we still think it's a very high quality project and one we're excited about pursuing. And kind of as you hinted out in your question, that does leave us some additional capacity that we have to work with for new opportunities that we think are going to be out there.
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thanks. Thanks for the color on that. I guess switching gears and this is just my second question. Alan, really appreciate the update on shut-ins in the Northeast and your volumetric projections and thoughts around that there. Was curious if we pivot to the West performance, at least as we were thinking about it, it was pretty solid mostly on the pricing front this quarter. Just wondering how you're thinking about producer activities out there; potential volume movements as we move into 2016 out there?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Sure. I'd just say that the producers just continue to find ways to bring in additional production out there as well with very, very few rigs running. But continue to find ways to do that, and as well are being very efficient with that. We are seeing some things that are pretty interesting out there in terms of new development. But I think our hope for that right now is to just – in the current pricing environment is to keep driving our unit costs low and keep the volumes as flat as possible, is kind of our expectation. The good news about the West relative to what we're seeing in the East is that, there's plenty of takeaway capacity, plenty of infrastructure, the gathering and processing costs are relatively low because it's older infrastructure that was built in a different pricing era. And so the variable cost or the cash cost to the producer to produce is relatively low. So we really just haven't – and we've seen very – we've seen a very small almost insignificant amount of ice-related shut-in, just like we would in any winter or shoulder month in the West. But overall, it's a very low cost place for variable production. And so we really don't expect a whole lot of change out there. So lots of reserves, lots of known reserves, and I think if we do see a price signal producers are ready to jump on it, but we're not expecting anything dramatic out of the area. And really proud of the team for working hard to keep our cash flows as steady as they have, considering how low NGL margins have been out (01:04:02).
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC: Great. Thanks a lot, Alan. Thanks for your color this morning. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Sharon Lui of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Just wanted to, I guess, get your thoughts in terms of the pace of additional capital spending for gathering and processing assets in the Northeast, given the current environment? Specifically, maybe if you can talk about, I guess, the investments tied to the Utica with Chesapeake and how you see maybe that $600 million of capital ramp up over the years?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Great question. I would just say that we're really excited about that acreage dedication and think that once the infrastructure demand, or – sorry, the infrastructure constraints are lifted out there and the firm obligations that various customers have out there, they'll be working to take advantage of that firm capacity that they have, and so feel pretty good about the prospects of that. But I also would say that the way we're structured on that, we're not obligated to go spend that money out in front of the production showing up, and so we have an ability to step into that. So we're not going to be out spending capital in front of that drilling from a risk standpoint. But we do think that's a very, very good acreage, some really impressive cost levels available to it. And so we're really excited. We've got a very good vantage point of what people's production versus cost levels are. We're very excited about that acreage.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from John Edwards of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Bhavesh M. Lodaya - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, good morning. This is Bhavesh instead of John on. So most of my questions are answered. Just a question on Geismar. Given where ethylene prices are, curious to know your views on prices going ahead for the next maybe few quarters and whether there are any opportunities to maybe have any fee-based contracts against (01:06:28)?
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: John, you want to take that please?
John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, The Williams Cos., Inc.: Sure. Glad to take it and thanks for the question. Yeah. First of all, we're really pleased to be serving customers again back in Louisiana. It just so happened that as we brought Geismar back on, so did Evangeline come on, and so the market was well served. And I think looking back over our shoulder here, in the last quarter, the ethylene market was well served by production in that there were very few shutdowns or unexpected shutdowns. And I think in at least one of the months – say it was July, we saw industry-high production. So I think all of that lead to perhaps a bit of an oversupply or a slightly long market in ethylene and the necessary price adjustments that occurred during the quarter. I'll note, though, that over the last weeks, two weeks notionally, we recovered some of that price. It's come back up probably on the order of about $0.05 at this point. And so just to take the conversation a little further forward to answer your question, finally, as we look forward and we look into, we call it, the second quarter of next year, a couple of factors that'll play positively is a very high turnaround season. And I think another factor that will play positively is relatively low inventories of ethylene by any public accounting. So I'm certain that people are doing exchanges to fill their needs in next year, but low inventories and high shutdown rates, planned shutdown rates certainly bode well for the supply/demand balance, I think, in our favor. I hope that brings the necessary coloring; that's the way we see things playing out here over the next couple of quarters.
Bhavesh M. Lodaya - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Sure. And are there any opportunities to tie in contracts, pricing-based contracts, on these?
John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, The Williams Cos., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Forgot to mention on that. We're always in the marketplace looking to secure the best value for our ethylene out there and we have been in conversations in past – I'll say, past quarters, including this last quarter, and we continue to have conversations with customers over whether or not they desire to enter into any sort of contracts, all in, including fee-for-service contracts and so trying to lock in some of the margins into the future. Of course, in this dynamic price environment, everyone sits across the table with kind of rubber guns pointed at each other, and we'll see where those negotiations go over time. But we're always looking, when it would appear to be favorable to us, to lock up solid volumes and solid margins on Geismar 1.
Bhavesh M. Lodaya - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you. And thanks, Alan, and congrats on a great quarter.
Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you very much. Appreciate that.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Please continue.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams and Williams Partners' Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John D. Porter - Head-Investor Relations: Thank you, Julia. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website, williams.com. These items include yesterday's press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to you momentarily. Our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to questions. And we also have the five leaders of Williams' operating areas with us. Walter Bennett leads the West; John Dearborn leads NGL and Petchem Services; Rory Miller leads Atlantic-Gulf; Bob Purgason leads Access Midstream; and Jim Scheel leads Northeast G&P. In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconciled to General Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Great. Thank you, John and thanks everybody for being on the call this morning. We've got a lot of things to cover today, but before we discussed the second quarter results, I'd like to briefly comment on the WMB Board Strategic Alternatives process that's underway. And as you'll recall, Williams announced on June 21 that it planned to explore a range of strategic alternatives that could include among other things, a merger, a sales of Williams or continuing to pursue the company's existing operating and growth plan. A robust competitive process, we believe, is the best way to get the best options on the table and to maximize shareholder value and the board's review is meant to accomplish just that. The process is underway and we're pleased with the progress to-date. As I'm sure you'll understand we do not intend to comment further on this thorough review of these alternatives before the WPZ transaction today and we won't be commenting further on that until the process is completed and a more definitive course of action is determined by the board. In the meantime and I can assure you that our focus remains on maximizing value and we continue to act in the best interests of our shareholders as we through this process. And so, with that, let's move on to the first slide and talk about the tremendous growth that we enjoyed in the second quarter and a strong trajectory of growth in front of us. So look here on slide two, the package, here in the second quarter, certainly, demonstrates the benefits from our clearly defined strategy of capitalizing on the significant natural gas market growth by connecting the very best supplies to the best markets. We've been on this strategy for quite some time and is really starting to deliver a lot of significant growth, particularly in our fee-based revenues. For this quarter, WMB's adjusted EBITDA was $1.02 billion, up 32% versus second quarter of 2014 and at WPZ, we had a record distributable cash flow of $701 million and delivered an adjusted EBITDA of $1.01 billion, which was driven by fee-based revenue growth. Overall, we had solid performance from four of our five segments, and the performance was delivered despite the fact that volumes were lower in some areas, as a result of price related shut-ins and also because we are operating in a historically low commodity price environment. So when we say lower, just we mean lower than they could have been. We actually had very significant growth in lot of those areas, but certainly, significant impact from volumes being shut in from gas prices. So let me walk through some of the numbers here. First of all, in the Atlantic-Gulf, really the strong performance from Atlantic-Gulf, $389 million in adjusted EBITDA and this was up 44% on fee-based revenues from new projects. And this group really is managing a tremendous amount of growth, and just keeps on delivering this growth in a very safe and reliable manner, so couldn't be prouder of all the great work going on there. At Access, $345 million, up 25% on fee-based revenue growth, and I have to say that certainly we're pleased with the contributions being made from this acquisition, and it's not just the predictable growing cash flows that we all expected, but I would tell you, probably, the piece that's been most impressive from my perspective is the great injection of new talent and ideas that are coming from our new fellow Williams' employees that came from this acquisition. So integration and the synergies are going even a little better than expected there and we continue to see great opportunities out in front of us, as we take in a lot of the ideas and we merge the entities, particularly seeing a lot of opportunity up in the Northeast and we're really starting to get into some of the synergies within our operational excellence and E&C areas as well. In the Northeast G&P, this is $92 million, up 21% and impressively on 54% higher Ohio Valley Midstream gathering volumes, so really starting to see that come through and noted that the team had a record volume there just this week, and really pushing out some big numbers there, as those volumes start to come in and I'll let Jim Scheel address that later. In the Northeast, in general, I would say that as the face of the energy in the U.S. has changed over the past years and where it's coming from, we have certainly worked very hard to get ourselves into a position to unlock the tremendous value of the Marcellus and the Utica areas like never before. And we have put ourselves in a position and we are the leading gathering systems in the Northeast. And we believe our shareholders are going to see great long term value from this tremendous position that we've been able to accumulate in the Marcellus and Utica position. On to the West, EBITDA was $150 million, and this was down 27%. But as we mentioned, this really was driven by lower NGL margins and so that really was the big story out there. But I will tell you, from an operational standpoint, continuing to see great performance there on both reliability of our operations out there and the safety of our operations out there. And in fact, in the quarter, our gathering volumes were flat really as compared to the prior quarter and as the year-over-year quarterly comparison and our equity gallons, so the gallons that we take for our account, and our plant inlet volumes were both higher on a year-over-year comparison. So West continues to hold its own, but certainly impacted by lower prices there in the second quarter. And then in the NGL and Petchem space, the adjusted EBITDA was just $33 million and that number is certainly lower than last year due to the absence of the business interruption proceeds that we reported in the second quarter of 2014. And the near zero prices for propane that we saw in the Edmonton spot prices from our Canadian operations. But this, of course, was a little bit offset by the Geismar, as Geismar began to ramp up here in the second quarter. But really that was probably the disappointment from my perspective, for the quarter, was not getting Geismar up as soon as we would have liked to, and we did have some very serious electrical power problems on the feed into the plant and we've gotten that behind us now, but it has certainly hampered our operations there in the second quarter. So once again, I want to reiterate the overall growth our teams are delivering, and we've begun to enjoy the fruits of our labor as we manage the tremendous growth that we really have thought very hard to win on our Transco system in the deepwater, and certainly, in the Northeast G&P, and we expect big improvement now in our NGL and Petchem services group for the balance of 2015, with Geismar now online and Horizon coming on towards the very end of 2015. Moving on to the next slide here – sorry I'm going back to – stay back on the slide sorry. When you look at our results this quarter, you'll see that our fee-based revenue growth really is coming through in a big way and pretty powerful the way it overpowered lower commodity prices in the quarter. And I think that's really important that we are executing on that strategy in a big way of shifting our business to fee-based revenues and this quarter is an example of where that really pushed through what was some really strong headwinds on the commodity price this quarter. And in fact, at WPZ, our fee-based revenues were up $537 million or 72%, and while a lot of that was driven by the Access acquisition, a lot of this came through our major projects that we're ramping up. And so, if you look at just the WPZ historic assets, our fee-based revenues were up 17%. And this doesn't include fee-based revenues from things like our proportional JVs. So for assets like Discovery, which of course got a big boost from the Keathley Canyon project coming on and our UEO investment in the Utica, big improvements in fee-based revenues there, but given the way we account for that, that does not show up in that $130 million of incremental fee-based revenues. On the NGL margin side, we certainly experienced some serious headwinds and our NGL margins were down $56 million here for the second quarter of 2015. In fact, we only recorded $38 million of NGL margins for the quarter, and it's been a long, long time since we had that low a report for NGL margins. The Geismar plant, just to mention what's going on there, did ramp up in the second quarter. And albeit that was slower than we expected, but it is now online and consistently operating at or near its full production capacity and we expect significant contributions from the plant here in the second half of the year, as I mentioned earlier. On a personal note, I'd just like to recognize that that leadership team there at Geismar has been through a lot. And I want to recognize the fact they have really kept their eyes on getting that plant back up in a safe manner, and they continue to hit some really impressive safety records there, despite a tremendous amount of activity going on at the plant there. And I can't tell you how hard that team has worked to get the plant back up and running safely and I'm very appreciative of their efforts. And so, let's move on to guidance. First of all, we are reaffirming our Williams dividend guidance for 2015 through 2020. And I would point out that the guidance that we've provided is based on an assumption of the completion of the acquisition of the Williams Partners public units by Williams. We are also reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2016 through 2018, although we are lowering the 2015 adjusted EBITDA midpoint guidance that we issued in February by about 6%. And of course, this reflects the lower commodity prices that are showing in the market right now for the balance of the year, and as well the problems that we had at Geismar and the ramp-up in the second quarter. So the Geismar impact of that is really already in our second quarter, and the balance of that lowering is coming through commodity prices for the balance of the year. We also are reaffirming our dividend of $0.64 per share in third quarter of 2015, or $2.56 annualized, and also our dividend of $2.85 in 2016 with 10% to 15% annual dividend growth coming through 2020. And so, on to the last point on this slide, certainly, a tremendous amount of growth continues to come at us. And I want to say that we're very excited about how the major projects that are now contributing on the fee-based revenue side are really starting to drive our business and also a lot of projects that are on our list right now that will continue to build the stream of growing cash flows for years to come. Now, moving on to the next slide here and this is slide four. First of all, the projects that are beginning to contribute. We said back in the first quarter at our Analyst Day in May that the demand side of the natural gas market is driving our project list and we are really reinforcing that here again today. And as we look at some of the significant projects that we put into service here in the second quarter, it's easy to see that we've really been executing and delivering on these projects. And here, as you look at the second quarter, for example, on our Transco system, you can see here we delivered three very important projects in the quarter: the Rockaway Lateral and the Northeast Connector project that goes with the Rockaway Lateral, so – but two independent projects there. The Mobile Bay South 3 project, we brought into service in April of 2015, and that was on time and on budget. And our CPV Woodbridge project, which was brought into service on schedule and below budget. And our New York Bay expansion project, just one more example, we did make our FERC application in July here just recently as well. So a lot of hits just keep coming on the Transco side. Gulfstar One, these big projects that we put on into service at the end of the first quarter really provided a lot of strong contribution here in the second quarter. And the production volumes from the Tubular Bells prospect there does continue to grow. And in fact, the fourth well was just brought on recently there by the operator. Our Discovery Keathley Canyon Connector, certainly drove our proportional JV EBITDA in the quarter. And again, these are fee-based revenues that are coming from Exxon's Hadrian facility and Anadarko's Lucius facility. Our Discovery system is running completely full now, and we are really liking the prospects that sit around the Keathley Canyon system and the kind of high margin business that will continue to flow in on this system that is so well-positioned now in the Keathley Canyon. We also completed an acquisition of the Fox Creek gathering and treating system. And this expands Access's Eagle Ford footprint. And as we said in the last call, we expected to see producer systems come into the M&A space and this acquisition is a really good example of that. So this is a bolt-on to our business there in the Eagle Ford and a very nice addition of predictable fee-based cash flows coming in there. We also acquired some additional interest in UEO and that interest is now up to 62% and this area is really enjoying tremendous volume growth here in the Utica. On Geismar, as I said earlier, Geismar is now producing near its full expanded capacity. And in fact, our production here on Tuesday was about 5.27 million pounds a day of both ethylene and propylene, and so, doing very well there and we'll continue to optimize between our ethylene and propylene production depending on margins. Coming soon, as we look forward, there's a lot of exciting projects left to come on for the year. Our Virginia Southside project is expected to come in-service in the third quarter of 2015. And our Leidy Southeast project is expected to come on in-service in fourth quarter 2015. And so, we're making good progress on those items. Our Canadian off-gas processing, we're making great progress towards bringing our CNRL Horizon project startup in 2015; and our Kodiak tieback, which is a tieback to our Devils Tower platform, is expected to come on in the fourth quarter of 2015. And these tiebacks that we're getting to experience out here are really powerful tools in terms of driving a return on our business, as they require very little capital and large amounts of fee-based revenues. In fact, our Devils Tower field is now nearly 12 years old and this is the fifth field to be produced from this platform now. And Gunflint will be the first tieback to our Gulfstar platform and that is expected to come on in 2016. And I would tell you that is well ahead of our original expectations that we had for that investment thesis in Gulfstar. So really enjoying the benefits of really learning to aggregate and tieback production in these big deepwater spars. Once again, this list is certainly very extensive, and I'm very proud of our team's progress, as they really are delivering the growth that's out in front of us now. Moving on to slide five, we've said many times that Williams is uniquely positioned to connect the best natural gas supplies to the very best markets. And we've certainly focused our strategy on natural gas and are positioned to take advantage of the demand growth that's both here today and is coming in the next few years. We have bought and built our way into being the largest gas gatherer in the largest and fastest growing gas supply basin. And we've built Transco into the largest and fastest growing natural gas pipeline. Our second quarter results are certainly a reflection of the fact that our efforts are driving tremendous cash flow growth, despite stark commodity price headwinds and our large scale fee-based projects are meeting or exceeding our expectations as they begin to contribute in a big way. So the revenues from big projects like Keathley Canyon and Gulfstar are really doing very well, and in many cases, as I said, going beyond our expectations. Our focus on the fee-based growth means that we're expecting about 89% of WMB's 2015 through 2017 gross margin to come from fee-based revenues. And we have $9.8 billion of the total 2015 through 2017 in-guidance growth CapEx and 96% of that is focused on fee-based projects. We have committed and potential growth capital through 2020 of over $30 billion. And I'll tell you that is very rapidly growing. We really haven't updated that guidance in quite a while. But I'll tell you that book of business is rapidly expanding. It also – when we put that out, we do not include things like our M&A bolt-ons. And so, we've got a lot of M&A bolt-ons that are coming at us and are very – we're very well positioned for and those are not included in that opportunity list as well. So our backlog of projects does continue to grow and we just have not updated that just because it is so large to start with, but we do continue to see great opportunities in our business, both in terms of the known projects and the potential projects both continue to expand. So I'd like to just sum things up like this, with over $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter and the record quarterly DCF, both of these are driven by strong fee-based revenue growth and we're very pleased with our second quarter results, as the headwinds of lower commodity prices are certainly being overwhelmed by the tremendous growth in fee-based revenues that will continue for years to come. So some pretty serious headwinds that have been out there, but well, it's really impressive now to see all these projects starting to take hold and really starting to make our NGL margin rather insignificant up against the growth of our business. And certainly, the growth that we're seeing demonstrates the performance of our premier asset footprint in the natural gas infrastructure space. And this includes the fastest-growing pipeline in the U.S. and the largest and fastest-growing positions in the tremendous Marcellus and Utica basins. So with that, as we move into the Q&A session, I'd just like to remind everyone that the purpose of today's call is to discuss our operational and financial results for the second quarter of 2015. And I ask that you please limit your questions to these topics. We won't be taking questions on the Strategic Alternatives process or the WPZ transaction. And once again, I can assure you that the focus of our strategic alternatives review remains on maximizing value and that the board and management team will continue to act in the best interests of our shareholders. And we're excited about doing that. And so, with that, let's move on to the second quarter Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question today comes from Brandon Blossman of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everyone.
Unknown Speaker: Good morning.
Unknown Speaker: Good morning.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Actually, a big picture question first up. Alan, you suggested that the backlog is actually growing, no change to the official guidance. What – just kind of qualitatively, when would we or should we expect some updates there and is it just as things come to fruition or is it more of a quarterly type event?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I would say there's really two things you should see moving there. One is that many of the projects that are in our potential backlog so that are in that $30-plus billion, some of those projects will start to be moving in to guidance as we close deals there. So a lot of big opportunity right now, particularly in the Northeast, and as well as Transco continues to be very successful in contracting for new business along its system. And so, you'll start to see some business migrate from that $30-plus billion into the guidance numbers. So in terms of timing, we'll just update that in that particular case, as those deals are closed. Secondly, on the potential bucket, I would just tell you we just – the demand side of our business is really picking up in a big way and we're extremely well-positioned to capture a lot of that. And so, we are seeing a lot of additional interest in that, and we just obviously don't update that every single quarter. On the potential side, for one reason, it's so large already, it's not going to drive all that much, but as we see significant projects move in there, we're beginning to expand that. But I think the first thing you should expect to see in the near-term is projects in the guidance side starting to build.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's actually very helpful. And then, somewhat related, you mentioned Access operational synergies kind of showing up here recently. Is there anything – any detail that you can provide around that or any specific synergies that you want to highlight?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Thank you for that question. We had identified that we would have 25 last year upon the acquisition and then 50 on the merger. And right now, we have in our sights a number that's better than 50 here for 2015. And because some of that is being – even though it will show up in 2015, some of that will be full run rate; next year, we'll actually see a larger number than that next year. So a lot of those things are on some of the support services side, but we also are in the process. We've reorganized our leadership in the Northeast under Jim Scheel there and so we're starting to look at that the synergies that are available to us in the Northeast gathering area as well, and those really will be 2016 kind of improvements in synergies, and we're just really starting to identify what that really looks like.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: So stay tuned for the 2016 guidance number on synergies?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. That's good for me for right now. I'll hand it over.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay.
Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni of UBS.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Hi, good morning guys. Couple of questions on my front here. I was wondering, first, if we can sort of talk about the MVC exposures at the old Access assets. There's been a lot of discussion about it lately. When you look at your exposures relative to your producer customers, I was wondering if you think of it on a basin-by-basin basis and if there are any regions where it's possible the producer customer has, I guess low to negative IRRs. And I guess that likely is in the case in Northeast, but I was wondering if you could comment if there's any regions where you see some weaknesses where producers are likely to be at or below the MVC should the commodity prices continue to be at the current levels, or possibly get worse?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Let me try to take that and then look a little bit to Bob here. If you are speaking of MVCs outside of the Chesapeake business, for instance, we do have some shut-ins in the Marcellus area. And those contracts are under cost of service. And so that value proposition of that would come back to us when that rate gets adjusted on an annual basis. And so that's I think the best way to think about that relative to the Chesapeake business. The MVCs that exist in the other Northeast, I would say, we're well above those – even at current shut-in production levels, we're well above those. I think the way you should think about that is that the volume support that we really have with that will come when the big pipeline projects come into service and there is known obligations to volumes into those downstream pipelines. So Constitution, Atlantic Sunrise and Leidy Southeast obligations into those projects will drive some support for volumes just because we know what the obligations are into those take or pay obligations on those pipelines.
Robert S. Purgason - Senior Vice President, Access Operating Area: Let me...
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: So...
Robert S. Purgason - Senior Vice President, Access Operating Area: Yeah, I was just going to add the two areas where we've got through MVCs, the Barnett and the Haynesville, obviously, were below the MVC in the Barnett. We do look at them on a basin-by-basin basis. And our view is that drilling in the Haynesville will come under the MVC that's growing in that area. And you're seeing that in the volumes that are showing up. But the Barnett is just not attracting the drill bit right now, and we don't think will be for a while, but it still is producing good cash flow in terms of its lifting cost compared to the current netbacks.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: So just to confirm, the Barnett is not attracting the drill bit, likely negative returns for your producer customers and is that the case also in the Haynesville? And that's why you're saying it's going to probably come under the MVCs at some point?
Robert S. Purgason - Senior Vice President, Access Operating Area: Well, I wouldn't speculate as to Chesapeake's returns in that area in total. I'll just note that the Barnett's producing good free cash flow in almost any environment and that that Haynesville is attracting drill bit currently.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. My follow-up questions, there was a big pickup in ethane volume sales in the Northeast. I was wondering if you can sort of talk about the big shift. Is it something that you did, is rejection suddenly not happening? I was just wondering if you can sort of give us a little bit of color on that.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Sure. One thing we didn't mention was that towards the end of the second quarter, we brought our ethane pipeline up there into service. And so, we now are running our de-ethanizer and that ethane pipeline feeds in to the – some of the contracts where producers have to sell their ethane. And so that is what's driving that. So now, we're getting incremental fees for those ethane services that we wouldn't have been getting until that pipeline and the de-ethanizer replacement service.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Final question. I realize you can't talk about the strategic review process and so forth. I was just wondering if you'd confirm whether a data room is currently open or not.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We're not going to talk about that, Shneur. We're just going to have to hold a very, very firm line on this (32:42) answer your questions on.
Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. No problem. Thank you very much, guys. I appreciate the color.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan.
Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Just for the strategic process, I appreciate you might not be able to say anything here, but I wanted to bounce a couple of thoughts. Is there anything you can share with us as far as what the timeline might be there? And also, you talked about some smaller bolt-on acquisitions. Does this process interfere with any larger M&A aspirations you might have?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll take the second question just to say that it is business, as usual, in terms of our bolt-on M&A efforts. And so, we continue to execute on our plan and our strategy in that regard.
Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then, in the Northeast, it looks like gathering volumes were down a little bit quarter-over-quarter, but processing was up. I was just wondering if you could share a bit more with us in terms of what you hear with regard to producer customer activity there in the back half of the year, and how you guys are thinking about volumes at this point?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Sure. I'll just take that real quickly and then if you've got some more detail, Jim Scheel can chime in. Really, the only impact, the gathering volumes and production available is actually growing pretty rapidly. And as you saw, the big increase we had in OVM volumes with a 54% increase in gathering volumes in the Ohio Valley area. But the real impact was from shut-ins, particularly from producers up in the Susquehanna County area and some very substantial shut-ins that are due to lack of infrastructure availability. So we hear the term gas price there, but in fact, it really – the problem isn't the gas prices. They were enjoying $270 gas price up there. They would be pulling everything they could, but in fact, with all the constraints and lack of takeaway infrastructure right now, they're not getting that kind of pricing level and so some of those big producers start to bid against themselves as they put additional supplies into the market and so they're taking actions to curtail that production and so – but in fact continue to develop the reserves, and are making ready for when these big pipeline projects like Leidy Southeast, Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise come on up there. And so there are some big volumes and big gas purchase contracts that will stand behind those, and so they're readying their availability to deliver against those obligations. And so it's just about that simple. The rest of the business, the Northeast volumes are, in particular, like I said, OVM volumes are doing well and the Utica volumes are doing well as well on the joint venture operations that we have there.
Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks for that. And...
James E. Scheel - Senior Vice President, Northeast Gathering & Processing: No, I'm sorry. I think Alan got it, thanks.
Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Just a follow-up on the Northeast. You'd outlined some of the cost savings that the Access merger had brought into the fold. I was wondering if you might be able to talk a little bit more about the commercial synergies that you might see. And I think during the Analyst Day, you talked about specific hubs there and opportunities related to that. So are there any further thoughts as far as what joint commercial opportunities could occur after the combination?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Sure. A lot happening there. Probably, the most obvious and the easiest to talk about is in the OVM, in the Ohio Valley Midstream area, where Access's North Victory system sits just to the north of our OVM system and extends the reach there. And as well, the ACMP team's capabilities on building out the gathering systems and the modular compression to attract those volumes is well-known by producers in the area. And so we have a really big list of producers that we're working with right now that leverage off of the combination of those existing ACMP systems feeding into OVM, as well as the expansion of those systems into new acreage that's been taken up there. So a lot happening on that front, and it really just boils down there – within OVM, it boils down to the expansion and the reach of our system just got a lot bigger into the OVM processing and fractionation complex. In addition to that, though, I would mention two other things. First of all, the Utica dry is really starting to hit some – people – far exceed especially our expectations, I would say, in terms of the potential of those reserves in production. And we're extremely well-positioned there on capturing the Utica dry business. And so, again, the reach of the Access system that's in the area along with the OVM system is powerful in that regard. And then, finally, the joint ventures between the Blue Racer Midstream business and the UEO system, both are very well-positioned on the Utica, and are enjoying growth there. And of course, we're looking to find ways to combine those systems in a way that really provides a super system for the area. And we think we're extremely well-positioned to bring that about. So a lot happening there that really is the combination of the historic Access assets and the historic Williams assets. And I think when we back up couple of years from now and look at this very impressive coverage of the area, in terms of being able to offer producer services on both Utica dry, the Utica wet, and the Marcellus wet, and particularly where those things cross over. So a lot happening there and we couldn't be more excited about the number of opportunities that are coming at us right now in Jim Scheel's area.
Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And do you see more opportunities to kind of take advantage of that liquids production, extending your footprint further downstream?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You know, there's a lot of great projects out there. We are certainly working with our producers who control those liquids to try to find the right opportunities and certainly, are encouraging that infrastructure to get built on the downstream side. And so, I think from our vantage point, we're looking to try to encourage the development of that infrastructure, but it's really our producers' volumes and they'll be the ones that need to speak for the support of those projects.
Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks. And then just one last one if I could. With regard to Geismar, how close will 3Q 2015 be to a complete full quarter? And is the O&M run rate in 2Q, is that a good run rate for the segment?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me have John Dearborn take that.
John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams: As Alan mentioned, we made about 5.27 million pounds per day on Tuesday. I think that would be a pretty reasonable rate to expect, because we've been able to demonstrate that for reasonably long periods of time, in excess of a week through this past several weeks as we brought the plant into full operation. So we're very encouraged with where we are today. So I think that's a fair way to look going forward. I think the one thing to take into consideration on the O&M numbers is we did face a rather substitute power failure, during the second quarter, which would have seen some higher O&M costs. I'm going to venture to say somewhere in the range of about $6 million to repair furnaces, which were unexpected. Those furnaces – it's a pretty normal thing when you face a significant power outage that you've to go in and repair the furnaces. That's what takes time, and it took some money in the second quarter.
Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks for all the color.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Shere of Tuohy Brothers.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good morning, guys.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Craig.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: So I got one follow-up on Brandon and Jeremy's question in the Northeast and then a couple on commodities. So picking up on the Northeast opportunities, there's been a couple absolutely monster Utica dry gas wells. I think one was just reported this morning, but in the last week a couple really big ones. Is there any way to give a rough range of the potential size of midstream service opportunities in the dry gas area out there?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Great question. And I will tell you that I think the challenge for everybody up there right now is getting the takeaway capacity out of the area. And so, there's no doubt that the potential was there at this point. I don't think anybody that's involved or engaged in the business up there doubts the potential. And especially, in areas where you already have pads established for the Marcellus wet and even some of the Marcellus dry, the underlying Utica under that and the ability to take advantage of the existing pads and existing infrastructure to bring that production on is where we think a lot of that big production will come on when there's an adequate call for it by the market. But as we sit today, the market – the supply side is desperate to see those expansion projects come online on the gas takeaway side to be able to alleviate that. So I think that's really the curtailment, if you will, right now, that will stop that from being – going gangbusters, but it is impressive. In terms of the opportunity for us, we've got a multi-billion dollar opportunities right now that we're looking at in terms of expansion of our systems up there, a lot of which is driven by both the Utica dry and where it overlays with the Marcellus wet. And so, we've got very – we're very far along in negotiations. And as I mentioned earlier, that's really where you ought to start to see our growth come from in terms of our potential projects. Besides the Transco demand side, you also should start to expect some of that business that was in the potential start to move into the guidance, as we start to close up on some of that business that's out there in front of us.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Great. That's helpful. And then, on the commodities side, a couple of related questions. First, on the $150 million of EBITDA guidance change relating to commodity price deck, can you roughly split that between Geismar olefins and all other and elaborate on what you're seeing as drivers right now for olefins crack spreads into 2016? And are you still seeing or expecting at least a couple cent premium to Belvieu there? And then the final thing on new projects relating to commodity issues, any updates on PDH or Geismar 2?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Boy, that was a lot of questions, Craig.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: I'm sorry.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Trying to digest them all here.
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I can take the – of the $150 million change in commodities since our February – we issued that guidance on February based on the price outlook at that time, I'd say something under $60 million was olefins, and the balance was NGL margins and related curtailments.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: I got you.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I'd say that's certainly the big numbers was on the NGL piece and then the Geismar piece, which is really behind us now. The PDH and Geismar 2 – great progress, really, on both of those projects and both in terms of putting the finishing touches on the contract for the polypropylene at PDH, and we do expect to be bringing that forward here in August before the board for further consideration on that project. But things are actually improving on that project in terms of – as we've started to getting quotes for a lot of the big equipment for that project. So we're really excited about the way that's going right now. On Geismar 2, very strong interest from two parties that we had narrowed that down to. And I would say we're into some pretty serious diligence now, with one party, in particular, at this point and I think very serious interest on their part and our part in terms of going ahead with the Geismar 2 project. So really great progress on both fronts there.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Great. And I'm sorry for the barrage at you. The one additional item, I just noticed that with 2015 that coming down, but 2016 unchanged, I think there was over a 30% increase in expected crack spreads, and I was wondering if you could give some additional color around drivers that you're seeing in the 2016 at Geismar.
John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams: Yeah, I think there are a couple of things. Let me take that one third in line. First, I'd like to just add to the earlier answer that I gave that that power outage that we faced was related to a utility power failure to our plant so that was not inside our plant. It was rather the supply to the plant that took the plant down, totally unexpectedly, in a very significant severe manner. Second, you had asked about premium to Belvieu, I believe. And now, with Evangeline running, with us running, that premium has essentially fallen back to more normal levels in the $0.01 or $0.02 range, though remember that Louisiana is a thinly traded market, and so, you don't get every day visibility into what that premium is. Also, remember that our customers have a call on about 80% of our production. So we have only available to us about 20% sell into the spot market, and coming through the second quarter, certainly, through June and in July, we have been satisfying our full contract requirements to our customers, so selling essentially all of our volume in that contract. There've been some de minimis volumes that we have sold into the spot market only when there were some discontinuities between what our customers needed and what we were able to produce. And now that I've gotten through those two, somehow I've lost track of what the third question was.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It was the 30% increase in crack spread.
John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams: The 30% increase in crack spread. Thanks. Well, looking at this year, I think earlier in the year, we were saying that we saw inventories rather low in ethylene and that we could expect some demand growth and we could expect perhaps some disruptions in supply that might drive to a tightness in ethylene that would help improve that situation. We haven't seen that materialize quite as yet in this year, but certainly, as time passes into next year and subsequent years, up until the time when the new crackers come on, you would expect that continued demand growth, and of course, recoveries of international markets and the like that might be hampering volumes these days would result in some strengthening opportunities for margin growth. And I think that's what we see behind the future there.
Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: We'll go next to Ross Payne of Wells Fargo.
Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: How are you doing gentlemen?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning. Couple of quick questions. Could we get a rough debt number or debt number for WMB or WPZ? And secondarily, thanks for the guidance on the fee-based from 2005 (sic) [2015] to 2017. Can you give us a rough estimate of what fee-based is currently for the company? And then third, I was going through your press release. Can you talk about the profits that the Geismar is currently generating or what it was maybe in the second quarter? Thanks.
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Hey, Ross. This is Don Chappel. The debt numbers are in the 10-Q that we filed this morning. I'll try to grab something real quick here for you. But again, we filed the Williams and Williams Partners 10-Q this morning. All that detail is out there.
Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great.
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Long term debt, this is at Williams, $21.285 billion.
Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay, great. I'll check the Q on that.
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, great. Thank you.
Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: And on the fee-based?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: The fee-based percentage, I think, for this quarter and for 2015 is going to be in excess of 90%. I think somewhere in the 92% range given that Geismar was down for a portion of the year and kind of where commodities are. We're estimating or forecasting the fee-based percentage to be just a little below that over the three-year period, 2015 through 2017 is about 89%.
Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And the Geismar profits?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I don't think we've disclosed the specific Geismar profits, but we did indicate that there was $50 million of gross margin for the quarter.
Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. All right. When I'm looking at the press release and it goes over the Geismar incident adjustment of the negative $126 million, how do I think about that?
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: That was business interruption and insurance proceeds. Again, a year ago, the plant was down, but we had business interruption insurance. And we estimated that during the second quarter of last year that we had a right to about $122 million. Since that date, we've collected -- we have a $500 million policy. We had losses, property losses approaching $70 million with just a little over $430 million, I believe, of BI. We've collected more than $420 million. We have a claim for $20 million that's open that's still being negotiated with an insurer, but again, the vast majority of our insurance claim has now been paid.
Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Looking at this, I mean it looked like it was $96 million in the second quarter 2014 and then it swung to a negative $126 million for the second quarter of 2015, so.
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Again, there's a difference between GAAP and adjusted. So for GAAP, for financial statement purposes, we record the cash, the insurance proceeds when we have a signed settlement agreement with the insurers or we actually receive the cash. For adjusted earnings, we in effect accrued it based on our expectation of collection. John Dearborn from Investor Relations can walk you through the...
Unknown Speaker: John Porter.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: John Porter.
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: John Porter, excuse me. John Porter in our IR shop can walk you through the GAAP to non-GAAP numbers.
Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks. And just one more, do you guys know the timing of when your strategic review will be complete? Thanks.
Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: There is no timing announced.
Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: All right. Great. Thanks, guys.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay, thanks very much, Ross.
Operator: We'll go next to Timm Schneider of Evercore.
Timm Schneider - Evercore ISI: Hey, good morning, guys. Hey, Alan, when we spoke in April, I think you were saying this was the earliest time you guys had locked up all of your Conway storage and rail racks for some of the Northeast NGLs. Obviously, if you look at some of the E&P numbers, realizations were pretty awful. I was just wondering how you guys see that shake out as we get into the shoulder season of 2016, right, Q2, Q3 without really any incremental export capacity slated to come on until the end of that year and what impact that's going to have?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Timm, great question and certainly one that a lot of people should be paying attention to, obviously. I do think that even though the export capacity, not any new export capacity coming on, there is, as you know, that hasn't been fully utilized. And I think the limitation there has been on ships having the capacity to carry that out. So I think that's kind of the next bottleneck, if you will, for the industry to face. And so, I think keeping a close eye on the availability of the shipping capacity to get out of the exports is probably the next thing to keep our eye on in terms of opening the markets up. But other than that, I don't really see much changing here domestically in terms of either storage capacity or rail loading capacity. I would say everything that can move and store NGLs right now is in full utilization, and building up behind the next bottleneck, which, as I mentioned, in this case is the export capacity getting the shipping capacity available to them. So I think that's the next thing to keep our eyes on here in the shoulder month. But certainly we don't see any near-term big relief here. I think we're probably three to four months out before we start to seize a lot of that capacity out there (56:35).
Timm Schneider - Evercore ISI: Okay. And then my follow-up is, you obviously saw a large proposed merger transaction up in the Northeast with two of your competitors. From your standpoint, how does that change the competitive landscape in the Northeast in terms of competing for projects and whatnot, how do you guys see that from your perspective?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I don't really expect a whole lot of change. I think from our perspective, we're pretty excited to see Marathon bringing their business and they've always had an interest and are very well positioned to take care of lot of the heavies and the condensate in the area. And so, we're really excited to have them engaged in bringing takeaway solutions to the area. So I would say that's kind of the net positive out of it. In terms of competition, I think we've got such major acreage dedications already to us and it's a matter of getting the takeaway capacity coming online for the Northeast and now, even for the Marcellus and the dry Utica. And I think that will be really the drivers there is that capacity coming online and then we will be in a position to provide a lot of supply infrastructure to handle that, as those markets open up in the future. So I really see that as really the determinant up there more than the competitive landscape.
Timm Schneider - Evercore ISI: Okay, got it. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: We will go next to Sharon Lui of Wells Fargo.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, good morning. Just a quick question for John. Perhaps maybe you can just talk about your outlook for NGL pricing up in Canada and how maybe the recent weakness could impact I guess the returns of some projects coming on in the back half of this year?
John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams: Yeah, it's a great question. And perhaps I can take it on by giving a little bit of background on how we make money there. And I think it's important for us all to remember that we make money on the spreads between gas and what is substantially an olefin stream. So we make money between gas and propylene and gas and uplift. And of course, we're protected on core price on our ethylene production up there in Canada. And so, really the substantive exposure that we face that I think – and certainly causes us concern is on the NGL portion or the (59:20) portion of that production. And certainly, today, propane is not returning a cheap value. And so, therefore, it's the one product that is not making money for us up in the Canadian pocket right now. And so we're just looking for opportunities where we might be able to mitigate that situation. We haven't found it yet. So I don't have a clear solution for you yet, but we have found a way to deal with the heavier part of the barrel. It's making money now and all the rest of the parts of the barrel are making money. And so, if you think about the pocket in that way, I think you'll understand that we're still contributing income in Canada despite the NGL difficulty. One last point, though, and that is the stranded (1:00:13) nature of that propane up in Alberta does substantiate our thesis on why we think the PDH and the creation of a demand center (1:00:22) in Canada creates a value-added project and a sustainably advantage project into the future.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Do you see any potential catalyst that would decrease that propane oversupply in Canada?
John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams: Well, if you mean by catalyst a process that uses a catalyst to convert the propane into something else? I'm sorry.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Or maybe a project that would alleviate the oversupply situation up in Canada, like any drivers?
John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams: The only thing that we occasionally seek through is whether (1:01:05) would ever reverse but right now, the (1:01:07) is needed up in Canada, and so, in the absence of another large pipeline that traverses rather long distances to move the propane to the Midwest or somewhere else in the United States, I think it's very hard to imagine something that's going to alleviate the situation on propane.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would just say, Sharon, and certainly, we've got our eyes on that, and as John mentioned, there are ways that we're looking to help mitigate that. And part of that is to getting the propane back into the fuel markets. So if you think about that, where there are big straddle plants that are extracting propane, our facility extracting propane, the simple way is to get those propane barrels back into the gas stream where they came from in the first place in the most part and I think you'll see moves on people's parts to start to get a lot of that propane back into those streams.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And I guess just a follow-up, how should we think about the near-term returns on the Horizon investment?
John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams: Well, in the near-term while NGL prices are still where they are, I'd suspect they're probably going to fall a little bit short of where we would expect long-term returns to be. I think on a volume perspective, think of Horizon as being about a third of what we're doing (1:02:37) today. So I think that gives you a view on both the margin and the kind of volume.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So just to remind you though on that, Sharon, the bulk of the income on that asset really comes off the propylene and the butylene and then the ethane, which has the fee-based contract or the floor (1:02:59) contract for the ethane already embedded, which gives us a margin on the ethane and ethylene. So that's really where the bulk of the value comes from and the propane stream, even though it's very depressed right now, certainly has not been and isn't expected to be a big contributor to value in the future.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: And our final question in the queue comes from Chris Sighinolfi of Jefferies.
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC: Hey. Good morning, Alan. Thanks for the color this morning.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC: I have a few questions. I promise to be quick. First, following on Shneur's inquiry about the relationship with Chesapeake, I'm just wondering – you were speaking specifically or inquiring specifically about the MVCs. I'm just curious sort of more broadly about the counterparty exposure you had to them. There's obviously been some visible setbacks for them over the last couple of months. So I guess within the context of that, have you tempered at all your expectations for the cost of service growth in the Northeast? I know your guidance in aggregate remained unchanged 2016 to 2018, but wondering if there was any movement within that on cost of service efforts, given CapEx headwinds potentially? And then, related, any recent conversations with them about the midstream contracts you have with them, any effort to renegotiate, do you see that as a risk?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I'll take a stab at the broad relationship and the contract discussions, and I'll ask Bob Purgason to speak to the cost of service expectations in the Northeast and broadly. First of all, on a broad level, I'll just tell you we continue to enjoy very good relationship with Chesapeake. We're very impressed with their responsiveness to the situation that they're in. And I can tell you that they continue to work hard. Obviously, they announced an asset sale in the quarter. And they continue to look for opportunities, and we continue to be constructive in working with them where we can on that. And I would just tell you, again, I remain very impressed and very confident in their actions to put themselves in a position to have the right capital focused on the right assets. And I'm confident that they're going to be able to do that. And in terms of restructuring, certainly, they take the lead on that, and we try to provide support and find win-win ways where they can add volumes that help offset some of those obligations and that's the kind of things that we're looking at. And I'm not going to get ahead of them on that, but I would just tell you we're very excited about some of the new opportunities that we can help with where they can bring on new volumes up against existing obligations. And with that, I'll have Bob try to take the cost of service question.
Robert S. Purgason - Senior Vice President, Access Operating Area: Yeah. Just in terms of our cost of service growth, there in the Northeast, it's really in our Marcellus north area where we're adding some compression to continue to support the development there. I'd note that's an area where the cost of service contracts are delivering, we'll call it, great market fees. You noticed we had a fee reduction in the first quarter, and it was related some – a part of it was the fee reduction in that north area due to the high volumes that drive that fee lower. So we continue to see that. And then our Utica area, which is cost of services well continuing to expand compression there to support really great wet Utica results that you're also seeing show up in our UEO OVM volumes. So, no, we still see particularly those Northeast contracts as good strong pieces of our portfolio and also look to be good in Chesapeake's activity as well.
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC: Okay, great. Thanks a lot for that color. I guess, sticking on the Northeast and this is sort of a follow-up to Craig's question about the monster dry gas Utica wells we've seen recently. From a gathering perspective, can you address those types of wells or pads with the same type of infrastructure you've been using? Or is it a concentrated magnitude of production from those wells is going to alter how you have to service them and does that have any ramifications on either the type of return or the profile of return you might see gathering for such well?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would just say that certainly already having the right-of-way and the infrastructure in the area, as you know, in a lot of our OVM area, we have a loop system, so we have one line that we can dedicate to rich service and one line that we can dedicate to lean service. Having said that, the kind of size of some of these wells that are being hit are obviously going to require some massive expansion of those systems. And I will just tell you that having the right-of-way established and having the interconnect into multiple takeaway pipelines is going to be what is valuable. And that's exactly how we're positioning ourselves out there. But I would just – if you think about it, an existing pad up there is almost like – and sometimes I think it's even more so the case, it's almost like an offshore platform, because the real estate up there, getting a flat spot, and having a road into it, and having pipelines into it in that very difficult terrain up there is really a precious piece of real estate. And so that's where you'll see the development of a lot of that Utica drive, particularly in the northern part of West Virginia there. And so we have the pipelines into those locations and the right-of-way into those locations. And I think we'll be very successful in continuing to pick up those volumes as they come on there. But you're right, the existing infrastructure – to the degree that we get takeaway capacity established out of the area, and by that I mean long haul pipeline, long-haul interstate pipelines established in the area, the existing infrastructure would be overwhelmed if the producers started going after drilling plan in those areas, because there is so much productivity available from those areas. Obviously, though the productivity is going to have to stay in check with demand in the market.
Robert S. Purgason - Senior Vice President, Access Operating Area: Yeah. I think it's a great example of where Access legacy and The Williams fit together, right, because this initial wave of development is going to be used in existing plumbing, to the extent that we've got proximal pipelines and/or rights-of-way we can give near-term service. And then we can wait for this big takeaway opportunity which is going to create a whole new wave of large infrastructure investment to meet these big wells. So I think we're positioned well to capture that business and give near-term service to those who want to produce dry wells given their economics.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think one of the interesting elements of all this big Utica dry gas that may or may not be obvious at this point, is that it really is going to provide a lot of blending capacity into the gas pipelines. And so, if you think about this concern about the ethane recoveries and ethane takeaway, all of this big dry gas really provides a lot more capacity to put ethane into the long haul pipeline and still meet gas specs. And ultimately, what that means is it somewhat it helps solve the storage problem or ethane feed into some of the big crackers that are being developed there, because in effect, the gas pipelines become that storage element, and if there's a problem with the cracker, the ethane just goes into the gas stream, but still stays on spec. So that's actually one of the really interesting developments from our perspective coming out of this big Utica dry volumes that we're seeing show up.
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC: That's a great point, Alan. I guess my final question. You mentioned takeaway from the basin, and so I just wanted to follow-up with you quickly on Constitution. I think at the time of your Analyst Day, you were waiting or hopeful for a New York DEC permit in June. I know that didn't happen, but I'm just curious for an update on where the regulatory process for that project stands? I realize it's not a huge CapEx item for you in the greater context, but when we think about the effect on the basin takeaway, just curious for an update.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I'd just tell you we've been working very closely with the DEC and are excited and very optimistic about where we stand and would hope to see a permit very soon.
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC: Is there a point, at which – does it have a cascade? Is there a point at which it has a cascading effect on the timeline that you've put forth for in-service, or are we anywhere near that in your mind?
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think right now, we feel good about the date that we put out there for getting that finished by the end of 2016, and so, I think right now, we feel pretty confident in that and feel like we've got a good path to get that done. So there're certainly some tight windows that will be pushing through here and we hope in the very near future. But we remain confident as we see here today in that.
Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC: Great. I appreciate your time. Thanks again for taking my question.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: And that concludes the question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Alan Armstrong for any additional or closing remarks.
Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Well, thank you all very much for joining us today. Really tremendous amount of fee-based revenue growth that's coming on, excited to have the Geismar expansion behind us and having that up and running and really excited about the way the execution is going on these major projects that are out in front of us and we're just going to continue to march our fee-based revenue growth up 17% in the first quarter growth, 17% here in the second-quarter growth, and we're just going to continue to see a big march as these projects come on. So I appreciate your involvement in the company and we look forward to updating you on our shareholder value propositions as that becomes available. Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference. We appreciate everyone's participation today.

Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Williams and Williams Partners’ First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John Porter: Thank you, Joshua. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website, williams.com. These items include yesterday’s press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily. Our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to questions and we also have the five leaders of Williams’ operating areas with us: Walter Bennett leads the West; John Dearborn leads NGL and Petchem Services; Rory Miller leads Atlantic Gulf; Bob Purgason leads Access Midstream; and Jim Scheel leads Northeast G&P. In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Finally, I mentioned that we will webcast our annual Analyst Day on May 13, where we will provide an in-depth look at all of our businesses and our extensive backlog of in progress and potential projects. We hope you will join us for that session. So, with that, I will turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong: Great, thank you very much, John and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us and I will jump right in here on Slide 2 with snapshot of our first quarter results. The highlight for the quarter was the completing of our merger of the two MLPs to create the new Williams Partners. And with this milestone achieved, we have created a leading natural gas focused MLP that’s positioned to drive consistent long-term value for our investors. And this quarter’s results also show very strong underpinning of growth in our fee-based revenues that will drive our growth for many years to come. And in fact, all five of WPZ’s operating areas had fee-based revenue growth and four out of the five enjoyed double-digit percentage growth compared to first quarter of ‘14. And so the Northeast Gathering and Processing segment delivered an impressive 43% growth in fee-based revenues and that was even despite an outage on one of our – an ethane pipeline in the area and the Atlantic Gulf posted a very impressive 22% gain due to the first of many new projects coming online during the quarter and a continued build on the strength of that business and of course Access Midstream fee-based revenues continued their steady upward march going 11% over the prior year 1Q. We expect this growth in fee-based revenues to continue as we had major projects like our Keathley Canyon only start to contribute very late in the first quarter and big projects like the Rockaway Lateral and Leidy Southeast will provide substantial growth in 2Q and beyond. The weak spot for the quarter was NGL margins being off by $105 million versus the first quarter of ‘14 and our Geismar plant did not start consistently producing ethylene until late March. So, due to the strong growth in fee-based revenues and the strong contraction in commodity margins, actually 96% of our gross margin in the quarter came from fee-based revenues. Overall, our first quarter 2015 adjusted EBITDA was up 12% to $918 million and Williams received $515 million in distributions from Williams Partners, which is up from $455 million in the first quarter of last year. Overall coverage for WMB was at 1.14 times and this was after increasing our quarterly dividend per share up to $0.58, which was up from $0.40 last year. WPZ’s coverage was lower than we would have liked, but even with the major drop in NGL margins, if just the base, Geismar volumes at the actual sales prices during the quarter had been producing we would have fully covered our distribution in the quarter. So, again, that’s just the base Geismar volume, not the expanded and just at the actual prices so really shows, I think the strength that we are positioned for as we look forward to the Geismar volumes really starting to kick in here in the second quarter and then get to our full expanded growth volumes in June. I am also pleased that we are reaffirming our guidance today as it relates to WPZ distributions and WMB dividend. And for Williams, our guidance is $2.38 per share in 2015 with 10% to 15% annual dividend growth through 2017 and all that with growing coverage. And for Williams Partners, we are reaffirming our distribution guidance of $3.40 per share – per unit in 2015 with 7% to 11% annual LP unit distribution growth through 2017 also with growing coverage. So we are also reaffirming our EBITDA and dividend and distribution growth for both Williams and Williams Partners, but we do expect that 2015 to be near the low end of our ranges as we communicated in our 2014 year end conference call. And so this is really primarily due to three items here. One, the planning assumption that we have changed on the ethylene prices that we think now from a planning assumption, we have got that built in at closer to the first quarter actual prices of about $0.38 a pound for the balance of the year. And we think there will be some ups – we think there may be some upside of this, but we certainly want to be closer to current prices with our assumptions right now. Secondly, we have been informed by a couple of our Northeast producing customers that they will curtail Marcellus production as natural gas prices in the basin have been low and they will continue if they don’t see this improve. So we have seen some price related curtailment. We haven’t seen that fall into necessarily the drilling operations, but we have seen it in terms of just physical shut-in of production. And so this is going to dampen some of the expected growth from our Northeast volumes. However, we continue to feel very strong about the health – overall health of that business as demand for natural gas picks up and some of the extreme bottlenecks that exist in the Northeast started to be relieved. And then finally, we missed some revenues in the first quarter from Geismar and we are currently expecting to not get up to the full expanded plant rate until June. And, as you know, earlier we were expecting that to come on at the full expanded rate in April. So those are really the there items that are driving us down towards the lower end of our range for EBITDA and DCF. So with that, let’s move on to Slide 3. This list really shows some of the large scale assets that we are executing on. As you can see, it’s a long list and you will also see a tremendous amount of progress that occurred during the first quarter here. An important trend that you will see here is that a lot of these projects are really on the demand side of the business. And so the natural gas market as we have talked about, we think is going to continue to expand. It was first driven by low gas prices on the supply side and now we are seeing the demand side start to pick up. So whether in the near-term, with projects like the Rockaway Lateral, Mobile Bay South III and Leidy Southeast wherein the longer-term projects like Dalton Lateral and Virginia Southside II, the demand side of our network is really picking up and the request for proposals continue to come in for many market driven expansions. These projects, when we talk about for instance like the Dalton Lateral, they don’t just include the laterals into the new markets, these projects also provide shippers with firm on our mainlines back to the supply point. So we are expanding our mainline all the way back to the supply points as we build out those laterals both, because as you know the Transco system is fully subscribed. So, really nice investment opportunities as the market expands. We have also put some of the mainline portions of our Virginia Southside and Leidy Southeast projects in service early. And we have been very busy at the FERC filing certificate applications for projects like Atlantic Sunrise, Dalton Lateral, Virginia Southside II and Garden State project. We also are seeing the market into our NGL business coming to life with projects like Bayou Ethane in Texas Belle being placed into service this quarter as well. And on the supply – and during the first quarter we commissioned the Bucking Horse plant in the Niobrara area. And that will now be reported over in our West segment. We also commissioned the Keathley Canyon Connector project and we have reached an agreement to acquire up to 21% interest in the Utica East Ohio gathering system from Enervest. The Keathley Canyon Connector, just a little more of that, we did receive first production from Anadarko’s Lucius platform about midway through the quarter, but then in late March, we began receiving a very large volume of gas from Exxon's Hadrian field and so just a little more detail on that. The Lucius field, as you probably know is a deepwater oilfield and the Hadrian field is a gas field. And so really the power of that Keathley Canyon project because the Hadrian field didn’t get turned on until towards the end of March, we really didn’t enjoy a whole lot of Keathley Canyon Connector. But here in the second quarter that facility is really ramping up very nicely with some very strong volumes coming off of that as well as our Gulfstar project continues to build in production and volumes there as well. So as you can see, this list is fairly lengthy and it’s a testament to our great teams that are working very hard everyday to execute on this very aggressive and robust growth plan. And we are really starting to see a lot of these projects come to fruition and we are beginning to see the financial benefits, a lot of tremendous efforts by our – all of our project teams that are executing. And so with that, let’s move on to Slide 4. Just to close out here, first of all, the ACMP-WPZ merger, as we said really we think puts us in the position for the natural gas MLP with strong cash distribution growth and investment grade credit ratings. We do think it’s the MLP to be exposed to amongst the large caps if you like the prospects of overall market growth for both natural gas and natural gas derivatives. We would remain very focused and dedicated to our strategy on that side. And we really feel very good about where we are positioned on that. And additionally, I would say on the merger, we have also build some confidence in the synergies and the cost reduction opportunities as the combinations of our businesses has preceded. We continue to commission and bring on these large scale assets. And the first quarter is a great evidence of that, which you are going to see throughout the next several years continued strength of these big projects coming online and really driving strong growth in our cash flows. I will remind you about 88% of our WPZ gross margin is we expect to come from fee-based revenues. And as mentioned, a combination of the strong growth in the fee-based revenues in the first quarter along with some very weak commodity margins actually drove that up to 96% in the first quarter. So we probably will be below that number here in – sorry, we will probably be above that 88% number here in 2015 by a combination of very strong fee-based revenues and less dependence on these weaker commodity margins here in 2015. And in fact, in about $9.3 billion of our 2015 through 2017 in-guidance growth CapEx, 99% of this growth CapEx is focused on fee-based projects with nearly $30 billion of committed and potential growth capital through 2020. So our strategy remains very sound and the backlog of projects to serve the demand side of the growing natural gas markets continues to build and it’s also continuing to firm up. And we are very confident our plan is realistic and allows us to continue to provide solid shareholder return in whichever commodity price environment develops. All of this gives us great confidence that we will deliver high quality long lived cash flows from our competitively advantaged assets. And finally, I want to give you one last reminder about our Analyst Day being held on May 13. And as I said, you can find information related to this event on our website, as John pointed you to. And we really look forward to sharing with you our great future. And with that, we will open the line up for questions.
Operator: Thank you so much sir. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Shneur Gershuni with UBS.
Shneur Gershuni: Good morning, guys.
Alan Armstrong: Good morning.
Shneur Gershuni: I guess my first question is you sort of talk about a host of projects I think it’s about $9 billion worth of capital to be spent over the next couple of years. I was wondering if you can sort of talk about plans to finance these assets? Is there enough EBITDA coming in place in 2015 that your leverage ratios can support you investing mostly in debt or alternatively will you need to rely on the equity markets as well too?
Don Chappel: Good morning, Shneur. This is Don. I think the beauty of it is those projects come in fairly ratably during this period. So, I think you can look at it as a continuation of the kind of organic growth that we have seen over the last several years. And we have a lot of that built into our near-term plans for 2015 as it is. So, not to say that there couldn’t be some additions, but we think the capital additions would be relatively modest. It could require some additional debt and/or equity, but we think that will be pretty modest in 2015. Certainly, as you can see in our guidance, the capital falls off somewhat in ‘16 and ‘17 and that will be filled with some of these organic projects as they are contracted and/or sanctioned and we would expect a combination of debt and equity to finance those in the future.
Shneur Gershuni: Okay, great. And just a follow-up to some of your prepared remarks, you talked about the potential for drilled uncompleted wells in the Northeast, is this a scenario where we would see those volumes really manifest itself in the second half of this year after the summer smoothen gas prices that we typically see or is this something that could take longer to play out? And then, if you can also talk about what the impact would be on the legacy access assets as well too in terms of the fee of service rate structure that you have in place?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, sure. I will take that in the two parts there. First of all, just to clarify, what we actually are seeing is actual shut-in of existing flowing production. So – and my comment around the drilling operations was comprehensive to both the drilling and the completion. So, we are not seeing a lot of drilled wells not being completed, we are just seeing actual decisions to shut-in production because of extremely low netbacks in some of the constrained areas up in the far Northeast part of the Marcellus. On the second part of that question, ye, the areas that we see that we would obviously see that pickup to the degree that volume coming in lower we would see that affect the cost of service calculations for the future if those volumes didn’t flow. And we will by the way, Bob Purgason is going to be given a nice tutorial of that at the Analyst Day and going to provide some more detail at our May 13, Analyst Day around the way some of those contracts work in this environment.
Shneur Gershuni: Cool. And one last follow-up, I was wondering if you can just talk about the Canadian oil fields business for a minute, margins have been challenged and so forth kind of like what steps Williams is taking to try and improve that and so forth or is it really just going to be dependent on the macro environment?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, great question. I would say that first of all extremely low pricing in the quarter on propane up there. And so, we actually saw Edmonton propane a lot of you probably don’t follow Edmonton propane, because you just see the Belvieu and Conway postings, but Edmonton propane really actually got down to around a dime. So, it was quite a bit lower than the value of natural gas in the quarter. So, we did see some extremities up there in the Alberta markets in terms of seeing very low propane prices and that certainly did hamper and will continue to hamper. The long-term solution to that is great projects like our PDH project, which will provide great markets for those captive propane barrels up there. The propylene market remain actually pretty good and we are railing that out of there as part of our PDH project to the degree we go ahead with that, which we are excited about that project still and to the degree we go ahead with that, not only will that open up markets for the propane through the conversion to propylene, but also will provide a new market for the propylene there via the polypropylene unit that would be built downstream of our facility, but – and we wouldn’t own that, but it would be part of the overall complex. And so we are working to open up markets if you will for those stranded products and so that’s really the effort that we have growing about that. We also do have with that some structure contracts that will come, that will put some callers around the value of our products up there and help make that look more fee-based and take some of this extreme volatility that we have seen there.
Shneur Gershuni: Great. Thank you very much guys.
Alan Armstrong: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays.
Christine Cho: Good morning, everyone.
Alan Armstrong: Good morning.
Christine Cho: So, I just wanted to touch on this – the acquisition of the 21% equity interest in UEOM. And given it was immediately accretive, you guys still are or at least WMB is waiving $43 million of IDRs between now and ‘17. Is this because the JV is reinvesting in the cash flow back into the business or is there something else going on?
Don Chappel: Christine, this is Don. Good morning. Williams chose to waive the IDRs, because it’s a business that also has quite a bit of growth. So, the cash flows in the first year, first couple of years, are not nearly as robust as they are a few years out. So, that’s really what made it immediately accretive is really the willingness of Williams to support the acquisition, because we think it’s strategic one. And two, we think it will provide very attractive returns. Does that answer your question?
Christine Cho: I guess just a follow-up – actually, I will follow-up offline. Pricing for Geismar at least for the existing facility, I know that you have numerous contracts, but from what I understand at a high level, the reference pricing is Mont Belvieu, but I think you are actually selling it in Louisiana. So, are the contracts structured so that it’s Mont Belvieu plus some fixed number on top of that, maybe $0.02 or $0.03, because that’s what the customer would have to pay for transport if they were physically bringing it from Texas? And then it’s – some of the expansion capacity that will be exposed to the actual spot pricing in Louisiana, which is currently $0.10 to $0.15 higher than Belvieu. Is that kind of how I should be thinking about it?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Christine, actually those contracts are swaps back – a lot of those are swaps back to the Mont Belvieu market at Belvieu market. And so there are exchanges between parties that have product in the river versus – and parties that have demand at Belvieu. And so those are actually are setup as swaps. And so you shouldn’t build anything on top of that. The way the business is structured of course there is a number of different contracts and there is quite a bit of complicity to it, but the way you really should think about it is that we have customers that have a call on about 80% – up to about 80% of our production at Geismar. And sometimes they will take all of that, sometimes they won’t. If they don’t take all of that, then we have the 20% plus whatever they leave for us to sell into the – physically sell into the Geismar market on spot. And so that’s really how you should think about that. So, when we are operating at just the base rate, we won’t have any excess available to sell in to that market, unless somebody doesn’t call on that production for whatever reason, they might have a plant down or they maybe have a better price from somebody else and it might not call on that volume. And at that point, we would be free to sell it in to the highest value market wherever that is. So, I think that’s the right way to think about that.
Christine Cho: I see. That’s very helpful. And then what about the expansion capacity is that going to be the same way or that’s going to be actually exposed to spot pricing in Louisiana?
Alan Armstrong: Well, as you can think about a lot of the actual expansion, so – basis, we are running at about 70% of total expanded, which is very close to base rate. And so at the number I quoted at 80% is 80% of the full expanded rate. So at the base rate, we don’t have any excess provided that people call on their volumes.
Christine Cho: I see. Okay, that was very helpful. Thank you. And then I guess could you also talk about expectations for the ethylene market maybe near-term and medium-term, it sounds like worldwide supply demand is pretty tight for the year and maybe was short in the U.S. next year, but any insight into what you are seeing would be helpful?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I am going to ask John Dearborn to pick up on that, please.
John Dearborn: Yes. Thanks, Christine and thanks for the lead-in on the subject as well. So I guess from our perspective, we would be a bit bullish on ethylene as the year wears on, but we don’t want to set an unrealistic expectation. But if we take a look at steadily increasing oil prices, strong demand, strong margins in the derivatives, certainly here in North America, we will be filling some underutilized assets in the Louisiana market. And we came into the year with relatively low inventories and so all of that I think would blend credence to a positive outlook on the year. Of course, how the market performs would – is yet to be proven.
Christine Cho: Great, thanks so much.
Operator: And next, we will move on to Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.
Carl Kirst: Thank you. Good morning everybody. John, can we just kind of keep on the thread of the ethylene price for a second. And I guess I am trying to think of basically to Christine’s question, you are trying to reconcile thinking that we would maybe be on a gradual strengthening through the year versus it sounds like Alan what you said for planning purposes, we are kind of keeping it more flat at this $0.38 level. And so I guess I am just trying to better understand what may – what’s going to have to happen to kick the ethylene price back into the 4 years or where our midpoint of guidance is for ‘16 and ’17, is there a gating event we should be watching or is it something as simple as quite frankly, just global GDP here?
Alan Armstrong: Thanks for the follow-on question. No, I think there are a number of factors that could play into the prices moving up. I think this is a natural tightening of the market as these markets the uses of ethylene growing year upon year globally into the very large markets at somewhere above 2% a year, somewhere about 3% a year, I am sorry. These global markets grow every year. And its okay, that supply has been – and there is not a lot of high coming in the next year or so. And so you could imagine it’s going to be a continual thing you can just basically find on demand. Of course, we are going to un-restrict the market a little bit here but from Louisiana and Texas, that should be helpful to the Gulf Coast certainly to the Gulf Coast market. And I think the third factor that could play into this is with relatively low inventories coming into the year of ethylene. And we always predict rather high utilization rates on crackers. We have had a pretty good first quarter, but if there should be some mishaps in some crackers around the system in the Gulf Coast, of course that could provide a negative supply shock to the market, which would of course have an impact on prices. So I just think it’s a general growth in the ethylene building markets that’s going to continue to see us enjoy some positive pressure here. But I can’t ever predict as how quick it’s going to move. If we look at polyethylene today, polyethylene is selling somewhere around this $0.50 range. And so there is certainly plenty of margin in the changed matter of like a split between each of the products in the chain.
Carl Kirst: Okay, that’s very helpful. Thank you. Alan and I understand you guys are going to be doing a deep dive here quite shortly, but is there any additional color perhaps to share, say for instance on Appalachian Connector at this point whether it’s on a slow burn or I guess, is there anything incremental to add at this point?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, not a whole lot to add there at this point, Carl. I would just say the market is continuing to try to shape around that. And I would say it’s a mix between – on our project is a mix between producer push and market pull and trying to find the right balance of that. And obviously, one of our primary goals there is to make sure that we have the very best market outlets available for our upstream assets coming out of OVM. And so that’s an item that we have focused on pretty tightly and has I would just say, added some parameters and constraints to the project. And so that’s one of the things though that from our advantage point, we are very focused on and we are very serious when we talk about connecting best supplies to best markets. We are very serious about making sure we accomplish that. And so that’s really been one of the complicating factors on that. But we will have more to talk about at the Analyst Day on that.
Carl Kirst: Would it be fair if I think the last timing update is potentially late 2018 and the service if it all came together kind of working backwards, is it fair to say – well, to meet that date, you need to get commercial viability contracts by the end of 2015 as far as the potential target?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I would say given some of the difficult areas that includes Appalachian Trail crossing and some forest – right around some forest service, I would say that’s getting pretty late if it pushes back that far. So I think people are going to learn some lessons on that effort in terms of trying to get build through that difficult area.
Carl Kirst: Understood, I appreciate the color. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.
Chris Sighinolfi: Hey, Alan. How are you?
Alan Armstrong: Great. How are you doing?
Chris Sighinolfi: I am great. I just had a couple of questions. I am not sure if this is one for you or for Don, but I am just looking at the project sort of calendar, which slide that is, it looks like the CapEx on Atlantic Sunrise came down by a touch from the time you reported 4Q, it looks like about $200 million, just wondering what drove that?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, sure. Well, I would tell you that’s pretty exciting news. And I would say that the – if you think about all of the resources and the – whether it’s steel mills or skilled labor, if you think about all of the resources that we are supporting some massive drilling operations here in the U.S. and the fact that those are now slacking, we really are starting to see that come through even though it’s a different area of the business, we are really starting to see that come through in our sector of the business as well. And so that reduction was based on a number of things. One was a firm we now acquired, our pipe is purchased and we saw that come in dramatically lower than our expectation for the price with the price of steel coming down. And we also are seeing much softer prices on the contractor rates for construction practices as well. So the team is doing a great job of really looking for any and every opportunity on that. And so we had quite a bit of contingency built into that. And so we are just taking – one of those is just actual prices of steel coming in much lower than we expected and some of the rest of that is taking some of the contingency out that we had built in there.
Chris Sighinolfi: So, Alan is that something we are likely to see on some of the other projects you are advancing or is it just given where Atlantic Sunrise was in the development phase at the time of the price collapse that was sort of squarely manifested on that project. And then as the second question, I think you had talked about a seven times multiple anticipated on that project in particular, is that now likely to be improved versus that prior estimate or given your assessment as to what was sort of captured originally is it unchanged?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. No, you are right. That will come – that will fall right to our bottom line because that project was negotiated, great projects. So whatever capital we save comes to us on that. And on the first part of your question around will we see it, that kind of savings trends into other projects, I would say absolutely. We are seeing some pretty big relief on major equipment, on steel prices and importantly on the availability of engineering and skilled labor resources. And so we certainly will see that come through. I would say though that before we write that into our books, while that is subsiding, I would say the regulatory environment for projects continues to get more and more difficult. And so we have to leave some contingency in there for that. So, the actual cost of construction for these projects, I think is definitely – the answer to that is definitely that is coming down, but clearly like we have seen on projects like constitution, where the regulatory format is – and several people have say so over it and sometimes are mutually exclusive requirements. Those kinds of complications I think will continue to hit the industry, particularly in areas where there is heavy population centers like in the Northeast, where a lot of the growth is.
Chris Sighinolfi: Yes. No, I understood. I guess switching gears my second question would be in regards to the ACMP side of business, I think you guys have reiterated the CapEx plan there roughly 21% of the $9.3 billion, with the CHK CapEx reduction already sort of anticipated by you in that number or is there downside to perhaps how much CapEx to put in the ACMP side in conjunction with a slowdown over at Chesapeake?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Let me have Bob Purgason take that.
Bob Purgason: Yes. Chris, I think what you are seeing is the big build out on our systems has largely already occurred. So, even though we are seeing a slight kind of current decrease in capital in general, just you are not going to see something significant, because the infrastructure is built out.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay. So, in terms of the cost of service modeling that we had done historically on the ACMP, the major driver of that is simply how much you could deploy in any time period? I guess what I am getting after is do you have much in the way of sort of visibility on that side of it certainly as we move past 2015 or are we sort of just cautiously trading along and watching what the producer CapEx might shakeout to be?
Bob Purgason: Yes. Well, again I think we will talk some more. In fact, I have got some good examples of how the cost of service models respond to this environment coming up at the Analyst Day, but again remember, the bulk of that build out was in the early years that’s occurred. And we had planned always for the capital to tail off in the out years and then you have adjustment there for some contractual growth that happens as a result of that levelized rate. But again, it’s, I would say, on plan to what we have expected in terms of current performance.
Chris Sighinolfi: Okay, great. Well, thanks guys for the help there. I look forward to more color on the 13th.
Bob Purgason: Thank you.
Operator: And next, we will move on to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.
Craig Shere: Good morning, guys.
Alan Armstrong: Good morning, Craig.
Craig Shere: Don, to start with your answer to the equity issuance question didn’t exactly sound like what I thought I heard on the last call when maybe you might have described ‘16/17 base case budget following de minimis equity issuance. Are you perhaps more agnostic as you see how commodity pricing shakes out and how does the CapEx deflation pressure Alan just referred to reflect on those kinds of decisions?
Don Chappel: Craig thanks for the follow-up. Again I was commenting on again what I think we have a modest amount of equity required to execute the plans in our guidance. However, obviously, we have a lot of other projects on the burner here. And I was really commenting on the fact that some of those additional projects would require some additional financing. I think that was part of that question. And that additional financing would be a combination of equity and debt. And the real guiding – the guidelines there are really maintaining our credit metrics and credit ratings. So, that will really be the guide. In terms of the way we are thinking about UEO right now, we are always thinking of that as more of a 13% acquisition versus the 21%, because we do expect that our partner will step up and acquire the 8% that they have a right to acquire.
Craig Shere: I got it. So, the base plant hasn’t changed at all in terms of funding despite some of the first second quarter headwinds you all described?
Don Chappel: Yes, there is some I would call it modest changes obviously the UEO was certainly not part of the plan.
Craig Shere: Sure. And any further thoughts I am sure you will discuss it in a couple of weeks here, but around ACMP WPZ merger related commercial opportunities and CapEx savings over and above the $50 million cost synergies?
Alan Armstrong: Let me take that. I think the commercial opportunities continue to be very exciting, particularly in kind of the West Virginia and Southwest PA area. And so that’s very attractive. And as well I would say the combination of our joint venture opportunities between in the Utica are also presenting some nice opportunities and the combination of the liquid clearing outlets for that business are very attractive to us as well. So, I would say the opportunities have probably been maybe even a little better than we thought, because we have got Access with providing basically a greater reach and some great capabilities in terms of well connect and compression addition in the area that really allows us to kind of expand the reach for OVM. So, we have got several deals that we are working right now that are fairly substantial and really are just firmly as a result of having those two capabilities brought together. So, we remain very excited about that. On the CapEx – sorry on – further on synergies, a measure I like to look at is what percentage of our overhead or our G&A costs are hitting us as a percentage of our fee-based revenues and that has come down pretty dramatically here over the last – as we look in ‘14 in other words we take all of our G&A expenses compared to fee-based revenues in ‘14 and look at that into 2015. That’s come down pretty dramatically. And it’s hard to move that number very big, because it is such big numbers, but that’s a measure that I like to watch and that’s improving very nicely which tells me we are able to use the scale of our overhead to grow our business and bottom line improve our net margins. So, both of those things are very positive. And I would say as well on the CapEx side, we are in general expense side we are finding things where we are able to take the best contract offerings, where we buy chemicals or lube oil or things like that on a procurement side and our supply chain management side, we are finding some good synergies there in taking the very best prices amongst the two entities.
Craig Shere: Great. That’s helpful. And last question again I am sure we are going to hear some more, but is there anything more to speak on with regards to PDH and Geismar 2 opportunities?
Alan Armstrong: I would say that as I mentioned earlier the cost reductions that we are enjoying on the pipeline side were also seeing that on some of the heavy equipment side for project like PDH. And so as we are refining those estimates on PDH to come forward for our final investment decision on PDH, we have got a lot of positive tailwinds associated with lower cost on that. And we are hoping to be able to provide a little more detail about where we are on that at the Analyst Day Meeting in terms of the traction, but I would just say just generally the PDH project is moving ahead very nicely and we are more nearing having all the facts and figures in place to make a final investment decision on that. And then on Geismar 2, really strong interest in the project and I am pretty excited about the way that’s positioned with some pretty attractive partners and I think that one is moving at the pace we would expect and we are excited about that as well. So both of those projects I would say continue to gain momentum.
Craig Shere: Great, thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Brandon Blossman with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.
Brandon Blossman: Good morning, guys.
Alan Armstrong: Good morning.
Brandon Blossman: Alan, moving kind of to the longer dated end of your project backlog and thinking about what’s out there, including potential projects, it looks like quarter-over-quarter, one, you have rolled forward a year, but two, you have added $5 billion to that big picture outlook, is that just a function of rolling forward or is there quite a few incremental projects in that outlook?
Alan Armstrong: There are a few incremental projects in the outlook and I would say that we also – I am proud to say we are firming up some things as well as some projects in the kind of the medium-term that have – that we have added in there that just kind of came to us unexpectedly that have been added. So several of the market-type expansions for instance on Transco, but we have also got some sizable opportunities as the market continues to build out for the LNG. Transco, of course is extremely well positioned to serve many of the LNG projects. And so we have gone through some very successful open seasons and so that’s adding some projects. And as well, we have got some opportunities to with – into serving Mexico that are – have come on the radar screen as well. So overall, it’s a combination of new projects kind of in the medium-term that have been added in and are firming up very nicely and further out on the back end some of these new projects that has Transco serving markets in the southern end of its system.
Brandon Blossman: Okay, that’s helpful. And I guess fair to assume that we will hear more about that at Analyst Day or all those projects. Third question for you even bigger picture. Are we kind of firmly moving as it relates to Transco but gas transport in general, are we moving from a temporary supplier-driven project Q2 much more weighted towards demand things and demands in your project?
Don Chappel: We absolutely are and I am really excited to see that. I think all along, we have thought that this natural gas market growth would come – has been supply-led and obviously that’s put lower prices out, which is just further encouraged the confidence in the demand side just are taking advantage of that and we are really starting to see that come through on our systems on the natural gas side. But we also, I think we remain really excited about that as it relates to the natural gas, liquids and the Petchem space and positioning ourselves to be able to serve that growing market as well. So I would say the natural gas market expansion is upon us. And we are seeing that through all of these RFPs and all this growth in our system. And we would try to be ahead a little bit of the NGL Petchem build out. And we are very confident that with the expansion going on in that space, it’s going to take a lot more plumbing and storage to serve that growing market. As we positioned our self well for that and the Bayou Ethane project and Texas Belle are just kind of the front end of those opportunities for us.
Brandon Blossman: Okay, thank you. I appreciate it. I appreciate the color.
Don Chappel: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Eric Genco with Citi.
Eric Genco: Good morning. I was wondering is kind of piggybacking on some of these CapEx questions, is there some building conservatism to your maintenance CapEx guidance of $430 million, because the roughly $15 million this quarter seemed – is that really just seasonality or is there sort of a hint there that maybe that’s some built-in conservatism?
Don Chappel: No, I wouldn’t go put that in the bank. That is seasonality and we typically see that in the first quarter. We have got winter weather and we have got the crews tied up on meeting peak demands. We hit some extreme peaks on our system here in the first quarter and so that’s a really bad time to be to be maintenance on your pipelines. And so you will see those dollars increase here over the summer months. You will see as our work crews are out doing those – doing the maintenance on our pipelines, you will see that pick right back up.
Eric Genco: Okay. And then my second question, I was hoping you could expand a little bit on sort of the Canadian side of things, is the Canadian PDH facility all included in some of the CapEx guidance that you have given for the MB side of things?
Don Chappel: No, it is not included in guidance. It is in that potential pie, the $30 billion, but it is not in the $9.3 billion guidance.
Eric Genco: Okay. I am just trying to, I guess, get a sense of the different pieces of what’s there because I kind of look through the projects that are there, it looks like their horizon upgrader comes on 4Q ‘15, is that in parts of PV through 2015 [ph], Texas Belle build through 2015. There is - and then kind of looking at that relative to the CapEx guidance of $260 million for growth for 2015, $185 million for ‘16, what - I guess what are some of the $185 million in ‘16 and just to try to understand how the capital spend is going there, because it really if you look at and I understand that there are some commodity issues that work but given kind of the way it looks like some of those things are coming on, I just want to understand what I am missing because it looks like for an incremental $35 million of EBITDA over that period of time, but $445 million in over those 2 years, I am just trying to understand that and what’s missing?
Alan Armstrong: I am not sure exactly what you are looking at.
Don Chappel: For the segment capital guidance there.
Eric Genco: It's on Slide, maybe not 17, but probably close.
Alan Armstrong: And so your question is where is the profitability from all of that capital spending that…?
Eric Genco: Well, there is that and then maybe also just the timing of what is – what’s going on in ‘16 that requires $185 million, if Horizon comes along in 4Q ‘15 and the ethane pipe and then what Texas Belle in ‘15, where is sort of the – where is that going and what’s the incremental?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, great question. And as I mentioned on the previous response, we really are excited about being kind on the tip of the iceberg and building out the infrastructure for the Petchem expansion. And so a lot of that capital in ‘16 is focused on building out for what we think is a growing position on the Petchem side there. And so we are putting quite a bit of capital to work building out some of these legacy systems that we bought a couple of – 2 years or 3 years ago, we bought quite a bit of a latent pipeline down there from parties like Exxon and BP and Explore. And so this capital is putting a lot of those pipelines to work making interconnections, extending them, expanding them and pushing them into those markets. And so that’s what a lot of that capital was.
Eric Genco: Okay, thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Alan Armstrong: And you can see some of those projects on I believe its Slide 37, I believe it is, you can see some of the detail. And we will be providing some more detail in the Analyst Day on that.
Eric Genco: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And next, we will move on to Mark Reichman with Simmons & Company.
Mark Reichman: Good morning. Alan has alluded to some of the challenges in receiving permits, etcetera. And so just wanted to ask if you could just walk us through the process of bringing Constitution in service in the second half and what variables could lead to and in-service date at the front end versus the latter part of the year. And maybe expand your answer to talk a little bit about some of the regulatory challenges of some of these projects that are listed on Page 18 of the data book and your expectations with regard to how they apply to the expected in-service dates?
Alan Armstrong: Question, and then I am going to ask Rory to give you some more detail on the Constitution project and what’s going on. The projects that many of which are on Page 18 there, many of those projects are along our existing right of way. And so to agree they are along are existing right of way, much less public resistance and certainly that’s one of the huge advantages of Transco is that it’s already got right of way in the extremely heavily populated areas that are very difficult to establish any new routes and so most of those projects are expansion along that existing right of way. You can see that one big exception is that leg coming down on Atlantic Sunrise. But our team has really gotten ahead of that and it’s done a nice job of getting out and getting some of the tougher areas of right of way pin down on that one. And so I would say we are very fortunate to have the established right of ways that we have. And I would say Constitution is an example of one where we didn’t have existing right of ways. And I think as kind of foreshadows what the industry is up against in terms of getting new pipelines built in areas like this. And particularly, as you get further into New York and New England area, it gets more difficult as you get into those areas. And everybody wants lower priced energy, but nobody wants the pipeline in their backyard and that’s simply the issue that we are facing here. And we really need some political leadership to really establish an energy policy that would encourage and help the public understand the benefit of having these lower priced energy into their areas. On the Constitution piece, I am going to turn that over to Rory to talk about the detail to permitting them.
Mark Reichman: And just quickly is it challenged more at the state level, it’s more at the state level than the federal agencies, correct?
Alan Armstrong: It is certainly in general that is correct. In the case of Constitution it is almost squarely on the state there. But the challenge is when the feds have delegated their authority to the state and the state doesn’t see it as something they critically need. That’s the reason we have interstate commerce laws and so that one state can’t block another state from enjoying the benefits of infrastructure. And yet in some of these cases for whatever reason the feds have delegated some of their authority and that is where we run into some of these problems. Rory will take the permit, please thanks.
Rory Miller: Okay. That was a great runway to kind of where we are at from a regulatory standpoint to get this project in service. I think everybody is aware that sometime ago we got our FERC certificate for this project. But as Alan pointed out, some of the permitting had been delegated to the state of New York. We have most everything we need other than the New York DEC final permit on this project. We do have all of our land and right-of-way secured. We are what I would say – what I would call in the final pros of working through some final details on some wetlands issues and the New York DEC I feel like it really rolled up their sleeves and working with us very closely on trying to get the remaining questions answered. And we are very optimistic that we are going to be getting a permit here in the next couple of months. And I believe there is also Corp of Engineers permit that would follow that. But that’s more of a sequencing issue than an issue where we expect any type of dispute or anything like that. Once we get started and like I said we believe that will be in a couple of months and take about a year to construct, that’s not exactly right, but for planning purposes just figure a year or so. If we get the New York DEC permits than the permits from the Corp of Engineering which would follow say middle of the summer then we can be in service in the middle of the summer in 2016. If they come in later just kind of use that year timeline as how much we would move back in-service date. But I would say in general right now I feel better about this Constitution project and where we are at than I have in the last 2 years. Things have really been coming together. People have been very engaged at the agencies. They are trying to do their job. And I think because of the climate in New York, their standard is very high. But they are just going to make sure that they have all of their ducks in a row and I think we are very close to that point.
Mark Reichman: So if the DEC is taking public comments until May 14, then you think that they could file or grant the permit say in the June timeframe?
Rory Miller: I think that’s the case. This latest re-filing that we did with New York DEC was merely procedural. In fact the year prior we had done the exact same thing but we basically canceled and re-filed with all the existing information that we have been building up in the project. And in fact the New York DEC came out and said, they required to have this open comments period, but they said look, we have already commented, we got your comment, we are going to be using and considering all the previous comments that have been supplied. So the additional 14 day period would be for if there are any new comments that hadn’t already been covered by the previous comment period then those would come in. But I think all of that’s has been run down to ground pretty sufficiently and I don’t really see that as introducing any new risk into the timeline that we see before us now.
Mark Reichman: And not to flog it too much more, but – so this was for the water quality certificate application, so what about the air title permit related to the compression station upgrade?
Rory Miller: I think we have got all that. This water issue is the issue that’s really kind of the last has been push we need to get through.
Mark Reichman: Okay great. Thank you very much for the color.
Rory Miller: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. And next we will move to Brian Lasky with Morgan Stanley.
Brian Lasky: Good morning. Just curious on the shut-in volumes, can you just quantify the impact of that for the quarter or just the magnitude going forward?
Alan Armstrong: I am sorry could you repeat that?
Brian Lasky: The shut in volumes, yes, can you quantify that?
Alan Armstrong: Sure. One of the probably most obvious pieces on that as Cabot has made some announcements on that. And we expect that to be to between about $300 million and $500 million of shut in volumes over a number of that would grow and we think that’s probably for about five months or six months. So and most of that we think will just be here in the second quarter, during the shoulder months. And so they can make good money at very low prices up there. But when the systems are full up there and there is not enough market. They really get – the spot incremental sale gets extremely low and puts pressure on their other productions since they are such a large producer in the region they tend to put pressure against their own sales. And so we think this is short-lived but and maybe second and into the third quarter a little better, but that’s about it. So that’s the amount we expect.
Brian Lasky: Got it. And then just on your – I was wondering if you could just walk us through high level I am sure you will go through this more at the Analyst Day, but just high level how you guys are thinking about volumes across your gathering and processing in the West and Northeast kind of the balance of the year, if you could provide kind of a high level trajectory of how you are thinking about that?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Sure. I would say in the West volumes continue to remain pretty flat, pretty steady out there and the rate escalators that we have in our contracts over time have basically after gathering our fee-based gathering revenues extremely flat in the West despite some pretty light declines. And so I would – I think we would expect that to continue. I think the bigger question will come into the ’16, ’17 timeframes in terms of what kind of continued drilling might occur. The one area we are seeing some continued activity that our team has done a great job of capturing is in the San Juan Basin, particular with the Mancos play and the team has done a great job of continuing to capture that business. And of course the volumes in Bucking Horse will continue to grow and that plant just got really as we speak is really just getting lined out to build a ramp up to full throughput on that facility. So those are kind of the drivers that I think will keep us relatively flat. And we will just have to wait and see what holds for ‘16 and ‘17 depending on gas prices and how those move over time. In the Northeast, I would say continued very, very impressive production rates from wells particularly the Utica dry the wet really have kind of for somewhat – to some degree of kind of not built into our plan, but we are seeing more and more evidence that the combination of the Utica dry along with the Marcellus wet particularly around our OVM system is some pretty powerful combination of the economics for producers. And of course the other side of that coin is the great success that they are having is continuing to put pressure on the bottlenecks and constraints getting out of the area. And so, again I think we are excited about seeing all of this demand pool coming into the market on our Transco system because we know where there are some great supplies that can help feed that for years to come and continue to grow the market steadily. But I think we are going to continue to see pretty moderate drilling in the Marcellus and the Utica as forecast. We don’t see really big changes to that. And I think really the only surprise to this for the quarter was just the shut-ins due to lower prices was really the only surprise we have seen on the volume side.
Brian Lasky: Got it. So would you characterize what you are seeing thus far in the first quarter is pretty consistent with what you are planning in the guidance?
Alan Armstrong: Yes.
Brian Lasky: Absent the shut-ins? 
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Very close to it, staying right in line with our expectations.
Brian Lasky: And then maybe just one last question. You talked a little bit about the dry gas Utica, and then – and one of your competitors that are out there talking about potential opportunity there and I was just wondering if you guys could talk about the competitive dynamics for some of those opportunities that you are seeing right now with the increase in the number of MLPs up in the region and also in light of what’s going in the broader commodity environment?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. I would just say whoever has got the pipe in place and has the best market outlet is probably going to win that business up there. And we have positioned ourselves very well to get that accomplished. And anybody can always come in and buy business and so forth. But I think we are positioned to really make a nice return on our investment by just capturing the business that is – that we are well positioned to capture in the area. And so I think we will continue to do that. But clearly, one of the key issues up there is going to be a multitude of market outlets, not just any one market outlet, but multiple market outlets. And we are trying to make sure as we grow our system, we are really investing our efforts in making sure that we have got best market outlets for the gas up there. And so that’s involved a large team on both our marketing side, on the gathering end as well as our team from Transco and our Atlantic Gulf team really trying to make sure we are providing very best market outlets for the producers up there. And just like that, it’s always been a winner for Southwest, we think that will be a winner for us in the Northeast as well long-term.
Brian Lasky: And just one final one on Appalachian Connector there, do you have to negotiate directly with the park service there, is that how that one works and does that require enact of Congress, can you just maybe just walk through the regulatory process for that project in particular and kind of what you guys have baked into your timeline in terms of the regulatory schedule?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Maybe we will get into that level of detail a little more at the Analyst Day, I will just say we worked pretty hard to stay away from areas that would require that kind of protracted permitting requirements in the area. But it’s an area that requires some pretty careful orchestration to step through. And we will provide some more detail on that – on the Appalachian Connector at the May analyst meeting.
Brian Lasky: Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much.
Alan Armstrong: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Abhi Rajendran from Credit Suisse.
Abhi Rajendran: Hi guys, good morning.
Alan Armstrong: Good morning.
Abhi Rajendran: Couple of quick questions, now that the commodity backdrop has stabilized a little bit do you have any update on the drop down of the remaining NGL Petchem projects at WMB level, I know last update you guys gave was that was going to get pushed out maybe later in the year, but any update or color there will be helpful?
Don Chappel: Abhi, this is Don. Really, no update at this point, we can talk more about it at the Analyst Day. But there is no urgent need to do it. And certainly, we feel better about it when equities are trading better. So that’s kind of where we stand.
Abhi Rajendran: Okay, got it. And then last quick one for me. Looking ahead to Analyst Day, are you guys thinking about sort of reintroducing the segment level guidance which you had last year would kind of help give some color by segment what’s going on to volumes and margins and whatnot?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Abhi, I would just say we haven’t confirmed that yet and so just stay tuned for Analyst Day.
Abhi Rajendran: Okay, got it. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. And next, we will move on to Timm Schneider with Evercore.
Timm Schneider: Hey, good morning guys. Most of my questions have been answered, so I have a macro question for you guys. How do you see the Northeast NGL scenario kind of play out, right, so one of your peers is saying they are going to be running at 90% utilization just firing NGLs into the base and you are getting into the shoulder season where it’s another real propane demand basically lack of storage, how do you think about realizations up in the Northeast and getting those NGLs to a home where they are actually needed?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, great question, Timm. And as you know we have been concerned about this since the Bluegrass days and we remain very concerned about the clearing of liquids out of the area. And I think unfortunately, the answer is they are going to get cleared out there by rail. And just as evidenced, what’s going on in that space, our Conway rail facility for the first time that I can ever remember is even though we have dramatically expanded our rail position – our rail rack position there at Conway, our inbound which I don’t ever remember this occurring, our inbound capacity on rail is fully contracted for the summer months. And so I think that tells you kind of what’s going on, which is all those products getting put on rail and it is going to any home again for storage and Conway is an attractive place for that. And of course Conway then has great access into the Bellevue markets when it’s needed there as well. So I think that’s what we are going to see, I think already seeing it. And I think the wholesale marketers of the NGLs have realized that’s one of the few places that you can clear those liquids and then sell them into the market as the market demands them. So I think that’s what we are going to continue to see more of the beneficiary that there with Conway. And if anything, we are probably guilty of under-pricing that service given how strong the demand has been there.
Timm Schneider: That’s interesting. Can you tell us how much of it is to rail from the Easter Conway?
Alan Armstrong: No, I don’t have the detail on exactly what that rate is.
Timm Schneider: Got it. And in terms of building additional storage in the Northeast, specifically I realize it’s all above ground storage because it’s simply reservoirs and that doesn’t really work for NGLs, do you have any sense of how much more it is to build storage in the Northeast than in the Gulf Coast?
Alan Armstrong: Well, I would – if you don't have a salt formation, you really don’t have a very attractive place or a few projects that we have been looking at through the Access team and looking at some areas to try to develop that, but I would just say it is the scale of opportunity is very limited for storage because you don’t have the big salt lands like you do in either the Conway area or the Gulf Coast area salt land has provided the opportunity for storage. Without that, it's very difficult – and frankly that’s one of the reasons that the Gulf Coast Petchem space is continuing to be prolific for year after year after year as one it has access in ports, but also it’s got the great advantage of salt dome storage for both the raw – feedstocks as well as the finished product. And that’s in the Olefin’s basins. So those are the big advantages. And frankly, I don’t see that changing anytime soon. So, very expensive to build any kind of storage capability in the Northeast, because mostly it’s going to be above ground storage capabilities.
Timm Schneider: It sounds like your view that Northeast in fact does need another export solution over call it the next 2 year or 3 years?
Alan Armstrong: Yes.
Timm Schneider: Okay, thank you.
Alan Armstrong: Thanks, Timm.
Operator: Thank you. And next we will move on to Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
Jeremy Tonet: Good morning. Thanks for all the color this morning, it’s been very helpful. I just wanted to touch base – here has been some chatter in the marketplace for the potential of a family level consolidation to improve the family’s cost of capital. Our impression has been that there is not really any rush or need to do that, do something like this right of way that we can give the post-ACMP structure a chance to prove itself and earn a re-rating from the market. I was just wondering if you can provide any thoughts on Williams cost of capital and any other updates or thoughts on family level consolidation if that makes sense?
Don Chappel: Jeremy, this is Don. I think we have discussed that periodically in the past in terms of pros and cons. And we do believe that WPZ is positioned to improve its cost of capital. So you know we don’t have that here today and we can certainly talk more about that during Analyst Day.
Jeremy Tonet: Okay, fair enough. Thanks.
Don Chappel: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays. Ms. Cho, please check your mute function.
Christine Cho: Sorry. I just had two very quick follow-ups. The 80% swap at Geismar to Bellevue when does that roll off, if at all?
Alan Armstrong: You know there is a multitude of contracts there Christine and so none of them – they don’t all start in, but typically they are not real long-term contracts that are established in that market. But there is a variety of terms on those contracts.
Christine Cho: And then with the maintenance CapEx, I know you kind of addressed the regulated maintenance CapEx, but what about for the well connects, I mean if we are seeing a slowdown in drilling and completion could there be – could that number have come in lighter than you expected?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, slightly. But as Bob pointed out we have got a lot of catching up to do still. We are still working off of quite an inventory of getting caught up. So even if the drilling does slowdown we still – the well connects will still keep coming for quite some time.
Christine Cho: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ross Payne with Wells Fargo.
Ross Payne: How are you doing guys?
Alan Armstrong: Great, how are you?
Ross Payne: Good. I was wondering if you can give us a little more detail on the Geismar startup kind of getting pushed back into June, are there other issues outside of the heat exchangers that you talked about in Q4 and has anything really changed from Q4 to where we stand today in terms of trying to get it up fully to specs? Thanks.
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Thank you and appreciate the question. It allows us to spend a little bit, because we really haven’t hit that much today. And a couple of things I really want to point out there, one is that we did have the major equipment for the expansion up and running. And so and in fact as we sit here today we are utilizing many of the components of the expansion facility. So contrary to what probably you would be left to believe, it’s not like we have just got the base plant sitting over here running and the expanded plant is sitting idle. We are utilizing in this period a lot of the big elements like the furnaces for instance on the expanded facility. And in fact we had the major equipment up and rolling when we had this transformer fail on us. And so I think that’s very good news because we been able to test all of the major components. And in fact we are using this time period to put load test on the expansion parts of the facility. But at the end of the day this EBR system is what is bottlenecking if you will the production on the plant, on the ethylene side of the plant. And until we get that transformer back in then we can’t go on with the rest of the plant. So the good news is we are not sitting here wondering about the rest of the major equipment in the expanded plant. We have actually been able to utilize it and get it up and tested. And so really this is – I hate to – there is nothing simple in a big complex plant like this, but to try to put in simple terms, we have got the plant – the expanded plant has been up and tested. And it’s a matter of getting this transformer repaired at the manufacturer’s facility and getting it plugged back in. And we did run that compressor that this transformer drives and everything was fine with that compressor. And so it’s just a matter of getting the transformer plugged back in.
Ross Payne: Okay. And in the last conference call you guys talk about the heat exchangers getting up to about 70%. Are you comfortable now that they can get all of the way up to 90% plus or are there other things that you need to do on that front? Thanks.
Alan Armstrong: Again we have kind of had the luxury, unfortunately we have had the luxury of time in getting some of those things that lined up. And we have gotten – we had some fouling and some residue oil coating on some of those highly efficient exchangers and we have gotten those cleaned up and they are performing very well now.
Ross Payne: Okay. Thanks guys.
Alan Armstrong: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you and that will conclude today’s question-and-answer session. At this time I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Alan Armstrong for closing remarks.
Alan Armstrong: Great. Well thank you all very much. Appreciate all the great questions. And we certainly are excited about bringing all of these projects and we really look forward to talking to you in more depth here on May 14. Thank you for joining us.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today’s conference. We appreciate your participation.

Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Williams Partners LP Year-End Earnings 2014 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John Porter: Thank you, Tanisha. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams, and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website www.williams.com. These items include yesterday's press releases and related investor materials including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong will speak to you momentarily. Our CFO, Don Chappel is available to respond to questions and we also have the five leaders of Williams operating areas with us. Walter Bennett leads the West; John Dearborn leads NGL & Petchem services; Rory Miller leads our Atlantic Gulf; Bob Purgason leads Access Midstream, and Jim Scheel leads Northeast Gathering & Processing. In our presentation materials you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we’ve reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials. With that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong: Great, thank you very much John, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us here for our Q4 and full year 2014 earnings call today. To begin with, I'd like to welcome a couple of new members of our leadership team and they are joining us today as John just mentioned by phone. First is Bob Purgason, who became Senior Vice President of our Access operating area in January, and just to remind you, Bob has been COO at Access since 2010 and before that he was here at Williams for about 19 years until 2006. So, the organization here at Williams is very excited to have Bob back and really looking forward to a lot of the leadership he is brining. Additionally, Walter Bennett is here with us, and Walter previously led the Western operations for Access, and in January he began leading Williams' Western operations post Allison Bridges' retirement. And of course that includes our Northwest pipeline area and all of our big gathering and processing out in the Rockies as well as we've added to that now the Niobrara area in Wyoming that ACMP had this built, and our team, the Williams team had collaborated to help bring that business up as well. So, we're really excited to have Walter's very strong operating background and strong technical expertise brought to our team out there in the west. Additionally, I would just tell you, there are a lot of great leaders that have come in from ACMP, and they really are contributing a lot to our organization and help us lead through this tremendous growth period that we've got going on here at Williams. So, really nice to see the teams come in together so nicely and so quickly. Moving on here to slide 2, and you'll see a lot of the major topics listed here on this slide that will hit on this short presentation, but this is the place I'd like to spend a little more time discussing the drivers of our new guidance and really the significant derisking that has occurred as we have dramatically lowered our planned commodity margins. We've lowered our fee-based volume assumptions, and we've got more conservative on our Geismar ramp-up schedule. So, here first on the commodity price deck, our new price deck is centered on a $55 WTI and $3 Henry Hub gas price, and we've tried to be conservative with the price decks that are largely below the forward curves for products like propane and natural gasoline, where we're along the commodity and below the forward curve where we are short like our natural gas and ethane. We believe this is certainly one of the most conservative decks being used amongst our peers in the industry, and overall this resulted in a 44% reduction in our planned commodity margins and commodity positions at WPZ, and this now represent only about -- this commodity price only about 12% of our gross margin is now exposed directly to the commodities. On the gathering volume side, we've assumed reduced activity on the assets with unprotected volume exposure. So, in those areas, we're directly exposed to volumes and in many case we're ahead of what the producers have publicly communicated to investors. In other words, we're trying to get ahead of the lowering of rig counts and making sure that we've got a good handle on what we expect, and in many cases where that hasn’t been publicly tried to get ahead of that with our own estimations. And fortunately though, I would tell you these impacts are only limited to a handful of our assets, and in the context of the new larger enterprise, the impacts we think are certainly manageable. So for example, our Northeast volumes are currently tracking ahead of our revised plan for 2015. On the Geismar ramp schedule, we have incorporated a much lower utilization of the facility over the first three months of the year, and this is going to allow for safe controlled ramp-up to full production. We’ve spent a considerable amount of time doing it safely and ensuring a very high quality asset, and we certainly don't want to try to make any shortcuts here at the last minute on that. So, very proud of the team there continuing to be very focused on safe and making sure when we do get up to full capacity that we've got a safe and durable asset there. A couple of offsets to the impacts of these more conservative assumptions do exist in our plan. First of all, the early in service for Transco projects on the mainline portion of the Leidy Southeast expansion and the Virginia Southside expansion, and I'll hit on more of this in just a little bit, so I won't spend any time there. And then finally, on the next, on the cost cuts, we do have some offset to some of the negative variances as we’ve stepped up our focus on really rightsizing our cost structure to match the reduced levels of activities in few of the regions. And so, while we've not specifically called out that number, I would emphasize that this can and will be a moving target depending on the ultimate levels of activity, and the production around our assets. But we certainly see an opportunity to offset some slower growth, and take advantage of the lower energy prices and materials in our own business because we certainly are exposed to energy and materials in our own business and a lot of those prices have come down. So in general, we're taking advantage of this low commodity market to position ourselves for a very strong consistent performance. And with many of the potential upsides that have been taken out of our guidance now, we still see a lot of those upsides out there, but we pulled a lot of that out of our guidance, and so as those occur, they will result in upsides to our guidance. But despite the significant derisking, WPZ still has one of the highest distribution growths amongst our peers, and this is driven now by approximately $4.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2015 which is further driven by fee-based revenues which make up about 88% of our gross margin. And then, we expect our EBITDA to continue to grow to about $6 billion on the backs of over $9 billion of fee based projects as we look forward to 2017. Moving on to slide 3, we can see here the key drivers of the fourth quarter and the comparisons to the fourth quarter of '13 along some of the mixed results that generated headwinds for us in the fourth quarter. So, this was certainly another very busy quarter for us as we undertook the commissioning of three very large assets. These assets are now ramping up to our expectations here in the first quarter and will be big contributors to our growth for the balance of 2015 and beyond. So, first now to hit on the WMB highlight, WMB received $515 million of distributions up from WPZ and ACMP and this was a 16% increase up $70 million. The higher distribution was supported by 30% increase in the fourth quarter adjusted segment profit in DD&A which was up $216 million to now $944 million there in the fourth quarter. So this large increase was certainly driven by the additional ACMP interest that we acquired in the third quarter of '14 and as well the associated consolidation of those interests. WPZ had mixed results for the quarter. We had some real positives and some real challenges as well. Ongoing mature businesses continued to perform as expected; however, we did have some delays and higher expenses in bringing on Geismar and along with lower commodity prices caused the quarter to come in lower than we had planned. So, now looking into each segment, the Atlantic-Gulf, strong underlying performance in Transco in the Western Gulf, but this was offset by some producer startups on the Keathley Canyon and Gulfstar facilities. These projects are now online and ramping up nicely here in the first quarter and really pleased to be serving our customers out there both the Anadarko's Lucius facility and the Hess' operated Tubular Bells facility up there. On the NGL & Petchem side, Geismar being offline versus an expected mid fourth quarter startup plus some LCM inventory adjustments that marks most of the products that we have for linepack and operating inventories back to a much lower market and so this is nothing new in terms of how we account for our inventories, but the sever downward move in NGLs caused a much larger than normal swing in this inventory valuation. We also saw some high expenses for the quarter associated with commissioning and repairs through our Geismar facility. In the Northeast we continue to ride the wave of strong growth in the Marcellus volumes with a 26% increase on a quarter-to-quarter basis and 28% increase in a full-year '13 to '14 comparison. However we did not hit our expected numbers in OVM due to a delay in bringing on some of the major well pads that producers were bringing on right at the end of the year, but we do continue and enjoy tremendous growth in this area and our current production levels in the Northeast segment as I mentioned earlier are ahead of a more conservative plan now for 2015. Southwest, the West really performed largely in line with what we've expected with the exception of the commodity prices which certainly clipped our NGL margins in the area. And this area has really held up fairly well despite of lack of drilling and as always our Northwest pipeline asset remained quite steady and in 2015 our plan has less than 15% of the company's gross margin in the west coming from commodity exposed contract. So, in the past as you know the west has always been an area of big commodity exposure to us and to some of our big processing facilities out there and because of the continued growth in our fee based business as well as the large decline in NGL margins now only have about a percent of that gross margin, actually a little less than that out West. So, lot less volatility as we go into 2015 at West. So overall, a noisy quarter for WTZ given several one-time and discrete events, but our underlying fundamentals are very strong they give us complements in our 2015 plan and certainly now on the ACMP side, ACMP produced another very impressive quarter. Fee based revenues were up 48% to $593 million and this was driven by a lot of new capital investments that delivered record gross gathering volumes of 6.5 Bcf a day, so tremendous accomplishment by the ACMP team there in the fourth quarter as well. Moving on to slide 4, talk about some of the milestones and the recent accomplishments here, that certainly give us a lot of confidence in our plan going forward. First of all as I mentioned Gulfstar won the typical startup issues I would tell you for the producers bringing on a lot of new big wells on to that platform, but it is looking like some ultimate upside to our original expected flow rates from the facility and so we're really pleased to see the way that's going and very excited about that investment. On the Transco side, another winner and another big increase in peak volumes on the nation's largest and fastest growing pipeline. With this year's peak a day here in January beating last year's record by 8% despite a very, very cold winter in January 2014. So, really just a lot of continued growth is driving that on the Transco system and that team continues to do a great job keeping up with all that growth. ACMP as I mentioned also hit another record volumes and this really a major contributor to this was the gathering volumes in the Utica and those fed into the 49% UEO processing JV there in Eastern Ohio and the latest train to come on line was the new Leesville plant. So, continued great exposure there to the growth in the Utica and really excited to see the way those volumes continue to perform. More recently, the big addition to our discovery partnership, the Keathley Canyon connector received first production from Anadarko at their Lucius platform and now as we move into March we expect to begin receiving much larger gas volumes from Hadrian field and so again, another huge accomplishment brining on that major facility out in over 7000 feet of water. Our Geismar restart has certainly been long awaited and we're excited to be where we are on that finally and it is, we are in the process of getting that lined out and we expect to continue to ramp up here in the end of February and our plan does really expect consistent full rate production until the very end of march and so we've derisked that as well and we currently are working to improve the ultimate efficiency of several of the heat exchanger systems before we can reach back for full production. But all the systems in the base plant have been activated and we've been able to fund that up to about 70% of load there on the base plant. So, we're very confident and where we are today on that it's really just a matter of getting those exchangers being able to operate up to their peak efficiencies. Our combined access and Williams operating teams came together on the new Bucking Horse plant in Wyoming right during the dead of winter and so, while we don’t expect this plant to generate a significant amount of cash flow, here in the near future, it was very important for our teams to get this plant online for the benefit of our new largest customer Chesapeake and it also demonstrated the clear benefits of integration between both Access and Williams personnel into one new organization out there. So hats off to that team that worked through the pretty touch winter up there to get that plant started up. Many of our recent expansions have involved along with other facilities modifications to the Transco mainline and so, this allows us to facilitate moving gas from the Marcellus and the Utica from the North to the South. And so, with two kind of projects in common here on this was first Virginia Southside which started up in December '14, the mainline portion did, not yet the lateral but the mainline portion started up much earlier than expected and that full facility of the lateral will come on in the third quarter of 2015. And then the same story on Leidy Southeast which in March of this year will bring on the mainline portion of the Leidy Southeast project and that also beats our expectations for that project as well. And together these projects will yield $50 million to $75 million of incremental operating profit in 2015. These are all fully contract and that's been approved by the FERC. So we are ready to put these into service and of course bringing on all this incremental operating profit wasn’t expected originally in those investments really gives a very nice boost to our original expected returns for those projects. And then finally, our Rockaway Beach lateral is expected to start up in either late March or early April and the team has been working hard to hold the schedule despite as a lot of you all know a very wet and cold weather there in the New York area. But really excited to finally bring that project to closure and being able to serve our big customer of their national grid. Moving on to slide 5, this slide really just provides a real quick snapshot of the different types of cash flow that make up our $6 billion of gross margin. And just to make a few points here, first it shows that now only 3% of WPZ's risk remains tied to the NGL margin commodities and the spread on NGLs and only 9% is tied to our olefins margin in both our Geismar and Canadian facilities. So, meaning 88% of our cash flows are now from fee based revenues here in 2015 and including nearly two-thirds of those that are under contract that have demand payments, cost of service with minimum volume commitment. So as we can see on the next slide our future growth is even less dependent on commodities as we move to slide 6 here, and this really shows that 99% of our $9.3 billion of growth capital that's in guidance are tied to fee based projects. So this slide really gets to the heart of our lower risk and growth strategy for the next few years. And as you can see the vast majority of this is tied to, even the fee based projects the vast majority is tied to the kind of business that are either on our gas pipeline system or in the ACMP area where we have a lot of protection from volume risk. And so lot of confidence and certainty from our perspective about how we go forward. So, while certainly commodity prices are and remain important to our business specifically here for the near term cash flows and coverage they really are not the driver of our growth. Our business strategy is built around natural gas volume growth and the demand for associated large scale infrastructure that are going to be required to build out as the natural gas and natural gas products markets continue to build on the back of a very low priced commodity. And as a result we're confident in our ability to deliver one of the highest rates of distribution growth amongst our large cap peers, despite the lower expected commodity prices that are not built into our plan. Moving on to slide on to slide 7, this slide just drills down into the known projects over this longer period. And so, I'm not going to go through each of these facilities, but one of things that I think we have not spoken very much about but is pretty impressive is the amount of exposure that we have to the LNG export facilities and in fact the Transco has connections that allow it to receive or deliver gas. But nearly every LNG import/export facility in the Gulf Coast and the eastern seaboard other than the Everett facility in Boston. Those LNG facilities include Cheniere's Sabine Pass, Exxon's Golden Pass, trunk lines like trialed [ph] Sempra's Cameron LNG, the Elba Island LNG and the Toe Point LNG [ph]. And as you know, we've talked in the past about our access to our Gulf Trace Project being a 1.2 Bcf a day commitment to Cheniere's Sabine Pass facility that's fully contracted and will start up in early 2017. But we also recently concluded an open season in December of '14 for the Gulf market expansion and this is designed to provide an additional 1.4 Bcf a day of firm transportation from station 65 going back to the West to points on the mainline in Louisiana and Texas and great progress there and we're in the process of negotiating the firm commitments from our shippers and that came out of the open season and it is anticipated that this could possible 1.4 Bcf a day of capacity could be in service as early as late 2018, so just continued tremendous growth on the Transco system, both on the market side and supply side. Moving to slide 8 here for the conclusion, certainly we're very pleased to have the PZ/ACMP merger closed and remain more excited than ever really, we continue to see tremendous benefits from the combined strength of this new MLP and we think it is the MLP to be exposed to amongst the large caps if you like the prospects of overall market growth of both natural gas and natural gas derivatives because clearly our strategy is very tightly focused on this opportunity. As we look to the PZ distribution growth, all of the issues I've gone through the day really drive to this and the revised outlook for PZ and WMB result in a new guidance of 7% to 11% annual distribution growth at WPZ through the '17 period with the midpoint of 9% and this really reflects the strength and the quality of our underlying assets with a growing coverage ratio of greater than 1.05 once we get through this first quarter and '15 ramp up period. So, not only do we think we have good growth there, but we are continuing to build coverage through period and so we're really excited that despite these much lower and a very relevant to our peers at very conservative price that we continue to be even at the lower growth rate at the low end commodity prices we're still at the high end of our large cap MLP peers. And so, even though this is slightly below the plan that we articulated at the time of the ACMP and WPZ merger, these level of growth in cash and coverage are indicative of the best-in-class large cap MLP. As we look at the WMB dividend growth we have also slightly slowed down our targeted levels of growth for WMB and this of course is driven by the lower price environment that we've forecast with a range now of 10% to 15% growth largely to match the underlying growth of cash flows coming up from the MLP. So just to highlight the stability of this business plan even under the low price commodity case we can grow WPZ at the 7% we talked about and continue to move over 1.0 coverage there at the low price and at WMB at 10% with additional layers of coverage index of 1.0 at WMB as well. So, we really like our position now with the distribution and coverage and we certainly like the underlying fundamentals that underpin that. So, overall we're very confident in this business plan. We think it's realistic. We think it allows us to continue to provide tremendous total shareholder return whichever commodity price environment develops as we go forward and in fact across all scenarios we have the best-in-class growth at WPZ and a top-tier growth at WMB with growieng levels of coverage across both entities. So, this continually building list of investment opportunities are very tightly aligned with our strategy. They give us great confidence in our future and continue to give us a very high quality long lived cash flows that we think are some of the highest quality in the industry and this is coming from our continually, very competitively advantaged assets. And so with that, I thank you for joining us and we'll turn it over for questions that you might have. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Carl Kirst: Thank you. Good morning everybody. I'll start maybe with the growth projects, and I'm just curious in the current market as you look to Canada, one of the things we were looking at was the PDH facility, I didn’t know if you'll be at the weaker Canadian dollar and perhaps some of the activity coming out of that area might be tempering down the investment costs, and perhaps you know, keeping that potential growth project still in advanced stages, as well as in third quarter, you guys were certainly opening up the possibility of Appalachian Connector, I didn’t know if we could get an update on that as well?
Alan Armstrong: Yes sure. First on PDH, you are correct Carl, the fundamentals are actually improving there as we are seeing some, the signs of lower-cost coming in for equipment and vendors as we go out and are in the process of really tightening up our estimates on that. And additionally, that project is really built around the benefits of the logistics of taking low-cost propane right there in Canada and converting it eventually into polypropylene by our partner and being able to serve markets.  So, we're basically just cutting down on a lot of rail logistics, and those things continue to improve. Propane prices continue to be a huge spread to Mont Belvieu, propane prices up there and we think that's going to continue for some time because there's not really any logistical answers coming out that will improve that any time soon. And so, we really like how that continues to unfold as well. And really just a matter at this point of getting contracts finalized with our downstream partner there that pulls a lot of that risk off of our shoulders from a commodity spread standpoint, but we really do like the fundamentals and they are certainly improving for that project. On the Appalachian Connector project, we are certainly still excited. We think the strengths of our market pool and the demand of our market, they are along the mainline is a real positive for us. There has, as you know, there's been some turnover in some of the properties upstream, and certainly with the lower gas prices, people are looking for creative solutions out of that area, and so we're certainly working with a lot of those customers both on the market side and the upstream side to try to bring those two together in a way that they can firmly support our project. And so, we're feeling pretty good about that, but it is -- certainly everybody is kind of, anybody in the energy industry right now is reeling a little bit in trying to get their forward-looking perspectives tend down before they make any major commitments, and so obviously that's where we stand on that today.
Carl Kirst: Do you get a sense, and that's kind of where I was going to, do you get a sense that even as these continue to percolate, they've both been pushed back to the back half of the year if they do come together or how would you think about timing?
Alan Armstrong: Well, I would say on the PDH project, it really is just we're going to be very, very careful. That's a big investment for us. We want to make absolutely certain that we've been, that we know exactly what our numbers, we get as many bids and estimates, solid estimates that are well engineered in the door, so the PDH project is more, just of us moving along at a pace that is focused on making sure we can execute on the project effectively rather than being in a rush on it. And so, that one is more driven by our own efforts and getting the contracts finalized than it is anything in the broader macro industry at this point. On the Appalachian Connector piece, I think that answers have got to come a little quicker on that, and so I think we'll be pressing in the next quarter to decide one way or the other on where we go with that, but in any way, shape, or form, I think we're going to position ourselves to benefit both our assets in the area, both our wholly-owned and some of our equity investments in making sure that we get good market attachment to those assets and as well making sure that we get the investments that are due to us for the downstream mainline expansions for that gas as well. So pretty excited about it, but we're not going to push a rope on that. We've got plenty of great investment opportunities, and we're not going to step up and take risk on that.
Carl Kirst: Yeah, I appreciate that. One final one just for Don, just very quickly, I appreciate the WPZ equity as far as obviously retaining investment grade. Don, do you have any planned equity issuances in '16 and '17 at PZ in the kind of base case budget?
Don Chappel: Good morning Carl. The PZ equity issuances in '16, '17 at this point is de minimus. So, it gives us capacity to really take on some additional opportunities since we see exciting opportunities develop.
Carl Kirst: Thank you, guys.
Don Chappel: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Ted Durbin: Thanks. First one for me is just on the balance of distribution growth, dividend growth coverage keeping PZ flat here it looks like in 2015, I guess how are you thinking about the right level there, especially given that you have a much higher mix of fee based cash flow?
Don Chappel: Ted, this is Don, I'll just note that we felt we want to go in with a fairly conservative plan here in light of what happened in the marketplace. So rather than continue to boost the dividend or distribution during the year we set forth a plan that we'd hold it steady. And obviously if we see things develop to the upside we could change that, but we felt that we'd set a plan here that was more conservative and one that hopefully investors will agree that is conservative as well.
Ted Durbin: Okay, great. Next one from me is just on Geismar, can you maybe quantify a little bit more closely how many pounds of ethylene are you actually planning to sell in 2015 or some sense of utilization rate you're looking for as we ramp up through the year/
Don Chappel: Well, as I said really, you can call it about anyway you want to, but we are expecting very little here in the first quarter and then we would be at our typical run rates on Geismar for the balance of the year. And so that would be up against the expanded capacity and somewhere around 98% to 98.5% of that expanded capacity.
Ted Durbin: Got it, very helpful, thanks. And then last one for me, it looks like you're no longer giving guidance by segment here. I guess I'm just wondering if you can give us any sense of versus the old guidance that you used to have of the different WPZ segments, how much plus or minus are we against those or will we start to get some more color there in terms of how the actual operating areas are performing?
Don Chappel: Ted, this is Don, I'm sorry again, given as much changes we have here we took a little different approach this quarter. I would say that as we approach our Analyst Day we'll look at providing some additional information about, I'll note for you that we did take volumes down fairly substantially up in the Northeast at OVM as well as Marcellus, but some volume reduction from our prior growth expectations that is in the West. So hopefully that helps.
Ted Durbin: That's helpful. I'll leave it at that. Thank you.
Don Chappel: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Abhi Rajendran with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Abhi Rajendran: Hi, good morning guys.
Alan Armstrong: Good morning.
Abhi Rajendran: Just a quick question on the dividend illustration and outlook over the next couple years, obviously on the cash tax rate line, you're not paying anything for the next couple years. I think previously you talked about that kind of eventually rising up to maybe the high single digit, low double-digit sort of percentage, how should we think about that kind of looking beyond 2017 and then what that might mean for maybe long-term growth covers, et cetera.
Don Chappel: Yeah Abhi, this is Don again. You know we had a couple of things change here since our third quarter guidance on this matter and cash tax rates are down substantially. A couple of key points there, one was the bonus depreciation, which again lowered our cash tax rates nicely and then as well the fact that income was lower also it kind of extended in the chart, the period of time although which some of these deductions will be realized. So, I think you can see there the cash tax rate is about zero through 2017 and in our footnote on that schedule you can see that we've disclosed '18 and '19 we estimated about 4% currently and obviously things will move around a bit, but as we continue to add projects or potentially even M&A that will have the tendency to push the cash tax rate down in '18 and '19 as well as perhaps periods beyond that. So again, some good news on the cash tax front.
Abhi Rajendran: Hey got it and since you mentioned M&A, what are your thoughts on the M&A environment and possibilities? Are you continuing to look or are things sort of put on the back burner a little bit, you know, you guys deferred the drop of the NGL Petchem projects from WMB until bit later down the line. How are you thinking about that whole dynamic?
Alan Armstrong: Yeah, sure, this is Alan. Thanks for the question. You know, I would just say we have a lot of acquisition opportunities that are where we have a preferential position to acquire and those are right down our alley and our knowledge base. So we wouldn't be taking a lot of risk where we are already know the area, know the asset, know the investments and so I would say those are probably first on the list for our capacity in that space. And but you know, we're going to be pretty prudent frankly and we like where we're positioned right now and think that as the cash flows really start to come through and people really see the strength of these investment opportunities we think we're going to be very well positioned to take on some of those transactions. So, I would say that's first, but I think one thing you can, we've certainly been consistent on as we stuck with our strategy very tightly on the acquisition front and have stuck to things that are very consistent with our strategy and so you should think about that as we go forward the same thing.
Abhi Rajendran: Got it, thanks very much for the color.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Jeremy Tonet: Hi good morning.
Alan Armstrong: Good morning.
Don Chappel: Good morning.
Jeremy Tonet: I know things have been changing really quick here, but I was wondering if you might be able to expand a bit more upon conversations you are having with your producer customers as far as their drilling activities in 2015 and if there's any way we can think about quantifying the risk of throughput through the legacy WPZ G&P assets that's a low end of guidance and that certain volume assumptions are different than the high-end or any help there will be great?
Alan Armstrong: Well, just to kind of put that in context for you from where we were in the previous guidance period, we pulled well over $100 million out on that from those fee-based volumes and so we have dramatically reduced that and I would tell you the areas that are hardest hit and we think are going to be hardest hit and I would tell you we've been more conservative than some of the input we've had from some of our producers in many areas, but the areas that have been hardest hit were areas that were enjoying a big lift from liquids. And I think the gas market overall particularly the demand side probably doesn't appreciate all the nice benefit of continued supply that has come on the backs of high-priced liquids margins and with those pulled out of the space right now you know, we think that is going to dramatically retard drilling. And so if you're, I would say conservative and may be even bearish relevant to our peers about where we think liquids prices will be for the year then that also has you not being very bullish on people drilling for rich gas. And so I would say those are the areas that from our perspective are most affected not so much the dry gas, but really the richer gas areas are the ones we'd really pulled back our assumptions on.
Jeremy Tonet: That makes sense. Thank you and just one last question on constitution if you could provide any updates there as far as how that's progressing?
Alan Armstrong: Sure, Rory, you want to take that one?
Rory Miller: Yeah, this is Rory. Jeremy, we've had some pretty good news in the fourth quarter. This is probably fairly well known, but just as kind of a recap, December 2 the FERC issued a certificate of public convenience necessity authorizing the constitution pipeline project. So that's a big milestone for the project. And then later on that same month on December 24, the New York DEC issued a notice of complete application on the project and sent out three public hearings that took place in that second week of January and they've set a deadline of February 27, 2015 to get all of the written comments and on the action that they are considering. So, we've been working very closely with the New York DEC, that's probably the next hurdle that we need to clear, but they're asking a lot of questions. I think they are very intent on doing their due diligence on the project and they've been very inquisitive, but we've been working very hard and very steadily to get them the answers that they need and put them in a position to issue that permit hopefully in a few months after the, month or two after the close of the comment period.
Jeremy Tonet: Great, thanks for that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brad Olsen from TPH. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Brad Olsen: Hey, good morning guys.
Alan Armstrong: Good morning.
Brad Olsen: I had a really kind of a financial structuring question, we've obviously seen Kinder Morgan take the step of getting rid of their MLP entirely and as you look out with the ACMP deal now closed and you guys have provided what I think is very conservative guidance versus you know, what market expectations are and you're still building coverage even in this conservative $45 scenario that you painted and yet, we still see WPZ trading a couple hundred basis points in several cases wider in terms of yield than a lot of the big cap MLP peers that its comped against. And so, I guess you guys have provided some interesting color in previous presentations in terms of kind of where you expect on a yield basis WPZ to trade based on its growth rate. It seems like that discount is persisting and I was wondering if you had thoughts on a) any kind of further steps that you can take to close that discount and b) if you still find that WPZ is not an effective financing vehicle or is just simply too expensive of a financing vehicle would you consider simplifying your structure and eliminating the MLP or folding it into WMB?
Alan Armstrong: Yeah, I would just tell you. I think that's certainly a tool for us in the future, I think though right now right we've got a great plan in front of us and we do believe that as these big projects come on and really begin to generate kind of tremendous cash flow that they've got that we're going to see the market reprice that the WPZ currency. And so, we think that is yet to come and certainly with Geismar continuing to be down and the big Gulfstar and Keathley Canyon, Rockaway Lateral all these big projects really starting to kick up here for the balance of the year. We think that's going to give the market a lot of confidence. So I would say you know, we certainly understand that the benefits of that as a tool for the future, but I think right now we've got to execute on what we have and let the market retune itself before we make any further decision on that.
Brad Olsen: Got it, thanks for that color, just one follow-up, as you look out into potentially heating up M&A market in light of the market dislocations that we've seen recently and you think about potential opportunities in the M&A market, would you be willing to contemplate using WMB as a consolidation vehicle given the fact that you've spent the better part of the last year getting WMB into a fairly streamlined General Partner HoldCo or would you be willing to wait for WPZ's evaluation to get more competitive in terms of an M&A currency before attempting to do anything?
Alan Armstrong: Well, I would just say I think both of them are fairly undervalued right now from our perspective and so I think I'm able to get them both in position, but I think it certainly would depend on the transaction as we move to that point then it will certainly depend on the transaction as to which one would be the more appropriate currency for that. So, it's nice to have both of them frankly because there are times when the co-op currency would be a much more favored currency than an NLP currency. And so we think it's important to have both of them right now and we like having both those tools.
Brad Olsen: Great, thanks a lot for the color Alan.
Alan Armstrong: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Shneur Gershuni: Hi, good morning guys. Just a quick follow up to actually to the discussion you just had with Brad, when you were thinking about it taken or whether it’s a tool in your chest further down the road, is it fair to assume that given the fact that you're effectively based on an earlier comment not a taxpayer at WMB through 2017 that it pretty much wouldn't make sense to even consider it until you actually become a taxpayer, is that sort of the way we should be thinking about that as kind of the first step in terms of whether you would consider taking it at all?
Don Chappel: Shneur this is Don. I think the tool is one that we'll continue to look at and yes, we're not a taxpayer for many years. However, there are other attributes to the option, but again I think as Alan mentioned earlier we think execution is likely to cause WPZ to trade at a level that is appropriate given its opportunity set, the growth set and we think the relatively low long term risk that natural gas growth demand drives. So again, we'll just put that on the shelf. It is something we'll continue to study, but we think that execution is job number one and yes, taxes are something that would not be all that valuable for quite a few years.
Shneur Gershuni: Great thanks. Okay, so just moving on to some of the questions that I had, first there's been quite a few announcements by many of the processors around the country of significant cost saving initiatives, some headcount reductions and so forth and I realized at the time of the merger you were very adamant about no headcount reductions, if anything you were looking to hire people and so forth. But I think more kind of in a different commodity environment today, I wonder if that thought process has changed at all and you are pursuing some sort of cost reduction strategies? Sort of I was wondering if you can sort of comment against what you're doing versus what the rest of the industry is doing?
Alan Armstrong: Yeah, great question and we certainly are going to put a lot of pressure on costs and we do think that we've got a lot of room to do that and so certainly using the buying kind of into these lower material costs, costs on things like lube oil which as you can imagine is with as many spending parts as we have in our businesses is a big number for us. And so, we certainly are going to go after cost on that side. On the headcount front, I would say there are certainly a lot of those opportunities coming to us as we merge a lot of support functions. But I would say we still really need continue to preserve our strength on the operating and technical side because we do have a lot of growth on that front, but it is shifting around and we will need to shift some of those resources around to be focused on where the opportunities lie, but I would tell you we still are looking for great talent in the technical and operating side and we do see some opportunities on the support function side as we continue to consolidate the organization. So we are pursuing them aggressively I guess is the best way to say that and we do think that's quite a bit of opportunity around that.
Shneur Gershuni: Okay, and then a question about the dividend policy, last night you’ve effectively tempered the growth you said it in your prepared remarks reflecting the current commodity environment, is it also fair to say that this is somewhat of an affirmation that's no longer going to be kind of an idea or waiver type strategy in terms of how you sort of structure the PZ distribution and the Williams dividend policy or is it really just about the current commodity environment?
Don Chappel: Shneur, we believe that WPZ is sufficiently strong to carry itself without requiring any IDRs. We initially designed it very stout coverage. Fortunately we have that stout coverage designed in and we used it, but nonetheless as you can see here we're building coverage back again in a way that we do not expect WPZ to need that reverse. And as Alan pointed out with 88% in fee-based gross margin with 30% of that coming from interstate pipes and another 27%, coming from ACMP and its cost of service contracts and MDC's, we have nearly 60% of our gross margin coming from either interstate pipe or cost of service MDC type revenue. So very low risk we think on relative basis cash flows, so again we don’t see a need for IDRs, we don’t think either the market puts enough value on those to make it worthwhile.
Shneur Gershuni: Okay, that's fair enough and one final question just with respect to Geismar, I was just wondering if you walk us through where you are with ethylene production today and sort of the confidence that you know, it will be at full runway in the first quarter kind of like what are the hiccups or challenges that you're dealing with today that you need to get complete so that you can actually be at full run rate by the first quarter?
Alan Armstrong: Yeah, well, I am going to have John Dearborn provide you a little more detail here, but I would just say in general as we started up the plant we hit a – we started seeing some inefficiencies and some fouling in our heat exchangers that are critical to reaching peak efficiency in a plant like that. And so rather than continue to be dogged with that, we chose to take those heat exchangers off line, stop sales on ethylene out of the plant for a while and get those heat exchangers cleaned out adequately to make sure that we could get back to absolutely full efficiency on the plant. So, and not continuing to try to run through that as we pull through startups. So that's really what's going on, that's not a big issue, it's just a matter of getting some of the residual fouling that had been sitting in those heat exchangers and getting then tuned up. But we have gotten the plant up and running. We've had all the systems up and running. We just weren’t hitting the efficiencies that we wanted to and so we're back getting that tuned up. And then the next step would be to bring on the larger expansion as well and so we think we've got that part of the plant ready to go as well and so that's what we'll be doing here for the next three weeks or so is tackling both those issues, but things are going well on that front and we're pleased with the way the work is going. John, have you anything to add?
John Dearborn: Yeah, obviously Alan is very well informed on this issue of how Geismar is going. I think we should keep him well informed that way. The only think I would add is as we look forward, it's our intension that we bring the plant back notionally to the base capacity level that 1.3 billion pound rate and at that rate which as you heard Alan say earlier we've demonstrated now 70% of that rate already operating with nine furnaces, then we'll line up plants and will be absolutely certain that the plant is running stably and then we'll take the next steps to ramp up to the full capacity getting up into that high 90s operating rate against the full capacity over the subsequent few weeks. So that's the way we had it planned out and we're making very good progress of getting this heat exchanger cleaned and expect to turn the plant back over to operations next week and in a few days after that be back in the pipeline.
Shneur Gershuni: Perfect. Thanks a lot guys, I really appreciate the color.
Alan Armstrong: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Christine Cho: Good morning. I was just curious, you guys in the press release talk about the deferral over the planned drop down of the remaining NGL and Petchem projects. When are you thinking that that's going to be deferred, do you have a sense of an idea when that's going to be?
Don Chappel: Christine, this is Don. You know, we didn't put a date on it, so it's not embedded in any of the guidance that you see here; however, I think I'll just say we'll be opportunistic about that, so we'll look to do that when we think WPZ has the financial capacity to do that in a real value creating kind of way with that capacity or with a combination of some debt and equity when the equity is trading in a way that we think is more appropriate. So right now I'll just say we'll be opportunistic and we'll deal with that as we see the right facts and circumstances line up.
Christine Cho: Okay, and then my next question is a bit of an operational one. You know in a prior response to a question you talk about how you stripped out $100 million of margin tied to areas where there is obviously rich related drilling. If I am to think about kind of the Marcellus and you know, you've previously talked about Oak Grove coming on at the end of this year, is there really a reason for that to come on by this year? Can we defer that, I mean it doesn’t sound like Fort Beeler is going to be fully utilized this year, so can you just kind of migrate whenever volumes are dedicated to Oak Grove to Fort Beeler in the meantime?
Alan Armstrong: Christine, actually Oak Grove is PXD 1 [ph] is up and running already and recall that that is where our de-ethanizer is and so we have both the processing train there and the de-ethanizer there at the Oak Grove facility. So for operational reasons it's good for us to have that up and running. I would tell you that again even though we pulled the upsides in the step that's not fully contracted out of our guidance on our forecast, there are a couple of very sizable packages of gas out there that we are extremely well positioned to capture, because we do have that capacity available. And so, I'm not going to get into specific customer names there, but I would just tell you we're extremely well-positioned to capture those because we do have that capacity available and so we're excited to have that Oak Grove capacity ready and available to serve those customers and we think we're going to build and capture that. There's quite a bit of gas that is just sitting there not flowing today because producers have had troubles bringing pads up. And so, I think as those come on and as we have an opportunity to capture some of that other gas out there we're going to be really glad we have that capacity available.
Christine Cho: Okay, so no changes to at least a second chain of Oak Grove then the timing of that then?
Alan Armstrong: That's right.
Christine Cho: Okay, and then my last question is you know, we've always talked about potential to convert Geismar into fee-based with the customer. Given all the changes that have happened in the last couple of months, has this thinking changed or is the challenge really finding a counterparty to do it with?
Alan Armstrong: No, I certainly don't think it has changed and we are certainly looking to really think about that from a shareholder value standpoint. Certainly if we were just looking at the PV or the cash flows as we think that having the commodity risks, especially as it covers our ethane processing risk, we think that absolute PV of those cash flows is probably better providing the commodity risk. However, given the beta and the volatility that that brings in from an investor perspective, we think there's some value to be had by lowering our risk. And so, it's a matter of finding that right trade-off. And as we said, as I said earlier the fact that we've got a much lower assumption and expectation right now on the commodity margin actually gives us a little more room to go do a transaction like that and so we certainly are very interested in that. And I would tell you that while they seem separate, the ability to bridge between somebody's needs on Geismar 2 and perhaps their more current needs from available production at Geismar 1 starts become the opportunity there. So we're still very interested in doing that and we think the current margin environment gives us a little more room to do that because we wouldn’t be coming out and having to lower our guidance so much if we weren’t able to convert that into fee-based.
Christine Cho: Great, thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Lasky with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Brian Lasky: Good morning. Just want to back in on Christine's question a little bit, you guys seen the appetite among producers potentially to convert to fee-based contract as they are looking to print more barrels and show more growth, is that something that they’re potentially open to in this tough environment for the right price level?
Alan Armstrong: I would just say that a lot of our business has converted to fee base. And so really the place that we have remaining exposure on a key pole basis as I mentioned is about a little less than 15% out West of our total gross margins out there. And so, I would say it continues to be an opportunity, but we structurally I would just tell you there are ways for us to keep the risk and for them to report the barrels. And so, that I would say we figured out and we’ve done a lot of that in the past for the producers report the barrels as an owned equity barrels, but we don’t have to really change the equity ownership of those barrels. And so, that’s always a discussion that we’re always interested in, I’ll tell you that we on the processing side we have over the years tried to contract for fee base when the margins are high. And take on the key pole when margins are really low and so, but just because we certainly believe in that cyclicality of the processing margin. And so, I don’t know that we’re really changed the perspective so much on that front.
Brian Lasky: Got it and just on the Access business seemed like quarter-over-quarter a little bit more flat this quarter. Can you maybe just kind of talk about the trajectory you see going forward there and kind of what puts and takes are you seeing?
Alan Armstrong: Bob, can you take that one please?
Robert Purgason: Yeah, certainly Alan and Brian glad to look at, I think we didn’t feel we felt like we had a really good quarter actually and are seeing good volume growth in our Northeast areas, Utica very strong, still strong volumes in Marcellus, Eagle Ford volume is still growing as Alan noted, Niobrara coming up although whilst picking that up here in process. So, we feel very good about our performance coming out no integration impacts from that. And in fact or looking for the kind of growth that you saw in detail as Access standalone continuing and in fact accelerating with the Williams team.
Brian Lasky: All right, thanks Bob, that’s helpful. And then finally Don, I was just wondering if you could maybe just speak to the kind of leverage capacity you think you have at the MB level, I mean in order to stay aren’t you rated up there? I mean then would you guys have any appetite potentially fund some projects of that level? 
Don Chappel: Brian, I think at this point in time we don’t have much in the way of debt capacity to volumes level. So, obviously as cash flows build and for past margins improve or build into that capacity. But today it wouldn’t be here that we have that capacity to do much of anything in the very near future.
Brian Lasky: Okay thank you very much guys.
Alan Armstrong: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Craig Shere: Good morning guys, thanks for fitting me in. 
Alan Armstrong: Good morning, Craig.
Craig Shere: Alan in response to Brian’s question about processing contracts you expressed the long-term contrarian view where you see the cyclicality continuing. On that note, in contrast to going to fee based to Geismar would you have the appetite for increasing the commodity exposure on the midstream processing to kind of neutralize some of your exposures on both ethane and also take advantage of that long-term cyclicality you are describing?
Alan Armstrong: Yeah, great question Craig and I would just say that we certainly are not in the Olefin business for the sake of being in Olefin business and we see it’s a nice extension of our midstream business in a way to push through into those markets and keep those markets open. On the tail end and certainly we are working to try to be neutral on that ethane to ethylene spread we’re actually a little bit short ethane right now. If we were to turn on all of our ethane recovery capacity, obviously we’re very short right now, because we’re not recovering ethane anywhere. But if we wanted to turn on our ethane, if we were at full ethane production against the contracts we have we still would be a little bit short ethane. So trying to get neutral on that, but another way of getting neutral on that would be to and we’re into some T based contracts on the ethylene side and therefore reduce our length on ethylene and reduce and improve our balance between ethane and ethylene. So, I would say that’s more likely the way we would approach that. 
Craig Shere: Great that’s helpful and on the commodity deck for guidance on obviously very conservative. But the one area I had a question on and I understand that you don’t really have a long-term ethane markets that are useful. But if I’m not mistaken recent ethane-ethylene crack spreads are perhaps few cents below the full-year guidance if I’m not mistaken. Can you provide some color around Olefin’s margin expectations and market drivers you see as Geismar achieves more capacity?
Alan Armstrong: Yeah, sure. Well, first of all, just want to tell you that on the ethylene side, remember that that is at a $55 oil price. And so, we think that ethylene price is very commensurate with a $55 oil price that we have in there. Also you obviously have to pay attention to the spread and not just the absolute price that we have in there would it sounds like you are focused on Craig. But the other thing that I think it’s missed sometimes in this is that we are actually at the netted price and remember that we produce in the Mississippi river market. And so while we certainly sell and exchange a lot of our product in the Mont Belvieu as well, we do have exposure to the Mississippi river market, which has been extremely short and there’s actually a lot of derivative production that’s been down in the area due to shortages. And so, you have to take that into consideration when you look at our proposed ethylene spread. And so, I think we feel pretty good as you look into the 2016 and 2017 timeframe you can see our ethylene price coming up, but you can also see that the ethane price is coming up right along with that as well. And so really again need to look at the spread I would say I’m pretty bullish. The ethylene market as we look out in next couple of years, because the growth that I think we're going to see in the economies and the lack of near-term productive capacity coming up, it’s pretty hard to argue there isn’t going to be quite a bit of pressure on those Olefin markets to the upside and lot of demand coming to that. So that’s what I would have to offer for you. I think we feel pretty good about where we’re positioned there and John is a great student of that space as well and I’ll John provide any additional comment you want to make.
John Porter: And I, only one few other things to add up, first the lower prices are certainly expected to stimulate some demand, but also we’ve been looking at some recent reports that would say that we’re seeing slowing exports and increasing local demand here in North America for ethylene and ethylene to reproduce. And certainly the ethylene derivative market remained quite strong. The second point I would add for consideration here is that if you look at ethylene inventories, there are pretty much all time low levels to estimated to be about six days worth of production in inventory at this point in time.  But remember that all those six days are not available to take advantage of a production mishap and nearly no one forecast production mishaps. So we think there are probably only about maybe three or four days worth of usable inventory they’re ready to make up for some production shortfalls. And certainly coming into the year we see a couple of crackers that are down now though we have a light turnaround season this year. And then lastly, I'd turn your attention a little bit further to the Louisiana market, today with the Evangeline pipeline shutdown and suffered some from reliability issues at the moment, the spot price premium between Texas and the Louisiana is in the $0.08 to $0.10 down range. I think as we bring our facility back in operations that will likely return to more normal levels, but we’re very well aware on some derivative capacity there on the river that is underserved, because of the combined outage of both Edmonton and Evangeline. So I think as Alan expressed and as I would confirm here we are generally positive as our guidance would suggest, so thanks for the question.
Craig Shere: Very helpful, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Sharon Lui: Hi, good morning.
Alan Armstrong: Good morning.
Sharon Lui: Just a follow-up question on ACMP, maybe if you could provide some color on the organic growth opportunities and what type of CapEx is embedded in your guidance relative to the historical levels for the G&P business?
Alan Armstrong: Bob, you want to take that?
Robert Purgason: Sure, yeah Sharon, it's nice to hear from you. In terms of just looking at going forward you'll notice we had a good strong capital year this year and we’ve given I believe a three-year look out here in the new numbers. And if you compare those to our past guidance you’ll see some strength in capital over our older forecast just in terms of our thinking that there are still new opportunities coming. These assets have not been worked hard and we are seeing the kind of backfill that we’ve always talked into our capital not just dropping off the ledge when we finish this first round build out that arguably happened this year. So we still see good capital investment opportunity and as you know that drives earnings given our business model.
Sharon Lui: But has that been, I guess the shift or change in producer's willingness to commit to like a contract under cost of service under the current commodity environment?
Alan Armstrong: Well, these are not new contracts these are continuing to build on the footprint that we have already established. And are continuing to build out in these core areas like Utica and the strength that we’re seeing there in the Eagle Ford where, yes drilling softer, but there’s still good strong drilling going on and really just filling out our existing portfolio.
Sharon Lui: Okay, great. And I guess just one question with regards to liquidity at WPZ, so post the merger, does the partnership have access to both credit facilities or is there plans to, I guess renegotiate with the bankers for one larger facility?
Alan Armstrong: Sharon, we put a new larger facility in place effective as of the date of the merger as well as a supplemental liquidity facility. So we have abundant liquidity.
Sharon Lui: Okay, and has the pricing terms changed?
Alan Armstrong: The pricing terms are more in line with WPZs pricing given its historic WPZs pricing in light of the fact that we have a mid-BBB investment grade ratings. So the ACMP pricing really moved to the WPZ level of pricing and it felt a little better than it was in our prior facility.
Sharon Lui: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eric Genco with Citi. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Eric Genco: Hi, I just wanted to follow up a little bit on Craig’s question. When we look at the spot prices for ethylene, if I will get sort of the Bloomberg today, it looks like for Mont Belvieu you’re looking at $34.75 per pound. Is that the right number to be looking at and what is that now for the Mississippi River market today roughly?
Alan Armstrong: Yeah, thanks for the question. Unfortunately, there’s not an awful lot of transactions happening on the Mississippi River. The few recent transactions that we saw came out to be plus about between $0.08 and $0.10 to that number that you see at Mont Belvieu. And as I mentioned in my commentary just a moment ago, at least I would believe that as we bring our plants back into service here through this early part of this year, we would probably see that differential climb to more normal levels. And those more normal levels range between $0.01 and $0.03, so if you are looking forward and it would be reasonable to expect those kind of differentials, but certainly and once again, we feel that there’s a pent-up demand over on the river that’s been lagging by our outage and the reliability of the pipelines getting ethylene to that market in recent past.
Eric Genco: Okay that’s helpful, but the $34.75 that’s a good number that’s kind of the good number for ethylene pricing in Mont Belvieu as of right now?
Alan Armstrong: It’s a good number whether all transactions happen at that level they’ll probably happen around that number, so yeah it’s a good number you are looking at.
Eric Genco: And just, I mean just kind of to remind me, I should have this somewhere, but I just don’t it top of my head. If Geismar is running at say 95%, 98% or whatever the target is, what percentage of, I guess U.S. ethylene capacity would that be like? How much more is coming back onto the market?
Alan Armstrong: Yeah, it’s around, it’s just under 4%.
Eric Genco: 4% okay.
Alan Armstrong: Yeah, right in that range, right.
Eric Genco: Right and then my second question just switching gears I guess to Atlantic Gulf and I'm sorry if you touched on this, it looked like the other segment costs jumped pretty significantly there. I can understand that there’s going to be some, perhaps some startup costs associated with Gulfstar, I was hoping you could quantify that a little bit more? And then just try to understand if that’s what it is at Gulfstar, are there any revenues or any revenues whatsoever in the quarter from Gulfstar, inventory and charge or anything like that?
Alan Armstrong: Well yeah, there were revenues in the quarter from Gulfstar. I think we had $19 million of new Gulfstar fees. We actually collected quite a bit more than that in really the second half of 2014. So we have the cash in, but based on the revenue recognition model that we’re using we kind of have to dose out those collected dollars based on the forecasted throughput through the facility. So our cash numbers are actually are far in excess of the $19 million that we took to earnings. But that will continue to grow and we are collecting a base fee or demand fee under that contract. And then there’s a usage fee as well as those barrels and those MMBTs of gas total across the facility. So that’s a fairly significant impact on revenues in the quarter. Also our Transco transportation revenues were up, fee-based revenues were up about $15 million. And there was some IT volumes and some short-term firm deals and as well as some seasonal volumes that we saw pushing that number up.
Eric Genco: Okay, but is there something that kind of caused the, I mean is it really Gulfstar startup or how much of this is one-time to go from sort of 3Q number of $133 million above the some of the cash cost to say $160 million?
Alan Armstrong: Yeah that the quarter I would say is not really indicative of the year. So if you look at the year in total on the expense side we were right on our target, but if you look quarter-to-quarter, it looks pretty extreme. I’ll tell you what happened though if you remember the polar vortex that we went through Q1 of 2014, it was kind of an all hands on deck period for Transco we were sudden new records seemed like almost every day. It was a pretty severe environment and we saw almost all of our expenditures that we could push got pushed into the second, third, and fourth quarters. So just it was a game of catch-up all year and we just wound up loading a lot of those expenses into the fourth quarter. If you look at the year’s total, it’s pretty much right on.
Eric Genco: All right this was helpful, thank you very much.
Alan Armstrong: Yep.
Operator: And our last question comes from Timm Schneider with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead your line is open. 
Timm Schneider: Hey guys just real quick, and first of all I appreciate all the color you gave on the ethylene markets that was super helpful. I think it is funny as your call was going on Axio filed for Private Letter Ruling for their MLPs, so you already got someone for your fee base Geismar ethylene I guess. I mean, so I just want to switch over real quick then to the Northeast. Can you just give us a little bit more color on what the exit rate maybe was at OEM? And then secondly, have any of the producers up there actually pushed back to you and kind of had some look, can you give us a break on any of these rates that you guys are charging us in exchange for it will keep the volume going?
Alan Armstrong: Timm, sorry Jim Scheel, you want to take that please?
Jim Scheel: Sure, you know as we spoke last time we were pretty bullish about ending the year around 400. That didn’t happen. We had a couple issues associated with some pretty significant CRPs that had some operational issues associated with producers actually having a much richer liquids content. So we’ll expect that volume to show up later in the year as we install the equipment necessary to handle that quality issue that we faced at the end of the year. So we ended just over 300. We have been talking to our producers and as has already been talked about it, that number of different times we have a much different expectation for growth around OVM, but it is continued growth, it’s just at a slower rate. We have had discussions with producers about renegotiation of agreements and that’s not to go not without opportunities for us to improve on the base agreements that we had achieved with Cayman and negotiate some better terms. But at this point, those are just preliminary discussions and we have not made any commitments to make any changes, but obviously if we can create a win-win position with our producers we will be open to those discussions.
Timm Schneider: All right, super outlook, thank you guys.
Alan Armstrong: Thanks.
Operator: And it appears we have no further questions at this time. So I would like to turn the program back over our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Alan Armstrong: Okay, great well thank you all very much, very excited about our future and really like how we've repositioned ourselves here and derisked our forecast substantially and yet still tremendous growth in distribution. And we think, best months it appears, considering our conservative forecast. So, thank you very much for joining us and we look forward to talking to you in the future.
Operator: That does conclude today’s program. You may disconnect at anytime.

Operator: Welcome to the Williams Partners and Access Midstream's Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir
John Porter: Thank you, Tina. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams, Williams Partners, and Access Midstream Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on each of these three company's websites. These items include yesterday's press releases and related investor materials including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong will speak to you momentarily. Our CFO, Don Chappel is available to respond to questions and we also have the four leaders of Williams operating areas with us. Jim Scheel leads our Northeast area, Allison Bridges leads our west area, Rory Miller leads our Atlantic Gulf area, and John Dearborn leads NGL & Petchem services. We also have Mike Stice, Dave Shields and Bob Ferguson joining us from Access Midstream Partners. In our presentation materials you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we’ve have reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials. So with that, I will turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong: Great. Good morning and thank you, John. Thanks everybody for joining us today. As usual, we have got a lot going on as we continue to pursue this tremendous growth that our strategy continues to deliver. We’re coming off a quarter here that was in-line with our expectations, but much lower at WPZ due to Geismar's extended outage and a continued heavy capital investing period all as was expected. But certainly, we’re looking forward to a much better quarter coming here in the fourth quarter, as some of our major projects start to come online and we see some dramatic improvements in volumes in the Northeast. A major change is afoot as we combine both WPZ and Access into the large scale natural gas infrastructure MLP. And the team here at WPZ is very energized right now as we’re on the verge of a major $1 billion boost in our annual cash flows that we expect to come from three major projects Geismar, Gulfstar and the Keathley Canyon Connector all of which have reached the commissioning stage here in the fourth quarter. We also are very excited to see volumes and profits beginning to rapidly escalate in the northeast operating area as many projects have been commissioned here in October and provide a little more detail on that later. The Access team continues its great performance as we have all come to appreciate this team's ability to steadily grow its volumes and cash flows as it connects gas supplies in some of the most prolific basins in the U.S. And we also are continuing to see major potential Transco projects coming our way as a result of Transco's competitive advantages. These new prospective projects include the Appalachian Connector and the Diamond East projects, both are major new projects that connect the burgeoning supplies from the Marcellus and Utica directly to growing demand on Transco that is anxious to see the supplies coming their way as those markets strive to grow as well. And of course we continue to have a long stream of projects that are under construction that will keep this well identified fee based cash flows continuing to grow throughout our guidance period and beyond. The major changes that will be occurring within the new merged partnership are exciting in many ways. First, we will have the highest forecast distribution growth rate of any of the major MLPs. Second, our coverage will be above average for the same peer group with expected $1.1 billion of excess cash flow coverage through 2017 and the Access cash flows, along with our major new fee based projects continue to dramatically reduce exposure to commodity prices. The Access LP holders are about to see a 50% step up in distributions to $3.65 in 2015 versus the forecasted $2.42 per LP in 2014. So truly a very exciting time here as we merge these MLPs and really turn this into the MLP in the major integrated group and particularly one that is well-positioned as we have talked about before with its strategy that is so focused on natural gas. So there are many changes occurring as these major tailwinds form and this first big tranche of capital finally begins to bear fruit in a very game changing manner against the traditional WPZ assets. But what has not changed is our commitment to a strategy that we strongly believe will be the most enduring growth model amongst the infrastructure MLPs. We have worked in a very disciplined manner to have this strategy of connecting the very best natural gas supplies to the very best natural gas markets at the center of all of our portfolio and capital allocation decisions. So we continue to stick with the strategy that we are very proud of and we think has positioned us for great long-term growth. The strong and undeniable fundamentals of low-cost clean energy and the cheapest petrochemical feed-stocks in the world will prevail we believe and we’re seeing the demand pool beginning. We have continued to position ourselves in a way that will catch this very sustainable and fundamentally supported wave of volume growth and at the same time, help our customer base achieve their lofty goals of growth as well. We appreciate all the support and patience from our investor base as we’ve had some bumps and bruises along the way getting to this as we have pursued this very ambitious plan. And we’re thrilled that many of you are well-positioned to catch this next big wave of valuation growth at both WMB and at the partnership level. So now let me quickly point out a few things in the prepared slide deck here beginning on page 2. You can see here just an overview of what we will hit on today most of which I have touched on already, so let's move on to slide 3. On slide 3, as I’ve mentioned in the opening WPZ's DCF was low, but was in-line with our expectations. Major drivers of the lower DCF was a missed opportunity on Geismar of over $200 million. So that's the number if we would have been up and running that we predict here in the third quarter, and higher maintenance capital as expected and was forecasted for the quarter. So this is really the time of year that a lot of our maintenance capital gets done. As you know, we had lower than expected maintenance capital for the first half of the year and we started to catch up with that as we usually do during the third quarter. Also we had some outages in Canada, particularly from some Suncor outages and we also had a planned turnaround at our Redwater facility where we made a lot of the significant tie-ins for our CNRL Horizon project which lowered volumes there in our Canadian assets as well. Also we had slightly lower than last year adjusted segment profit plus DD&A was just off of last year. This was driven by lower NGL margins and this was really driven as the result of a loss of the keep-whole processing contract up at our Opal facility. And thankfully though, this was largely offset by about $36 million in higher fee based revenues in the quarter on our consolidated assets and operated assets. And at the same -- we got the same kind of very positive move in our equity investments in both Discovery and Laurel Mountain Midstream. You should really continue to expect a lot of great things coming from these equity investments across the board really here in the fourth quarter; Blue Racer Midstream is continuing to see great Utica volume growth. Our Discovery system gets the Keathley Canyon Connector started up and the Laurel Mountain Midstream benefits from our increased ownership which has now moved up to 69% versus 51% in the third quarter. Also as you can see on this slide, ACMP's adjusted DCF was up by an impressive 42%, driven by 20% higher fee based revenues and so this all combined for WMB, these Partnership holdings now produced a segment profit plus DD&A of $838 million which was 36% higher than the third quarter of 2013. So, really starting to see some great distributions out of PZ as always and now an increasing amount coming from Access. Moving on to slide 4, you can see some of the operational highlights here for ACMP and starting with a big milestone of 6 Bcf a day of gross gathering volumes which the team hit in September and also ACMP's 49% interest ownership in UEO continues to increase in importance. And this really well-placed infrastructure that’s referred to as UEO is serving the rich Utica volumes and the volumes continue to expand rapidly up there and now two new trains planned. One planned to start up later this year and one planned to start up at the end of next year. And also great work by our Access teams, getting the Bucking Horse plant started up in Niobrara. That’s planned for later this year and I'm really proud to see the way our Williams and Access teams are working together. As you know, we’ve very substantial processing operations at Williams in Wyoming and then very thankful to see our teams working so well together to help bring up the Bucking Horse plant up there to serve the Niobrara. So overall net volumes on ACMP are up 9%, and as you can see where the high performers are in this list that drove that growth with of course the Utica being the star of that. Moving on to slide 5, looking forward a little more now, and we expect to see the fruits of Williams' major capital projects really starting to kick in here in the fourth quarter of 2014 and in a very powerful way in 2015. In fact, these three projects alone are expected to produce nearly $1 billion in 2015 cash flows and to put this in perspective, these three projects should drive a 33% improvement over WPZ's expected segment profit plus DD&A for 2014 and during 2015. So huge driver coming from these three big projects, and we will also have an even larger impact on DCF because a lot of the financing of course the financing costs have been carried for a large portion of 2014 on these projects, as these have been very long dated capital projects. And these assets have had really very little -- they have had very little planned maintenance capital for 2015. So a huge driver of DCF in 2015 as well. We also have several other recent milestones and achievements listed. All of these would normally be big deals, but we have so many developments, it really is getting hard to give them all their due bandwidth, but just to provide some details on a few of these items. The Geismar rebuild and expansion project is complete, and we have begun to bring hydrocarbons into the plant this week, and start-up operations including the final dry-outs of the primary systems. And then once those dry-outs are completed, the actual cracking processes will be initiated later. I certainly want to just take a moment, and thank our team there at Geismar for their intense focus on doing this project safely. It has been a very large and complex project, and they have remained very focused on no matter how much the pressure is to remain safe, and keep that first and foremost and I'm thankful for both their leadership and management there at Geismar for keeping that front and center. On Gulfstar, we are complete with our work, and Hess is now running the spar. They announced yesterday that they plan to have first oil within the week, and this project team also achieved first quartile safety performance on that project. Tremendous effort, to bring so many different skill sets and capabilities together to get that project delivered, and we are very thankful to be getting to work with Hess and Chevron on delivery of this major asset as well. And then the Keathley Canyon connector has been fully hydro-tested, and is now in the dewatering mode. Anadarko will control the timing of this first production which they and we still expect later this quarter. Our Constitution project reached a major milestone last week, and this was the receipt of the final environmental impact statement for this project from the FERC and this gives the Commission the green light to approve the project as designed, and we are pushing for a November order from the Commission. And of course, they certainly understand how important it is to get this project up and moving, so that we can reduce some of the bottlenecks and constraints of getting gas supplies up into the New England states for the winter of 2015 and 2016. Our Transco team has just continued to knock it out of the park in the areas of business development and we had two very successful open seasons in the period, and we continue to string together both important base hits which we just continue to have a number of laterals and expansions off the systems and the occasional grand slam like the Atlantic Connector project that is significantly larger than even the massive Atlantic Sunrise project. And I will hit on that a little bit more in a minute. On slide 6, you can see the continuing list of projects that we continue to click off on the left. And on the right, potential projects are being added so quickly, it is really getting hard to keep this slide up to date. You will note that we had to move the Rockaway lateral into the first quarter of 2015 due to some construction environment difficulties that we face there. However, even more offsetting this, we expect to place portions of the Leidy Southeast and the Virginia Southside project into service earlier than planned. So, great job there of the team, continuing to be innovative in ways to bring some of those projects on earlier where the environment allows us to do so. We also expect to be able to move our Canadian PDH project into the firm category later this month. We will still have a few contingencies related to third parties on that, but we will have our feed study completed for PDH-1 and we will be going for final Board approval here in November. So, great progress being made on moving those projects along as well. On slide 7, we’re going to provide some detail now here on the really exciting Appalachian Connector project and we’re not disclosing the actual capital on this project at this point, but we do expect this to be at least 50% larger than our Atlantic Sunrise project, so very large scale project. It involves a major greenfield line that you can see coming out of the panhandle of West Virginia, the northern panhandle of West Virginia down into a connection there in Virginia and then a major expansion along the system to be able to move those supplies into the various markets both to the north and to the south. Actually all the way to station 65 which is zone 3 on Transco and of course, from station 65 you’ve access to both growing industrial markets as well as access to many of the expanding LNG facilities in the area. So really that is coming together. And that really helps us be the supplier for the LNG projects that are being developed along the coast as well on Transco. So the support from these shippers has really been tremendous, as this is one of the few projects that delivers gas to the actual markets. And so, this really gives an ability to a producer or supplier to really go get the highest price because they have so many options of where they can sell their gas and they can really go to the highest bidder for their gas by having so many multiple market options along the Transco system. Really this is a tremendous value proposition to have all these -- the direct access to all these growing markets on Transco, not just existing, but really growing markets and we also are excited to see the confidence that the producers behind our Ohio Valley Midstream system. And our investment in Blue Racer, the great confidence we are seeing from producers there in growing their volumes out on the system as well. And so that connection that we like to really stress about being able to connect the very best supplies, to the very best market outlets, this is just another great example of that. Of course, you saw that with Atlantic Sunrise coming out of the Susquehanna County area and now we’re able to basically do that in the same way, coming out of the southwestern Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and southeastern Ohio areas. So our gathering business really benefits from this because it would have the best market outlets out of the area. And of course, our market end customers get access to these great prolific upstream supplies. So really a win-win-win and really shows the strength of our strategy. Moving on to slide 8 here, really exciting drivers for getting the merged MLP into the very, very strong and offensive posture and getting our 2015 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $5 billion. As I mentioned earlier, a 50% move-up in the distribution for ACMP unit holders from the 2014 guidance and a 30% increase over the 2015 distribution guidance. So we will have the best-in-class distribution growth at 10% to 12% through 2017 and with a very strong coverage ratio at or above 1.1 and about $1.1 billion of excess cash flow through 2017 that we expect to generate off of this strong business growth. We also will enjoy strong investment grade credit ratings and very limited equity needs up against this current business plan, because our cash flows continue to grow, continue to expand our debt capacity very rapidly. So really excited about how we have got this merged MLP positioned. It is strong from a strategy standpoint. It is very strong from a capability standpoint, and now financially extremely well-positioned for the environment that we are in. Just to talk very quickly about a few of the synergies that we are seeing. One of the things we are really excited about is really looking for the very best capabilities exist between the two companies. One of the areas that we are really seizing on very quickly is Access' well-honed, modular compression design. And so we’re looking at that to be a major savings for Williams here, as we look to see the cost and the scale frankly, that we gain by having all of the compression installation that both parties do, and being able to really be the low-cost provider of getting in that the field, in a very quick way that serves our customers. So great capabilities there by Access, that Williams is very rapidly adopting. Likewise, up at the Bucking Horse plant as I mentioned earlier Williams of course has great strength in the operations of processing facilities and we’re very rapidly bringing those alongside Access and helping them get that plant up in a safe and reliable manner and then one other area that I think is really impressive for us is the Access North Victory system that lies just to the north and east of our OVM system is going to be the beneficiary of -- provided that the transaction goes through, of Southwestern Energy's acquisition of Marcellus acreage in that area. And we think that bodes very well in terms of having a new buyer in the area that is very excited about that acreage and who has got the capital to bring to that. And of course, that system ties into our OVM system, and ultimately then would have access into the great Appalachian Connector project. So great example of how we are stringing together the synergies of our assets up there. Moving on to slide 9, this is really impressive picture of valuation here at the new merged MLP. And so, what you have here is regression analysis between the distribution growth rate and so, we have got the merged MLP here marked at 11%, and then on the Y axis you see the current yield. And of course, this shows that on a regression analysis basis that the merged MLP should ultimately trade out at a sub 4% yield, even at that yield, on this line you would see a $94 unit price for the merged MLP. And frankly, we think given the coverage ratio which is just above the average for this group, the strong credit rating that we have and the tremendous strategy and clear line of growth. We think we actually ought to be trading below this line on the regression analysis. So really excited to see this valuation coming through and we think the market is waiting to see some of these things like Geismar and Gulfstar get done and those start to cash flow, and so we think we are just on the verge of realizing this kind of value at our MLP. Moving on to slide 10, a tremendous opportunity with Williams, we just couldn't be better positioned right now, very excited to have delivered a 32% raise in our WMB dividend and following that with a 15% dividend growth rate through 2017. So tremendous value that we’re able to deliver for our shareholders and I don't think anybody doubts the amount of growth that we have out in front of us. And I do think obviously, there has been concerns over our ability to execute and bring some of these major projects on-line and we’re just on the verge of passing that stage. And then we continue to have a number of very large scale projects going forward. Also very excited to see the very strong capabilities of Access and Williams coming together from a leadership perspective and from an operating capability standpoint, very solid alignment, I would tell you, between the values of both of these companies. And I want to take a moment, and thank Mike Stice for his tremendous leadership at building such a great organization with great values. And we’re just very thrilled to be able to working up alongside Access and taking some of the best ideas that they have to offer and bringing those in to Williams and as well, excited to have the new team there at Access all pulling on the same rope. So with that, we will turn it over to questions. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). We will go to our first question with Shneur Gershuni with UBS.
Shneur Gershuni – UBS: Good to see the progress that you have made with respect to coming to an end and putting forward the Geismar project and in closing up the merger. I was wondering if we can sort of transition on some questions more on a go forward basis, with the merged ACMP/WPZ combination, you’ve sort of mentioned in the past a high percentage coming from revenue. When you think about the 2015 guidance can you share with us some of the sensitivities around NGLs and that margin you have baked in -- in terms of the low and the high-end of guidance in terms of how we should be thinking about the commodity environment?
Don Chappel: The combined MLP will be more than 80% fee based since all of the Access business is in fact fee based and much of it under cost to service or MVCs. There is really no direct commodity exposure there. So I think you can look solely at the Williams -- and if you look in our data back on slide 85 you can see the sensitivity of the price changes on commodities. Again I think we’re fairly diversified on the commodity front. It will represent less than 20% in 2015 and that percentage will likely continue to decrease as we grow the fee based business much more rapidly than the commodity side of the business.
Shneur Gershuni – UBS: And as a follow-up, I recognize the fact that you're expecting about a beds of cash flow coming in with some of the new projects slated to come on-line late this year. How do you think of your leverage funding for the next several years as you sort of think about the big capital projects and so forth? The expectation to fund it kind of on a 50:50 basis? Just wondering if you could give us a little color and how you think of your current leverage.
Alan Armstrong: We would expect the merged partnership to maintain its kind of mid-BBB investment. Somewhere around four times debt to EBITDA on an adjusted basis so I think that will be the guide post. We think the business plan that we put forth with the $5 billion of EBITDA and the 10% to 12% growth rate through our guidance period that ends in 2017 can be financed with a very modest amount of equity. Obviously we’ve many more opportunities in front of us. Alan highlighted a couple of major ones. I would point out that those are fairly long lead time items so something like the pipelines that Alan mentioned would kind of service dates the financing for those is really out principally in 2017 and 2018.
Shneur Gershuni – UBS: Finally on the Constitution Pipeline, if I saw correctly you have requested to get the final sign-off within the next 30 days or so. If it takes longer than 30 days, does that delay the project due to weather issues and so forth? And also I was wondering if you can comment about whether you think the length of pipeline will deviate much from the current plan.
Rory Miller: Well, the timeline right now as it sits is very tight. We’re hoping to get the FERC certificate on for Constitution Pipeline in November. If that happens, then we will be looking for notice of completion from the New York in December [ph] -- along that same timeline. It is a very tight schedule, but if we get the kind of responses that we are hoping for, and we think are possible, then we can still make the heating season of 2015-2016. We do have some major delays. If we have mullet tie month delays, then that heating season won't be possible. So there is a chance that we could get pushed beyond that but we are trying to be very clear with everyone involved I think the need for the gas is definitely there. We saw that with the polar vortex last heating season. And I think we’re just trying to get the message out to let people know what's at stake. It is going to take some cooperation but we think we've got a good shot at it.
Operator: And we will now go to Christine Cho with Barclays Capital.
Christine Cho – Barclays Capital: Regarding the Southwestern purchase of Chesapeake with Southwestern it is going to 11 rigs compared to Chesapeake's one. I know it's early days and the deal is not even done yet and we don't know where the rigs are going to go, but can you give us an idea of how much undedicated acreage is -- that subpoena for grabs overlaps your footprint? Then you kind of mentioned this in your prepared remarks, but given ACMP at one point was Chesapeake's MLP are there opportunities for you guys to process the gas that ACMP has the dedication for on the gathering side or is that already committed to other players? Can you just give some more color on your synergies there?
Alan Armstrong: Sure, Christine. We can provide you the detail you're looking for there today. I would just tell you that there is a very substantial amount of gas that is available for processing from Chesapeake and potentially now Southwestern. So, I would just tell you there is a lot of acreage there that needs processing, some gathering and processing services and I would just say that we are very well positioned for both of those 0.
Christine Cho – Barclays Capital: Okay, with the recent correction in the mark, we saw a number of deals get announced and obviously Access to capital markets is pretty key in this space. And just add a brief (indiscernible) that maybe non-investment grade MLPs might have trouble raising capital, and if we see some more of these big companies spinning out with mull till billion dollar backlogs with drop-downs. I would think some of these private equity players hoping to monetize their investment maybe the IPO might have trouble competing with something like that. Has sentiment of potential sellers changed from where you sit? Can you kind of give us an idea of what you’re seeing on the M&A front?
Alan Armstrong: I would say that it has varied. Obviously some of the smart money I would call it decided to take some risk off the table of that early and get out while the getting was good and I would say that sentiment is probably becoming more pronounced. I agree with the concern you raise and I do think that we will see some movement in that direction, because I don't think anybody wants to be left being the guy that was too greedy waiting for any more increase. I think people appreciate the market is pretty hot and so I do think we will continue to see a lot of assets coming out of the private equity sector into the market. And I think they will start to appreciate how much quality IPO there is that has some pretty major advantages over less substantial offerings.
Christine Cho – Barclays Capital: Okay, and then I guess kind of piggybacking off your response to that, I think you guys are now sitting on an option to enter into the Permian. Deal size isn't too big, multiple looks attractive, although you probably have to spend a couple hundred million to get there. You’ve the parent of a potential partner behind this system. However, you’ve previously said that you would like to be number one or number two in a basin. Are there any initial thoughts you can provide us, and is this an area that you would be interested in growing into?
Alan Armstrong: We’re not going to respond on exactly our position on that. We’re just not at liberty right now to discuss that. However, I would say that we have been looking at the Permian from a business development standpoint, particularly the Delaware basin for quite some time. From a Williams side, we've had a lot of producing customers that are customers elsewhere that have been interested in us providing services in the area where there is not much infrastructure and certainly we’re not interested in going into areas that are already well served, but I would tell you there is a lot of that basin that is not well served and we’ve been looking at it that and I would say we would like to enter it in a way that. One, it is well supported from a financial perspective and two that ultimately we get to a scale position that has competitive advantages and provided that we can accomplish both of those tasks, then yes we would be interested in entering the basin. But those are two pretty lofty goals in terms of making sure that the cash flows are well supported and that we’ve a clear line of sight on gaining scale and competitive advantage the way we usually enjoy in a basin.
Christine Cho – Barclays Capital: Okay, last question for me, appreciate all the color. One of the competing pipes for your Appalachian Connector project, you know recently announced it was moving forward at least to station 165. Is there room for both projects? Or do you think yours is different and off because it provides a clear route to station 65? And then when you also say it's 50% more than Atlantic sunrise, you mean 50% of what the CapEx is for the 100% interest or just your interest?
Don Chappel: On a gross basis, it's 50% more as well. So you can use either number because we said more than but even more than a gross amount. In terms of the advantages of that project, I think it is almost two different projects frankly because I will tell you the strength of the Appalachian Connector project is that it does not just get you to station 65, it allows you to go directly to those LBC interconnects, directly to the town borders, directly to those markets. And so rather than sitting at a pooling point and being stuck with gas that you have already paid a rate to get there. You don't really have any options but to sell it at that point, you can go to multiple marks and you can go cut deals with people who want to have growing supplies on their system. So I would just tell that you is the distinction. It is very major distinction and as to whether there is room for both, I would just say that I think our shippers are speaking for themselves -- can't really speak for the other project, but I would just say given the way the response we have gotten from the shippers that are interested in our project, that would tell me there is room for two, I guess if the other project has economic support as well.
Christine Cho – Barclays Capital: Is the shippers for you guys mostly producers?
Alan Armstrong: It's a mix, pretty substantial mix just like we have seen in our other big projects like this.
Operator: And we will now go to Abhi Rajnandan with Credit Suisse.
Abhi Rajnandan – Credit Suisse: Couple quick questions, in the northeast segment EBITDA was actually down sequentially in the third quarter. I believe there were some one-offs included in the results, but could you help us think about some of the factors preventing maybe a quicker ramp-up in the profits in the segment and how we should think about that trajectory looking ahead from 4Q and then into next year?
Jim Scheel: As we look at the third quarter this year, let's take a step back and talk a little bit about volumes. During the last earnings call we talked about the number of wells coming on line. We actually had eight wells delayed during the third quarter coming into the OVM system. That was obviously a disappointing issue for us, some producer issues. But we see those coming on-line pretty quickly, and we have won a site to 35 more wells coming on line over the course of this quarter, two of which are dry Utica wells. So as we look at our exit rate for the year for OVM, we are very excited about the opportunity to continue to see a very robust fourth quarter. That would be combined with some additional fee based revenue coming from all of the new assets that have come on-line. Obviously I have been disappointed by and the delay in bringing on the stabilization facilities as well as CXP 1, but we've had a lot of assets coming on-line, and just getting that all put together has been a pretty big issue, keeping that as safe and as efficient as possible has been our high priority. So those are coming on line as we speak. We've got commissioning activities coming on today that will also improve earnings coming into the fourth quarter. We've also seen pretty much the completion of a major expansion around the Susquehanna supply hub so volumes there have increased since the close of the third quarter by about 200 million a day and we are excited about the continued increase there. So we've got a great trajectory for future growth. Then when you combine that, one of the things you wanted to reconcile to was the third quarter. As we think about that, we had some kind of -- I won't call them extraordinary but we had some income from Cayman associated with the fire, and then one of the other changes that we have to be aware is with Laurel Mountain Midstream, we have a percentage of gas. Gas prices have been down for the third quarter and so we've seen a hit from that as well. So if we really look at earnings growth going forward, taking out those two things, we still see a nice improvement as we look forward to the fourth quarter and into 2015.
Abhi Rajnandan – Credit Suisse: Shifting gears to Geismar, could you give us some color on the ramp-up there over the next couple of months? When do you guys expect to kind of get up to commercial levels of production, and then when could we potentially see operating rates up in the 90s like the rest of the industry?
Don Chappel: From where we stand today, as you saw in our announcement, we've announced that construction is complete and we’re fully into the commissioning and start-up activities. These activities are largely focused on getting the plant dried out and oxygen freed and leak tested and rotating our major equipment in the plant in preparation for the startup. Sitting here today I would say November 15th, plus or minus a few days is where we should be for making first ethylene as is signaled by our announcement. Then as we look forward beyond that we are expecting a ramp-up, first, I would say what was the base plant rates in order to make certain that we get the entire machine lined out and make certain that we've got a good stable operating system at that point of operation and then shortly after that ramping it on up to the expanded capacity. The overall timeframe for getting that done from the day we start making first ethylene is going to be notionally around a month. It is going to be about four weeks but again we’re going to want to do this in a very disciplined way. We've brought some unbelievable operational discipline to the plant there in Geismar and the team is going about this startup in a very deliberate way and a very deliberate disciplined way. But I think that brings all the color you need to give a sense of how we are going to bring the plant back into operation.
Abhi Rajnandan – Credit Suisse: Last one from me coming back to the merger between the MLPs. So based on the previous iteration of the terms I think you guys have put out figures expecting about a 1.2 times dividend coverage for MB in 2015 and 2016. And then on the revised terms I think cash available after dividends comes in slightly lower. So could you just give us some color on how to think about the maybe new Access coverage over the next couple of years and any other puts and takes there?
Don Chappel: In terms of the 1.2 times we boosted the initial distribution I think before we said at least 349, we decided to go with 365, so quite a higher initial distribution there, that reduced the coverage a bit but the coverage is still well north of 1.1 times. And in terms of the transaction, we shifted coverage from Williams to the merged partnership. We thought that was the right thing to do to create the kind of valuation and the partnership to make it the lead entity to move Williams to a pure play GP HoldCo. So we shifted the coverage to WPZ again over that three year period, took the coverage down at Williams but nonetheless we still have over $300 million of cash coverage just in 2015 and 2016 really with no real need for that capital. It is nice to have, and I'm sure we will find a value adding use for it, but nonetheless rather than run 1.2 times coverage at Williams without a clear need for the excess coverage or having double coverage, in fact, with the partnership having coverage and Williams having coverage, we didn't see that adding value. So really shifted coverage to be very substantial at the partnership with again the industry leading growth rate for large cap MLPs and taking the coverage down at Williams to a level that we think is appropriate.
Operator: And now we will go to Brad Olsen with TPH.
Brad Olsen – TPH: I would like to focus on the macro and maybe follow on some of the questions that Christine had about the pipe project out of the Northeast. Obviously you guys are in a pretty unique position having multiple large scale projects currently out in the mark for producers in the northeast and when you look at all of the different markets that Transco searches do you have a feel -- is there a specific market where either producers feel that they don't have enough access to or the consumers in that market don't feel as though they have enough access to northeast production growth? Just trying to get a feel for as you fill the pipe with all this gas where is it actually going to head and where is there economically the most pull for that gas?
Alan Armstrong: I would just tell you that the amount of new gas-fired power generation obviously in the southeast is a major issue as that area converts off of coal, if you follow some of the commentary from folks like Southern Company. I think one of their big concerns has been whether there would be adequate infrastructure built out in time, and reliable infrastructure to serve their power generation loads. And so I think this project helps answer some of that frankly. As well, we’re continuing to see obviously a lot it of folks wanting to get to spots where they can deliver to LNG contracts, and by getting all the way to station 65 with this gas, that option becomes available as well. And then, of course, we also have like the large methanol project that Transco has contracted to serve just south of station 65 as well. And as well, all of the southeast from just a general load standpoint continues to grow and so we see that continuing in those regions as well. So many projects like the Dalton Lateral for instance, are projects that need supply. And demonstrate the growing markets, the (indiscernible) expansion to serve Sabal Trail. I will just tell you Transco is winding up being the big high-pressure header that's right in the middle of all the market growth, and people realize that, and they want to be there, not just to serve any one particular market but to have the options of going to where that market growth is. And so it is really a network value, if you will, where you have all the best supplies in the country trying to get in to places where the best marks are and that mutually attracts each other to being connected to that big header.
Brad Olsen – TPH: Even further south of 65 I know you guys have talked about potentially working with Pemex on the deep water projects that they're starting to pursue, but is there an opportunity maybe for Transco even in south Texas, where you have some existing infrastructure to participate in any of the tenders that either Pemex or CFE have out to import Eagle Ford and other gas supplies into northern Mexico?
Alan Armstrong: We have a relatively unique project. I would tell you that we have been working on and we’re not positioned to describe that just yet but we are pretty excited about it. And we think it's a very low-risk way of serving that growth in the market and we’re continuing on a nice trajectory to develop that project. But, yes we do have opportunities and yes we’re pursuing those.
Brad Olsen – TPH: And if we could flip to the ethane side of things, we've recently seen received (indiscernible) for their world-scale cracker and I think that rounds out six or seven crackers which are set to proceed. Interestingly we've seen ethane exports come out of is nowhere and gain quite a bit of steam as well. In light of these recent announcements, how does your view of ethane as feedstock change? I guess more directly, does potential tightening in the ethane market later this decade cause to you rethink what you might use for a feedstock on a second Geismar project, or does it give you pause about a second Geismar world-scale cracker in general?
Alan Armstrong: I would just say that we think there's a lot of ethane available with these growing gas supplies. However, what's not getting invested in actually right now is the infrastructure to be able to recover all that ethane and get it into all these points of consumption and obviously that's a business that we like, and one that we continue to have an eye towards in terms of how we play a critical role in distributing -- recovering and distributing all of that ethane. So I think, it's a very good question and it's at a time like this when the market seems to be awash in ethane, people are unwilling to invest in the infrastructure that it takes to get it recovered and into those markets, but we believe that just like what we are seeing on the gas side now where the demand is on the verge of really starting to grow pretty rapidly. We think the same thing will happen on the ethane side, but it is going to take quite a bit of infrastructure, and we are certainly working hard to plan that. We’re in the process of commissioning our Bayou Ethane project which extends ethane from Mont Belvieu over into Lake Charles area in Louisiana and ultimately connects into our system that gets ethane all the way over to the river, and so that's just an example of how we are positioning ourselves to be a solution to the problem that you describe which is going to eventually catch up with us.
Brad Olsen – TPH: And you mention the ethane pollution. Are there opportunities as we see the ethylene market potentially growing 30% or 40% with all these new crackers and Brownfield projects? Do you see opportunities on the Olefin transportation and storage side as well as on the ethane transportation and store?
John Dearborn: Absolutely we do in that we continue to promote our projects on the Gulf Coast around the transport of both propylene which today will be made from new sources like propane de hydro units, what is now Flynn Hills and down [ph] to new markets as well as some additional propylene splitters that will put new supplies on to that system. So that's one pipeline system that we are promoting. And then the second is what we call our project which is an ethylene pipeline which is intended to connect some of the major players on the ethylene side in order to bring some of the really more about reliability there. But as well give the opportunity to get ethylene into the hub where ethylene will be able to be traded well in that hub in order to be able to do some good price discovery of ethylene which is a service that Williams brought to the market in the last couple of years.
Operator: I will now go to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Some clean-up stuff here, the Canadian PDH sounds like you're close to FID there. Any sort of zip code on the capital involved there? Can you confirm that will be 100% fee based and then the kind of return you would be looking for?
Alan Armstrong: You know, until we take that to the board, Ted, and we've got an outside party involved in there as the customer and so I think until we get all that wrapped up we’re are not -- don't really want to be announcing any of those details just yet. But as you know we've continued to try to work that project in a way that it reduces our commodity exposure in that space is and we think we've found a nice way and a nice partner to accomplish that with.
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Okay. I wonder if you can just talk a little bit, looking out west here the implications of buying the 50% interest in Ruby. Do you think that helps at all your Pacific Connector project or should we really just look to sort of Jordan Coke [ph] going to FID?
Alan Armstrong: Well, I just think it non straits their confidence in the project and certainly they're the ones that have the very best seat at the table there. We certainly have worked alongside them and have our own internal perspective, but I would say anybody that's putting their money where their mouth is something you ought to pay attention to and they certainly have stepped up and done that.
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: And then last one from me is just as you look at the deep water, any thoughts? We have seen some of the majors continue with the activity out there of another Gulfstar, more like the Keathley Canyon project. How is the outlook there?
Rory Miller: The timeline on making deep water infrastructure investments and I guess development of deepwater prospects is pretty long, usually it's a four to six-year cycle to get that started. So current price is not really too instructive about those decisions. There is a lot of what I would call pent up discoveries in the mill, if you will. A lot of discoveries have been made and they're slow going to sanctioning right now and that's predominantly, I think, because producers are waiting on that 20-K technology to be made available. I think the target is maybe sometime in the 2019, 2020 timeframe that the technology and the equipment will be ready. That's slowing things down a little bit more than the price of oil but we do think we’re going to have an opportunity in the next 12 to 24 months to deploy another Gulfstar, and as those project get broken loose we think we will be well-positioned. We haven't lost any interest in that. It's kind of 10 and the flow of the deepwater but most producers are looking out I think six years or so in terms of what the price is going to be at that time.
Operator: And our next question from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.
Craig Shere – Tuohy Brothers: Picking up on Ted's question about Geismar 2, have you all given any more thought with Geismar 1 ramping up over the next couple of months possibly neutralizing the commodity risk there over the next year or two?
Alan Armstrong: Craig, we continue to look at that, and obviously what we’re trading off there is the high margin and the benefit we get from that versus the stability of fee based structure, and as well I would tell you we really would like to do a transaction that pulls all the way through our infrastructure. In other words, takes advantage of the ethane supplies and death that I know length that we’ve, our upstream business, and pulls that all the way to our own infrastructure. And so that would be our preference on how we would do that and provided we could make enough margin in the fee based side to help offset a large portion of that commodity margin. We would do that and so I would just tell you we are always weighing that balance internally, but it is a hard margin, especially given how strong the fundamentals are right now. It is a hard margin to give up, but we do continue to look at that and I would say it would probably come in the way of a fairly large structured transaction for us to get that because it would, as I have mentioned, would it involve trying to get the value chain all the way back through our access.
Craig Shere – Tuohy Brothers: Sounds like that's not anything imminent, maybe more like 2016 or beyond?
Alan Armstrong: It might come with contracting on Geismar 2 perhaps -- and perhaps a portion of that so it could come ahead of that.
Craig Shere – Tuohy Brothers: And picking up on Christine's questioning, with the MLP set to finalize the merger in just the next couple of months, have you had any formal discussions with customers about amending ACMP's cost of service arrangements to dove tail with WPZ's infrastructure in kind of a win-win manner?
Alan Armstrong: I would just say -- to answer your question directly is no, but I would say that we see a lot of opportunity. We've had some very encouraging meetings with the Chesapeake team and really honestly, pretty impressed, frankly, by the attitude that Doug Lawler is bringing to that and kind of a high trust relationship that we’re used to working in and one that we can really drive win-win solutions for each other in. And so while we don't have anything specific there, I would tell you I see a lot of opportunity between our companies to continue to expand our relationship in a way that's beneficial for both parties.
Craig Shere – Tuohy Brothers: And there has been some kind of strange trading between WPZ and ACMP since is you announced your finalized merger agreement. Can you discuss anything that would logically push this past the fourth quarter distribution record date, so that PZ would get the higher February payment versus the combined one?
Alan Armstrong: It's just a typical SEC process so we will file the S-4 within the next couple of weeks, then it's just a question of how quickly we get through the SEC. It could move very quickly or it could be a bit longer. So that's really the wild card. It's just really the SEC process for the S-4. As we indicated in our documents Williams has sufficient votes to ensure that the vote is in favor of the merger and in fact, we have already committed to vote in favor of the merger. So there is no doubt as to the outcome. So it is really just the SEC's S-4 clearance process.
Craig Shere – Tuohy Brothers: Last question, I think you have $275 million of outstanding unpaid insurance claims. Can you kind of give some more color about what the primary questioning is around this and to the degree you don't recover, what you had anticipated? Does the MLP just kind of chock that up to history, or does MB help out in any way?
Alan Armstrong: Craig, we’re vigorously pursuing the claim and we think we’ve a very strong claim. Obviously the insurers would like to pay less, so there's some level of debate. I don't think we want to go into the details, but certainly we’re actively engaged in the process. We and our insurers have now agreed to non-binding mediation in an effort to resolve differences and we’re going to begin that later in the month of November. As to what happens if WPZ falls short, it will just be a shortfall in the collection. It will be kind of a onetime item that I think and that's the way we look at it, really no other action that would be related to that. But again, we’re vigorously pursuing the claim and we will begin the mediation process in late November.
Operator: And now we will go to Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.
Carl Kirst – BMO Capital: Just maybe two quick areas of cleanup, Alan, if I first go back to Appalachian Connector, I'm just sort of curious with some of the competition that you’re seeing there, do you see any potential for either this project to move into -- or to have partners in the structure and similarly, do you expect any erosion or change perhaps in the economics from what you saw in Atlantic Sunrise as far as return on capital?
Alan Armstrong: I would answer the second one first. I think very similar kind of the targets of course a larger portion of this project is Greenfield in terms of the capital amount so we had a less leverage if you will off the existing system. So potentially, depending on the ultimate size potentially could be a little bit lower than what we enjoyed on Atlantic Sunrise just because that was pretty extraordinary, but still very attractive returns on the project. Secondly, I would say that the -- as to the partnership and arrangements there, we think we've got a good project going ahead and while there may be some partners that bring some strategic value to it that we would entertain right now. We would tell you we have a project that we think stands pretty well on its own at this point.
Carl Kirst – BMO Capital: I had just one quick follow-up on that, and I guess I ask this in the sense that all large infrastructure seems to be taking longer than expected to kind of get done these days. And so I'm just curious when you all work backwards from a potential late 2018 (indiscernible), when do you feel like you need to basically have shippers locked up I mean as far as whether you’re getting to the present agreements or following it with a binding open season? When do you kind of have to have that in hand do you think?
Alan Armstrong: I would just tell you we’re in the stage of negotiating those agreements and making great progress on that and obviously the quicker we get them done, the less risk we’ve on the timing. But I would tell you we've got a very sober viewpoint out there these days on what it takes to get these projects built and we've got that built into our perspective. But having said that, we can't spend six months getting the agreements negotiated, so I would say it's more -- a couple months to get this done within our expectations. Again, I think the appetite that we’re seeing, I think that's very doable at this point.
Carl Kirst – BMO Capital: And then last quick question, just maybe turning to Canada, and this is really more on the base off gas and the processing and I think you actually mentioned some of the coker outages at Suncor and it looked like there was maybe been maintenance at Redwater, I think you said (indiscernible). I guess maybe my question is that do you’ve a sense of what the missed opportunity cost was in the quarter from those outages from the lower equity NGLs? I think you mentioned Geismar for instance being $200 million. I didn't know if you had a similar analog for the Canadian side.
John Dearborn: If I could just make a few comments though about how things are going up in Canada. First of all we have invested mightily over the last year in reliability up in Canada so we’re poised to take as much gas as our partner is ready to deliver to us at that facility. In fact, we've made some improvement projects that perhaps might allow it to be higher than our earlier expectations. Secondly, in terms of operational discipline in this last turnaround, we actually got through this turnaround slightly less time than we originally planned. We accomplished a 100% of the tie-ins that we wanted to accomplish during the turnaround and came in slightly under budget. So now that the answer to your question is probably about $20 million in missed opportunity in Canada this quarter. Against what would be operations at full capacity receiving all the gas that we could from our partner.
Operator: Our next question is from Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.
Sharon Lui – Wells Fargo: Just following up on your previous comments, have you tried to quantify some of the commercial opportunities you expect to realize and what type of upside that represents to maybe 2015 guidance for the merged MLP?
Alan Armstrong: The only thing that we've put out there, Sharon obviously, is that the merged MLP of $50 million savings and I would tell you we think that's very achievable at this point. And we really haven't though put a number to the commercial side and I would tell you some of it will be pretty hard to characterize. For instance, if we’re able to pick up volumes and develop a project like Atlantic Connector based on some of those synergies, that's a longer term value proposition but nevertheless valuable. And so we haven't really put any kind of numbers to the commercial side of that yet and as I said it's such a fluid situation in terms of customer responses and so forth, that's going to be pretty hard for us to quantify. But we’re certainly excited what we’re seeing, and Jim Scheel and John Seldenrust, John runs that area for ACMP, are working closely together to capture a lot of those and I think both of them are pretty impressed with the amount of opportunities that we’re seeing.
Sharon Lui – Wells Fargo: And just one last one from me, for the drop down of the remaining Canadian assets is there a specific reason why the drop would occur to WPZ versus the merged entity in 2015?
Don Chappel: Sharon, this could go either way, it's our expectation. We'll likely drop it to WPZ. It will likely happen just prior to the merger but it could happen concurrent with the merger, but it's something that we've got some flexibility on, but it's likely going to be first of the year.
Operator: And we will go to Timm Schneider with ISI Group.
Timm Schneider – ISI Group: Quick one from me, so I think it was two weeks ago or so Sunday night, a report hits Bloomberg, Williams amongst bidders for a competitors Rockies, gathering processing system. Obviously not expecting you guys to comment on that transaction, what I'm interested in is what's your appetite for acquisitions at this point? What are you guys kind of seeing? And then specifically how do you balance that with kind of working through what you already have on your plate and then follow-up on that is how do you guys look at your securities as currency in this environment?
Alan Armstrong: I would just tell you, Timm, as we've said all along, we’re always interested in acquisitions that are write-down or ally in terms of being strategic and in areas that further strengthen our hand, but we’re not interested in just doing (indiscernible) acquisitions that aren't additive to our strategy. And so I would just say we’re going to be very selective, but given the large footprint that we have there is a number of project that would add a lot of synergies. I would even suggest something like QEP. Not surprising to me that somebody assumed we would be the buyer because I would tell you we would be a pretty good buyer for those assets just given the synergies that we’ve in the area. And so we will certainly be keeping our eyes open as to the equity value. I would tell you obviously we've demonstrated we think we’re really undervalued substantially right now, but we think that will correct itself in the not too distant future. So we’re going to be pretty stingy with our equity obviously when it's valued like it is right now but we do have our eyes open and we do have other financing means given the strong step-up in cash flows that we've got coming our way.
Operator: And we will go to Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.
Chris Sighinolfi – Jefferies: Just want to follow-up on some of Carl's questions on Canada. John, curious if you talked about or Alan talked about the Redwater outage, Suncor downtime you gave some color on the impacts of the quarter. Just wondering where we stand right now? Are there any outages of that nature we ought to be thinking about on a go forward that would be sort of profiling over the next 4 or 5 quarters and then as you sort of assessed the operations up there given some of these disruptions do you still feel comfortable about the segment profit target that you had previously given for next year? I think it was kind of 170 to 210 range?
Alan Armstrong: You've asked a lot in that question, so let's take it piece by piece. Looking forward into next year in the fourth quarter, late third quarter – fourth quarter, obviously we've got to finish up the tie-ins for the horizon project which will be coming on-line. So we can expect there will be some outage during that time. We try and minimize the impact of these outages by continuing -- we keep our wells as dry as possible ahead of the outages so that we keep the gas, or the liquids flowing out of the LEP unit up at Fort McMurray for as long as practical. We minimize the impact. So that's I think where we’re there. And then to the second point as to how do we increase, and perhaps I would ask the question a little differently, how do we increase the reliability of the gas flow. We’re spending an enormous amount of effort and time in collaboration with Suncor to help both solve some of their problems which they have some real problems that need to be solved at their plant as well as to obviously assist them in getting more gas to our plant. Until we have multiple sources of gas getting to our plants, multiple sources of liquids, I think we are always going to be beholden to the reliability of our single supplier there. So I guess -- I don't want to give the excuse it's out of our control, because we want to work with Suncor in maximizing our opportunities at this stage but until we have the multiple sources I think we’re going to have the risk of the single source of supply in front of us.
Chris Sighinolfi – Jefferies: I think sticking with Canada for a moment, but shifting to Don, wondering about the pending drop-down of the projects up there given I guess, the fact that they're in-progress opportunities largely. Wondering if you could sort of help us think about the potential multiple we might expect there. Obviously nothing specific but we've seen in-progress opportunities be dropped at book value, some companies talk about sort of flywheel effects that are generated from those in-progress opportunities and sort of expand them. So I'm just wondering your thinking now, the Board's thinking about the Canadian opportunities in light of some of the challenges we've seen up there as of late.
Don Chappel: Chris, what we’re thinking is that the aggregate portfolio of assets, both the project we mentioned as well as a variety of other prospective projects would include includes the Syncrude prospect, the Canadian PDH, Geismar 2 and the Gulf Coast pipelines, they're all held by Williams NGL & Petchem Services, it would be dropped together and we would drop those at about invested capital, so book value if you will and that was part of our I will say negotiations as part of our merger.
Chris Sighinolfi – Jefferies: One more question from me real quickly. You've had some questions obviously in this call and I think, Timm hit on it with acquisitions and what not but, Alan just curious, how do you think about the IG rating, the surplus cash your projecting over the next couple of years? It does appear you have retained a lot of financial flexibility if the execution matches the plan. You know you're slides indicated, you’ve stated on the call. You don’t think you’re being paid for the distribution and growth that you're projecting right now. So I'm just wondering given that, are you likely to accelerate any of those growth projections or is there -- if more head room comes available or would you rather sort of add coverage, keep optionality on the table as you think about potential acquisitions that might come, additional project that might come, any color on that would be helpful in regarding your priorities.
Alan Armstrong: I would just say that we do think we’re not being valued for the growth at either the MLP or at the parent level right now and frankly, I think that's to be understood given the outage at Geismar and some of the risks around that and some of these major projects that we’re bringing on-line. And so I think now as those issues are cured, I think we could see a pretty big step-up on that. So I would just tell you, we’re pretty energized about how our strategy is playing out. We think there is a lot of acquisition opportunities that would be dead in-line with our strategy and continuing to strengthen that. And certainly with the major footprint that we have now with the combination of Access and WPZ, there is just more opportunities out in front of us that we are the right buyer for. So I would tell you, I think we’re in a pretty offensive posture, but I would say two things, tamp that a little bit. One, of course, is that we do need to see our equities valued properly and two, when you've got such a tremendous growth in your cash flows built into your model and you're running accretion analysis, You’ve got a big step to climb there to be accretive against such a terrific growth pattern that we already have. So it's great problem to have when your base business is growing so strong to look at these acquisitions. But at the end of the day we’re very focused on our vision of being the player in this natural gas space on the infrastructure side and we’re going to stay committed to that vision but do it in a financially prudent manner.
Operator: And now we will take our last question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
Jeremy Tonet – JPMorgan: Just one small question follow-up here at the end, I was just wondering if you look back towards the end of the data back and you have segment profit guidance reported to adjusted on slide 103, just looking at the 2015 guidance it seems like there is an item in the northeast GMP of $136 million. And I apologize if I missed it, but could you just provide some color on what the item is?
John Porter: Yes that was an item that we had in the fourth quarter of 2014 that we discussed on our second quarter call that has now been moved into 2015. We haven't given specific details around that but it was an item that we were expecting to come through our GAAP earnings and felt like it should be adjusted out. It's contingent type item.
Operator: This concludes today's question and answer session. Mr. Alan Armstrong at this time I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Alan Armstrong: Great. Thank you very much. Well, as you can see, this growth is right on the verge of here at WPZ. ACMP continues to perform extremely well and the combination of these two great organizations is something to be very excited about. However, as we think about all of this growth, I think one thing I want to recognize to our investor base here is the tremendous amount of toil and effort that goes on by these teams that are bringing these big projects in. It is not an easy job these days to work these projects and do it in a safe manner and there is all kinds of hurdles that are constantly facing these big projects and these teams have stayed with it and done their work in a safe and reliable manner and I just want to say a big thanks because of all these great rewards that we’re able to offer back to our shareholders are really coming through the efforts of our great operating teams and our project management teams. So I want to recognize the great effort that's going on there. So with that, thank you all very much for joining. Appreciate, as always, the great questions and we’re really looking forward to really seeing this major powerhouse really starting to take off. Thank you very much.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Williams and Williams Partners Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John Porter: Thank you Rochelle. Good morning and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our websites, williams.com and williamslp.com. These items include yesterday’s press releases with related schedules and the accompanying analyst packages, the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to you momentarily and an update to our data books, which contain detailed information regarding various aspects of our business. In addition to Alan, we also have the four leaders of our operating areas with us, Jim Scheel leads our Northeastern G&P operating area, Allison Bridges leads our Western operating area, Rory Miller leads our Atlantic Gulf area and John Dearborn leads our NGL & Petchem Services operating area.

In yesterday’s presentation and also in our data books, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we’ve reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials. So with that, I’ll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong: Great. Good morning John and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. Certainly the second quarter was very exciting for Williams as we seized the opportunity to make an important acquisition that moved us closer to fulfilling our vision of being a premier provider of reliable large scale infrastructure that really has become very clear to everybody that this kind of large scale infrastructure is going to be absolutely critical to allow North America to take advantage of its fast natural gas resources. We also rapidly accelerated our earlier stated plans of establishing WMB as a pure-play G&P hold-co and continue to lead the space and dividend growth by very wide margin. At WPZ, we had another strong quarter with operation performance being in line with our expectations and driving a 30% increase in distributable cash flow at WPZ. We also enjoyed great progress in execution on a number of very important projects in the second quarter, a tremendous amount of work going on in the organization on this front and just to name a few and you really only hear about the very largest projects, but a tremendous amount of efforts going on across the organization, but just to name a few Gulfstar, Keathley Canyon, the condensate stabilizer at Oak Grove and Ohio Valley Midstream area, the new ethane line which is being completed in the OVM area and we also started construction finally on the Rockaway Beach Lateral after a very long and drawn out permitting process. So for those of you there in the New York you look at see some of that work going on in fact on the front of our slide you see some picture of that. So that’s going to allow us to bring that project in on schedule as well. So a lot of very big projects that we made tremendous progress on and remain on schedule on some of those major projects. We also saw continued strong demand for our services with two significant new market pull projects on Transco that were fully contracted and I think it’s becoming pretty evident that Transco discontinues to line up these hits and I’ll tell you that’s not slowing down in terms of continued business development opportunities just keep coming at us in that business line. The Marcellus area volumes continued their rapid growth as well with a 31% increase in gathered volumes as compared to last year’s 2Q volumes and we are on track once again to lead the industry on volume growth in the Marcellus this year. Our Geismar E&C efforts were in line with plan and our rebuild was completed last week. Our final efforts on the expansion will be done by the end of next week. So our E&C team, our engineering and construction team is wrapping up and moving out as we now are turning that important solely over to our operations team. Unfortunately and certainly this is something we’re all very disappointed around here with, but unfortunately did find a new concern there at Geismar that is going to require enhancement to our safety systems that we expect to cause about a six to eight week delay in the first sale at that point at Geismar. As I mentioned this is certainly disappointing to us but as difficult as this is, I’ll tell you, I am proud of the fact that our organization will always put a safety of our people first and this is certainly just our organization following those words with action by having the courage to pause and do the right thing in terms of making sure that, that plan is as safe as possible. So even though this is an out of the norm situation here, I know this is such a big issue, I really would like to take you back to the appendix and if you look back on, I believe it is slide 14 in this deck and we’ll move that on our webcast even though it is out of order here. You will see that on slide 14, we show the incredible progress that has been made on the expansion and the rebuild and the pre-commissioning efforts which were all but complete and will be complete at the end of next week in terms of getting all of our systems turned over to operations. So what does that mean, it basically means systems like our steam systems, all of our auxiliary systems and we break those down in to about 62 different systems and as those are mechanically complete, we turn them over to our operations team for them to take control of those facilities. And so we were finalizing some of the release valve study that was required as a result of the event of June 13th, we determined and were frankly a bit surprised but determined that there was another scenario that we needed to be prepared for in the event of a blow down or the event of an error at the plant and the malfunction of the plant. And that assumption that we embedded has required us to do go back and study the press release system and we determine as we did that that we actually had to make some further modification to the relief valve system again certainly a tough decision to do that, but again I think absolutely the right line when it comes putting a safety ahead of anything else in our business. So you can see here in July 31, we are started on that relief valve system and modifications, we had a lot of this, the plant already buttoned up and in many cases lot of the systems were dried out, we haven’t open the system back up now and so that introduces moisture into the system. So when you see that plant dry up, it’s basically backing up on some of the systems that we had already turned over. And so we think the relief valve system modifications will take about seven weeks and in parallel that as we start to complete, button up some of those systems will start to dry out and will start tuning up some of the cracking furnaces there and so that’s the second blue part that you see they are called plant dry out and hydrocarbon introduction. And then finally moving us to a first week in October as we start to get into ethylene production and so one of the things I would like to clear here that is certainly our target. We think that is a very achievable target, but in terms of our financial projections, just given the number of issues we face there we have spread that contingency up and basically we have the range in our financials now just basically starting with that first ethylene production running through the end of the year and so that’s the range of outcomes that we’ve got to built into guidance now. So we are building ourselves some additional contingencies in there beyond what our targeted date is there. So that’s our detail and we’ll be happy to take any questions on that later John Dearborn will be here to help address in that as well. Moving on now to the rest of the presentation and on the Slide seven, it’s really a impressive growth numbers continue to be posted were both WPZ and ACMP and that continues to drive very impressive cash flow growth at Williams and this is especially impressive when you consider that in the second quarter, we only recognize about two months of business interruption coverage there Geismar. And so our fee-based revenues in the quarter continue to steady march up into the right and despite a very mild second quarter in terms of any weather on our pipeline systems, we still continue to move that up about 7% over 2Q of last year on our fee-based revenues and I think also important were well over 80% of our reported net revenues were coming from fee-based services. It also should be understood much of the big capital investments that we’ve been making here really over last two and half, three years, don’t start producing cash flow until the third quarter and fourth quarter of the year as Gulfstar, Keathley Canyon and our OVM or Ohio Valley Midstream investment really began to generate significant cash flow and earnings here in the last half of the year. And then of course ACMP continues, it’s very steady progress up into the right as this group continues to benefit from its very tight focus on growing the gathering the compressions business in the nations very best natural gas basins. So I’m very pleased with the way the business is continuing to expand and we’ve got a really exciting last half of the year in front of it. Now looking at some of these important growth drivers that we continue to focus on and report to our investors. One item of significance been added to this was you will see there at the bottom is the ACMP acquisition and in terms of results, pretty impressive work by our finance and legal teams this last second quarter moving from price agreement with GIP all the way to closure within a matter about five or six weeks. So very impressive work by that team and just continues to shine light on the kind of town we have around here and our commitment to continue to drive shareholder value here at Williams. And so this was, the half year represents a tremendous amount of effort really across the whole organization and with the exception of Geismar we are very pleased with the results on the store card here as we pause here in first part of third quarter. Now there is certainly many E&C projects that are nearly complete and now we are beginning to turn our attention on the next waiver projects that just keep coming, things are very well positioned assets and the competitive advantages that we constantly focus on developing. I’ll tell you that’s a very natural part of the way we run the business here at Williams and a lot of these major large scale projects that we take on and the challenges that we take on really are in support of making sure we maintain strong competitive advantages in our business. So moving onto Slide nine and looking forward here to this next waiver project, we see that this list is long and it just keeps coming. The bulk of the large projects in 2015 come from our Atlantic Gulf region that continue to perform very well, Atlantic Gulf region continues to execute and continues to hit this number on a regular basis. And we certainly are, as we look here at the projects in ‘15, many of these are really in the major projects are expansions of our Transco and our gas pipeline system in the Atlantic Gulf area, projects like Kodiak for instance really are capital led to tie back to an existing facility and we do have continued what we call program capital as we continue to build up northeast GMP but a bulk of our major projects have really in the northeast, a lot of that is getting out of the way this year and we’ve really set ourselves up for a lot of big fundamental growth looking forward beyond 2014 in the northeast. The major projects in 2017 really come on light in the year but our backlog of projects beyond 2017 just keeps building and you really should expect this to continue for some time as we bring the combined strength of both WPZ and ACMP now and bring those resources together and the opportunities that they combination brings really is going to be critical as the nation here tries to get up on a 100 Bcf natural gas market. We think Williams and the combined entity is going to be very much at the forefront of reaching that 100 Bcf today gas market here in the U.S. So moving to Slide 10, I’m kind of looking at the big picture of what this new MLP would be, we are, we couldn’t be more excited about, not only the size, the scale of this MLP, but the very consistent focus on being the player in the natural gas phase and natural gas products and derivatives they are coming out of this big road to natural gas and we think the combination of Williams access just continues to load us towards more and more growth, just some important things to note on here that are very impressive in 2015 and expected EBITDA of about $5 billion and in addition to that continued best in class growth distribution of 10% to 12%, which is really impressive when you consider the scale and what it takes to grow the cash distribution in this business and something of this scale. And so continuing to be able to do that through 2017 and maintain strong coverage really provide an investment vehicle that we think is absolutely unmatched and is going to continue to give us the kind of firepower to continue to expand this business larger and larger. So, couldn’t be more excited about the combination of this business and if you look on slide 11, this really conveys the breadth here that Williams has but it also shows really what ACMP is doing for us in the upstream piece of our business and if you think about the way, we have genuinely grown a lot of our businesses over the year, we basically have linked and levered either the market back into the upstream or we have taken the upstream and the gathering & processing business and move those opportunities downstream certainly nothing is more obvious about how we have done that in recent times, you know many times over the years nothing is more obviously than the way that’s is going for us up in the Susquehanna supply area and the ability that we have generated may large projects off of about brig upstream growing volumes there. So, if you look at that and think about ACMP today on a operated gathering volumes PZ and ACMP are every close to the same number and if you look it on a capacity basis WPZ is larger part of that just because of the legacy large scale assets that we have had out in the Western basins. But nevertheless very impressive position in the gathering space upstream and our ability continue to deliver services and link that to service opportunities for our customers downstream this basically just reloads our set of opportunities in continuing to grow that, I can tell you didn’t feel like we needed a lot of that but nevertheless I have got a lot of confidence in not just the assets but the combination of the people of ACMP and Williams, there is some incredible strengths at ACMP that frankly we are very excited to have hitched to our wagon and a lot we can learn frankly from expanding the upstream gathering business and a great job they have done there and what PZ brings to that of course is the ability to continue to expand opportunities beyond that. So, tremendous strategic fit as well as a great financial for Williams and WPZ. So, moving on to slide 12 here, really couldn’t be more excited about how we are positioned strategically right now and thrilled to see the ACMP piece come along, it further fills our hand out and this scale and the opportunity set that we have and the growth that we have, we think is unmatched. And we have a very fired up organization I can tell you right now, very excited to take on these new opportunities both at the ACMP level and at the Williams level. So, very excited about the quarter, disappointed with Geismar but extremely excited about the second half of this year and the kind of growth we are going to get to witness here in the second half of the year. And with that, I’ll turn it over to questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And first we’ll hear from Christine Cho with Barclays.
Christine Cho – Barclays Capital: Good morning everyone.
Alan Armstrong: Good morning Christine.
Christine Cho – Barclays Capital: Your other fee revenues in the Northeast doubled quarter-over-quarter even though NGL production didn’t change that much. I am assuming that this is the condensate handling that came on during the quarter. When did that come on and how much of the 6,000 barrels per day capacity are you using currently?
Alan Armstrong: Jim can you take that please?
James Scheel: Sure, Christine good to talk to you again. That’s correct, that’s the stabilizer fee revenue and the stabilizer came on, it was 50% of the stabilizer I should say came on you can see we have the first phase of 6,000 barrels a day come on in April of this year.
Christine Cho – Barclays Capital: And that how much of that capacity are you currently using?
James Scheel: We are using about half of that today and that’s growing as additional wells come online. We have got about 73 wells coming online for the balance of the year.
Christine Cho – Barclays Capital: And then if you’re GPM of the gas is 8 or something like that how much of that is condensate is 10% is a fair assumption?
James Scheel: I am not 100% sure on that Christine I had to get back with you but I think that’s pretty close, it is probably in the 8% to 12% but I don’t know exactly that number.
Christine Cho – Barclays Capital: Okay, that’s fine. Also the de-ethanizer getting moved up by a quarter. Did this impact volumes in second quarter at all meaning did anyone have to shut in wells because the gas wouldn’t meet pipeline respect with ethane in it?
James Scheel: No, we haven’t had any of those issues right now although that continues to be concern a Christine. The de-ethanizer had no impact in the second quarter, actually even if it had been online we wouldn’t have had the opportunity to move ethane because of some other downstream issues, we are right now working to commission that asset and it should be up during the third quarter.
Christine Cho – Barclays Capital: Okay, great. And then Alan or Don I think you have told in on a prior call that you guys have – your first refusal came into – it came in energy too JV position but what about on the ACMP side you know there are some partners who are backed by private equity in E&P companies who may or may not want to a minority owner in such assets in the longer term and I would think that they would want to monetize at some point with the combined ACMP/WPZ MLP have any first rates there?
Alan Armstrong: You know I am not sure what the confidentially terms are for ACMP on that issue. So, we’d rather not comment on what their rights are there I would just simply say that we do feel like we are very well positioned to consolidate a lot of those assets in the Utica there I am pretty excited about Blue Racer – what our opportunities to consolidate look like there?
Christine Cho – Barclays Capital: Okay, great. And then while I think its consensus opinion that the first part of the deal of ACMP is accretive I think there is some confusion in the market as to whether or not the second part of the deal adds to that accretion or chips away a little from that accretion is there any clarification you can provide?
Donald Chappel: Christine its Don. Since the merger is currently being negotiated or about to be negotiated between the two partnerships I don’t want to go too far on this. But certainly the way we styled it Williams would take reduced cash flow in the early period and enjoy higher cash flows, higher growth beyond so, likely mildly dilutive initially and then turning around pretty quickly.
Christine Cho – Barclays Capital: Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.
Operator: And we’ll next move to Shneur Gershuni with UBS.
Shneur Gershuni – UBS: Hi, good morning guys.
Alan Armstrong: Good morning.
Shneur Gershuni – UBS: Alan in your prepared remarks you talked about market pull of projects and so forth it seems to have come to fruition during the quarter. I think in your slides you had said that you got about a backlog of 25 billion at WPZ and another 4 billion at Access. Any sense on how large this backlog could potentially grow in terms of order of magnitude, are we talking in the neighborhood of 10% to 20% or are we talking to something significantly higher assuming you are able to commercially negotiate some projects and so forth?
Alan Armstrong: Yeah, you know I think a couple of thoughts on that. One, we may actually see a lot of opportunities that come to us that require less capital so, higher earnings and better return but less capital as we look at opportunities between the two. So I would just say the opportunities may not be measured in capital and will be measured in earnings growth. But I will just tell you that the number of opportunities that just keep coming at us along the Transco system and on the northwest pipeline system as the market continues on the demand side to try to figure out how to take advantage of all this low cost gas and continued confidence in low cost gas is pretty impressive that given what a deficit we had in storage this year and we are sitting in sub 4 gas price really tells you the confidence that the demand side has and the supply capabilities, the long-term supply capabilities of the gas basins. But what that’s developing is a lot major downstream project And so I would tell you, I think a lot of our growth is actually going to come from that and our ability to connect the supplies into those opportunities and of course all of that new gas supply leads in to both natural gas liquids and olefins as well as we produce that gas we got to something with the liquids and find market to those liquid. So, I would tell you rather than the ACMP combination driving a lot of capital increases, I would say it’s slightly going to drive in the northeast, it will drive some higher earnings but perhaps I don’t know that it will reduce our capital but I would say a lot of it would be just higher earnings in here.
Shneur Gershuni – UBS: Great a couple of quick follow ups, we saw some ramps in volumes in the northeast and you didn’t have any change to your 2015 guidance, is it fair to say that the way the northeast acted in the second quarter is exactly the way you wanted it to, it is running according your plan and you would expect to see a significant acceleration in 3Q and 4Q. I was wondering if you can sort of walk us through the ramp as to how we go from 1Q and 2Q of this year as to how we end up with kind of the guidance for 2015 in terms of where you expect the big pick up in ramp acceleration to…?
Alan Armstrong: That’s an excellent question and I’ll tell you I am very excited what we are seeing there in the engagement I’m going to ask Jim Scheel to provide a little more color on that, thank you for asking the question.
James Scheel: Yeah I’ll answer that in a couple of phases. I think we are very excited about the progress we are making in the Susquehanna supply hub or ABA area. We are right on target and actually probably a little bit ahead of where we wanted to be. We have a lot of projects coming online during the third and fourth quarters of this year, they will be on time-on budget. We’re growing those volumes by about 34% versus prior year as we come out of the year and quarter-over-quarter this year we’re up 8%. So obviously we’ve always wanted to do better up there and smash more gas in to the system but we’re right on target with where we want to be. OBM has been a bit of a different story, it’s very consistent with the last analyst day in the last earnings call. You can actually see on page 20 of the book that we’ve lowered our average volumes for the year, that’s primarily due to a number of producers having some challenges at the front end of the year and so we are seeing the way on wells coming online. But we will actually end the year higher, we adjusted the number for the year end at 420 and again as I’d mentioned a bit earlier, we have a number of wells, we have lots of visibility on getting ready to come online. We have 73 wet Marcellus and in addition to that some dry Utica wells that’s not included in that overall number that could actually add to some of the volume but obviously that will be at a bit of a lower rate. Our biggest issues right now as we look into the third quarter are commissioning the assets that will drive some incremental fee revenue, you’ll see our fee revenues increasing and then just seeing when the producers tie those lines in. L&M is on target with where we expect for the most part and will end the year about 25% higher than last year as well. So, although there are challenges in the northeast that we’ve been seeing around OVM on the producer side; the good news is unlike past discussions the assets seem to have the reliability in order to move the gas and we’ll be able to meet our customers’ needs as we go through the third and fourth quarter with the incremental processing options for them.
Shneur Gershuni – UBS: Great one last question if I may. Just if we can turn the Geismar obviously a disappointment that it wasn’t able to start up on time so forth. I was just wondering if you can sort of elaborate a little bit on the safety issues, did it come up in the inspection process and sort of prevent a permit from being issued or is this something that you’ve just decided to do over and above the process in all permits and everything is in place. I was just wondering if you can give us a little bit of color around the safety measures that are being enhanced?
Alan Armstrong: Yeah let me have John Dearborn take that, he’s been right, square in the middle of that.
John Dearborn: And thanks for the question, very insightful question the way you ask it. And to take on the first part of your question as to whether it had something to do with the permits. I would say no not at all it rather to put it into some context for you, the overall – and in the overall plant there were more than 750 pressure safety valves throughout that plant and on a regular basis you go through and you study all the pressure scenarios on these various pieces the equipment and how these valves are expected to control over pressure circumstances and prior to the incident and then of course as a result of the incident we were doing over pressure studies and they were being done in a very prioritized way and a very careful way as well. We have to be very deliberate, very disciplined in how we go about doing this work. And the work, it progressed extremely well, some of the valves just to give you an idea, some of the valves get studied and we said okay the valve is fine and you put the documentation to the file about how the valve has been restudied and no further work was needed. In the prioritization we left several studied valves towards the end of the study and it until early in July as the study was finishing up the team came to learn of a particular scenario that truly required mitigation. So as we came to learn of that, the team considered several strategies that could have potentially worked in the circumstance and determine that the best solution we could have applied was to install several new PSVs and just so you understand the number of several is really about 12 PSVs are being installed and to replace several sections of piping. Now it happens that the full impact of this essentially new work on our schedule is not known until earlier this week and frankly it’s what resulted in this disappointing disclosure today but I just want to reiterate once again that we’re taking this extra precaution here to enhance the safety of our workers and the public and I hope that provides some adequate colors everyone on the phone about this entire issue that we’re grappling with as we move forward toward the safe and sustainable restart the plant.
Shneur Gershuni – UBS: Great that was extremely helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: And we’ll move next to Brian Lasky with Morgan Stanley.
Brian Lasky – Morgan Stanley: Hi good morning. Just kind of following up on Geismar there really quick. I was just wondering if you guys can discuss a little more at length kind of what the drivers of your range is in terms of for first ethylene production and what could possibly delay this further?
John Dearborn: Sure glad to bring some color to that. So let’s reflect again about what happened at the time of the incident, this plant went down in a very unusual and a hard way right. We had to take some unusual precautions and go through certain procedures in order to clean it out. And so certainly there could be some potential risks related to some of the equipment as a result of way it had gone down. Secondarily I would say there’s always a concern that exists around restart of a plant especially when it’s been extended. Now as to whether the systems as designed and as reinstalled work, take for instance rotating equipments, sometimes you have to go in and look at the rotating equipment a second time. Now that’s historically happened to us, from time to time it doesn’t, we don’t know anything today that says we should have an unusual worries on the startup, so I have nothing that I know of at the moment but with an abundance of caution we thought it was appropriate to guide that, that the start-up is not risk free once we are through this next round of installation of pressure safety release valves and that’s the entirety of the story behind the contingency range that we put around that start-up.
Brian Lasky – Morgan Stanley: Got it, and Don I was just wondering if you could just update us on your discussions with the insurance companies and your recovery expectations and kind of once we get into this outer period where you be above your business interruption, insurance, how you are kind of thinking about that and how that’s kind of baked into guidance?
Donald Chappel: Let’s say that now that the plant is substantially complete from a construction standpoint and we’re moving very quickly and toward the start-up most the facts are now very well-known and obviously we’ll continue to update our claim as we move through start-up. We’ve retained some expert consultants, if you will that are doing studies to support our claim. We plan to present those studies and conclusions to the insurers in the fall and we would be hopeful that, that would then start the next round of settlement discussions.
Brian Lasky – Morgan Stanley: And in terms of I think you mentioned previously that you expected to use your ATM kind of in 2014 to be largely at the equity markets and ‘15 at PZ I mean you put out kind of share count applying some meaningful equity issuance in the back half of the year. I just want to make sure that was kind of still your expectation that you do any incremental equity on the ATM this year and you’d be largely out of the markets at PZ next year?
John Dearborn: Brian that in fact is the case again our car financing plans is pretty well unchanged obviously the drop down of the Williams owned assets is another factor and we’re looking to do that ideally post merger in the late ‘14 early ‘15.
Brian Lasky – Morgan Stanley: And then finally just I mean I think Cabot mentioned on their call some infrastructure issues that they were having which impacted their production in the quarter. I was wondering if you guys could just elaborate from your perspective what some of the issues were and kind of how the event resolves going forward?
James Scheel: This is Jim Scheel I’ll comment on that again I listen to the earnings call too and I want to just reiterate, our performance quarter-over-quarter were 8% more than we were previous quarter and first quarter’s 4% more than the year end. So we’ve been continuing to grow volumes obviously, we have to do a fantastic job in coordinating volumes into this system. I think Cabot is probably relating more to the opportunities missed just by some coordination on scheduling gas because actually we were moving more than we have and again as the additional horsepower comes online during the third and fourth quarter this year, we’re going to see a rather rapid ramp up so that we finish the year about 34% more. So again I appreciate the concerns of the shippers but we continue to put some more gas through that system and are only accelerating that as we end the year.
Brian Lasky – Morgan Stanley: And just finally from me, in terms of any update in terms of timing on the ACMP/WPZ negotiations, is there any update from most recent disclosure?
Alan Armstrong: Nothing new I would just tell you, the complex companies are working hard and have got, are very well advised and I think everybody understands the importance of moving ahead with it and with some diligence and that’s exactly what’s going on right now.
Brian Lasky – Morgan Stanley: Thank you gentlemen.
Operator: And next we’ll move on to Abhi Rajnandan with Credit Suisse.
Abhiram Rajendran – Credit Suisse: Hi good morning guys.
Alan Armstrong: Good morning Abhi.
Abhiram Rajendran – Credit Suisse: In your data book outlook for WMB you show a revised outlook at the excess cash flow available you went after the dividend step up which is around 28% for year through 2016. And it sounds like the remaining part of the deal will be may be modestly dilutive upfront and accretive beyond that so I guess how should we think about the current and potentially more excess coverage being brought down overtime once the entire deal is done?
Alan Armstrong: Abhi again yes, we would expect some of that excess coverage to come off because one of the big considerations that Williams is making here is moving the distributions we received really took the ACMP schedule in terms of those ISR. So Williams is making I’d call a concession there to enable the merger and we think that that’s going to drive significant value long-term but certainly with some near term reduction in cash flows. However by ‘17 that really turns around we would expect to have a nice increase in accretion if you will, cash flow accretion on a per share basis. I hope that answers your question.
Abhiram Rajendran – Credit Suisse: Yeah I know, that helps. And then just a couple of other quick ones, at WPZ you have a shortfall this year of about 400 million between the DCF and distribution. So I guess how should we think about how you make this up is this just with capital raises or do you need any sort of support from WMB, any color there would be helpful?
Alan Armstrong: We expect that WPZ’s financing plan is largely intact. I think at midpoint here, we moved the cash flow about $150 million and as well we do have, and anticipate the litigation settlement that we would expect would largely offset that in terms of cash so we think not a lot of change there. Going back to the cash flow, your first question, I would point out that our 2017 to 2019 cash tax guidance is an assumed rate of 14% and we would expect that to come down somewhat as we continue to add to our capital spending, as you can see our capital spending is about $4 billion this year and it declines to 2 billion unchanged by 2016, it’s because what we have in guidance is really sanctioned projects and we have a lot of projects, organic projects that we’re working on, those are added to guidance and those projects are placed in service that will continue to press that cash tax rate down somewhat, so just consider that as building your models. Right now, our run rate seems to be about in the $4 billion range and if you take that 25 billion and divide it by the six years you get about $4 billion a year and that’s pre-ACMP and they have been spending about $1 billion a year. So you can think about that as you think about our cash tax rate and while the rate looks to be fairly low remember that, that’s based on cash distributions received and if you look at it on a percent of pre-tax income which is more conventional, you’ll see the rates quite a bit higher.
Abhiram Rajendran – Credit Suisse: Okay got it that’s helpful and then just last quick one from me. On the Canadian projects, can you talk a little bit about what’s driving the shift back in CapEx and this is at the WMB and Petchem segment level, are these delays in locking down customers or just a slower than expected construction schedule, any color there would be helpful.
Alan Armstrong: Yeah great question and particularly the PDH project is what I assume you’re referring to primarily and the other being the Syncrude and I would just tell you that, given the kind of increases that we are seeing in the Petchem space on engineering and construction side and the kind of demand we’re seeing on labor and we expect to continue to press forward we are working very hard to not get ourselves in a difficult situation relative to schedule and to make sure that we are pushing away from that risk as much as possible in terms of overruns because we do, as we look forward we see a lot of pressure on the skilled labor that it’s going to take the build out this infrastructure and so I would just tell you that we are making sure as we move forward in that we don’t get ourselves in a position where we’re relying upon thinner and thinner resources and lower and lower productivity and so that’s the primary cause.
Abhiram Rajendran – Credit Suisse: Okay got it thanks very much.
Operator: And we’ll move on to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
Theodore Durbin – Goldman Sachs Group Inc: Thanks. Just sticking with sort of Petchem and I guess bigger picture, do you see being in the petrochemical business as a core competence for you or do you think it is maybe distracting you from some of the maybe bigger midstream activities that you have, should we read in6to this PDH, maybe delay something around there, there’s some questions around what constitutes qualifying income I am just wondering if you can just talk about the value chain a bit more?
Alan Armstrong: Yeah sure. We continue to see the petrochem business as not, for William not being in the petrochem business for the sake of being in the petchem business frankly but really as a pull through and the market outlook for these NGL supplies and so certainly I would say it’s a little bit different between Canada and the Geismar facility because in Canada really we pursued that many years ago because mostly that’s a processing business we’re not actually reforming any molecules there that’s being done that the upgrades were simply above extracting that through typical cryogenic processing and then fractionating it just like we do in other sectors of our business. So in Canada I would tell you the competencies if you will are not very different and we have certainly got very strong competitive advantage there. But in both cases, Geismar and as we would move in the PDH, we continue to look at that as an outlook for products in a way for us to continue to provide market access for our customers that otherwise isn’t showing up. So I would tell you that’s how we think about it, and we certainly think about it in terms of being more fee based business. I think it is a very good question that you raised and certainly given the great number of opportunities that we have in front of us that’s always an issue of capital allocation for us. And as part of the reason that as I just answered before, part of the reasons that we’re making sure we don’t get ourselves into a difficult spot there in that piece of business because we do see a lot of pressure in getting that business built out particularly on the PDH facility. So in the end I would just tell you we continue to look at it as a place for us to expand market for us and for our customers I think it’s very nice complement to the ethane link that we’ve had for years and it’s a good place to provide market for our customers. And that’s kind of the extent of it in terms of how we look at it, we don’t look it at as being in the petchem business to be a petchem player.
Theodore Durbin – Goldman Sachs Group Inc: Understood that’s very helpful. If I can just shift back to the Northeast, I am just wondering if you’re seeing any reaction by the producers to some of the gas price volatility and sort of that the price decline that you have seen recently. And especially some of the regional basis issues that clearly people are still have in there. It sounds like the issues have been more sort of physical and tie-in challenges and what not, but is there any sort of bigger reaction from producers from the gas we are seeing in the Northeast.
Alan Armstrong: Yeah, no and to be fair I would say that given the kind of recent push down in price that’s just really just happened here, we’ve had we’ve doubts with it but it’s really just push down here over the last month or so I would say it’s a little bit early to call that frankly, but certainly the activities that we saw in the first half of the year are just now coming to fruition and there has been quite a flurry of activity on the drilling side both in the wet Marcellus to the dry Marcellus up in the North East and now starting with some of the dry Utica in the OVM area. And so in the first half of the year I would tell you that that’s been pretty strong. I think it’s a little bit early to call with this more recent weakness in natural gas if that’s going to slow much of that down. But so far we certainly haven’t seen any signs of that. And I would tell you I think the producers are getting, particularly in their OVM area are getting better and better at understanding what they’ve got there and are more and more excited about it. So we’ll see what happens, but I think it’s a little bit early to say we have seen any kind of reaction at this point.
Theodore Durbin – Goldman Sachs Group Inc: Okay. And then just last one from me on constitution, any update on sort of the regulatory and permitting process there?
Alan Armstrong: Not much to add there. I think we are very pleased with the way the FERC has continued to press forward on that and we are working hard to work with the New York DEC and communicate to them the importance of this infrastructure and the need to deal with the some of the water quality excuse me water crossing permits that the New York DEC has in their hands. So really kind a remains focused on that issue and I would say we’ve made progress but we haven’t solved that problem.
Alan Armstrong: Okay, thanks. That’s it from me.
Operator: And next we move onto Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.
Carl Kirst – BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Thanks good morning everybody. I think I’ve just got two questions left and then now on understanding and appreciating your comments around the Canadian PDH facility and labor inflation like. I think prior we were thinking that maybe this could come to a hit by year end and so just trying to kind of getting a little bit more color on what you were saying earlier. Is this something that we should just kind a think of now as more just on the back burner more of kind of on hold or is that still progressing?
Alan Armstrong: Yeah not at all. There is tremendous amount of work, we have made great progress with the polypropylene take contract if you will that takes a quite a bit of price risk out of it. And I would just say both parties, both us and the party that have the polypropylene take are working diligently to make sure that we’ve got great confidence in our estimates and the work plan it would take constructed in a low risk manner. But I’ll tell you the work is probably at all-time high in terms of making sure that we are very confident of where we stand with the estimate and we do very much expect to conclude and have it pinned down by the end of the year. And so in no way you should consider it’s on the back turn or it’s just us absolutely making sure we de-risk it is as much as possible before we move forward.
Carl Kirst – BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Understood. Appreciate the clarification. And then just last question and maybe this is on Geismar with respect to the pressure scenarios that were studied. Clearly ethylene plants are not like processing plans. So I guess it’s not exactly a cookie-cutter approach here and what I am wondering is, is that to the extent that this plant has been rebuilt or perhaps studied now maybe with all the different scenarios that are out there from the safety standpoint, does this in anyway make Geismar, I hesitate to call it best-in-class because of what we have gone through, but as we kind of look forward from this point today, does that anyway help you distinguish yourself from other plants and then how ultimately does that perhaps help our hinder Geismar 2?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, Carl good question. I would say we certainly are coming out of this much stronger than we went into it both from an operational focus and reliability and we have worked hard to really improve the older plant as well as making sure that those learnings were built into the new plant as well. I would tell you that probably the fact that we’ve got a team that’s been a right in the middle of a major construction project like this that’s also looking at Geismar 2. And so it’s not some distant memory of the lessons learned it’s kind of real and available, puts us in a very knowledgeable position to push forward with Geismar 2 if that’s what we choose to do. So I would say I am very thankful that we’ve got a team that is, and this has been a really tough project if you think about it, if you’re managing this major expansion project in the first place in and around a plant and then have the major explosion that isolates us from being able to complete the plant right in the middle of a project, that’s a project managers worse nightmare. And yet they have hung with it. So I would just say we’ve got a team that’s very schooled on what it takes to be successful as we look forward into Geismar 2 and certainly we all have a lot of confidence in pushing forward as we look to Geismar 2 opportunity.
Carl Kirst – BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Great, appreciate the comments. Thanks guys.
Operator: And next we move onto Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.
Sharon Lui – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Hi good morning.
Alan Armstrong: Good morning Sharon.
Sharon Lui – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: John I guess with regards to the dividend illustration you provided. Those tax rates do you anticipate those cash tax rates to change materially if the ACMP/WPZ transaction occurs?
Alan Armstrong: No Sharon, we do not. So we don’t expect that to change. The distributions will change somewhat so there will be some effect. But we wouldn’t expect any material change in those tax rates as a result of that. I think right now they are driven largely by the placing assets and service. And we are in the middle of appraisal for both accounting and tax purposes. So there will be some adjustment of estimates along the way as we conclude both the accounting and tax appraisals to really key in this process.
Sharon Lui – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay. And then I guess just trying to gauge the potential for the exchange ratio to be renegotiated. Maybe if you could provide some color on some of the key factors, management considers when you determine the proposed exchange ratio?
Alan Armstrong: Sharon we did some extensive modeling and really trying to come to a transaction that we thing was value adding both ACMP and WPZ unit holders for let trying to balance the considerations there. So obviously a lot goes into it, but that really was the design criteria we wanted it to be a transaction that we thought would be beneficial to both partnerships, really trying to strike that balance and that’s really what we put forth in our proposal.
Sharon Lui – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay. And just the last question. I guess given the IRS’s scrutiny on some of the non-core – activities in PLRs. At this juncture, is there any concern regarding the PLR for Geismar?
Alan Armstrong: Not here, not at all.
Sharon Lui – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay, great. Thank you.
Alan Armstrong: You’re welcome.
Operator: And we’ll we move on to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.
Craig Shere – Tuohy Brothers: Good morning guys.
Alan Armstrong: Good morning.
Craig Shere – Tuohy Brothers: So back to Geismar 2 prospects. Any further updates around the markets capacity to provide long-term fixed return contracting versus commodity exposed returns?
Alan Armstrong: Don you want to take that.
Donald Chappel: Yeah. I am glad to take that. Thanks very much. Not much has changed since Analyst Day, so just to reiterate where we are there we’ve got a very warm reception when we put our RFP out to the marketplace and our interest was oversubscribed quite significantly. What we are doing with this particular investment is we’re essentially trading off that commodity margin to the buyer of gasoline to our joint venture partner in exchange for a fee for service opportunity for WPZ in total concert with our strategy. And certainly the markets appetite given recent and current ethylene prices is quite warm to a provider that’s willing to provide on a fee per service basis. So we’re seeing very, very warm reception both on the JV side and on the ethylene purchase side or fee-for-service type arrangements.
Craig Shere – Tuohy Brothers: Great. When do you see that, is that like a 2015 really 2015 period to try to true up some of those negotiations?
Donald Chappel: Yeah, we’re going to work those negotiations through this year and into the early part of the next year I am sure. But I think the bigger emphasis here is very much aligned with Alan’s comments earlier about the PDH unit at the strategic level. So until we’re absolutely that we’ve got the right commercial deals lined up here and until we’re absolutely certain we know how we’re going to execute and derisk the capital project on an investment of this magnitude, we’re going to hesitate to rush our way into a sanction if I could call it that. So we will sanction only when we’re absolutely ready for both commercial and the project side.
Craig Shere – Tuohy Brothers: Got it. And Don if I could return to the insurance recovery question. If I remember when I asked at the Analyst Day the comment was made that debates about recoveries has less to do with debates about what true commodity price should be versus taking best care in not only being safe but also being appropriately efficient and starting up again. Could the fact that you are now delaying start-up comfortably beyond the recovery period basically obviate that issue a little bit and make it to easier to achieve recoveries since you are kind of taking some of the dime on your own accord?
Donald Chappel: Craig good question. Certainly the claim – our claim continues to get somewhat larger because we believe we’ve worked prudently to bring the plant back into service. Obviously insurers who have the money in their pockets argue against that but we think we have a very solid claim, we think that our outside experts will help us present our claim in a way that is compelling and we’re optimistic that we will receive a very substantial additional payments perhaps as early as late third and fourth quarter.
Craig Shere – Tuohy Brothers: Okay. So you think that much of those could be resolved by the time the plant is actually up and running?
Donald Chappel: No I think more likely it’s fourth quarter.
Craig Shere – Tuohy Brothers: Okay.
Donald Chappel: Yes the plant being up and running in the fourth quarter but with the target of October date it could take a bit longer than that is I guess my comment.
Craig Shere – Tuohy Brothers: I got you. And last question kind of a little broad spectrum and big picture. But we’ve got a couple of things going on with potentially a competing NGL line from the northeast to Belvieu maybe looking a little better prospect at the moment and also condensate exports looking more realistic than ever before. There is obviously competitive pressures for new business opportunities from all these types of events across your system I wonder if you all could just comment on any net positives or negatives from these types of events?
Alan Armstrong: Well I guess if you are just asking generally about the competitive environment that we see out there I think we continue to see not see much impact from competition frankly we just have so many opportunities coming at us that, that’s probably why I want to say it’s the least of our worries, it’s certainly low on the list. And really if you think about some of the larger risk to the business it’s more around the macro environment and one thing we do compete for frankly we’ve become very aware obviously we comment for rigs from one basin to the next. And so I think having ACMP alongside gives us a little bit better diversification to that in terms of being exposed on big gas basins. But I would say that really the issue that keeps us focused on getting great market access for our customers and keeps us aligned with them frankly is that we desperately want to see good market access for the basins we’ve invested in and that’s obviously a service we would like to provide as well and providing better market access and better long-term markets for their products and so that’s how we’re continuing to go about that. But I would say on the competitive front that we’ve just got our hands so full with the opportunities that are coming to us and we’re uniquely positioned to win that we’re not having to stretch very far beyond that.
Craig Shere – Tuohy Brothers: Great. I appreciate it.
Alan Armstrong: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question we will hear from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.
Christopher Sighinolfi – Jefferies: Hey guys thanks a lot for taking my question. Don just curious I’d see the guidance for WMB effectively DCF but I don’t think that’s something that you reported along with quarter reports, so I am just curious if you could either for the second quarter sort of provide on the same schedule of how you would guide it. What the DCF or WMB entity was and is that something that on a go forward you are plan to report as part of the financial.
Donald Chappel: Chris great question. We have not done that yet but we certainly expect to, so you can look for that next quarter.
Christopher Sighinolfi – Jefferies: And any broad framework as to what it might have been for the quarter?
Donald Chappel: I don’t have that number off hand and I don’t know if John has it but we can get it to you or we could post it on our website.
Christopher Sighinolfi – Jefferies: Okay, great. That would be helpful. Thanks guys.
Donald Chappel: I’ll just comment here again we’re going through a transition here with ACMP and that our acquisition of the additional interest will know cause us to consolidated ACMP beginning in the third quarter which will create some differences in reporting. Obviously we’ve done reporting on equity basis will be fully consolidated, we will be looking to gain significant gain in the third quarter to revalue our initial investment in ACMP, we will be looking some substantial and tangible assets and we will have some additional depreciation, amortization related to those assets as well. So just kind of a heads up and look forward to quite a bit different presentation you still get to the same bottom-line here in terms of cash flow but from a balance sheet than earning standpoint there will be some changes in the basis of presentation.
Christopher Sighinolfi – Jefferies: Okay. Great, thanks Don.
Donald Chappel: Welcome.
Operator: And our last question today will come from Bradley Olsen with TPH.
Bradley Olsen – Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for fitting me in I know we’re running a little bit late, so I really only got one question. Now that you’ve closed the ACMP general partner acquisition, can you comment on any ongoing efforts to retain key personnel from Access and kind of broadly speaking how successful those efforts have been?
Alan Armstrong: Sure. That’s certainly something we very much value that organization and their capabilities and that was high on our list of things to accomplish. And so we did move swiftly and aggressively to do so and I think we’re with comfortable with where we’re right now on that front. And so what a great work by our teams here at Williams and the team at Access to really address where any of those issues might be and take care of them swiftly. So, I’d say we feel very good about where we stand today and I am you know particularly proud of both the organization coming together and work that so quickly.
Bradley Olsen – Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.: Okay, great. So, broadly speaking I guess it’s fair to say that in the Utica and the northeast where Access is maybe most their capital is being deployed that he team is kind of largely in fact for a post acquisition?
Alan Armstrong: That is correct.
Bradley Olsen – Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.: Great, thanks guys.
Operator: And will conclude today’s question and answer session I would like to turn the call back to Alan Armstrong for any additional or closing remarks.
Alan Armstrong: Great, thank you. Thank you for all the great questions. As you can see, we are very excited about the future we have got in front of us and this team as you know I think just continues to generate momentum towards this vision that we have of really being de-premier player in this natural gas super cycle and very excited about the opportunities that keep coming at us and we keep executing on to accomplish that and we look forward to reporting to you in the third quarter with great continued progress and certainly at the balance of the year. Thanks for joining us today.
Operator: And that will conclude today’s call. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone. Welcome to today's Williams and Williams Partners First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John Porter: Thanks, Melanie. Good morning, and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our websites, williams.com and williamslp.com. These items include yesterday's press releases with related schedules and the accompanying analyst packages, the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily and an update to our data books, which contain detailed information regarding various aspects of our business. In addition to Alan this morning, we also have the 4 leaders of our operating areas with us: Jim Scheel leads our Northeastern G&P operating area; Allison Bridges leads our Western operating area, Rory Miller leads the Atlantic Gulf area; and John Dearborn leads our NGL & Petchem Services operating area; Additionally, our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to any questions. In yesterday's presentation and also in our data books, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan S. Armstrong: Great. Thanks, John, and good morning to everybody. Thank you for joining us. Certainly excited to be reporting another great quarter and really on all key measures, but before we dig in to the quarterly results, I want to remind you that we remain very committed to our natural gas focus strategy and we continue to have -- and the strategy really continues to have us right in the middle of some great opportunities, and really, we couldn't be more excited about the way we're seeing the tailwinds build for the opportunities that we've positioned ourselves for. This has certainly been a wave that we've been seeing building for quite some time, and we think we've got ourselves in the perfect position to catch this wave. And certainly, as we see a lot of our major projects start to come on here in the last half of this year and really, for many years to come, we just got a tremendous wave of great projects that we've been working so hard on to get out in front of. So we certainly see it -- the wave building here in the first quarter and through our guidance period and then well beyond, and we look forward to talking about that well beyond certainly at our upcoming Analyst Day. So we are also well positioned to return this value to our shareholders for many years to come with our industry-leading dividend at WMB and as well, our solid and very visible distribution growth at WPZ. So today, we'll talk about the key measures for our first quarter results. We'll talk about the continued project execution and development that we've got ongoing, discuss the drivers for our '14 and '15 -- 2014 and 2015 guidance range. And I'll provide a little bit of color on Bluegrass, the current situation, which has improved for us dramatically at Opal, and then I'll briefly touch on our future growth. So as I did say, though, a lot of that future growth and a lot of opportunity to really dig into at our upcoming Analyst Day. So getting in here to the first quarter and looking at our very strong first quarter operating results. I think the real big keys for this quarter from my perspective is, one, first of all we're continuing to see our fee-based revenues drive. And so we saw a 9% increase over the prior year's quarter, and we continue see strength on that. We certainly had a tough winter, but I will tell you that our teams did a great job of driving reliable services and certainly, we had some production outages upstream of our systems, but for the most part, our teams were able to keep our systems up and running through -- and available through some very difficult winter time. So I want to commend our teams who really had some great focus on that this year and did an extraordinary job on that. Also, our 17% growth in DCF, which is really driven by the $63 million increase in the fee-based revenue growth and as well, the $8 million lower maintenance CapEx. And of course, that lower maintenance CapEx was really driven as well by a pretty harsh winter that made it hard for us to get out and get some of the work that we would have expected to get done in the first quarter done. You will see -- obviously, you'll see that those costs continue to build -- on the maintenance capital side will build here in the second quarter as things thaw out and we're able to get in to get a lot of that work done. So bottom line, great quarter, great start to the year with many large catalysts for growth ahead of us in the last half of '14 and certainly beyond '14. Moving on to the growth that we expect through our guidance period. This is something we're really excited about, greater than 50% growth in our DCF from 2013 to 2015. And of course, that really is on the backs of all of these big projects that we've been working so hard on and investing so much capital into. And you'll see a lot of that growth is going to be driven by about a $900 million increase in our fee-based revenues, comparing '13 to '15. And as well, though, I think something that's really impressive on this front. As we look at our cost structure, really, a pretty small increase in our cash operating expenses relative to the size of this growth because a lot of this growth is already built out in terms of our assets being well positioned in the Northeast and as well they're along a lot of our existing right of ways and just additive to our existing lines of business. So our increased cash cost is really not that high. So we see a nice increase in our margin over the period as well. For 2014, some of the drivers, they certainly remain the same. Certainly, we're very focused on the June restart at Geismar and also the successful recovery of our BI insurance proceeds, and those 2 things obviously go together, and so we continue to be very focused on that -- getting that done. And I would say on that front, John Dearborn is here to address more of that, but we're certainly still within the window that we've been describing and we'll be looking forward to starting probably in the last half of June. And I'll remind you, a startup isn't a simple push of the button, and we are starting to return systems, various auxiliary systems to -- into service as we speak. But again, a lot of work left to be able to get hydrocarbons into the facility and cracked. We're seeing a planned ramp-up in the drilling in the Northeast G&P area. We've got great tailwinds building behind this area, and certainly, the strong gas prices are a boost to that. And so we're pretty excited about how we're positioned there, but we do have a lot of growth in the plan, and Jim Scheel is here to address that. Finally, our commodity prices. We certainly have got a clear explanation of what we're at risk to there on our commodity prices. And I would tell you, the thing I've probably got my eye on the most, relative to our plan today, is higher gas prices, which, of course, would impact our processing margins in the short term. I think in the long term, that's a very strong positive force because it's going to continue to drive volumes, not just in the Northeast, but it'll drive volumes in the West as well. So I think that while we may see some short-term impact against our processing margin if we get above that average that we've got stated, I think we're pretty excited to see that because it's really going to drive the kind of growth in our basins and drive our volumes higher. Finally, ethylene prices are certainly an obvious driver, but nice to see the very significant improvement we've seen here in the last couple of weeks. And I'll tell you that John Dearborn and his team have done a pretty good job of calling that. And so we're excited to bring Geismar back up, right into running when there's a great need for those ethylene -- particularly around the Mississippi River front. In 2015, we get a big boost from all of the big 2014 projects being on for a full year. So you'll note, many of our big projects are coming on in the last half of year. So in '15, we get a full year of that. And then another round of fully contracted projects that come online in 2015, as Transco continues to connect these tremendous demands for the Marcellus supply into these markets that are rapidly expanding as well. So the great capital investment opportunities continue to be a big opportunity and certainly are going to drive a great cash flow growth. But I think looking to the next slide, an even more important change to WPZ really is the fact that because we've been investing using -- been funding so much of this growth on the equity side, now, we're going to be able to rebalance to the debt side as these big projects come online. And so as you can see here on this slide, titled growth plans, required minimum of WPZ equity and no WMB equity, that is really powerful for the whole story because, again, very limited needs for capital in the foreseeable future on WPZ because of all the equity we've issued, positioning ourselves over the last couple of years. And so for '14, all we're seeing is a little bit of entrance into the ATM space on the equity side and then no equity planned for 2015 at WPZ. So a great reward coming back to our equity side of our balance sheet. Moving onto the next slide here. Relatively modest growth in the WPZ CapEx. This is driven by the recently announced 1.2 Bcf a day contract to serve Cheniere Sabine Pass LNG facility. We're very excited to capture that business, and a very nice piece of business for us because a pretty limited capital for the size of the market that we're capturing there. And that's a very long term, well-secured contract, so we're very excited about that. And then as you can see in WMB, a fairly significant reduction in capital driven by us pulling Bluegrass from our capital plans at this point. So we certainly continue to believe the Bluegrass pipeline is a great project. We certainly think it's the best long-term solution in the marketplace for getting all these growing NGLs from the Northeast, from both the Utica and the Marcellus, into the Gulf Coast. But however, we're not going to stick our necks out for the sake of the industry on that. We've got great projects in our wheelhouse and a lot of tremendous opportunity. They just put us in a very envious position of not having to stretch for that project. And so we certainly hope that Bluegrass or something like it gets built for the sake of the space, but that's really going to be up to the shippers and producers to determine if they want to support a project like that. So we remain ready and able to push ahead on that project but are plenty happy with all the great long-term contracted business we're getting in the other sectors of our business. Moving on to looking at few of the milestones that -- and the challenges here among executing large-scale, value-creating projects here on Slide 6. And really, this is really just a highlight, a few of the milestones and challenges that we are tackling this year. And this slide really is just the top of the wave of all the growth that we're executing on this year. On the next slide, you'll see some of the bigger projects moving forward. So a few things I want to highlight, though, here. First of all, on Transco, boy, what a great position we continue to enjoy on Transco. And it's not just moving the Marcellus and the Utica supplies out of the Northeast. It's really being driven, even in a larger scale, by market growth on our system. And so just here in the past last couple of weeks, we've announced major progress on 1.9 Bcf a day of new markets just in the Southeast. So that doesn't include a lot of the market expansions we're seeing that go with Atlantic Sunrise, and with Rockaway and Virginia Southside. This is just the Southeast markets proper, so 1.9 Bcf a day. And in fact, we really are going to be working to make sure we keep the supplies delivering to these projects, like the Dalton Lateral, the Gulf Trace project that we've mentioned a while ago and as well, the Mobile Bay South III, which adds about $325 million a day to meeting some critical gas generation loads in the Southeast. On Gulfstar, I just want to really give a big shout-out to our team on the E&C side on this one. They really pulled it together with some great designs, some great plannings on the Gulfstar operations to get that spar set. We got that spar set in an offshore window of about 4 weeks and that is, according to the experts we deal with out there that are in the business of setting a lot of this, a record for getting in and out of the major offshore campaign there. So that does not come with luck. That comes with great planning, and I'm just very proud of our team and the way they executed on that. We're also very excited because we think this is going to be a huge success for Hess and Chevron on their Tubular Bells prospect, and we think with that kind of success comes more. And we think is going to be a great project for them as they look back and look at the project returns they're going to gain out of this. But it also helps other customers in the area, like Nobel, and we're helping them deliver Gunflint, an extremely attractive schedule and returns for that project for them as well. And so this is exactly what we're hoping to do is to help create great value for both our customers and for our shareholders at the same time, and Gulfstar is a great example for that. Regarding several of the incidents that we've had lately. So first of all, our Opal gas processing facility. And as you'll notice, we did bring back 2 of those trains back overnight and we are -- that we -- we'd shut those down last week following the fire at the facility. Those facilities weren't damaged in any way, but just as an abundance of caution, we had shut that down, make sure we inspected everything and make sure we were safe before we came back into service out there. We have 2 other trains that also were not damaged in the fire and that is trains 4 and trains 5. And with those 4 trains on, we have adequate capacity to serve all of our existing business out there. So we'll be working hard to get Trains 4 and 5 back on, but we're going to make sure that we do it safe first, and that's what we're focused on right now. So I think regarding these incidents, Williams, we've always been very focused on being safe and being reliable. And certainly, this has come as a big surprise to our organization. I can tell you this has my full attention and the attention of our board as well. We're conducting very thorough investigations into each incident and see -- determine if there's any common or root cause that's common to these incidents. And I'll tell you one thing that is common, which is a bit surprising perhaps is that these historically have been some of our safest facilities when you look at typical industry standards for safety. And certainly have been -- had gotten high marks from regulators previously, kind of across-the-board. So anyway, that's the one thing that's common, but we're looking hard to determine what other contributing factors may be out there and to make sure what we're doing as an enterprise, to make sure that we're doing our business in as safe a manner as possible. Not just for our own benefit, but -- and our employees' benefit, but to the industry's benefit as well. So you'll expect that -- you should expect to hear a little more on that on our safety performance at the upcoming Analyst Day as well. And then one final note on this slide, I just like to commend the team at ACMP and Access Midstream, continue to drive great performance for us, and that is certainly continuing to drive our growth in '14 and beyond. Looking to slide -- to the next slide here, certainly a very large increase in our projects and just tremendous backlog that we're building here. A couple of things you can pull off of this slide. First of all, you'll see a line drawn in between our WMB projects -- or sorry, at the top, our WPZ projects, and then we draw line toward the WMB projects. And you can see, we continue to develop a pretty significant backlog of drop-down opportunities for WPZ at the WMB level. And so that should -- certainly should not be missed. And as well, I will tell you, this is really just a result. This long backlog of great contracted projects is really the fruits of sticking to our strategy and being very focused around catching this wave of natural gas market growth, both on the supply and the demand side. Our -- we think by far, we have the best visible contracted growth and it's certainly well beyond any of the other large-cap midstream players, including Kinder, Enterprise or Energy Transfer. And much of this growth is driven off of our very well-positioned assets and the kind of investments we've made over the last several years, gaining our position that we have today. Our strategy, we think, is very much in line with our customers and the -- their access to markets, and that's driving a lot of our benefit as well. And then we remain very, very focused on connecting the very best supplies in North America to the very best markets, both for natural gas and for the natural gas derivatives that are coming, because those are obviously low cost into the markets they serve as well. So a very attractive set of backlog here. And I'll tell you, this continues to grow and it really just continues to present opportunities for us to allocate capital to the very best projects. Moving to the final slide here. Certainly going to continue right along our strategy, and this great line of sight that we have to the major growth. We continue to contribute beyond guidance in terms of new projects and new growth. And we really look forward to talking to you about that at our Analyst Day. And finally, I'll just say, we're focused on the business that's going to be there for the long haul. We're not just focused on the opportunity du jour. We're really focused on where we can gain a competitive advantage and reward our shareholders not just in the short term, but a great focus on sustainable investments that are supported by long-term market trends and competitive advantages. And so we think that will continue to generate opportunity for not just years but decades, given the kind of position that we're staking out in the space, and we're very excited about what that means for our shareholders, long-term. And so with that, I'll turn it over for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go to Abhi Rajendran with Crédit Suisse.
Abhiram Rajendran - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just a couple of quick questions. First, on Northeast G&P. So your segment profit in 1Q was $12 million, but you also maintained your full year guidance of $195 million, which suggests a pretty meaningful ramp up. So could you maybe just talk a little bit about some of the puts and takes driving this? And also what some of the main risks may be to this ramp?
James E. Scheel: Hi, this is Jim Scheel. Thanks for the question, Abhi. As we looked at this winter, this has been one of the worst winters we've had in the Northeast, and I know over the course of the last few meetings about the reliability of the OVM system in particular, there have been some challenges with that. Those, we didn't face this year. And so volume challenges that we had were more on the producer side versus the asset side that we're operating. So we're very excited about having a reliable system ready to move gas, especially in this market of ever-increasing prices for our customers. We see a rather rapid ramp-up of volume over the course of this year. Obviously, we saw a 2% growth between the fourth quarter and the first quarter. But I want to remind you, Abhi, that during the fourth quarter of last year, we had some incremental volumes coming into OVM due to the Natrium fire. Those did not materialize or weren't in there during the first quarter of this year and we still saw an increase. As we move through the course of the year, I would expect our volumes to be slightly under perhaps what we've shown on our spreadsheets as the $335 million average, but I want to emphasize, we'll probably end the year with a much -- with above the $400 million that we're showing. So I'm excited about the assets' ability to move the volumes, to reach those goals. One of the key risks that we may need to look at is related to the Chevron well pad fire and how they react to that with bringing volumes online later in the year.
Donald R. Chappel: This is Don Chappel. Just to add to Jim's comments, I'd also just remind you that, again, we're bringing a number of processing and frac facilities online during the year. And even on the volumes -- on the growing volumes, those will provide additional fees. So we'll not just get the volume growth, but we'll get additional fees for additional servicing.
James E. Scheel: To add to that, that's a great point, Don, is we'll be bringing on a number of facilities around the OVM very quickly. We've -- we're already starting the pre-commissioning of these assets that include the stabilizer. That'll provide a much larger netback for our producers around their -- around their stabilized condensates. The deethanizer, I want to add, that's going to be a great asset for our customers. Again, we've had some restrictions in the ability to get product into the interstate pipelines because of ethane content over the course of the last couple of months. With the deethanizer online, that will no longer be an issue. It will allow basically unfettered flow out of the assets into the interstates. And then as we bring on additional capacity on the West Side of the system with the 24-inch line coming in, we're excited about the ability to fill up our cryos and continue the execution of building more cryos at the Oak Grove facilities as we move forward.
Abhiram Rajendran - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, great. And then just shifting gears a little bit, just a broader question on maintenance spending. So this appears to be trending lower over the coming years despite kind of more projects being put into place, but we've also seen some of the operational problems that you referenced. So I guess, how should we think about all of this? Do you need to spend more going forward? Or efficiencies making up for it? Any color here would be very helpful.
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes, sure, Abhi. I would just tell you that if you look over time, we've been at the -- I'm not sure if it's good or bad, but we've been in the lead in having more maintenance capital as a percentage of our EBITDA if you look back over the last 4 years or so, and that is really just driven by our focus on making absolutely sure that we're spending dollars wherever we can to improve safety and reliability on our systems. We'll continue to do that. I would just tell you that we got a lot of work out of the way, a lot of big, expensive work done out of the way in terms of -- in 2012, and that's for a number of reasons, some regulatory required, but as we inspected our lines, we went to the areas where we thought we would have the worst conditions on our systems, and as we've moved off of that group, obviously, we get to the newer and newer systems and the systems with less potential anomalies in it. And so our cost per mile of inspected pipe is coming down dramatically on us because we're getting into the better and better pipes. So we saw kind of a big run up there in '11 to '12, driven by things like the Clean Air Act and some pipeline inspection rules. And that was really kind of driving that. So not telling you that you should expect that to continue to go lower because we don't have that built into our plan. But so far, just the things that we've been hitting lately as we inspect our pipes, we've had less repairs required. So we basically have to forecast what we do expect to find with our in-line inspection tools. And our pipeline inspections, we basically have to estimate how much of that we'll have to repair, and that's been coming down over time, just again, because we're into the better -- some of our better-conditioned pipe.
Abhiram Rajendran - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, got it. And then one last quick one, if I may. So I guess one of the emerging debates in the industry is the viability of the export market for ethane, and you guys are in a unique position to kind of evaluate this. So could you maybe just your thoughts on this in terms of where the supply-demand balance is headed longer term in your view? How do you know -- how big of a market you think this could be? Any color there would be great.
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes, Abhi. I'm going to ask John Dearborn. He is quite the student of that issue. And I'm going to ask him to offer his thoughts on that.
John R. Dearborn: Yes. Hi, Abhi. Thanks very much. It is an interesting idea. It think I'm a bit schizophrenic on the idea of this, so let's talk about both sides. From one perspective, you'd really like to see some better price signals out there on ethane so the necessary infrastructure gets built and you get supply reliability to the industry, to the petrochemical industry, which, of course, we're a participant of, but of course, that could mean ethane prices going up. So moving some ethane offshore I think begins to increase some of the demand, which perhaps begins to create a better balance there so that we do get the infrastructure that provides the supply reliability, which then assures on the demand side that people continue to invest capital. On a very positive note, though, that -- and I can't speak to the project that was recently announced. But on a very positive note to projects like this, I think there's also an opportunity because there are some shortages out there in the world for ethylene that we could export some ethylene from some of these ethane facilities. And I think that bodes well for the ethylene balance in North America, which would be a very positive dynamic for us with our investment at Geismar today. So I see a fair bit of positive there. Exactly how big the market is going to be for ethane export, that's a difficult challenge, a difficult question to answer right now. But I do see positive dynamics on the -- potentially on the ethylene site.
Operator: We'll go next to Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Just a maybe a micro and a macro question. First, on the micro side with respect to Geismar. And Don, perhaps this is for you. With -- if you could just give us an update on when you see the next tranche of insurance recoveries coming? And I guess, perhaps an associated question is to the extent that what was in the first quarter adjusted EPS was a relatively large healthy number for Geismar, given that amount, do you see business interruption actually being sustained through the outage period? Or are we going to see a little bit of a gap between that ending and the plant coming back online?
Donald R. Chappel: Good morning, Carl. In terms of the next tranche of cash, I would expect we'll see some cash in the second quarter. We've made an application with the insurers for the next period of loss and it's going through their process. So I would expect we'll see some cash in the second quarter. I think we've disclosed that our business interruption insurance combined with our property damage insurance would substantially offset the down time. We think that's still the case. Exactly what that is will be dependent on the Geismar -- I'll call them pro forma margins, had Geismar has been up and running, and as well as our negotiations with the insurance companies. But I don't think anything has really changed. I think we're about where we were the last time we talked.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Fair enough. And then maybe macro question for Alan. And this might perhaps start getting into 2016 thoughts, but I just wanted to get a little bit more color on the ramifications perhaps of not doing Bluegrass. In the sense of do you think that for instance what had happened with Atlantic Sunrise, where you had to see that train hitting the market before people were willing to sign onto long-term contracts. Without Bluegrass, do see perhaps the industry needing to get hit first before we will see longer-term contracts? But ultimately, I'm trying to kind of get to are you more nervous than before perhaps of 2016 drilling activity? I know that's kind of an open-ended question, but any additional color there would help.
Alan S. Armstrong: Carl, great questions, as always. I would just tell you that, certainly, I think that there's a lot of people kind of counting on somebody else solving the problem as it relates to Bluegrass. And frankly, we're not going to be the ones to do that for the whole industry without adequate contractual support. And -- but yet, we still believe that something needs to get done. We're very interested in seeing the very best project available to the market come forward and get subscribed, and whether it's Bluegrass or whether it's a combination of other projects, we're not all that jealous of the opportunity, frankly, just because we have so many other great investment opportunities, and very well contracted opportunities. But we certainly think that something -- a solution does need to get resolved. Used an interesting term there to say that the train that we would have to hit out here. And I would just tell you that, that is going to be issue is people are going to understand in the not-too-distant future that railing all of this product out of the area is just not going to be a sustainable solution. But I think that's kind of what's got the market thinking it can continue to ignore the longer-term issue at this point. So we're going to remain very engaged in the subject for both our own project and for other potential projects that might come along. And we'll certainly stand by, ready with Bluegrass for the industry, if it becomes adequately supported by contract. You are correct. I do see this a little bit like Atlantic Access, where the market just wasn't quite ready for it and just didn't feel the pain quite enough yet. And I do think that as we get into this summer and into next winter, when a lot of this new production and these -- starts to ramp up. As for our forecast, our forecast that we see through Access and our forecast that we see through Blue Racer, we see a lot of liquids coming into the market and we're certainly hopeful that we can get a project supported that will not deter drilling in 2016 because this is some tremendous resource out here. And we're going to have to work as an industry to come up with the right market access, and we certainly look forward to being a part of that.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Great. And then just to sort of paraphrase back, though. You're thinking that with the supply models that you all are seeing, that we could in fact see that pain as early as next winter?
Alan S. Armstrong: I'd -- yes, if you look at the ramp-up in volumes that we're expecting, I think we will see some pretty big improvement in volumes.
Operator: We'll go next to Christine Cho with Barclays.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I noticed last quarter that your ownership in Caiman Energy II had moved higher, and this quarter's data book confirmed an incremental 11%, it looked. Can you talk about who sold and was management included? Also, can you discuss how the exit plans of the private equity guys work? Do you have the right of first refusal and then it goes to Dominion and then any third parties?
Donald R. Chappel: Christine, this is Don Chappel. We had an option in our Caiman II deal to increase our ownership by funding a proportion of the amount of the capital investments. So we chose to act. We had a good look at the -- how the business was developing. We liked what we saw, so we exercised our option to invest a greater amount than our partners and increase our ownership accordingly. So we did that. In terms of the exit, we have a right of first offer on the sale, so we'll see what the sellers choose to do.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, great. We noticed some of the majors receiving permits in Marshall and Wetzel Counties in first quarter, the very end of fourth quarter. But I was unable to tell if they was Utica or Marcellus. Can you provide any insight into any updates on their plans to develop the acreage? Also, one of the majors also had an impressive well in Utica in Marshall County. Can you talk about what that may mean for you on a near-term and longer-term basis if the play is as great as IP rates could suggest?
James E. Scheel: Sure. This is Jim Scheel. I'll let the majors speak for themselves as far as any specifics related to their forecasts. But I will say, generically, we've had a number of folks in our offices talking about the additional drilling specifically around the Utica dry. I would say there's an upside opportunity for us at OVM to be gathering some of that Utica dry gas into our system, gathering that for them. We have some extra capacity at the plants today, so that wouldn't impact our liquids volumes to provide us with some near-term additional opportunity. Right now that's not baked into our plans, but I think what you'll see is, as folks are delineating that dry side, you'll see more and more permits issued, so they get a better feel for what they have in that particular area.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then I noticed you've started to kind of put Pacific Connector in your slides. It's looking like the probability of Jordan Cove, its moving forward, is getting higher. And something that I thought was interesting was that we've seen some pipeline projects for other LNG facilities contingent on the LNG projects receiving FERC approval and not necessarily FID. For you, can you discuss a little bit what has to happen for you guys for it to move out from under the potential project umbrella and into development?
Allison G. Bridges: Yes, certainly. This is Allison Bridges. Yes, we are very excited for all of the progress that we are seeing on Jordan Cove and Pacific Connector. We have nonbinding agreements with shippers, so that would really exceed the total capacity. Before we would be ready to, I guess, move to approval for that project, we will be looking to turn those nonbinding agreements into binding agreements. We are hopeful that we will get the FERC certificate, perhaps by the end of this year or early next year. So that is another major milestone. I will say, with respect to the FERC certificate, the route that we have on Pacific Connector was actually previously approved by FERC, so we think it's just a matter of timing on that.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Well, I wasn't actually talking about FERC approval for the pipeline. I was talking about the FERC approval for the LNG project. But it sounds like, for you, it's just -- it has nothing to do with the LNG projects you're seeing, FERC or FID. It's, the customers just have to contract with you.
Allison G. Bridges: No. I mean, we certainly are working jointly and expect the same FERC approval timing and customer commitments for both Jordan Cove and Pacific Connector.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then last question for me, the Gulf Trace project, is that like just Zone 3 max rates? Is that how we should think about that?
Alan S. Armstrong: Rory, you want to take that please?
Rory Lee Miller: Yes. This is -- Christine, this is Rory Miller. That project is a -- it's a negotiated rate. It will eventually be rolled in, and so it's a little bit lower than what the postage stamp rate would be, and therefore, it's required to be rolled in.
Operator: We'll hear next from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just wanted to talk about use of cash a bit at WMB now that you've canceled Bluegrass. How should we think about the disposition there, whether it's the path of the dividends? Maybe it's M&A or obviously, you do have a big backlog of projects that you're developing potentially up at WMB. Can you talk us through that?
Donald R. Chappel: Ted, this is Don. Yes, one, we do have -- obviously, we have dividend, but in terms of the excess cash flow at Williams, beyond the 20% annual dividend increase that we've guided to, we do have some projects that are in development that we've highlighted here. And that cash is earmarked for those projects. Beyond that, we'll have a high-class problem of choosing whether or not we have any additional projects or if we just roll that cash into an even greater dividend. So we're moving more and more to a, call it, pure-play HoldCo model. And as WPZ financial capacity grows, we would expect more of the organic growth to be funded at WPZ and less so at Williams. And again, so moving more and more the a GP HoldCo, where Williams can put all -- substantially all of our excess cash flow into the business.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then if I can ask about Geismar 2, can you just give us some more color about what that exactly is? Is it an expansion? Is it a greenfield? How big is it? What's the capital? Just maybe some rough numbers there.
John R. Dearborn: Yes. Thanks for the question. Geismar 2 is we're out in the market right now trying to assess the market's interest in participating in an investment there. Our concept, and we're going to be talking more about this at the analyst meeting coming up or analyst day coming up in New York, but our concept there is to build a cost advantage, large cracker. It would be greenfield. We have expanded Geismar, if I could call it Geismar 1 for the moment, about as big as Geismar 1 could be expanded. I think we're about done with expansion save for perhaps some incrementals there. So that's a concept between -- about what we're thinking on this -- another investment on the river in ethylene.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: But you would do it as a JV? Or you would do it, a standalone by yourself?
John R. Dearborn: Yes, the current concept is we're considering a JV with perhaps 1, at most 2, other partners that would build derivative capacity alongside it, so creating new demand. And then we would take our volumes and sell them into the market on a fee-for-service basis.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I see, okay. And then if I can just ask one more. As we're thinking about Transco and the ultimate -- and the growth in the Marcellus, even in the Northeast, as you look out 3 to 5 years here and the ability to do backhauls down to the Southeast, what do you think is the ultimate capacity that Transco could move in that direction? And then maybe can you talk about the incremental capital you might need to spend to achieve that throughput?
Alan S. Armstrong: Rory, could you take that please?
Rory Lee Miller: Yes, I'd be happy to take that. With -- if you think over the last couple of years, we've had a series of projects that were primarily designed to move Marcellus supply into the traditional market areas on Transco. The first ones are Northeast Supply Link. The second one was Leidy Southeast. The third was Constitution. Now that's not impacting the Transco system at all, but it's certainly pulling reserves out of that area. And then the fourth project is Atlantic Sunrise. And all of those projects -- or at least the 3 Transco projects, had the feature of taking advantage of some of the latent capacity or latent capabilities that existed on the system to be backhauled or to be designed to change the flow from north to south. As we start moving beyond the volumes that we currently have contracted, the costs do start to go up. And so I think the big question there is where's the market for service for producers in that area to get to an end user that they can contract with, take their gas. And the market's going to have to be higher than, say, the market that was established for Atlantic Access for us to do more. However, if you start looking at new greenfield projects out of the area, you'll be looking at rates far in excess of the rates that we contracted for in Atlantic Sunrise. So I know that's a little bit unclear on -- as to the question you asked, but on a per-unit basis, the capital required is going to be higher on future projects than it has been on the projects in the past.
Operator: We'll go next to Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: With regards to Bluegrass, do you anticipate that this could be a project you would revisit within a year or 2? And I guess, do you have the contracts set up with Boardwalk to enable you to do this. Especially on, I guess, their ability to, I guess repurpose part of their pipeline?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes, certainly, we have a great relationship with Boardwalk, and I would tell you that we're working to make sure that if there is a project there that makes sense, we're -- we got the ability to move forward with the project. And at the same time, Boardwalk's got the rights -- under certain conditions, has the rights to utilize that capacity for gas if they see a demand or a higher value in that direction after a certain period of time here. And so I think we've struck the right balance between us in terms of how to move forward on the project. And so I think it's really kind of a matter of time. I think for the meantime, I think there is plenty of alternative uses or alternative ways to move gas south and quite a bit of capacity to do that on various lines, including the existing -- 2 other existing Texas gas lines that would still be in gas service. So -- or on Boardwalk's system. So I would leave that to Boardwalk to answer a little more -- in a little more fine manner. But from our vantage point, we've struck the right balance that allows us to keep Bluegrass on the table and also, under certain conditions, allows them to move forward with something that makes sense for Boardwalk.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And I guess, any estimate on the potential financial impact of the Opal incident?
Donald R. Chappel: Sharon, this is Don. We expect a $10 million impact on property damage with the excess property damage covered by insurance. We expect the -- I'll call it the business interruption loss to be very modest, particularly given that we already have 2 of the plants back up in operation, and we're hopeful that we can bring the other 2 undamaged plants into operation in the not-too-distant future. So expect $10 million in property damage and a very modest loss related to the downtime.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And any update on the regulatory front for Constitution and perhaps the timing of that project?
Alan S. Armstrong: Rory, you want to take that?
Rory Lee Miller: Sure. Yes, on Constitution, we have started getting into some of the typical project milestones. The FERC issued a favorable draft environmental impact statement back on February 12, and they'd asked for comments by April 7. A lot of parties were asking to get that date extended. The FERC did not do that and held fast with their schedule, and we appreciated that. I would say, in general, that the FERC has been very workmanlike in terms of laying out a plan and sticking to it. So we're very satisfied with what the FERC has been doing so far. They've been trying to, I think, do their part in terms of helping us get the projects built. Right now we're working with FERC and the New York DEC in a coordinated fashion to try to get any of the remaining questions answered and the details checked off with the hope that we're going to get a final decision sometime later this year. But it is part of a process, and I'd say it's moving well. But at the end of the day, there's probably more things that are uncontrollable in terms of going through the regulatory process than there are in terms of doing just the actual physical construction. In terms of in-service date, I think right now I'd say that what we've guided so far is -- those are still good assumptions.
Operator: We'll hear next from ISI Group, Timm Schneider.
Timm A. Schneider - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: I just had a follow-up question on the maintenance CapEx. Obviously, it was $36 million. In Q1, you addressed so many weather issues. But if I go off your full year guidance of $340 million, does that kind of imply -- I just want to get the arithmetic right, that this actually jumps to $100 million over the next 3 quarters?
Alan S. Armstrong: It actually -- if you look at our pattern of spending on that, Timm, you'd see that second quarter is always kind of our highest because we've got a lot of work going on, kind of winding up, waiting for a thaw out. And so I would say, generally, you'll see our heaviest spending on maintenance capital in the second quarter followed by fairly high third quarter, and then it tends to taper off in the fourth quarter because winter starts to impact our ability to get work done there again. So I think if you look back to our historical patterns, that's what you should expect.
Timm A. Schneider - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: But there's no change at this point to that $340 million?
Alan S. Armstrong: That's -- that is correct.
Timm A. Schneider - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then next question, on OVM, can you just kind of give us a sense of what utilization rate these assets were running at in the first quarter and what is kind of implied to get to your 2014 guidance?
James E. Scheel: Well, OVM was running, during the first quarter of this year. We -- let me look at this real quick. We were running at about 271 a day. We obviously have a lot more capacity coming online than that. I'm really not focused on the capacity issue right now. We can take everything that customers can bring to us. We're anticipating having that growing to over 400 by the end of the year. What I'm the most focused on as it relates to capacity really are those issues related to the new assets coming online this year. That will help us both from increasing our fee-based revenue to also maximizing our customer netbacks. And so as you can see the second and third quarter come online with those incremental assets, that's what we'll be really focusing on. And then we'll be taking all the gas that the customers can produce out of OVM.
Timm A. Schneider - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And last question for me is on Atlantic Sunrise, is there any read-through on the regulatory front that you guys have picked up from Constitution versus that? Or is it just a completely different ballgame because it's more looping and just compression?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes, Timm, I'll take that. First of all, I think one of the major differences is we're dealing primarily with a big chunk of that, will be through the state of Pennsylvania. And I would tell you the state of Pennsylvania has been very businesslike and approached things in a fashion that's very cooperative. And so I think that's probably one of the biggest differences frankly. It is not all along existing right of way, though, just to be clear. There is some greenfield route coming south of the Leidy diamond, if you will, or the Leidy lateral. Where it ties back into our main line is a greenfield. And so we certainly will have routing issues to deal with there that we don't get to enjoy along with looping our existing lines. So there is some existing looping on there, but there's also some greenfield expansion there. But I would just say the area that we're going through does not deal with some of the New York DEC permitting issues that we're facing on Constitution.
Timm A. Schneider - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: And actually, I have one more quick one. In the slide deck, you moved the opportunity set you outlined with PEMEX in the Atlantic-Gulf segment from 2019 to kind of 2017. And I was just wondering if you could talk about those opportunities in a bit more detail.
Alan S. Armstrong: Sure. That is gaining some steam I would say. I think PEMEX is very focused on developing those deepwater reserves in a very timely manner for a number of reasons I think. I think their elections are in 2018, and I think they certainly want to show that. But I would remind you there that, that 2017 is actually 2017 plus, so not as big a change that we were intending to indicate there. But I would say, at the same time while you ask the question, that they are going to try the accelerate that as much as possible, and that's why a project like or system like Gulfstar, with our existing pipelines in the area and our capabilities, is really important to that in terms of speed to the market. So we're very excited to be positioned well for that opportunity.
Operator: We'll hear next from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: On WPZ and your discussion of not issuing any equity in 2015 and minimal equity in 2014, can you talk about how far you're willing to lever up at WPZ in terms of debt to EBITDA?
Donald R. Chappel: Now Becca, this is Don. That implies, call that, up to a 4x debt-to-equity -- excuse me, debt-to-EBITDA ratio, so again, well within the BBB investment-grade band that WPZ enjoys. So really nothing in terms of levering up. It's just really the cash flows are growing at such a rapid rate that it creates substantial additional debt capacity.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: And does that -- can we translate that over to WMB? And can you discuss your willingness to go non-investment grades there?
Donald R. Chappel: I think our position is that this management team and the board chosen to maintain investment grade at Williams, and that's where we're at. But having said that, we'll certainly always be open to looking at what kind of value we can create and balance that with risk. But again, the management team and the board have chosen investment grade at both WPZ and Williams. So it mitigates some risk during more challenging financial times, and puts Williams in a more opportunistic position during challenging financial times. And while things are rolling pretty nicely in the capital markets, we know that, on a pretty regular basis, the high-yield market does shut down. So that's the advantage that having both WPZ and Williams at investment grade provides us.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: And then last question is on -- once again on the Northeast volumes and your guidance for the year. The $195 million of EBIT for the year, it's -- should we start to see a material ramp-up in the second quarter? Or is this going to be very much a back-end loaded kind of thing?
James E. Scheel: Again, this is Jim Scheel. As we look at the second and third quarters, just again to reemphasize, we'll be bringing on substantial new assets during the end of the second quarter. That would be driving additional fee-based revenue. We do see a pretty significant ramp-up during the second -- or during the third and fourth quarter. I've mentioned earlier, I think, in our package that we've provided, we're showing an average of about $335 million a day for OVM. I think that will be a little bit short of that as far as the yearly average goes. Right now we're anticipating about $327 million but ending the year at a much higher rate. So in excess of the $400 million that we're showing there is our current thoughts around that. So yes, we do have a pretty significant ramp-up. And I think that's in line with what you see from others, whether that be ACMP or Blue Racer also showing pretty significant volume growth, as producers take advantage of this gas environment we're in today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bradley Olsen with Tudor, Pickering.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: I just want to stay on the Northeast and maybe push a little bit harder on Timm's question, which was related to the utilization rate. Just trying to tie together the kind of disparate commentary that you hear from the upstream and your midstream peers in the Marcellus. We're hearing some midstream guys talk about utilization rates for processing assets in the Marcellus that are kind of in the 60% to 70% range. But at the same time, we're hearing upstream guys continue to mention that they do have wells that are waiting on pipe or stuck behind infrastructure constraints. And so maybe just to kind of go back to that question of utilization rate and just to make sure I understand Jim's comments, talking about the $327 million a day average moving to above $400 million by the end of the year. Am I right in thinking that that's -- you've got the $500 million at Fort Beeler, another $200 million at Oak Grove by the end of this year and I should kind of think of utilization in excess of $400 million across that asset base?
James E. Scheel: That's right. Not to -- again, I haven't really focused on the ultimate capacity of the system. We're working to fill up what we've got today. But as we look at Oak Grove coming online with TXP-1, we've got the ability to add significantly more cryo capacity at that facility. We can have up to 10 cryos at that facility. We have a great piece of flat land. We'll talk to you a little bit more about this at analyst day. But when I think of the total capacity for the OVM system, were really in excess of 2 Bcf a day. So it's really -- we will be able now, with these foundational assets, to stay ahead of our customers. And so as we see their drilling profiles coming online, we'll be adding additional infrastructure if necessary. It's not going to be near as much pipe. We'll be connecting to the CRPs, making sure that we have the processing and the compression in place in order to meet their needs. And what is so nice now is where we have struggled in the past around some of those challenges, as we've come into 2014, we're well positioned to do that. Customers have recognized the increased reliability and our ability to get their gas to market. So we will build to meet our customers' needs, and we can meet all of the needs that they have today through our assets as we bring on the stabilization, the deethanizer. The ethane line, the additional 24-inch line on the West side and then TXP-1 at Oak Grove, we've got a great story of growth to tell and the ability to meet the customer needs.
Alan S. Armstrong: So Brad, just to add a little color. That's a great job by Jim kind of describing the situation out there. But it is not as simple as just do I have processing capacity out there. It depends on do you have the trunk line laterals to be able to reach out and get the gas. Do you have the air permit requirements to set compression to pick up the gas? Do you have ethane, deethanization capacity to be able to not get constrained into the interstates and backup gas that way? And so it's a tremendous amount of planning required between the producers and the midstream companies to not have underutilized capacity but to be able to be drilling where the capacity is. And I would highlight a perfect example of that great planning that goes on between us and Cabot in the Northeast. And if you looked at the utilization of our facilities there, you would see it very high, and you'd also see a limited constrain limited to their activity, limited constrained production on Cabot's part, again, relative to their tremendous growth profile that they're on. And so that's a great example of the kind of planning that can be done and that we'd certainly try to encourage with customers. And as Jim mentioned earlier, he's had -- that's starting to be recognized because he's had customers coming into his office wanting to sit down and make sure that they've got capacity for things like some of this burgeoning Utica drilling that is really starting to gain some attention right there in the footprint of OVM.
James E. Scheel: Yes. And I guess, and even a follow-up to Alan, as we talk about the Susquehanna Supply Hub or formerly ABA market area, up in the Northeast, our capacity will be going up towards the top end of that as we go through the course of 2014 into '15. And we're already thinking ahead of how do we continue to expand that capacity through compression in order to meet our customer needs across the board. Those investments in that incremental volume isn't in guidance but those discussions have already started taking place as working with our customers in order to facilitate all of their needs. And it is a complex issue. As Alan was pointing out, it's one that, I think, across the Northeast, we're getting much better at.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Yes, that's great color. I appreciate those comments and the one -- I guess, the one final question, which kind of relates to the comments about the development of the dryer gas portion of the Utica. Do you think -- you mentioned that you have more of a 2 Bcf a day system in OVM, which I assume refers more to the aggregate gathering capacity. Do you think that you'll be more focused on gathering -- high-pressure gathering services as opposed to incremental processing once you're done with the Oak Grove build-out just due to the fact that the drill bit does seem to be moving towards the dryer areas around that kind of northern West Virginia area? And then just one final one, which is it looks like the kind of per Mcf margin implied by your guidance in Northeast G&P is significantly higher in the latter half of the year than it is currently. And is that just kind of the resulting higher fees that you're able to collect with stabilization, ethane and the addition of the trunk line that you've got laid out here in your presentation? And that's all.
James E. Scheel: Okay. Well, there are a lot of questions there. Let me start out and let's make sure I don't miss one. Starting out as it relates to the opportunities around the dry Utica, I would say we still continue to be very excited about the wet Marcellus, obviously. We've built a wet system at OVM. It's one where we have the ability to continue to expand our cryo facilities in order to meet that need and maximize netbacks for our customers. Yes, the incremental improvement in fee-based revenue will come through both increased gathering, as well as the additional services provided to our customers. So that will improve our overall revenue position for OVM. As it relates to the dry gas area, I think we're perfectly positioned to go, in the near term, put some of that dry gas into our existing system. Obviously, we won't -- we'll be running that through the plant where we won't be getting any liquids, but with surplus plant capacity right now, we have the ability to do that. And let -- and work with our customers in order to help them identify what they've got. And as far as the resource potential in the dry area, we're all very excited about that potential to the extent we need to have a duplicate dry gas system built because I believe, again, I believe a lot in the wet area. And to the extent where we continue to build out that, it would really be a separate dry gas system. As we think about putting in some of the 24-inch lines, well, there is the potential, I guess, to repurpose some of our lines. Those will be -- that would be on our planning horizon as we talk to the customers. Again, this all really comes back to making sure we're planning with our customers about what they need and when they need it. I think that dialogue is beginning to open up as they learn more about this. And because of our great competitive position in that marketplace, I think we're well positioned to meet any of those requirements as they evolve. Again, a big dry gas build-out though is not contemplated in any of the numbers that you're seeing here today. I don't know if that was every one of the questions, but I think it was.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: No, that's great. And the only other one was just am I right in thinking that margin per Mcf is set to increase in latter portion of the year in the Northeast?
James E. Scheel: Yes. Yes, it is because the margin will increase because of the additional services we're providing through OVM. In addition to that, we have some higher revenues coming from the recontracting around ABA.
Operator: We'll hear next from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.
Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Just one quick cleanup for me, and actually, it's probably for Don. And this is really just tied to NGL and pet chem. Lots of moving parts in the quarter with BI and the drop-down. But just wondering if you guys could quantify the DCF impact from the dropped assets for the period owned, and sort of how that compares to the guidance you gave us earlier in the year. I think you were looking for 130 to 160 on the full year and so just wondering how sort of initial 1 month of owned DCF sort of stacks up against that.
Donald R. Chappel: I think our initial guidance, Chris, contemplated 3 months of ownership of PZ. And as it turned out, there was 1 full month of ownership because the drop-down happened a couple of months later than what we expected when we put out that guidance in the first place. The good news, Williams enjoyed those earnings for January and February instead, and the -- yes, the 1 month was about $15 million to $20 million.
Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then you guys -- just quick follow-up on that. You guys had flagged some tie-in issues and third-party disruptions in 4Q up there. Just wondering if all that's resolved at this point.
John R. Dearborn: Yes. That is a great question now. And yes, we did through the first quarter, but we're tight-lined to Suncor up there. They did have some operating issues at the upgrader, which reduced our volumes approximately by about 20%. At the end of the quarter, all of those issues were resolved, and we're back to full volume. So looking forward, we can expect Canada to deliver at its full potential.
Operator: With no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the call back to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.
Alan S. Armstrong: Okay, well, great. Thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. As you can tell, a lot of excitement about the quarter and the growth prospects that we have in front of us. And we'd just say we look forward to seeing you at analyst day and sharing a little more of that with you and particularly as we look further in beyond '15. So thanks again for joining us, and we're excited -- we very much look forward to seeing you at the upcoming analyst day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams and Williams Partners Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John Porter: Thank you, Dana. Good morning, and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our websites, williams.com and williamslp.com. These items include yesterday's press releases with related schedules and the accompanying analyst packages; the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily; and an update to our data books, which contain detailed information regarding various aspects of our business. In addition to Alan, we also have the 4 leaders of our operating areas with us. Jim Scheel leads our Northeastern G&P operating area; Allison Bridges leads our Western area, Rory Miller leads the Atlantic Gulf area; and John Dearborn is here from our NGL & Petchem Services operating area. Additionally, our CFO, Don Chappel is available to respond to any questions. In yesterday's presentation and also in our data books, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan S. Armstrong: Great. Thank you, John, and good morning. Let me welcome all of you who joined us today for our fourth quarter results. We'll also talk about our major developments and our outlook today. We do have a lot to cover today concerning items like Geismar, Gulfstar, Bluegrass, our Northeast volume growth and now our big exciting project, Atlantic Sunrise. But before I turn to our fourth quarter results and our full year, let me provide a brief update on where we are with Corvex and Soroban. As you know, in December, Corvex and Soroban disclosed their interest and each having representation on the Williams' board. Since that time, we've been engaged in discussions with both Corvex and Soroban related to the company's strategic plan to drive continued value creation and, of course, we look forward to continuing those discussions with those parties. We do have a long track record here at Williams and, in fact, in recent years, have been a leader in taking advantage of transformational and structural opportunities that create value for our shareholders, and we continue to welcome input towards our goal of enhancing shareholder value for this great company. And so with that, let's turn to our fourth quarter results. Before we get into the details of fourth quarter performance for WPZ, I'd like to remind you of our strategic focus to grow our exposure to fee-based revenues. We are accomplishing this by continuing to develop large-scale infrastructure that will be critical to connecting the fastest-growing supplies to the fastest-growing markets for natural gas and natural gas derivatives. And in fact, this train is just gaining steam as we saw an 8% increase year-over-year in fee-based revenues at WPZ, and we expect even faster growth into 2014 and '15. In the fourth quarter, WPZ enjoyed this growth trend despite harsh winter weather conditions in the Rockies and, in fact, we had another record for DCF growth in the fourth quarter of $509 million, up 26% over the previous fourth quarter. This strong performance exceeded our internal expectations in spite of about $43 million lower in NGL margins. One of the drivers for the better performance was lower costs and maintenance capital expenses. About 1 year ago, we reorganized the company to enable a flatter management structure and better cost efficiencies by deploying our very best knowledge of things like asset integrity and procurement across our entire operations. And as you can see by analyzing our numbers, we've been able to drive the combination of our O&M and G&A expenses lower despite managing tremendous growth in our business. I want to be very clear that our lower maintenance cost in our maintenance CapEx area has been driven by better efficiencies and fewer required repairs, not lower standards of care across our facilities. WMB also -- moving on to WMB, we also enjoyed an 8% increase year-over-year in the segment profit plus DD&A for the quarter, with Williams Partners carrying much of that increase. One disappointment for the fourth quarter was the financial performance for our WMB NGL & Petchem Services segment, primarily driven by Canada, where third-party outages dramatically impacted supplies available for Fort McMurray facility. But that project is up and running very well now and is now exceeding our expectations for both recoveries and volumes, as we really have that business up and running very smoothly now with the ethane recovery portion that we added in that business in the third and fourth quarter of last year. So we look forward to that project becoming the driver for WPZ's results with the drop-down, and we expect that to be completed very soon here, actually, at the end of this month. So of course, we appreciate the great work the team at ACMP is doing to grow their business in a steady and predictable manner, and of course, this also helped us outperform the year for the fourth quarter. Moving on to the DCF growth and our expectations for growth looking into '14 and '15. We do continue to expect strong DCF growth, in fact, greater than 50% from 2013 to 2015. This extraordinary growth rate is on the backs of large capital investments that we've been making over the last couple of years, most of which -- a lot of which has been financed by equity, and our organization is very focused right now on executing this large capital program that is essential to this growth. We updated our commodity prices and our latest assumptions on all of our key projects for 2014. With the degree of volatility we've seen recently in commodity prices, there are a lot of different impacts in our guidance, but in summary, our guidance range is unchanged from the third quarter. We have great visibility around the projects that we expect will drive this growth. We continue to hit key execution milestones that serve to substantially derisk these major projects, and I'll talk a little bit about that in some more detail in a few of our projects. Where we did update our guidance is for growth CapEx, where we have added some noteworthy changes, and we'll see that here on the next slide. And so you can see for the WPZ increasing CapEx, we've got initial spending on some new projects, so projects like Atlantic Sunrise and Dalton. And this higher spending reaffirms our belief in growth potential of our business both within and well beyond our guidance period. 2 of the new projects we've listed here, Atlantic Sunrise and Dalton are on our Transco system where we continue to see strong demand for our services, and really, I think in very positive way here, not just coming from the supply side but from the market and the demand side as well. I expect you saw our news release this morning with some additional detail on Atlantic Sunrise, and we'll hit that topic here in a few minutes. Gunflint, which is mentioned here, is a deepwater tie-back to our new Gulfstar One facility, and our team on Gulfstar have done a terrific job of making some modifications onto the top sides there at Gulfstar to be able to accommodate the easy tie-back of Gunflint. So we're really excited about the way our team continue to execute on Gulfstar One. And WPZ will be adding CapEx for the new Redwater projects. So these are expansions at Redwater that will accommodate things like the CNRL Horizon volumes that will be coming in, and so we've added capital in there for that as well. We're also incorporating $175 million higher capital spend for the Geismar expansion on higher costs that result in part from delay in the restart. For WMB, specifically, you'll see that we have lowered our growth CapEx to reflect a shift in timing to mid- to late 2016 on the joint venture Bluegrass pipeline project to better match the needs of the market. We remain very excited about the Bluegrass pipeline project, and I continue to believe that it's the best solution available in the market. And what I can tell you in terms of where we are is that the activity that we continue to see and the input and discussions that we're having, there is -- there are a number of parties out there who share our view of the market and the attractiveness of the solution, and we are working to reach definitive agreements with all interested parties as we push that project forward. Moving onto next slide here, on Atlantic Sunrise, just a little bit of update and just some brief information. We did issue a news release earlier today on the milestone that Transco executed firm contracts with 9 shippers or 100% of the 1.7 million dekatherms per day of firm transportation capacity. And so we're very excited to announce that very important project for Transco in that it not only serves as a great investment, but it really opens up a lot of supply availability for expanding markets as well. The project includes 15-year shipper commitments. Then the shippers are both producers, local distribution companies and power generators. The project represents vital energy infrastructure designed to connect surging, new supplies of natural gas in the Marcellus producing region in, really, coming mostly from the northeastern Pennsylvania area with growing demand centers along the Atlantic Seaboard. We expect to bring the Atlantic Sunrise into service in the second half of 2017 and of course, this assumes all necessary regulatory approvals are received in timely manner. Moving onto our milestones and the key accomplishments and developments here on Slide 9. We did have a number of recent milestones in the fourth quarter and even into this year. We brought the Canadian ethane recovery project online as I mentioned earlier. The volumes in the fourth quarter for that were disappointing for a number of reasons, but primarily impacted by some third-party outages, both upstream and some difficulties delivering the project -- the product downstream. Those have all been worked out now, and we're enjoying, as I mentioned earlier, great volume growth now. We're reaching important milestones on our Keathley Canyon and Gulfstar projects. We also are rapidly growing our northeast business. We saw a 63% increase in our gathering volumes from the fourth quarter of '13 to the fourth quarter of '12, and that compares very favorably, if you really look at the whole Marcellus volumes, which grew about 40% last year. So really, we're growing -- that says we're growing at a 50% higher rate than the broader Marcellus base is growing. So we're very excited about that. We did see our volumes reach an average of about 1.9 Bcf per day for the full year, and of course, our actual volumes are well above that now. We touched on the impressive financial growth that we expect to see between '13 and '14. I would certainly say that's not without risk, and we've highlighted the largest of the growth drivers here for 2014 as we continue to push forward on these projects. Looking at 2015 and beyond, we're really starting to see the development of our growth, as some of our projects experience a full year of earnings and we bring these new projects online. So '15 is both the combination of a lot of the full year benefit of projects like Gulfstar and Keathley Canyon, which come on in the last half of the year going into '15, as well as some exciting new growth projects through '15 as well. Beyond the guidance period, you'll really begin to see the effect of these major projects. They provide visibility to our continued WPZ DCF growth and support for Williams' continued strong dividend growth. Because we do have the luxury of so many projects that leverage off of our competitive advantages, we can be selective in pursuing only the best risk-adjusted return projects. So we're in a very envious position to be allocating capital to, really, the very best projects. Moving on to Slide 10 here. A picture of different services we're providing for the Northeast, and here's our large scale strategy. It really comes together and plays out in this key growth area where we have operations and investments and opportunities across our various lines of our business. We're strategically positioned in one of the fastest-growing production areas. The biggest challenges in the Marcellus and the Utica are exactly the kinds of problems that our large scale infrastructure strategy is designed to solve. This is a great resource basin that needs great market access. And what stands in our way? Well, as we've been pushing through these major projects, certainly, one of the key issues is the customer's ability to make major commitments up against very complex regulatory structures and the risks in their business. And certainly, the regulatory complexity that it's taking to get this large-scale infrastructure installed as well are barriers to growth. That's both an impediment, but it's also a great opportunity for a company like Williams that's very skilled at taking on these very large complex projects. Atlantic Sunrise and Bluegrass are really big infrastructure solutions that we've been working on. And in the case Atlantic Sunrise, it took some chronic, very visible infrastructure constraints in the market to bring adequate shipper support and firm transportation contracts with long 15-year terms to the project. Consider that, in this example with Atlantic Sunrise, it takes more than $400 million in annual revenue each and every year over those 15 years, along with very strong credit support behind those, to underwrite a project to the side. That's a very big commitment to make in the face of these regulatory mazes, but as we mentioned earlier, the market has really recognized that it's going to have to invest and support these kinds of projects. And so Atlantic Sunrise is one of the first major investments that's coming -- that connects increasing markets with the increasing supplies in the Marcellus area. Of course, it's on the backs of 3 smaller projects that we've been doing out of the area, but this is really a very large scale project that we're bringing forth. We certainly believe that the Bluegrass pipeline project will be the next chapter in how the stories plays out. But in the NGL segment of the market as the constraint in the supply sources become more evident and people look harder for really the right solution out of the basin and our discussions with our customers certainly indicate, that's where we're headed. We expect to bring the Geismar plant back into service. Sorry, I'm moving to Slide 11 here. We expect the Geismar plant to be back in service in June this year. The delay in returning the plant to service and completing the expansion resulted from a variety of factors including the extended loss of utilities. So that's primarily things like steam, our electrical system, those were all damaged severely in the incident. And as a result, getting the project back up and running without those systems has proved to be very difficult and very complex. Based on the current commodity price assumptions, we continue to expect that we are mostly covered on the financial effect of the incident with the exception of the 60-day period before the business interruption insurance kicked in during 2013 and the $13 million in cash deductibles that were primarily associated with the property damage. Moving on to Slide 12 here. Talking about some exciting milestones here in our deepwater projects, and of course, that's included in our Atlantic Gulf segment. On Gulfstar One, we've now achieved an important milestone with the mooring process. So Gulfstar has now reached storm-safe status and the contingencies to cover risks related to weather and powerful eddy currents can be dramatically reduced. So one of the key issues is getting a spar like this set. When we set Devils Tower originally, we were faced with some pretty bad eddy currents in this area. And getting that facility moored is a major milestone for our team, and things have been going very smoothly in accelerating the schedule on Gulfstar. So very excited about the team's performance out here on Gulfstar. And so we do expect our facilities to be in place for an on-time startup of production. Keep in mind that our production -- that a portion of our cash flows will be dependent on the startup of the production and of course, we will be doing everything we can to help to produce and bring production on as soon as possible. I'll remind you that on Gulfstar that Hess and Chevron's Tubular Bells prospect initially, and then as I mentioned earlier, later, outside the guidance period, Gulfstar -- sorry, Gun Flint would be tied back. We do expect production to commence in the third quarter of this year. On the Keathley Canyon project, the customers are Anadarko and Exxon, and we expect this work to be done well ahead of the production commencing in the fourth quarter of this year, and in fact, our deepwater line is now more than 80% laid. Moving to the summary slide here on 13, which just tells you, we are very committed to the strategy with an intense focus for the long term on the natural gas supercycle. We are convinced more than ever that we're really in the sweet spot. We've positioned ourselves very well to create value in this environment. We are now getting some tailwinds from a lift in both NGL prices and gas prices, and these are exactly the kinds of signals that the producing community needs to see right now to continue to develop the resources that are out in front of us. We're rapidly converting our business to a volume, fee-based business that is enduring, and we're putting in the kind of infrastructure that is difficult to replicate in the long term. We're very focused on this critical infrastructure and very well-contracted business is going to be here for the long haul due to its competitive advantages in the market. That's hard work. It's a lot of risk, and it's a lot of grit on the part of our team to push through all of that, but that's exactly what we're going to stay focused on. And it's the stuff that in the long term, the market is going to have to have for a sustainable growth in natural gas and natural gas derivatives markets here in the U.S. I truly believe that there is no other company in this sector that enjoys the degree of visibility to growth that we enjoy both now and over the long period. So with that, I thank you, very much for joining us, and we'll turn it over to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Brad Olsen with Tudor, Pickering.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: First, a quick question about weather. Obviously, the price impact of this winter has been very good for gas and NGL markets. What impact, if any, do you expect to see as we move into Q1 in terms of freeze-offs or other operational issues as a result of weather either in the West or in the Northeast? And have we seen some of the buildout in the Northeast or some of the drilling activity slow as a result of some of the cold weather?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes. Great, Brad. Thanks for the question. First of all, I'd like to commend our Western team and our Northeast team for some great operations despite some pretty difficult environments out West in the fourth quarter. Moving into the first quarter, where your question was targeted, I would say the West continues to do pretty well up against our norms -- we normally do have quite a bit of freeze-off. But I would tell you, they continue to perform very well up against the norms for the Rockies in the Western areas. San Juan Basin has actually had one of the better periods during this than we normally see quite a bit of reduction in production there. In the Northeast, I'm very thankful for the work our team's done up there. Key to reliability up on our system. I will tell you there's certainly been some freeze-up upstream on some of the producer's equipment and some of the volumes upstream of our facilities, but our facilities have remained very reliable. And really excited to see our team having pushed through some very challenging times of getting these facilities up to reliable standards. And so we have set some freeze-offs out there in the wet Marcellus area. But again it's not been on our systems, it's been upstream, and producers have been working quickly to overcome that.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Great. And another question about a little bit more of the long-term outlook in the Northeast on your OVM systems specifically. There have been some really impressive dry gas well results just across the river in Ohio, and it appears that there is some potential prospectivity in Marshall and Wetzel for those very productive dry gas horizons. Are those -- is that kind of emerging play something that you've discussed with your OVM customers? With that dry gas production, if it does emerge, would that dryer gas maybe alleviate some of the operational issues that you've seen with some of the especially super-rich gas that you've had on the OVM system just by diluting some of the liquids content and providing you with maybe more of a dry gas blend stock for some of the ethane-rich gas you produce?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes. Well, first of all, I would tell you there are several of our key producers that do have plans this year to test into both the Utica dry and the Upper Devonian. And while the Upper Devonian doesn't provide any relief, I hate to -- as a processing company, I hate to think about getting -- moving to dry gas as relief. But to your point, some of the big volumes that we've been seeing from Utica test in the dry area would certainly help provide some sweeping volumes and a more reasonable gas-to-liquid phase in our pipeline. So we're excited about that, and we certainly are working with the producers. I would tell you included in our capital is some expansions of our systems to be able to accommodate some of those higher volumes on the dry gas side.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Great, and just one last one. On Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise. Constitution kind of stood out as the only Northeast pipe project to involve a significant laying of new build pipes, and Atlantic Sunrise, at least from the map you have provided, it appears as though that project would also involve some significant new pipe from kind of the Leidy Line down towards Station 190. And I guess, is there anything from the Constitution process that's maybe something that could be applied to the Atlantic Sunrise process? Or is it something where, as long as you're laying significant new build pipes, there will be some regulatory risks of delays and what have you?
Alan S. Armstrong: Great question. I would tell you that on Constitution, the real issue we're facing right now from a regulatory issue really relates to the New York DEC, not to the FERC. And so the nice thing about Sunrise is it does not go through the New York area. So we're not faced with that same regulatory issue. On the FERC side, I would just tell you, no, they are continuing to push through. You've saw the Constitution's draft EIS. So we're very thankful for the FERC continuing to try to do their part to accelerate these projects, and we continue to work well with them. And we certainly have some -- a lot of discussions, communications we need to do in New York to find the right answers and right solutions there as well.
Operator: We'll go next to Stephen Maresca with Morgan Stanley.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: A couple of quick questions on Geismar. So you say, expect to be out of service until June. How firm is that date? And then how much extra out-of-pocket costs are there for each month you missed that? It seems like there, you only had, if I'm reading this right, $10 million of additional uninsured losses from delaying this, 2 the 3 months from April to June. Is that right?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes. It's for 2 months. That's correct. Just a little over 2 months of delay, that's correct. And so to answer your question, right now, the mechanical completion is expected in the first part of May, and I would tell you there's obviously a lot of things to go right, but I'm very proud of the work that our team has done to really dig in some great detail to understand what the drivers of that are in the productivity and labor. And I think we've got a very studied perspective on that issue. Having said that, I would tell you the window is probably from the last week in May through the end of June as the expected window right now for that startup. And in terms of that cost, of course, if we were delayed beyond that, it's very dependent on ethane to ethylene spreads. But in a range, that's probably around $1.5 million to maybe up to $2 million a day of expected revenues we lose on that.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And then one more. The $175 million more CapEx and the higher cost for Geismar, is it relating to repairs? Or are you getting a return on that increased capital spend?
Alan S. Armstrong: No. There are -- unfortunately, this isn't one that we'll get any return on. And I would just tell you, it's been driven by a lot of the complexities associated with the damage at the plant. So we've had, as I mentioned early, we would have to go in and wait on utilities being ready, the complexity of working in both the damaged-repaired areas, as well as getting the expansion that's just put a very crowded and complex stage there. So I would tell you that is one of the major drivers for us, but there certainly isn't, unfortunately, any incremental return to come to us from that investment.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. Understood. And then moving to Bluegrass, Alan, you pushed it out, but you're still talking quite favorably on the project. And is your sense that producers are eventually going to be willing to sign up, but this is just a timing issue, and I guess, what is causing them to hold off on signing right now and still giving you confidence that there will be in the future?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes. Steve, great question, and thanks. I will just tell you, if you look at what cost for a producer, the kind of commitment, if somebody's got 30,000 to 70,000 barrels a day of commitment, and you look at what that looks like on a roughly $0.30 a gallon by the time you pay for transport, frac and go to an export facility. That $0.30 a gallon, put that times 30,000 to 50,000 barrels a day and pile it up for 15 years, that's a very, very large commitment from many of the producers we're dealing with. And it's just taking time for them to get all their approvals and work through all of the issues and concerns that they have with that because it is a very, very large commitment, and if you do the math on that. And so I really think that's the practical issue we're dealing with. We have some very engaged customers. I think, as I mentioned, a lot of our costumers see this opportunity just like we do. That it is essential, and it's an essential piece of infrastructure, and I think some folks would just like to see some of the else get it built, and hopefully be on the coattails of that. But frankly, we're going to have to see an adequate amount of financial support before we push through with additional investment.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And I appreciate -- moving away from Bluegrass, and your comment about discussions with Soroban and Corvex. I want to know if you could just talk any discussions you have with respect to the Access's 50% GP interest held by GIP. Is it something that you would ultimately like to own at WMB? And is it something you're working towards ultimately?
Alan S. Armstrong: Well, I would just tell you -- we think the ACMP business is a great business. We think it would be a great complement to Williams in a lot of ways, both from a management team standpoint, as well as the structure and the contracts and the focus on natural gas. So it's very much in line with our strategy. But of course -- so I think fundamentally, the answer to your question is yes. We would like to look towards bringing in the synergies of combining those businesses, but there's another party involved. And that means there is a value trade to be added, and we'd have to make sure that the value trade really makes sense for our shareholders. And because we do have some many great investment opportunities in front of us right now, we have to keep that in balance as well. And so to answer your question, yes, we'd love to do it, but at the right price and at the right timing as well, because the bigger hurry we get in, the more extensive that likely becomes.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: One quick follow-up. Are there active -- would you describe as active discussions in that for this or not right now?
Alan S. Armstrong: No. I wouldn't describe there's being any active discussions. I would say we continue to study the opportunity from our own perspective. But I wouldn't suggest that there's any active discussions with GIP on that.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Final very quick one for me. Do you expect to have IDR waivers in 2014? I saw you didn't have them in the fourth quarter.
Alan S. Armstrong: No. We do not intend to have IDR waivers.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Abhi Rajendran with Crédit Suisse.
Abhiram Rajendran - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: A couple of quick questions. You increased a lot of your assumptions on your commodity deck, but your outlook was largely unchanged. I guess, is this just a function of most of the commodity movements largely netting themselves out? Or are there some volume offsets? If you could provide some color on some of the puts and takes? That would be helpful.
Alan S. Armstrong: Sure. Yes, really, it is very much an offset. So you'll see, of course, some higher NGL prices reflect the current market, and you'll see the slightly lower ethylene prices. And of course, all of that is up against the higher natural gas price. And so as I mentioned in my comments, really, those -- all of those work to offset each other primarily. So really fairly little movement in all those businesses as well.
Abhiram Rajendran - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. Got it. And on the topic of ethylene, ethane prices. I mean, could you talk a little bit about your thoughts on margins for Geismar over the long run? Obviously after it's up and running. Ethane is spiked recently, but there's still plenty of supply coming online. And on the pricing side, ethylene is largely driven by crude, international crude. So just some of the puts and takes there and your thoughts on how margins will shape up over time.
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes. Abhi, I'm going to ask John Dearborn to take that question for us.
John R. Dearborn: Sure, and thanks very much for the question. Starting with -- let's start with a short-term look at ethylene. As we look back over our shoulder, coming out of last year in anticipation of the second quarter turnarounds that are in front of us, I think there are 3 factors that are about to turn around in the second quarter. The industry, if you look at the EFPN [ph] inventory data, built inventory, in our estimate is they built somewhere between 700 million and 800 million pounds through the end of this year. That's roughly how much ethylene will be needed in the second quarter. I think on the back of that, we saw the weakening prices in the first quarter. It's our expectation they'll warm up again into the second quarter, and that's -- and then back to what we would consider normal for the year in the latter part of the year. And so I think that's the way we see this year playing out. If we look at ethane, I think in the short term, ethane is facing some operational difficulties in the Gulf Coast, mainly related to brine that's all the new fractionators have built there in the Gulf Coast. I think folks just challenged in moving the inventories around us is necessary because of some brine difficulties. We think that's going to clear out over the short period of time, and as a result, coupled with -- as a result, I think that we're going to see the ethane prices drop back to what would be a more normal level in the $0.30 per gallon range. I think that's what we've got in our guidance. So I think that takes care of this year's view. So now as we look forward, the next significant tranches of ethylene come in, in the 2017, '18 time frames. So our expectation is -- on the back of oil staying high and naphtha being relevantly related to oil, that our ethylene margins through that period until we see new, significant supplies of ethylene come on in the latter part of this decade, I think our ethylene margins are expected to remain pretty strong.
Abhiram Rajendran - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, great. That's helpful. And then one last quick one, if I may. Could you maybe talk a little bit about recontracting on the Northwest and Transco pipelines in terms of what's up for renewal, how we should think about changes in the transportation rates? Obviously, Transco is running pretty close to full; Northwest is not quite there. But any color there would be very helpful.
Alan S. Armstrong: Okay, great. I'll ask -- we're in very good shape on that, as well as Gulfstream. I'll ask Rory Miller to take Transco, and then Allison Bridges can give you a response on Northwest. So Rory, if you'll take that Transco question?
Rory Lee Miller: Yes, that's a good question. Just thinking about Transco a little bit, we've got what I would call some pretty fresh market signals around pricing with our new Atlantic Sunrise project. And although we're not really disclosing all the information on it right now, the rates are above, significantly above where our system rate is. I think we've got an average of 6 years or so on contract length there. But we believe that with the change of the system, supply coming in both ends and the kind of growth that we have from the market side, it's truly a "supply push, market pull" kind of scenario. We believe as those contracts roll off that re-upping those contracts is going to be very attractive for our end users. We don't think anybody in the marketplace will be able to touch the opportunity that the LDCs have to just re-up those contracts. And in fact, that's what we've seen as contracts roll off. We've not seen any pressure at all in terms of getting those recontracted. So it's kind of -- it's a very healthy situation, and I think, due in large part just to the quality of the service and the positioning of the assets.
Alan S. Armstrong: Great. Thank you, and Allison, if you'll take the North -- question on Northwest.
Allison G. Bridges: Yes. On Northwest, we are fully subscribed even though we don't run at 100% load factor day in and day out. We do -- our contracts are fully subscribed, and I believe, on average, we have a remaining term of over 9 years. And we continue to be able to extend terms with customers. Additionally, we're really starting to see, I think, some exciting new market growth opportunities come to the Northwest through potential new fertilizer plants, potential new methanol plants for exports. So I think that not only will that continue to bode well for our existing capacity, I think longer-term, it will also result in some expansion opportunity.
Operator: We'll go next to Christine Cho with Barclays.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: In the Northeast, your processing volume was a bit stronger than I would have expected. How much, if any of that, was due to benefiting from a third-party outage?
Alan S. Armstrong: There was some in the month of -- mostly in the month of December there Christine, that came from the Natrium plant being down, and I think it was around varied, but up to about 50 million a day during the month of December.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then if I look at your NGL production, it looks like you guys may have hit your fractionation capacity maybe at the end of 4Q or sometime this quarter. Is that the case, and is your new frac unit online today?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes. We are up against the limits on the base frac, and the second frac, we are -- we'll be commissioning here towards the end of the first quarter.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. Was there a buildup in NGL volumes that couldn't get frac-ed or no?
Alan S. Armstrong: No.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. Going to Bluegrass. Was there maybe more acreage dedications than you would have liked and not enough minimum volume and/or ship or pay commitments? Is that delay in the pipeline more about reducing your volume risks, and that's only going to happen when producers feel more pain in netbacks. Also, have the smaller projects that have been announced since your original announcement of the project played the part in pushing back your timing?
Alan S. Armstrong: Well, first of all on the acreage dedication versus not enough volume, we certainly appreciate both of those as contributions. But clearly, we want to have a baseload of revenues that we can count on initially, and so that certainly is a major part of the issue. Secondly, as to the smaller projects -- I think those are great projects. I think they're needed. But they don't provide the kind of long-term underground storage opportunities that you get with the Gulf Coast nor the diversity of the markets for both the growing Petchem businesses and as well as the export opportunities that are very large-scale in nature in well-protected ports. So I would just tell you that I think we're excited those other projects exist because we think the growth in volume is certainly is dictating those kinds of solutions. But we really haven't seen that as a big deterrent for producers committing to Bluegrass.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then last one for me. Can you provide an update on the PDH facilities? Last we heard, you narrowed it down to 2 international players or 2 players, I guess, who are interested in building derivative plants alongside your facilities. But we'd like to know if there's been any progress there.
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes. I'm going to ask John Dearborn to take that as well.
John R. Dearborn: Yes. Christine, thanks for the question. Yes, we've made some good progress there. We actually narrowed it down to one person, and we're entering into definitive agreements on that. Give us a couple of months and probably by Analyst Day, we'll be able to bring you a good update on where that the project is at that stage, but progressing as expected at the moment.
Operator: We'll go next to Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
Jeremy B. Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I was hoping just to possibly drill down a little bit more on the Northeast G&P. Would it be possible to quantify how much weather impacted the quarter, the ROIs?
Alan S. Armstrong: I would tell you it wasn't very large, actually. I'd say, some of the more significant issues were line breaks and a number of onetime operational expenses and some write-downs and so forth. But not too big of a volume impact from weather. One impact, though, that we did suffer was the ethane limitations going into the TETCO system. And so without the ethane systems being up and running yet, there were constraints that TETCO imposed on points like the Fort Beeler connection that required curtailments there. And so that did have some impact on our volumes in the fourth quarter.
Jeremy B. Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then as we look forward into 2014, I was just wondering if you could provide any color on how you see the segment ramping up over the year? Do you expect the first quarter to be similar to fourth quarter or a steady ramp across the year or any step change in any given quarter?
Alan S. Armstrong: Well, some of the big projects that we have coming on, of course, is the Gulfstar project, which would come on in the third quarter, and the Keathley Canyon project, which comes on at the beginning of the fourth quarter, and then the Rockaway lateral project. Additionally, though, the projects in the Northeast, many of which will come on either at the very end of the first quarter or the second quarter, really, are some big drivers, not necessarily just the volume, but to the rate that we achieve for those services. And so even though people come accustomed to looking at volume there, a lot of that will be just an increase in rates. So those are really some of the big projects, I would say. On the Cayman system -- sorry, on the system in Susquehanna Supply Hub area with Cabot, those volumes will continue to grow throughout the year. And we're really excited about the continued growth up there, and we're working very hard to keep the infrastructure out in front of the growth up there. But that's pretty well steady. That growth will be well steady throughout the year.
Jeremy B. Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. So specific to the Northeast G&P, sounds like going into the second quarter, there could be a bit of a step change there?
Alan S. Armstrong: Correct.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Harry Mateer with Barclays.
Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Two for me. The first, can you just talk about whether your thoughts on the need to have investment grade ratings of WMB have evolved and whether that financial policy might be part of your discussions when you consider taking advantage of the structural and transformation opportunities that you mentioned at the start of the call?
Donald R. Chappel: This is Don Chappel. Certainly, our -- I'll call it policy and desires have been to maintain the investment grade ratings at Williams. We think that it provides a lot of flexibility and ability to be opportunistic, particularly during very challenging times when the high-yield market is locked up. But having said that, we're certainly open-minded to other paths that create more value but it would have to be something compelling that would cause us to deviate from the path that we're on. So again, we continue to be open-minded, but we think it would take a compelling value-creation situation in order for us to deviate from our current path.
Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And then just a follow-up on Transco and Northwest earlier. Appreciate the commentary on rolling contracts. But you said there's been no issue with getting contracts renewed and extended. But I'm just wondering, has pricing been stable as well? Or do you feel like you're giving up some pricing to get tenor?
Alan S. Armstrong: Rory, you want to take that, please?
Rory Lee Miller: Sure. Harry, we really haven't seen price pressure on those re-up contracts. If you look at where our system rates are, they're probably the lowest-cost opportunity that people have in the marketplace. And so the other thing is so many of our -- the LDCs that we serve, it's not like we're just dropping off large volumes of gas at one point. In some of our bigger customers, we've got over 40 delivery points. And so when you think about the way that we're distributing that gas into a 60- or 70-year-old distribution system and the low rates that we have that they can re-up at, it's just really hard. Plus, it's virtually impossible to replace those with gas from a new competitor.
Alan S. Armstrong: And to be clear on that, we haven't discounted any of that firm. It's 100% contracted, and the rates are getting set by those rate cases. But to those long-haul 100% firms, there's not any discount. There may be a discount in the production area for IT and so forth, but not on the long-haul firm.
Operator: We'll go next to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I guess, first question for me, it's WMB-leveled. You've obviously reduced the CapEx here with Bluegrass getting pushed out. I'm wondering if you can just talk about capital allocation, thoughts on the dividends, I don't know, share buybacks, keeping dry powder for acquisitions. What would you do with the extra cash, now that you'll have here for a little while?
Alan S. Armstrong: Don, take that.
Donald R. Chappel: Ted, this is Don. I would say that the extra cash flow now is still going on into some of our growth projects like CNRL. And we'll see what Bluegrass does, but for the near term, that extra cash is being reinvested in that Canadian business. Longer-term, I think we have a lot of options, and we'll have to see how things play out here in terms of investment, as well as all the other options that we continue to evaluate. I think as Alan mentioned early on that we continue to evaluate kind of all the options, and we're very open to possibilities that will create additional value.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then we've sort talked around it a little bit, but can you just give us a sense on Atlantic Sunrise? The returns that we're ought to be modeling in there, it sounds like it's higher than your current system rates. I think there was a mention of $400 million of revenue. Just give us a sense of what kind of returns from the $2.1 billion of capital we should expect.
Alan S. Armstrong: That looks like about -- without providing specific returns there, it does look like about a 7x multiple on that project. Of course, that's a little better than you normally would see on a pipeline project, and some of that is driven by the fact that we did have the competitive advantage of having a lot of that service being provided by the existing system. And so that allows for some higher returns than normal.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Great. And then last one for me is -- you sound now a little more bullish on the Gulf. Any thoughts on potentially affecting Gulfstar here? As you're getting close to completion of the first one, what's the opportunity set look like right now?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes. Well, first of all, I'd tell you, one thing we are very excited about is the tie-backs that we're seeing to both Gulfstar One and to the original Devils Tower spar. And I'll remind you, those 2 facilities are very close together until there's a pretty nice area there that we can serve from those 2 spars, and we are seeing some nice tie-backs. And certainly, the Gunflint tie-back is a big boost to our expected economics for Gulfstar and came on much earlier in our assumptions. In our projects like that, we assume some tie-backs for the future, but this one came on much earlier than we had expected originally for that project. So that's very positive and of course, we've got a couple of tie-backs to Devils Tower as well. On the new spar front, we have many projects that were out there working, as you look out into the further reaches. I would tell you, we're pretty excited about some of the opportunities that we see to serve PEMEX with some of their big deepwater finds, which I'll remind you, are just south of our Perdido -- of the Perdido fold belt and our pipelines that go out to serve Shell's projects at Perdido Norte. So anyway, we're very seeing a lot of interest in the product, but we don't have any capital and guidance right now. We don't have enough confidence in those projects at this point, have any capital embedded in our guidance right now.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Just maybe if you clean up questions, if I could. Alan, maybe going back to Bluegrass. If we get abandonment -- FERC abandonment in March, do you see that playing any type of catalysts? Would -- did anyone have any concerns over that as they may have with other alternative projects? And two, could you help us with any color, maybe, you saw from the international petchem community as far as going through Moss Lake and perhaps getting capacity on Bluegrass from that end?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes. Well, those are both really astute questions. First of all, on the abandonment issue on Texas Gas, certainly, Boardwalk's in control of that issue, and I would defer that question to them. It's certainly at some point with the timing of that abandonment would certainly play into the decisions on Bluegrass. And the catalyst for a decision, we'll just say, we're not certain of the timing of that. And I think we certainly work closely with Boardwalk, but they've been working to manage that issue. But at some point, that would likely become an issue as abandonment word would come out and a decision would have to be made in terms of which direction to take there. On the question around the international players, lots of interests. A lot of a big interest, I would tell you, from a lot of international players. And I think there are some great strategic matchup there in terms of what we're trying to accomplish in the markets that we're trying to present for our producers in the Northeast. But I also would tell you the challenge to that is it is a very slow process in terms of working through all the approvals not within -- not regulatory or anything like that within the governance, within those very large multinational corporations. And so we're excited about it in strategy, but it's a long arduous process to gain approval on that. And so we're not waiting around, I would just put it that way. We're not waiting around for those approvals for moving on, but we do have a lot of exciting talks there. And we'll remain very excited about that strategically. But we've got to execute in the near term sometimes, and those parties can move, too.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. No, I appreciate the color. Two last questions, if I could. And understanding what the Canadian PDH, we haven't seen the first one yet. So I don't want unless I put the cart in front of the horse, but to the extent that my understanding was at the end of last year, we were looking at perhaps wooing 2 different companies, and that led into potential even assessing the twin of the project. Is that something that is still progressing? Or is it more at this point, let's get the first one locked up under construction, and then we'll, perhaps, assess a twinning at that point?
Alan S. Armstrong: A great question, Carl. I'm going to ask John Dearborn to take the question.
John R. Dearborn: Appreciate the question as well. Yes, the second PDH is certainly still a bright spot in our future that we want to keep our eye on. But I think you've got it exactly right that we need to have success with the first one, before we're ready really to take a big step into the second. The marketplace, though, is continuing to express great interest. In fact, the partner that we're talking with is interested in the second one as well. So just that person is interested, and then we've got an arms-length-long list of folks that have come and approached us about number 2. So I guess, I'll just say stay tuned. There's more future growth opportunity for us up in the Canadian franchise.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: And then a final question, if I could. Maybe one for Don and understanding that is sort of one of the risks that were outlined, the insurance recoveries for Geismar and the risk of perhaps oversimplification. Is there any additional color to share that, say, for instance, of the $125 million second payment that should be coming this quarter? Can you express that in any terms of bid versus ask, of what you had requested from the insurance companies versus what they were comfortable at this point paying out?
Donald R. Chappel: Carl, the insurance paid 100% of our claim to date. So I think to date, they've paid the claim as filed, and I think we're pretty well paid up through the end of the year now. In fact, obviously, the business interruption loss mounts every month. So we'll continue to update the claims process and make requests for additional payments. We'll see where that takes us. But the actual claim is based on actual losses, so we can't expect to get paid for February until sometime after February ends, or -- March until after March ends and we know what the real price is. We're in the market, and therefore, the basis of our claim. So those will kind of tick off periodically.
Operator: We'll go next to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: A couple of questions here. Alan and Don, on this call, you both commented a couple of times about being open-minded to transformational opportunities. But Don kind of emphasized the bar was set high for giving up that investment grade credit rating and also noted that WMB level free cash flow is already spoken for a bit in the near term. My first question is do you kind of see this ongoing internal discussions with investors being an ongoing long-term issue to keep in mind or something that's more of a 2014 catalyst?
Alan S. Armstrong: Well, I would just say -- it's a great question, Craig, thank you. But I -- we've always had our eyes open to any arbitrage that's available in the market and any additional value we can add to our shareholders to either transformational or structural changes. And as I mentioned earlier I don't think anybody can accuse us of not having been aggressive, and in fact, we've certainly been a leader in many of the structural changes over the last several years. And so we'll continue to look for those, and I think the drivers will be what the market is valuing and how our businesses are being best valued in the market, and we'll continue to look for those opportunities as time goes by. So I don't -- unless there became a roadblock between a really good idea and what we are willing to do, that would be catalyst that might limit '14. I just don't see that. I think we're very well aligned with both Corvex and Soroban in terms of looking for the great value. I think their perspective is that we're well undervalued relative to marking to our peers. And that we've got the best growth story in the business, and we ought to be getting value better than our peers and not just at par with our peers. And so I think they see a huge value gap there. And I have to say, I share their perspective. And I'm very well aligned and will continue to work with them or anybody else that has good ideas on how we can achieve that value.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Great. I appreciate that, and a couple more. With Gulfstar One pending completion, do you see this completion -- successful, on-time completion, being a catalyst for other significant deepwater projects?
Alan S. Armstrong: I would just tell you, I think our producers -- I think Hess and Chevron, and particularly, Hess discussed with some more visibility to them, are going to wind up, looking really smart on this project both in terms of the time that they brought their production to market. And the capital that they have tied up or the lack of capital they have tied up. So I think it's going to look like a really good project for them. It's going to look like a really good project for us because we're bringing in third-party volumes, and we're marketing the project for that. So I think when people sit back and analyze that, they're going to look pretty smart. I think Hess will want to do more business. Chevron want to do more business like that, and I think their peers will be pressured to do that kind of businesses as well. So I think this is a smart solution out there, and certainly, it gives -- we'll continue to gain confidence in our ability to execute on these kind of projects, as well as the producing community.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Great. And last 2 small ones. Can you provide some more color on that $20 million Petchem Services pipeline project write-off? And as a follow-up to Abhi's question about long-term commodity price outlook, and I know this is going out a bit. But if we are thinking maybe nat gas and even ethane pricing, especially could be a headwind towards the end of the decade, would you consider leading up to that, balancing out your short positions by expanding midstream processing POP exposures through development or acquisition or new processing?
Alan S. Armstrong: First question on the write-off in the Petchem Services, that was related to an NGL extension up in the Northeast, a line extension that, through some potential partnering arrangements, we don't think we need any longer. And so we found a better solution than the investment that we've made in the right away and so forth developing the project. So that's the first one. And then secondly, on the commodity price outlook, certainly, the natural gas pricing is one that is kind of bittersweet for us in the short term. It will put pressure on our NGL margins and therefore, ultimately, on the ethylene spread as well, as ethylene prices, as you mentioned. But the good news is, and I think this is very positive news, is that just as we stated, we're really trying to move it forward to being a volume-driven company, and with this shot in the arm for the producers, the gas and the NGL prices that we think are going to spur additional drilling and additional volumes into our system. And so frankly, I think it's very -- long-term, very healthy for our business. In terms of contract restructuring, I think you'll see that we continue to restructure into -- away from the business. And if you look at how rapidly our fee-based business is growing over the period, it's tending to push out the importance of those NGL margins. And so we're always looking to try to reduce the risk in exposure, but it has to be done with an eye towards really the expected net present value versus the commodity risk. And so -- but we're always looking to do that. We see great value in more and more predictable cash flows, and so we're always working towards that.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: I guess, my question there was a little more focused on an appetite even if the individual investment is not as high-return, in balancing out your commodity exposures longer-term. So you have a little less volatility. So in other words, would you be willing to go into fresh midstream commodity exposed operations that would balance out your existing risks.
Alan S. Armstrong: Well, I would say that I don't see adding POP contracts as reducing risks all that much frankly. And so I would say you'd see us investing in more fee-based investments. I think POP is a different kind of risk, but I really don't see it balancing out all that much risk. We do have some contracts that will reduce risks like our Laurel Mountain contract with Chevron that's a percent of gas. And that does, but that's not just limited to the processing business that's on the gathering business as well. So we certainly will look to those kind of opportunities that reduce our exposure to natural gas but not necessarily adding length and exposure to NGLs.
Operator: We'll go next to Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Just a couple of follow-ups. For the Atlantic Sunrise project, do you anticipate that 7x multiple at the start? Or is there a stairstep in the commitments to get to the full capacity?
Alan S. Armstrong: No, that is both initial and end of term revenues. So that's fully contracted from day 1.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. And then also for the planned Canadian drop-down. Any change in the target multiple? I think you previously mentioned around 7x.
John R. Dearborn: Sharon, we said less than 7x, and I think we're in that same zip code.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. And I guess, given the recent news on Boardwalk, do you anticipate that this could have an impact or bearing on shippers' decision to commit to Bluegrass? Or maybe on the way you would like to structure the JV as the project goes forward?
Alan S. Armstrong: No. Just to remind you -- and I'm certainly going to be careful. I do not to speak for Boardwalk here, but I will tell you that Boardwalk has been very clear with us from the inception and have certainly recently reiterated that Loews really stands behind the bulk of their capital commitment. And so we did not worry the recent reduction in their distribution and the impact that's had on the company. So we -- we're very excited to have them as a partner. They've been a great partner to work with, and we really don't see any issues there because of they've got such strong backing from Loews on the project.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Timm Schneider with ISI Group.
Timm A. Schneider - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Just -- I was wondering if you guys can maybe discuss what you're seeing in terms of operating cost creep in some of your different service areas. So if I look at Northeast, for example, volumes and revenues were up pretty nicely, I think, 18% sequentially, but that didn't really push through to the bottom line. Was this just kind of onetime issues? Or is there something else going on?
Alan S. Armstrong: It really -- Timm, thanks for the question. It really is -- has been a lot of onetime issues. We also have allocated quite a bit of cost the way we allocate kind of our support services across the company. Those get allocated on both the capital and a revenue basis, and so the cost of them coming up directly with those allocations as well. But for the most part, the real issue was a bunch of onetime matters in terms of write-downs and so forth that on various assets. And frankly, we're kind of cleaning up what's been a pretty fast-paced period up there. And I would tell you, as we move forward, Jim Scheel and his team are going to be very focused on operational excellence and really fine-tuning our cost structure up there. So I'm very confident in our team's ability to do that. If you look at our overall cost structure across the entire company, you'll actually see that, that actually -- between our O&M and G&A, actually, reduced a little bit from 12% to 13%, which is pretty impressive, considering the amount of growth that we've been managing. So I'm very confident in our team's ability to get after cost and get those in line. But we've certainly been trying to make sure we got some of the reliability problems behind us and for the benefit of our customers and because we saw that as kind of a job one. And I think we've done that and reliability has been very, very impressive over the last 6 to 7 months. But it's come at some expense to get it there, and I think that's a lot of what you're seeing right now.
Timm A. Schneider - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Sure. And as a follow-up, can you guys just discuss maybe your preliminary funding plans for Atlantic Access? Are you kind of happy with the $2.1 billion, I guess, CapEx outlay at this point, or would you consider selling some of that balance to another party?
Alan S. Armstrong: No. I don't think we would be planning on selling that down. It's part of the Transco system and as a result of that, it's not an individual project, the way like a Constitution project is. So Constitution is not part of the Transco system, and it allows for that, but being part of Transco makes that a little more difficult.
Donald R. Chappel: Yes. We like the risk return profile there, and again, most of that capital is in 2017. The amount of capital for 2017 is pretty modest. So it puts it out in a period where we'll have a lot of capacity and be looking to make big investments.
Timm A. Schneider - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. Lastly, for me, on Constitution. I guess, what are some of the big moving parts around the in-service date, whether it's going to be kind of end of '15 or early '16? And how are some of the conversations going with producers in that part of the woods?
Alan S. Armstrong: Well, that -- the Constitution system is fully contracted as you know. And so the discussions are really more around what all we can do jointly to accelerate the permitting process. And really, the permitting is the issue. As I mentioned earlier, the FERC has certainly been constructive, and they are pushing things along. But there are some permitting requirements in the state of New York that, for various reasons, can be a bit of a barrier. And frankly, I think we just got to work towards the right resolutions that meets everybody's needs on that. And I feel we'll remain confident that we can do that, I think it's very clear, politically, that the infrastructure is desperately needed to serve the New England markets. And I think that bringing that to life, clearly and firmly, will help bring some reason to getting past some of the permit issues that we're facing right now.
Timm A. Schneider - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: So was that more at the state level? Or was it actually land owners challenging rights of ways?
Alan S. Armstrong: No. It's state permitting issues.
Operator: We'll go next to Faisel Khan with Citi.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I hate to beat a dead horse, but if could just go back to sort of the response that you guys have to the activism in the market and your stock. Is there going to be like a formal response from you guys, from all you guys, to the activist shareholders' sort of demands? Or is there going to be any change in the board over the next several months? I know that there were some requests by the activists to take board seats, too. So just wondering is there a timeline when you have to respond to them or put out a formal sort of response and discuss sort of what are the strategic options or at least adopt the strategic options that they're recommending?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes. Well, really, the only thing they really asked for at this point is the board seats. And so that's where the discussions have centered, frankly. And as you noted, we -- I'm sure we put out an 8-K announcing that we had expanded or extended the window for nomination post this call in our 10-K release. And that really was to eliminate any disclosure kind of risk and really allow the parties to have a more thorough discussion post that information being out there. So I think you should see that as very accommodating on the company's part and very interested in continuing those discussions.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Is there sort of a time line when sort of these discussions and you guys all present your sort of findings to the market? Or is it sort of just ongoing?
Alan S. Armstrong: I would say it's ongoing, and certainly wouldn't try to speak for Corvex and Soroban. But I think from Williams' standpoint, we certainly are interested to reengage in the discussions. And again, just given the timing that we were up against the window closing ahead of a 10-K and our earnings release, we just wanted to make sure that we didn't -- that the compliance issues were first and foremost in the attendance of the various issues we need to deal with there.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. Fair enough. And then going back to the funding on Atlantic Sunrise. So do you guys envision sort of issuing sort of pick [ph] units in the future for -- to fund the equity on this project? Or do you think that you are -- the cost of equity will be low enough that WPZ to sort of to move forward with the common equity offering?
Donald R. Chappel: Faisal, one is that the significant funding is on a long way out. As I mentioned, the bulk of it is in 2017. So -- and we would expect the WPZ cost of capital to improve significantly, particularly as we -- as Alan cited here, we've got a lot of projects that we -- are expected to go in service here in '14 and '15, which will really boost WPZ cash flow and coverage. And as we do that and the coverage comes back to a -- I'll call it a more attractive level, we would expect WPZ will trade in line with fundamentals. So I'd say, we're optimistic that WPZ will come back in line here over the next year or so.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Chris Sighinolfi from Jefferies.
Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: I guess, first, Don if you could talk about maintenance CapEx. I realize in the prepared remarks you talked about some synergies that were realized in 4Q that led to the improved spend versus what you were guided in the third quarter. But I'm just wondering a bit more about that, given that we didn't see any change in '14 or '15 guidance, is that more of just a onetime synergy? And if so, what's sort of additional color around it?
Alan S. Armstrong: Let me take that, if I could, please. This is Alan. I think, first of all, the -- a couple of drivers to that. We have a lot of maintenance capital items that had been driving a lot of the costs in '11 and '12. So they were Clean Air Act issues. There was a lot of required inspections on the pipeline to be done by a certain period, smart pig inspections. And so we got a lot of that out of the way. If we also -- if you think about reducing risk on your systems and your asset integrity issues, you always want to hit the systems that have the most risk on them first. And I would just tell you that our costs have been based just assuming that we would continue to find the same number of anomalies on our systems, as we completed those smart pigging and some of the hydro testing. And in fact, as we've gotten further down the profile and the lower-risk assets, we've had less and less dig outs. We've had less and less repairs required, and so that has driven some of that out. In terms of -- so if you were the team that's responsible for that asset integrity work, when you do your forecasting for that, you go in assuming you're going to have a certain amount of digs and certain amount of anomalies to clear. And if you don't find them, then those costs don't show up. Certainly, the big cost is in the repairs of that. So that's one item. And certainly -- and because we had such rough winner out West, in particular, towards into the November and December time frame, it did slow down some of the works that we would have done in that period and would have expected to get done in the fourth quarter. And so a little bit of that'll get pushed in to '14. But it's not like you miraculously have a bunch of new capacity to get the work completed, so that tends to get pushed out into '15 as well. And so I would just tell you that we haven't backed off it all in terms of maintaining the integrity of our systems and spending the right money. We've just been very fortunate that a lot of the early work that we did was on some of our pipelines that we did most reconditioning, and as we moved into the less -- or the newer parts of our system and areas that we've had less issues, our costs are coming down as we do that pipeline inspection and asset integrity work.
Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Great, Alan. That's very helpful. As you think about the '14 and '15 programs, and just as a quick follow-up, in what you have planned for asset integrity. Might there be upside opportunities like what you mentioned when you find less there than what you think, given where you're moving to? Or is it kind of entirely a different aspect of the system?
Alan S. Armstrong: No. I think we're having a hard time, really, believing we're going to get that fortunate on a repeated basis. And so I would just tell you our assumptions haven't baked that in at this point, but certainly, that possibility exists, but we just haven't baked that in at this point. Secondly, I would tell you an area that may be an impact on that would be around well-connect capital. Again, this isn't built-in. Because we're seeing gas prices and NGL prices move up so nicely, we may see more drilling coming on, which might increase our well connect capital towards the last half year. We love spending that money due to the degree that's producing revenues for the future. But nevertheless, given the way we account for maintenance capital, we would include that well connect capital as maintenance capital.
Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. And I think that actually drills down to rather nicely out to questions I have on the West segment, Alan. We saw the ethane equity volumes come down again in a big way in 4Q. Obviously recognized, rejection's been something we grapple with all year. But I was curious, 2 questions out there. One, if there's something in particular that drove the change in 4Q that can be sort of isolated and highlighted? And then two, as I think about '14 and '15, with the commodity construct we're seeing today, if you've had any sort of revised views around the volume could be out there. I did see WPX had numbers out last week, calling some increased numbers out of their Piceance program, for example. Sort of how that might translate into what you guys are expecting out late?
Alan S. Armstrong: Great question. Let me ask Allison Bridges take that question.
Allison G. Bridges: Yes. We did have some -- a little bit of anomalies, I think, in the fourth quarter in that we were -- third parties were actually continuing to recover. And so we were actually giving them some of our equity ethane, which was a positive thing from our financial standpoint. And additionally, we did have a contract that terminated at the end of the third quarter. So those 2 things caused a rather large drop in the fourth quarter. We have been seeing some declines in volumes. As you said, we are starting to see some good signs with increase in gas prices, as well as WPX announcing that they were adding rigs. So we do believe that a little bit out in the guidance period, we're going to start to see arresting of some of those declines.
Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Great, very helpful. One final follow-up for me. Just to dovetail on what Timm had asked earlier about costs. Alan, we did see a very strong bead relative to your guidance in Atlantic-Gulf. Obviously, some cost creep continued into the Northeast. You had mentioned, as you have in earlier quarters, about sort of this week calibration or reallocation of costs more towards the Northeast given the activity. Was any of that present in the fourth quarter? Or is that sort of -- have we reached run rates we should expect from here?
Alan S. Armstrong: No. And just so you know, I mean, I think if you're just focused on the Northeast segment, you'll see movement. If you're looking at the total cost structure, you won't see that much movement as it relates to that allocation because it's basically just pulling cost out of area where there's less activity and less growth, and it's being applied again. That's done on a modified mass basis, which basically takes in as a primary allocation is the capital invested and the revenues. And so as both the capital invested and the revenues grow there, it will shift more costs to there. That doesn't necessarily mean that the cost of that business directly is going up, but it just is the way and the method that we allocate cost across the business. And of course, we need to do that because we have regulated assets in our businesses as well, and so we need to make sure that we keep proper tallies on how we allocate those costs, and we keep constant method going on how we do that. So to answer your question, as you'll probably continue to see some allocated costs even though, I would tell you, in terms of the lack of operating profit performance in the Northeast for the fourth quarter, very little of that was driven because we are already expecting that cost allocation. A lot of the drivers, really, a bunch of onetime issues that we had in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned earlier.
Operator: And we'll go next to Becca Followill with the U.S. Capital Advisors.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: On Atlantic Sunrise, are these 1.7 Bcf a day capacity incremental to the, call it, throughput on the system that's really running from south to north?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: So it doesn't reverse flow on any of the system to cannibalize the existing system? Or is it all incremental?
Alan S. Armstrong: Well, I think if you just looked at our initial flows back then and you looked at our initial flows after the project is done, those 2 numbers are additive.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: So it won't displace any of the existing, roughly, 60% of contracts that you have rolling off by 2016?
Alan S. Armstrong: No. The -- where the product -- projects are going and deliveries for it will be incremental. And so I think you could -- really, if you think about it, it's the amount of gas going off the system that you would see. And so while you may see the benefit of physical displacement allow us to increase our capacity, so in other words, we don't have to go build as much capital as you normally would think to get incremental volumes because you've got gas coming from both directions. The volumes leaving the system will increase by that amount.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: And then on Bluegrass, when should we expect a go or no-go decision?
Alan S. Armstrong: As we mentioned earlier, we're still in those discussions, and I don't really think we should pin that down. But -- because frankly, it's some really big commitments, and we think it's the right project, and it's taking some time to get people to make those huge and long-term commitments. But I'm really not willing to put a specific time line on that at this point, Becca.
Operator: And with no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the call back over to Alan Armstrong for any additional or closing remarks.
Alan S. Armstrong: Great. Thank you, Dana. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us. We remain very excited about the tremendous growth that we've got ahead of us. And a lot of the big capital investments, as I mentioned really on the backs of a lot equity, are really start to come in to '14. We're pleased with the performance we saw for the fourth quarter and particularly pleased with some of the operational reliability improvements that we're seeing across the systems. And so we look forward to talking to you in the future and continuing to talk about the great growth story we have here at Williams. Thanks.
Operator: Again, that does conclude today's presentation. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams and Williams Partners third quarter earnings conference call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John Porter: Thank you, Divona. Good morning, and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our websites, williams.com and williamslp.com. These items include yesterday's press releases with related schedules and the accompanying analyst packages; the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily; and an update to our data books, which contain detailed information regarding various aspects of our business. In addition to Alan, we also have the 4 leaders of our operating areas present with us. Frank Billings leads our Northeastern G&P operating area; Allison Bridges leads our Western operating area; Rory Miller leads our Atlantic Gulf area; and John Dearborn is here from our NGL & Petchem Services operating area. Additionally, our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to any questions. In yesterday's presentation and also in our data books, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan S. Armstrong: Great. Good morning, everyone, and thank you, John. Starting here on Slide 4. I love this cover that our IR team came up with beginning. It really depicts all the tremendous amount of activity and construction and project development that we have going on right now at the company and are currently managing. And certainly, this is what is -- will support the tremendous cash flow growth that supports our 20% dividend growth at WMB. It also -- I think it's important to note, this heavy CapEx burden also weighs heavy on our coverage during this supercycle of investment opportunities that we're thrilled to be a part of right now. But before I get into the slide, let me just very quickly remind you of our strategy that continues to guide all of our actions and certainly our investment decisions. And so our strategy, which is to be the premier provider of large-scale infrastructure to design, to maximize the opportunities created by the vastly greater supply of natural gas and natural gas products now known to exist in North America's unconventional resource plays. This is underpinned by our scale, which we see as a competitive advantage in all the areas that we operate. So wherever we are, you'll see us be big. And if we can't be the #1 or #2 in an area, you won't see us playing in a space like that because we think to have superior returns, you've got to have the advantages of scale that allow you to connect to your customers to the best markets. So we want our supply connected to the best markets, and we want our markets connected to the best supplies. And we want to be the infrastructure in between that continues to fuel this tremendous opportunity here that we have here in the U.S. to take advantage of low price natural gas, natural gas liquids and the olefins, derivatives off of that. So moving on to Slide 5 here. I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time on this because it really is just a overview of this presentation. But here is what we'll cover here this morning. First of all, I'll talk a little bit about our better-than-expected third quarter performance and the drivers for that beat and also show some detail on how we're accounting for the impact of our Geismar outage. Next, I'll also reaffirm our 20% dividend growth profile at WMB while lowering our distribution growth rate to the bottom of our earlier stated range for '14 and '15. So we're at the top end of the range here in '13, and we'll be moving to the bottom of that range, that 6% to 8% range for '14 and '15. And of course, that is designed to drive better coverage metrics at WPZ and along with something we're excited to announce and something we've been working on for a while, which is to provide you some detail on our Canadian asset dropdown. And that would be the existing assets that we plan to drop down in January of '14. Next, we'll review some drivers of our tremendous 60% DCF growth at WPZ throughout this guidance period. And then finally, we'll review our project execution scorecard that is so critical to our success, and we continue to show you. And so it's critical, not only for this guidance period but even beyond our guidance period as we continue to develop more and more fuel for our growth beyond 2015. So moving on to Slide 6 here. This is an overview of the third quarter, and it certainly was a good quarter and better than we expected on many metrics for the quarter. And so the thing I can tell you I am most excited about is where strategy is working. And finally, in this quarter, we saw our growth in our fee-based revenues begin to overcome the continual slide in the NGL margins. And so you can see there a $61 million increase in the fee revenues, and that's a 3Q of '13 compared to 3Q of '12. And so really thrilled to see that. In addition to that, despite the tremendous amount of development and effort we've got going into growing our business, we are also able to control cost and continue to lower cost on that same comparison of 3Q '13 to 3Q '12. So at WPZ, our DCF was up 20% as compared to 3Q of '12. And this was driven by that $61 million increase in the fee-based revenues at PZ. Primarily, this was driven by the tremendous growth in the Northeast and on Transco. And also, just to put that in perspective for you, that means a 9% increase in our fee-based revenues more than offset a 30% decline in our NGL margins during that period. Also, something I'm very excited about is the $19 million reduction in our O&M and G&A, again, in the face of tremendous growth across our system. Additionally, our WPZ maintenance CapEx was down $50 million as compared to '12, and we still are spending over $310 million this year in these maintenance capital expenditures. And we certainly -- and compared to '12, one of the drivers for that in '12, we had a lot of spending in our -- the asset integrity and the Clean Air Act issues related to our gas pipelines. And so we got a lot of that out of the way in '12. And in addition to that, our maintenance capital on our Midstream assets was actually down more significantly. And this was driven by lower well connect cost out West, and as well as we've been making some smart consolidations out West and retired some of our older higher-cost assets, like our Lybrook complex in the Four Corners area. And that allows us to obviously to then do not have to spend the money to maintain those assets over time. We continue to invest as required to maintain these safe and reliable assets. And in fact, we will invest over 35% of our segment profit from our pipes back into the proper maintenance of our 2 major gas pipelines, Transco and Northwest Pipeline. So the negative for the quarter certainly was the lack of contribution from our Geismar facility, and it only contributed $15 million to the DCF for the quarter. And this represents about a 13-day period between the 60-day waiting period on the BI and the planned 50-day turnaround. And we'll show here on the next slide and show some really good detail on how that works out. It's certainly fairly complex the way we're accounting for that Geismar impact. But I think it's really important to note here that even with the Geismar with this 20% growth in DCF, we only got $15 million of that 20% improvement out of Geismar for the quarter. So really truly a strong DCF for WPZ during the quarter. And we'll show here on Slide 7 -- now moving to Slide 7. You can see what we show as the impact from Geismar. And so I'll focus your attention here to the $79 million in the bottom of the second column, and what that represents is the negative impact or the delta that we estimate we would have seen we did see in the quarter versus what we would have seen if Geismar would have been up and running on a normal basis in the pre-expansion mode. So to keep this simple on this chart, you can think about this business as about a $1 million per day of impact to our DCF and in the pre-expansion mode. And so you can see there that if you -- the 60-day waiting period accounts to a total of $60 million of impact in 2013. And you can see the 50-day turnaround amounts to $50 million of impact, looking over there to the right column. So really only about 13 days of profit in the third quarter associated with the business interruption claim that we submitted for the third quarter. And this combined with the receipt of an actual insurance payment of $50 million related to the incident during the third quarter allowed us to record this $15 million of DCF in the third quarter. So we also show on this slide how that has been handled in our accounting for both GAAP and adjusted numbers, and we provide some additional detail in the appendix. So anyway, fairly complex, but bottom line here is we think this hurt us. Having Geismar down for the third quarter hurt us by about a total of $94 million, offset by the $15 million of DCF that we recorded in the quarter. Moving on to Slide 8 then. This is the -- a little more detail on our Canadian asset dropdown, and so we certainly are excited to be announcing this. This really comes at the start-up now of our last big expansion, our ethane, ethylene recovery facilities that are now in operation at Fort McMurray. And so we've got pretty big window here now between the next big tranche of assets that'll come on, which will be the Canadian -- sorry, the CNRL Horizon facilities and the PDH facilities. So this is a nice window for us to drop down these assets that are now up and cash flowing the existing assets that are up and cash flowing. So a little bit about this business. Certainly, as we've explained before, we've got great competitive advantage in this business. And because we really are the only parties up here that are taking the off-gas and extracting these highly valuable products out of the off-gas, and we've got the right assets, the right experience and the right operating team to be able to continue that. And so we're excited about our -- that continued competitive advantage leading further growth for opportunities like Syncrude in the future. We also are expecting about $200 million of DCF from these assets in 2014 and 2015. And one thing I think is really unique about these assets is they were quieter [ph]. Though they're a typical processing plant and fractionation, they have such a tremendous resource upstream off them that is invested by the upgraders that we really have very little capital required to keep these assets, keep the free cash flow coming out of these assets partly due to the fact we don't have any well connect cost, we don't have to go secure new supplies for these assets and partly because these assets are relatively new as we've been expanding these assets over the last 10 to 15 years. So very excited about being able to do this, and we will be funding this through WMB taking back 100% paid-in-kind units on -- so on a transaction, this will add DCF coverage for both '14 and '15. And as the many projects come online, this will continue to support our industry-leading dividend growth beyond 2015 when the PIK units convert. So said another way, that certainly, the PIK units give us some room on our coverage here. So we think this is a really smart transaction for WMB and Bridges to win this tremendous amount of capital investment that we're making over this period. About $8 billion really starts to kick in, in '15 and beyond. So the planned dropdown of these currently in-service assets is subject to the successful negotiation of the transaction between Williams and Williams Partners. And because of that, we're not going to be pinning down a price, a transaction price at this time. But I will provide you a little more insight into what we're expecting here. We certainly recognize that a portion of these assets have commodity risk. And as a result of that, the multiple need to be lower than what you might normally expect. And so just to decode that a little bit at this point, we expect that multiple to be below a 7 multiple for this transaction, and so not too different than the kind of multiples, all-in multiples that we saw with the ethylene cracker. Even though I'll remind you that these assets, for instance, the ethane and ethylene business are backed by some fixed rates in terms of capital recovery for the ethane and ethylene projects. Another really important point I would make on this slide is that our projects like the CNRL Horizon project, which is underway and we are certainly up and spending capital dollars on that, and as well as our PDH project and potentially, the Syncrude processing expansion are staying at WMB, and will be great future dropdown candidates for WPZ. And in fact, just to kind of put that all in perspective for you, WMB continues to build out a tremendous backlog of future dropdown candidates in both Canada and the Gulf Coast PetChem area that we've talked about in the past. And so just the projects that are approved and underway. We've got more than $2 billion of additional dropdown candidates for WMB, that would be dropped down to WPZ. And in addition to that, we also have the exciting Bluegrass and Moss Lake JV with Boardwalk. So we are building out a tremendous amount of dropdown opportunity, and that doesn't even include things that we're continuing to develop like the Syncrude opportunity in Canada as well. So plenty of continued growth for WPZ as WMB continues to develop some major projects. Moving on to Slide 9. You can see here the very impressive story of DCF growth from 2012 really as we increase $231 million from '12 up to $1.72 billion in '13, then in '14 going up $630 million to $2.35 billion and then up another $435 million in '15 versus up to $2.78 billion. So some very impressive growth going on in the space. And I would just say a couple of key points here. First of all, the coverage ratio that you see here does assume the distribution increase of the 9% this year and 6% in '14 and '15. So the coverage is over and above that distribution growth. And importantly, in '14 and '15, we are assuming no additional IDR waivers from WMB. So really working here to get WMB -- or sorry, WPZ to a position of the coverage ratio that we're comfortable with. And certainly, the Canadian dropdown and the reduction in the growth rate are the key tools that we've employed here to accomplish that. The drivers throughout this entire period, as you can see, are the tremendous amount of portfolio projects and the one dropdown that we have built into WPZ right now. I'm also going to make a few notes here on just there's been some confusion, I think, on the IDR waiver for 2013. And just to be a little clear on that, we are only planning on using $140 million of the $200 million that we have previously announced at the cap. And so what we did say was that we would contribute up to $200 million of waivers from WMB to WPZ as required to maintain a 0.9 coverage ratio. The good news is because of our better-than-expected performance at WPZ here in the -- about the third quarter and throughout the balance of the year that we do not think that we will need to contribute any more than another $50 million on top of the $90 million that is being put forth today. So anyway, good news on that from both the PZ side and the MB side. Another comment I'll make here quickly is on the capital side. And you'll see in the CapEx changes as you review them you'll see we've added about $375 million or about 4.6% increase over the $8 billion of spending during this period. And there's really 2 primary drivers for that. First of all, a $200 million increase in our Gulfstar 1 project. And let me remind you that Williams Partners has a 51% share of that project, so that'd be $102 million net to our interest. And so this brings the real net increase in capital spending to about 3.5% over this $8 billion. And in addition to that, though, to really describe what's causing that, we have 2 new Transco projects that have been added to guidance during this period as well. And so Transco just continues to see tremendous opportunity on the market and in particular, of expanding as people continue to build a demand for the very low-priced natural gas and the tremendous growth opportunities that the Eastern Seaboard represents for Transco. And so let me move on now to Slide 10. And this is our scorecard that we continue to show you. And just a few things to highlight here in terms of changes to this. First of all, you'll see that the third quarter projects, which was the Canadian ethane recovery and Transco's Northeast supply link are now online. And so we're excited about that. The investment in ACMP, I will tell you, is not listed here, so we have a lot of capital here. But in addition, we have growth coming from the ACMP investments. And also remind you that with the exception of the Geismar expansion project and the Canadian projects, the PDH and the CNRL upgrader, these remaining projects are all backed up by fee-based revenues. And so that is what's continuing to drive that increase in fee-based revenue. I think what's really impressive here as we continue to add -- in fact, we've added one project here, the Hillabee Expansion, to this Transco portion. But we also have a smaller project. It's not listed on here. But we continue to really build out the Transco expansion projects, and we think those are great projects for both WPZ and then ultimately flowing to WMB's cash. So that's the picture here. We've already talked about the Gulfstar increase, and I think that's the majority of the issues you'll see in the Northeast. Our spending is actually pretty flat, a little bit of movement between the various asset areas but generally pretty flat. Moving on to Slide 11. And this is the picture of the Northeast. Certainly, we're making a major reduction in the rate of growth for OBM. And -- but I certainly want to keep this in perspective here. We have now grown these volumes in year-to-date '13 versus year-to-date '12 by over 80%. So despite a lower projected growth rate at OBM, our growth here is tremendous. It continues to be tremendous, and we couldn't be more excited to be in what we think is the growth area in the U.S. for -- from both the Marcellus and the Utica. And so this growth, as you know, does not depict our exposure -- economic exposure that we have to both ACMP and the Blue Racer. And it also doesn't include any growth from Three Rivers. Yet we're still showing a 73% growth in this period from '13 through '15. So we've lowered, as you can see there, pretty significantly OBM, but the primary drivers for that being a lot of the private equity groups that were invested out here have now sold out to parties like Chevron and Statoil. And I would just say that they are more patient investors. And I think they're waiting to make sure that the infrastructure is available to get both their gas and their NGLs to market. And so we think they obviously make great customers for Bluegrass, and -- but they're going to look at these resources and make sure that they can get their products to market and to good markets before they go into more aggressive drilling programs out here. And so that's really one of the major changes here as we shifted from more aggressive independents owning some of these resources to more patient investors like Chevron and Statoil. Moving on to Slide 12. This is just a big list of all the various accomplishments and the things that continue to go on here. Certainly, the Bluegrass open season and the continued growth on Transco were kind of a big highlights that I would point out to you here. The Atlantic Sunrise open season was overwhelming, I guess, is the best term we have to describe it. And really very, very excited about the kind of response and how quickly we're going to be able to bring that to closure given the very strong response there. And so it's nice to be in a position of having to figure out how you're going to size a project and fit in all of the demand that we saw from that. So that's a very exciting development during the period. Additionally, we hit a new record high in the Northeast of 2 Bcf per day on a monthly average during the third quarter. And as well, ACMP announced earlier, as I'm sure you all saw, that they were raising their LP distribution up 23% in the third quarter versus the third quarter of '12. And that is big news for us because that really accelerates the Williams GP, first into the high splits a lot quicker than we were planning on. So that investment opportunity is proving out very well for us, and we continue to be very excited about our relationship with ACMP's management team and our ability to continue to support their tremendous growth opportunities that they have in and around their business. So couldn't be happier with the way that asset or that investment is performing and certainly thrilled to see the high quality of the ACMP management team that continues to perform very well. Moving on here to the closing slide. Just to remind you that we are all in relative to this natural gas infrastructure supercycle. We think it's the right place to be. We like a commodity that we think is so low compared to crude oil and other commodities that it is going to continue to drive demand, and ultimately, that demand is going to drive continued supply growth. So we really are bullish on our situation where we sit, and you're going to continue to see us invest heavily into this space while this opportunity to build out this major infrastructure that will be here for many decades to come gets built. And we don't intend to back off of our heavy investment cycle while the opportunity presents itself. We also continue to be excited about our 20% WMB cash dividend growth through '15. And I think if you really stop and look at how all of these big projects are coming on in '15 and the continued growth cycle that we see beyond that, I think you'll see that we've got good reason to continue to support a very strong dividend growth beyond 2015. And again, would just remind you that we've got over $1.1 billion of DCF growth in '13 through '15. And this is not based on acquisitions that we might speculate on. It's not based on projects that we're speculating we might win. And these are projects that we are out and developing and building right now and all identified and contacted. So very excited about where we stand today. Excited about some of the changes we made here for the third quarter and look forward to hearing your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to Christine Cho with Barclays.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: In last quarter's data book, you guided towards $110 million to $200 million of segment profit plus DD&A for the WMB NGL and Petchem Services in 2014. Can you help us reconcile between that number and the $200 million DCF number you gave for the dropdown? Is most of that driven by the higher propylene prices you are now using in commodity assumption?
Donald R. Chappel: Don Chapelle. Yes, it's largely an improvement in margins in Canada as well as lower expected corporate allocated costs. And that's just based on formulas that we continue to implement. So our new organization structure that we announced at the beginning of the year is, I think, bearing some fruit. And our costs are somewhat less than perhaps what we expected before in the Canadian business. It's getting a bit less of that. So I think those are the -- or the NGL Petchem Services business, excuse me in making a more broad statement, is getting a bit less of that. So those are the primary drivers.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then how should we think about the potential timing for the additional dropdown that Canada, the 2 other off-gas processing contracts, the 1 -- maybe 2 PDH facilities, maybe Bluegrass. Would you be open to drop it as soon as it's cash flow generating, which may not be a lot in the beginning? Or would you wait until it's a little more mature?
Donald R. Chappel: I think it's too soon to answer that question. I think certainly, be eligible to drop at any time quite frankly. But we think that the right answer is to build it at Williams and then drop it once it's in service. And I think we have to take a look at the cash flow profile and determine if it's right on start-up or if it's some time after start-up as the cash flows ramp up. So I think that's a question that's a ways out. It's couple of years out at the earliest, and we'll continue to study that.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then what are the tax implications for dropping the Canadian assets? Are you guys subject to any repatriation tax?
Donald R. Chappel: We expect -- and I think you'll see it on our 10-Q, to record a tax provision of just over $200 million, cash taxes of about $140 million in the near term. And so it's really an acceleration. We expected that at some point that we'd have repatriation and we'd have a tax to pay. This will accelerate those cash taxes to the tune of $140 million. We'll be able to use excess cash balances, cash balances we have on hand to pay the $140 million. And then after that, we'll have the Canadian tax. Right now the Canadian tax rate is very low, perhaps 0 because much like in the U.S., we have high capital spend and accelerated depreciation that's shielding taxes. But at some point, we'll pay Canadian taxes, and we'll get a U.S. tax credit for the taxes paid in Canada, and we'll pay the differential of U.S. tax. So fairly -- so the onetime cash tax cost is about $140 million, and then beyond that, it will be some incremental amount of U.S. tax over and above what we would typically pay in Canada. Canadian statutory rate is 25%. So again, it's factored, but it's not huge relative to the value of the assets.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, very helpful. How comfortable are you with the new numbers at OBM? Are we largely derisked here? And also the other segment costs in the Northeast segment seem to be really high. Is there anything onetime here in nature? Or is this kind of more of a run rate we should be going off of?
Francis E. Billings: Sure, this is Frank. I think on the -- relative to the Northeast in the volume, I would say that we have probably derisked that some. And really, what I would say is the primary factors. I would call 2013 kind of the lost year. I mean, we really didn't get much volume growth. And basically, what we've -- we're anticipating and what our producers are projected is kind of push, kind of what we were expecting in '13 and kind of roll in most of the drilling plans forward. On the cost side, if you look quarter-to-quarter, we did have -- looks like a pretty significant increase in quarter-to-quarter, other segment costs and expenses around $22 million. But in that number is -- some of that 9 -- the $9 million adjustment that's down below, and we had the continued liability that we booked. We also had some slip repairs that hit us in the third quarter as well as some writeoffs of some investments that we started to undertake in OBM but then did follow through with those. Or we much changed the project scopes, though we had some costs that we had to -- that we're capitalizing, we've had to take to expense. So I think going forward, we'll have a run rate that's less than what we saw in the third quarter. In OBM, we have a liquids system, a gas system, processing plant and fractionation. And we've really kind of set up our organization to have some of those assets in place in 2013. Those assets aren't place in 2013. We won't be looking at material or much staffing increases as we get into '14. So really, we're going to kind of hold and redistribute our [indiscernible] once our assets [indiscernible] and we'll have better defined after the construction and commissioning is completed. So we did have some items in Q3 that drove that number up, but our run rate should be less than that.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, great. And then last question for me. The spread between Texas and Louisiana ethylene prices have obviously been a focus given the pipeline between the 2 states that's down. How are your insurance proceeds going to account for this? I think it was initially thought that the pipeline will be down through year end, but now I'm hearing that it's going to be pushed out further than that.
Donald R. Chappel: Christine, this is Don. The insurance policies provide coverage in terms of the lost value in production. So we'll calculate the -- we know what the lost production is. We'll take a look at the market prices, and that would be the basis for our claim. With respect to the pipeline, that's something we're continuing to study to determine what effects it may or may not have. So I'll just pause there and perhaps -- I don't know if Alan or John want to add anything regarding pricing on the pipeline.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Well, just because I asked because are you going to be getting Mont Bellevue pricing or Louisiana pricing? I mean, there's like a $0.20 spread between the 2 points, last time I checked.
John R. Dearborn: Yes, and perhaps I could make some comments there. This is John Dearborn. If we look at the dynamics in the market there, right, with our plant down and Chevron's Evangeline pipeline out of service, the Texas market has got length, and Louisiana is short, right? So that's what we always see, and that's what's driving the premium between the 2 markets. As we look forward and we bring Geismar back up and we expect that some time, Evangeline will be back in service, that same market dynamic is going to diminish in its significance. But let's remember also that second quarter next year, we move into the industry's ethylene cracker turnaround season, and I believe there are about 4 crackers that go into turnaround then. And so as we take a look at all that, in total, we're looking forward at strong demand [indiscernible], which I think is going to support very strong ethylene margins into next year and through next year if we could take you into that line of reasoning, Christine.
Donald R. Chappel: Again, this is Don. And I just remind everyone that this pipeline outage is a short-term issue. And we don't expect that to extend all that long.
John R. Dearborn: And recall also that's a Chevron asset. So I think for -- the true story that you'll have to look to Chevron for that as well.
Operator: And we'll go next to Holly Stewart with Howard Weil.
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Just maybe a high-level question on the Northeast infrastructure issues. I think you guys are probably in one of the better -- or have one of the better vantage points on the pipe side. So what are you seeing in the Northeast, what alleviates the differentials, and what's your view of the differentials going forward?
Alan S. Armstrong: Holly, I'll take that. This is Alan. First of all, I think there's been a lot of focus on just the Northeast dry area. And certainly, there is more infrastructure over in the Southwest and over in the Utica area, but we're certainly seeing continued a lot of development over there as well. And I would say a lot of pressure has come on -- came on here in the third quarter from 2 factors, one being that certain pipes were not yet opened. So Tennessee expansion wasn't online yet, and so that, we think, will help alleviate. But as well, a lot of new gas came on in the quarter that wasn't necessarily from drilling, but it was from infrastructure tie-ins, not necessarily on our systems. But some of the adjacent systems really worked off a lot of the well connects and a lot of the pending completions. So we saw a tremendous amount of gas come on -- trying to come on in the third quarter, and it was coming into the face of the market that was lower. And so the Northeast Supply Link Project is now up and running, and so -- on Transco, so that's 250. I can tell you that's hardly a drop in the bucket compared to the kind of demand that we're seeing for the infrastructure being built out of the area. But I do believe that the fall shoulders out there are going to be a little worse than the spring shoulders because this is kind of a rare situation up here where you have the Leidy Storage, which is a very large market area storage that refills in the spring but, of course, was full in the fall. And so nowhere for that gas to go either into those local markets or to the South. I think pipelines like Transco are -- now make or got plenty of support for new infrastructure to debottleneck systems to be able to carry markets to the South. And certainly, the Atlantic Sunrise open season was indicative of that. And as well, of course, the Constitution project, we think, will alleviate some of the challenges up in the Northeast area. But I will just say this. People that are not paying attention to that and not planning for their capital expansion are taking some pretty big bets, I would say, and some pretty big risk. And those that are continuing to plan and plan well, I think, will be the winners at the end of the day and will be able to access growing markets on systems like Transco to the South. And so I think we're getting after it, and as usual, the market -- we tend to wait a little too late to get the infrastructure built. And we'll probably be having the same discussion on Bluegrass here in '15 before that capacity comes on to get the NGLs out of there as well. But I certainly think the market has gotten a strong signal from the gas-on-gas competition it saw this quarter, and it seems to be responding to support continued infrastructure development out of the area.
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Got it, okay. And then I guess you gave an explanation for the, I guess, weakness in the Northeast volumes compared to maybe what you'd initially forecasted. Are -- in terms of these new customers or now the majors, are -- what are you assuming for growth in '14 and '15? I guess my point, are you comfortable that your new targets have some of their plans factored in?
Alan S. Armstrong: It is. It's really kind of built from the ground up, looking at the drilling plans that we've discussed with the producers. And so we feel pretty comfortable. I would certainly -- wouldn't try to tell anybody it's not without risk because there's a lot of continued infrastructure development to be built out there. But I would tell you that we feel pretty comfortable with the schedule and the detail that we built behind the volumes at this point. And so it really is kind of a grounds-up review from each of our producers and their drilling plans out there. I do think there -- perhaps there's some opportunity to improve on that. If we saw some better pricing signals and people become convinced the Bluegrass is going to be -- get built, we might see some even better development into the '15 timeframe as people gear up for that.
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then you kind of led me into my final question. Can you just maybe explain the open season for Bluegrass and how these commitments will really work on the Bluegrass pipeline and the LPG terminal?
Alan S. Armstrong: Well, I would just say that the open season for the pipeline is completely separate from the fractionation and the export terminal discussions. Having said that, we recognize that customers don't want a pipeline to nowhere. And so that's why we've been working so hard at developing both the storage, the terminal and the export facilities is that we've got to be able to provide customers with a comprehensive solution. And I would -- the thing I'm fairly encouraged by in that regard is with the discussions we're having on the export side, we're seeing interest in customers wanting to know where that supply is going to come from as well. And so I think the market's really starting to come together in terms of the supply side and the demand side. And we see that as one of our critical roles in the industry right now is bringing together that strong demand that we're seeing from international players back upstream to our customers on the upstream side and being the party providing the infrastructure in between.
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. So it's not all comprehensive in terms of at all getting built.
Alan S. Armstrong: Well, I would say that at the end of the day, people are going to want to know what their frac deal is. But that's a -- just because of regulatory process, that's a bifurcated process. So we deal with them in the open season, and we make sure that everybody has a chance to weigh in on the capacity that they want and the terms of the capacity they want on the regulated side. And so we make sure that's a nondiscriminatory process. And then second to that, then there's a discussion around what people's needs are for storage, fractionation and export capacity. But I would say that most customers are going to want to know what their deal is on both sides of that. So on one hand, they're separated for regulatory purposes, and on the other hand, people need to know what their downstream services are going to be.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Stephen Maresca from Morgan Stanley.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just sticking on Laurel Mountain and OBM for a second, and to be more specific, you took Northeast adjusted segment profit and DD&A down about 20% in '14 and '15. Can you help us understand what changed so materially in such a short period from last quarter's forecast to now? I know touched upon it, Alan. But is it as simple as just your drilling plans are off because of the change in ownership? And as a subset to that, it seems like you dropped the '16 and '17 kind of bar chart forecast you had in your slide deck in terms of gathering volumes for the Marcellus. Did -- is that a sign or do you not feel as comfortable forecasting that anymore in light of the changes in ownership from private equity to bigger majors?
Alan S. Armstrong: I would just say our -- what we're seeing from the majors is, as I said, just a more careful effort on their part to make sure they maximize the NPV of their reserves and not just to quick-drive towards IPs [ph] and volumes. And so -- sorry, IPs and reserve growth. And so I would just say that we've -- what shifted really was having -- sitting down and wanting to make sure that we weren't investing capital too far out in front of the reserve packages that we're seeing there and not taking on additional risk. And so that resulted in sitting down and getting very detailed granular analysis on what their drilling plans were. And as you know, that's a little harder to predict because the motives of the majors are more around allocating capital around, and so it's a little harder to predict than somebody who just has one resource to go develop. And so I would just say we've gotten a lot more conservative in our approach towards that forecast, and it's just built from the ground up. And that probably is -- the major shift that we made, Stephen, was moving from a resource capability play to a detailed analysis of what the producers are actually doing and their actual drilling plans.
Donald R. Chappel: And, Steve, we ceased to project '16 and '17 given the challenges we've had in projecting the next couple of years. So we've -- we're really focused on projecting '14 and '15 and just conforming the volume forecast to our guidance period and really not trying to get too far out given all the variables that we see in the Northeast.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, appreciate that. Moving to Bluegrass, I just have a couple of questions here. Alan, do you have the same level of confidence in this project getting completed as you did on the last call given the large competitor project proposal? And can you talk at all -- ballpark types of project returns you would expect? And then I have a second one just on the funding after that.
Alan S. Armstrong: Well, I would say on the confidence level, I think this might surprise some people. But the confidence -- my confidence level is not really all that driven at this point by the competition, by the competing project just because we think we're so far ahead in terms of development of the project and details and how far ahead we are in terms of getting project developed. I think the -- so I would just say that's not really that big a factor frankly. I think the challenge that still remains is producers knowing their drilling plans, being committed to the drilling plans. And so I think we may get a lot of commitment, but we're going to need to be weighing how solid that those volumes will be and how much we can count on those volumes being there. And so that's what we're in the process of doing with the open season. And as I've said before, we're very excited about Bluegrass. We think it's a really key piece of infrastructure for the Marcellus and the Utica. And we think that it really, really needs to be installed at the end of 2015 to protect our investment on the upstream side and other investments or other more indirect investments that we have up there. So we think it's very important, and we think Bluegrass is the only one that can really meet that kind of time line. So that gives us a lot of confidence, but we're also -- we got a lot of projects to invest in, and we're going to make sure that it's a sensible investment for us before we plow -- start really plowing the big money into it in the first quarter of 2014.
Donald R. Chappel: And, Steve, this is Don. In terms of financing, again, we have a partner at Bluegrass. And I'd also note that we've been approached by others, industry players and financial players that would like to invest in the project, and we may or may not choose to partner with others. But beyond that will be a combination of debt and equity to maintain our credit rating goals, which we have previously consistently espoused as investment-grade ratings.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. One follow-up there. Have you thought about something at all, doing something with your Access GPL [ph] stake, to monetize that and create some liquidity? Or is that not something that's on the table right now?
Donald R. Chappel: All right. I think all of our assets are things that we evaluate all of the time, and certainly, those are assets that we continue to look at as well. So I certainly don't want to create an expectation, but we certainly look at all the levers that we have to pull as we look at potential financing.
Operator: And we'll go next to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Not to stay too much on the Northeast GMP, but we do have a pretty significant cut in EBITDA but not really any change in the CapEx forecast, from what I can tell from last quarter. So we're effectively saying we're getting lower returns on capital. I must -- I'm missing. Is there any reason why the CapEx budget may not have gone down given the slower volume ramp?
Francis E. Billings: Yes, this is Frank. What we've done is we basically cut more of the capital out in the out years. We've taken out the third train, frac train. We've pushed out the second, third and fourth processing plants. So we've kind of -- basically, we're focused on installing the -- let's say those foundational assets, the second frac expansion, the stabilization plant, the deethanizers, the ethane pipeline. Once we get all of those assets in place in by 2Q of '14, we'll -- pretty much of that, majority of those what I would say is the foundational assets in place. Some of the assets have installed costs, have gone up some, so that's part of the reason we've kind of had -- we haven't had the 2014 capital change. If you look, most of it shifted from '13 to '14, and that's the representative of the shift in in-service date. And then most of our growth capital has been pushed out to match the volumes being pushed out.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. The -- just shifting over to Geismar. Can you give us an update on where you are with some of the regulatory side of that in terms of the -- whether it's OSHA or [indiscernible]the other folks sitting there, looking at it?
Alan S. Armstrong: Sure. I'll have John Dearborn answer that for us.
John R. Dearborn: Sure, and thanks very much for the question. Our relationship with both the agencies remains extremely strong and excellent. And we're committed to keeping it up certainly that way. With the government shutdown that we all witnessed here the last few weeks or so, we've suffered a bit of a delay, all right, as that shut down the CSB and the OSHA work for a bit of a while. However, prior to that shutdown, we had all the necessary protocols in place to continue our work around the propane propylene fractionator that was damaged. And so we've continued our work, and we don't expect to suffer any delay in what we're doing as a result. One of the other things, though, that I'd like to bring to your attention in order to continue to build this relationship with OSHA and CSB is, you might have noticed that we've released the findings of the Williams investigation, and we're taking care to communicate those findings to all of the important stakeholders, of course, our employees being one of them. But we took the time and effort to communicate that to OSHA and CSB, and of course, they were grateful to that -- to us for that. Bottom line is we still expect the OSHA to issue their report around the beginning of the New Year, and that's the next important milestone, I think, relative to the federal regulatory agencies.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Very helpful. And then last one for me just on the costs. You did actually take out a lot of costs, it looks like out of the West segment. And I'm just wondering if we should think of that as a sustainable new run rate? Or is there any kind of onetime lower OpEx you may have had there?
Allison G. Bridges: I think -- this is Allison Bridges. Yes, we have seen some lower cost especially as a result of some of the reorganization that Don spoke about earlier, and some are the allocated costs that we get in the plants.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Carl Kirst with BMO.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Just actually a few clarifications of things that were said prior and maybe first starting on the Northeast on OBM. And, Frank, I think you mentioned this, but just to be clear that essentially, the pushout that we have seen in some of the milestones, the Moundsville fractionator, et cetera, that is all very deliberate with respect to matching up to industry activity, right? That's got nothing to do with execution, is that correct?
Francis E. Billings: I would say that the Moundsville frac train 3 is probably associated more with preserving that decision to be in line with the Bluegrass decision when we make that determination. I would say that moving the Moundsville frac train from 3 or 4Q of '13 into 2Q '14 is a function of just physical execution of the projects that we've seen in that area.
Donald R. Chappel: So to be clear on that, the demand is there for the first expansion or the Phase 2 Moundsville, and it's a matter of getting that project completed. The decision for laying down third is just because we think Bluegrass will reduce the need for local fractionation. And so we think that we're becoming more and more confident on the timing of Bluegrass such that we don't need to have both the local frac and a Bluegrass solution.
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes, definitely, the second frac train at Moundsville with 30,000 barrels a day is definitely needed as well as the stabilization plants and the deethanizers. So those are all on track for completion in '14 to support the drilling programs in place.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. No, I -- that's helpful. And then, Alan, just to kind of go back to the Bluegrass and understanding the commercial sensitivity of where we are right now, but I guess, as you guys have opened the biddings -- the open season here. Is the general approach a minimum take-or-pay type of commitment? Or isn't there something where, for the right price, you're willing to take volume risk?
Donald R. Chappel: Yes, because that's a regulated asset, we offered out a, I think, very intelligent response to the market that allows us a considerably higher rate for people that are just wanting to dedicate acreage but not make volume commitments. And then a very attractive rate to the degree people are willing to make a volume commitment. And there's various steps in between that. And so we basically provided a menu for customers, and then we still -- once we get all that built into our analysis in terms of those options, then we can decide whether that we think that degree of support justifies the investment and the project. So it is a menu, and it's, like I said, a very attractive rate if you compare it to, like, an ATEX ethane where it's a pay -- ship-or-pay kind of obligation on one hand. Then on the other hand, up to a volume dedication with -- or sorry, an acreage dedication have much higher rate but one that gives producer flexibility.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, appreciate the clarification. And then maybe just last question back on Geismar and the business interruption insurance. And I guess now that we have $50 million recorded agreed to, I guess, by the insurance companies, and I guess the number is refined a little bit more from sort of the initial preliminary estimate. Don, do you feel more comfortable around the uncertainty range, if you will, around that number today versus, say, for instance, on the second quarter call? Meaning, have there been deliberations with the insurance companies that have tightened perhaps the deviation of where that number can go to? Or is it basically, each time a new claim is filed, it's a new claim, a new process, so to speak?
Donald R. Chappel: No, I think we feel comfortable with our claim amount. Clearly, we have a good read of the policy, and we certainly know the lost production, the actual amounts to be determined based on the market prices and we would have realized. So that'll be dependent on what happens on the market over the coming quarters. But certainly, in terms of the volume, the lost production, we know that pretty darn well. So we think we've got a solid basis for our estimate here. I think the initial $50 million payment evidence is good faith on the part of the insurers. They stepped up and paid us $50 million in advance of our actual claims because our out of pocket around the physical damage was not that substantial yet and we only had 13 days of covered loss under business interruption during the month of August. So they actually, I think, made a good-faith early payment. So I think that's a good sign. Our next covered loss under business interruption would be for a partial month in October, so kind of the end of October. That's when we assume that the expanded plan will come back to service. So we'll file a claim for the month of October during the month of November, and then we would to expect it will take the insurers a month or so to respond to us. And we're -- and that will be the process every month. So partial month in October filed in November, give the insurers a bit of time to review that claim and respond to it. And then we'll have a full month loss in the month of November, file that claim in December, and again, the insurers, a bit of time to respond to that. So I think from a process standpoint, it's pretty well established. I think volumetrically, we know what our losses are, and we're mitigating the losses to the best of our ability, the economic losses. And then I think we'll see where market prices turn out. But again, we've outlined in our guidance what we expect the lost profits to be and the market price assumptions we've used there, and that's really what's guiding this claim.
Operator: And next, we'll go to Bradley Olsen with Tudor Pickering.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: We saw on the Leidy Southeast project, most of the shippers on that project were downstream or LDC. Are you seeing more upstream demand as you've gone out with the open season on Atlantic Sunrise?
Rory Lee Miller: Yes. Alan, would you like me to take that?
Alan S. Armstrong: Please, Rory. Thank you.
Rory Lee Miller: Yes, Bradley, this is Rory Miller. It has been changing, and there was an earlier question about pricing in the Northeast. Of course, we're looking through a knot whole, a bit there. But certainly, what we've on the -- our current Leidy system that moves about 3 Bcf a day, there's much more gas than that trying to get into that line every day. We've got 8 Bcf a day of interconnections there. And so there's a lot of gas-on-gas competition for things that are playing in the spot market, and the prices have been at huge discounts to the Henry Hub. So I think that really is leading up to the answer to your question, and that's that we've seen a lot stronger response from the producer community. That being said, the people that made requests within the open season were fairly balanced between the market side and the supply side. But the producers were definitely stepping up in a much bigger way than what we've historically seen on Transco.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And you alluded earlier to having interest from potential partners in the Bluegrass project. And in the past, with projects like Constitution, you've obviously brought E&P partners into the project to secure volumes. Have you found so far that there are E&P shippers who are maybe making their participation in Bluegrass contingent on getting a significant equity stake in the project?
Alan S. Armstrong: No, we really haven't seen that from the key customers that we're talking to because it's such a big investment. Mostly -- usually, when we have the parties that are wanting to take equity, it's a project that's fairly specific to their needs. So for, instance, Constitution with Cabot. That project was mostly -- capacity mostly taken by Cabot, and they wanted to make sure they were involved and had a stake in making sure the project was executed well and as well enjoyed some of the economic benefit of their capacity obligations. I think in Bluegrass, we've got a variety of different shippers such that it's not enough -- nobody has a dominant position in the pipeline, like we've seen on some of those other assets. Having said that, I would tell you there's a lot of interest from more strategic players, I would say, in wanting to have an interest. But it's likely not going to be the -- from the E&P side for the reasons I stated.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Got it. And the MOU that you alluded to last year when you acquired the ACMP interest that Chesapeake would -- at least intended to commit volumes, is that still an agreement that's in place as it pertains to Bluegrass?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then just jumping to the Canadian side, just in rough numbers, maybe when you think about the top line in the Canadian off-gas processing business, how much of the revenue is there? And I realized it's kind of a key polar arrangement in the off-gas processing, but what percentage of that margin is coming from the olefins side versus from just the NGL side?
Donald R. Chappel: We'll have to get back to you on that. It's -- that mix has moved a little bit just recently as now we're starting up the ethane recovery plant. And that business, as I remind you, is a floor -- has a margin on it that has a floor that we're operating at because ethane is it's based off of Bellevue ethane. And therefore, that will be a fixed fee that will not be commodity-sensitive. But we can get back to you some detail. I don't have that right off the top of my head here.
John R. Dearborn: That would -- and it is John. The precise number for the majority would be NGLs and the minority being the -- being olefins up in Canada today.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And just one final one. Looking through the guidance, and there are a couple of other questions that alluded to this point, in the Western segment, you mentioned some of the things in the field that you were doing more efficiently. And certainly, it looks as though there was a big move up in 2013 full year EBITDA guidance, and fairly sizable move in '14 and then a little bit smaller move revising upwards in 2015. Maybe just qualitatively, if you could talk about why is it that the benefit from those cost-cutting or efficiency gain initiatives that you're taking gave a larger -- provided you with a larger step-up in guidance in '13 and '14 than it did in '15?
Alan S. Armstrong: Well, I think what you're really seeing there is just a lack of confidence in drilling volumes continuing out West is really what's driving most of that. And so the cost savings, I think, are very apparent to us there. But I would just say I think most of that is driven by an expected decline in volumes out West.
Operator: And we'll go next to Curt Launer with Deutsche Bank.
Curt N. Launer - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Two questions if I may, one more back to the Marcellus. In the 10-Q, you're referring to less favorable economics in the Western region. And I think that's been discussed a lot already in this call. But from the standpoint of the lower volumes in '13, what are the conditions, what are you seeing relative to your discussions with producers that could make that materially better in '14 and '15? Clearly, we think about it from the standpoint of NGL takeaway capacity boosting the netbacks. Or is it a question of natural gas prices needing to be higher that would spur that activity?
Francis E. Billings: Yes, this is Frank. I'm assuming you're referring to the Western part of the Marcellus...
Curt N. Launer - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: That's correct.
Francis E. Billings: Or our Eastern business up there? I would say that the biggest thing we see relative to the Western area and volumes is more a function of what the ultimate netback might be for those areas, especially as you get into Northwest Pennsylvania, Northeast Ohio, some of those areas that are very infrastructure-challenged. I think in the -- our area, especially in the OEM area, I think we have -- we saw an improvement in the netbacks when we brought our fractionation train on, and we're going to see continued improvement in the netbacks to the producers when we bring this stabilization plan and the next fracturing as well as rail load facility. So for us in OBM, I think it's going to be able to show its consistent ability to get the commodities sold into the market. And I think that's what's going to support in our area we're currently operating. But I do think the Western part of the Marcellus, it's going to see -- and even Ohio, it's going to see -- we'll see some -- some of us could see some of the same pinching of basis relative to net gas sales and NGL prices as supplies outstrip, being able to get those commodities out of there.
Curt N. Launer - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And switching gears to the Canadian assets. I wanted to ask if there's anything you could tell us that will help us model that into the outlook here. You mentioned the PIK units certainly, but what would be the expectation relative to debt as being part of the financing package as the assets are dropped down?
Donald R. Chappel: Curt, this is Don. Again, I think, as Alan mentioned, we expect the multiple not to exceed 7x on the purchase price. We expect it to be all equity. That's advantageous from a tax standpoint to Williams. Again, we defer taxes on that basis other than this tax that's triggered by changing the ownership -- structure of the Canadian assets to WPZ. So that's really the driver there. I hope that responds to your question.
Operator: And we'll go next to Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: Is there a fine on Northeast -- I'm sorry to keep harping on it. But I think you talked in all those slides, you're deferring $200 million a day processing out of '15 into later period and 30,000 barrels a day of frac. Yet we don't see CapEx go down. Can you reconcile that?
Donald R. Chappel: Yes, I think what we've done is we need the second fractioning. If you look at our 2014 volumes, our 2015 volumes in OBM, we will need to start to put the second $200 million a day train that drove in. But a lot of that balanced plant work has been done as far as the initial work. So we don't have a significant, significant requirement. But we have pushed it out to where we may not have to spend those dollars until 2016 given the current volume forecast that we have today. So you have -- that's probably the only asset that we've kind of shoved out of the '15 into '16 relative to kind of assets that you've seen before.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: I think the frac capacity sound like 30,000 barrels a day also.
Donald R. Chappel: That's the other thing, yes, that I mentioned earlier.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: So are you saying that the CapEx -- you've already spent the dollars on that, and so that's why we don't see CapEx coming down?
Donald R. Chappel: Well, we purchased the frac train. So we have that in our inventory, wasn't going to redeploy that in either some of our other opportunities that we have going on today whether it be up to 3RM [ph]. But today, most of the CapEx -- to get the kind of the investments that you see as -- on the slide, Slide 8, most all of that capital will be deployed in 2014. We have a little bit of capital in 2015 that prepared to get the second Oak Grove facility on. That one would be in our 15 plan. But beyond that, we've pushed out frac train or processing plants 3 and 4 and some of the other things that we've had in our 15 plants.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then this is -- it's smaller in the scheme of things and I don't have all the numbers in front of me. But looking at the maintenance CapEx, in this guidance, it's down by $85 million over the 3-year period and it looks like the last -- probably the last 4 quarters, maintenance CapEx keeps coming down. In an aggregate, it's material relative to the size of maintenance CapEx. Can you talk about what is it driving that and your thoughts behind the maintenance CapEx?
Alan S. Armstrong: Sure. As I mentioned earlier, we're still spending a very large amount of our profit particularly within the pipes. In fact, over 35% of our segment profit, we're putting back into maintenance CapEx if you take the 3-year maintenance CapEx and put that over the -- our segment profit. And so very significant amounts still going into that. But I would say that we invested very heavily in both '11 and '12 in catching up and beating the deadline that we had relative to some regulatory requirements for getting some of the asset integrity work done on the pipeline. So we had kind of a lot of that capital squeezed in to the '11 and '12 period. And as well, we also had things like we had some work that we had to get done for the Clean Air Act on -- so on our compression, on our major pipelines that we had to get done as well. And so again, those kind of culminated in '11 and '12. And so we've been working that hard in terms of getting done what we needed to get done for those timeframes. But it's allowed us a little bit of relaxation here in terms of that heavy capital spending in the guidance period that we have before us.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: I understand why it was higher in '11 and '12. But what I don't understand is why the guidance keeps coming down for '13 through '15 because I mean, that's past. So why would the guidance keep coming down?
Alan S. Armstrong: I don't think I can -- sorry, I didn't follow your question there. Well, a couple of things. One, with the continued decline in volumes in the West, we have less maintenance CapEx. And we've made some decisions, as I mentioned earlier, for doing things like taking the Lybrook plant out of service. So some of our older fleets out West is a result of the volume reduction, and those older plants, as you can imagine, suck up maintenance capital. And so those changes have been made to our Midstream maintenance CapEx and on the gas pipes. One thing we did do -- and I'm not sure this is a major driver, but it's certainly embedded in here, is we had some pressure-testing obligations that we were trying to get all done by '18. We took a really close look at those in terms of really where we needed to reduce risk on the system and negotiate it with FEMZA [ph] to -- and got them to understand that really, the better risk reduction was spreading out that timeframe on some of that pipeline integrity work. So that spread things out a little more versus where we had some dollar spending in there in '18. So that's a little bit of that reduction on gas pipes. But I think the major reduction you see is really on the Midstream side. And it really is the teams out West working pretty hard to reduce our maintenance capital out West, and it's resulted in reducing volume.
Rory Lee Miller: Alan?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes.
Rory Lee Miller: One other item, too, that's probably worth mentioning to Becca here, the -- with the changing flow patterns on the Transco system, where we're now getting a lot of our supply or much of our supply from the Northeast as opposed to just the Gulf Coast. The middle portion of our system is the compression on that portion of the system is running much less frequently. So we're having a lot less hours on those units. We're having a lot less maintenance there, and our turbine change-outs are being able to pushed out in the future years. So as we kind of put that whole new dynamic into the equation, that's also a bit of a significant impact.
Alan S. Armstrong: Great point. Thanks, Rory.
Allison G. Bridges: Yes, and this is Allison Bridges. And I would also just like to add to the lower sort of maintaining the facilities. We do have some pretty significant reduction in well connects than we had previously had. So at least for the next few years, that's continuing to come down.
Operator: We'll go next to Selman Akyol with Stifel.
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: In terms of the Canadian assets, in your assumption there of the $200 million, what capacity utilizations have you guys assumed?
John R. Dearborn: They're flexible. There are -- there's actually 3 assets there to be thinking about. One is the -- is liquids extraction plant up in Fort McMurray. The other is the pipeline, and the other is the fractionator. In terms of our operating in the next year and future years, the fractionator is going to be running near to full capacity. We'll need some incremental expansion in order to accommodate CNRL plant and the liquid extraction plant up in Fort McMurray when the upgrader is running -- be running pretty much full out because it's a dedicated to that facility.
Alan S. Armstrong: I'll take recovery point.
John R. Dearborn: I'm sorry?
Alan S. Armstrong: I'll take recovery point. Can you do the other? Let's partner. I would also add to that. Normally, we build into that about a 97.5% run time. So in terms of how much, that's up and that's consistent with our typical capabilities. And perhaps, you can speak to the pipeline?
John R. Dearborn: Yes, the pipeline will have a little bit of excess capacity as we -- we'll have some room on it as we bring on these other projects into the future.
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Great, And then just to confirm, are you still looking for an April 1 start on Geismar?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes, that is correct.
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Armstrong, at this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to for any additional or closing remarks.
Alan S. Armstrong: Great. Well, thank you very much for joining us today. We are blessed to have such a great portfolio of growth -- major growth projects to pursue, and those keep coming on. And that gives us confidence in our ability to continue to grow our WMB dividend and our distributable cash flow at WPZ for many years to come. And we certainly are excited to make the step we're making on the Canadian asset dropdown, which moves us closer to a pure play. But we also retain the benefit of some very significant dropdown candidates for WPZ in the future. So we think structurally, we're very well positioned. And we think in terms of our business opportunities, they just couldn't be more robust. And the team is very excited about continuing to execute and deliver on this tremendous cash flow growth. So thank you very much for joining us this morning and for the great questions.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation.

And at this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John Porter: Thank you, Mary. Good morning, and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our websites, williams.com and williamslp.com. These items include yesterday's press releases with related schedules and the accompanying analyst packages, the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily and an update to our data books, which contain detailed information regarding various aspects of our business. In addition to Alan we also have the 4 leaders of our operating areas present with us. Frank Billings leads our northeastern G&P operating area; Allison Bridges leads our Western operating area; Rory Miller leads Atlantic Gulf; and John Dearborn is here from our NGL & Petchem Services operating area. Additionally, our CFO, Don Chappel is available to respond to any questions. In yesterday's presentation and also in our data books, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan S. Armstrong: Great. Good morning. Thanks, John. We are excited to talk to you about our second quarter, as well as the continued progress on executing our strategy. We remain very confident that our strategy is well positioned to benefit over the long haul as we continue to see this market emerge and tremendous demand for infrastructure to take advantage of the low cost natural gas and natural resources continue to be developed in North America. Just to level set before we get into the presentation. I want to run down a few key points that are key to our strategy and this is starting here on Slide 4. First of all, this -- the strategy really does frame our growth investments, our dividend and distribution growth strategy as we continue to use that as direction for how we manage the business. So we remain very disciplined around the strategy and it really is a very strong compass for us in the decisions we make. So it's important for you to understand it. First of all, in the competitive advantage. Competitive advantage is created by large scale and the resulting market access and low-cost that we offer to our customers continue to be a guiding light for us. You won't find us making investments without those characteristics in our sites. Our Transco system and our West operating areas are great examples of what that looks like to us. And if you look at the Northeast, the moves we're continuing to make in this area really are all focused on getting to that scale of #1 or #2 position in that area. And certainly, we are convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that over the long haul, this creates great opportunity and value for both our customers and our investors. On looking to the growth side, I'm not sure it's possible really at this point to overemphasize the growth opportunities that we have available to us right now. Our Williams Partners Transco system is another great example as it relates to the growth opportunities that are in front of us. This is the nation's premier natural gas pipeline system. It's connected to the right supply and certainly the right market areas and the growth opportunities that continue to come at us day after day on this -- continue to build our confidence about the growth, not just in the supply side as we've seen around natural gas, but a strong movement towards the demand side. And as we expect, the overall market continue to expand. The position we're in there is very enviable and we really are in a position to select not just any growth opportunity, but the very best growth opportunities available in the industry right now. Simply put, you'll see us focusing on the top layer of cream in this opportunity set and with Transco is in other areas, we're realizing our strategy and we are ensuring these benefits translate into value for our investors. On the high dividend growth side. This is central to our value creation strategy. We've taken steps to ensure that even during a period of high investment in all these great growth opportunities that we are rewarding investors right now. We are building in the components to see this strategy run full-out as we bring on significant growth investments, many of which come online in 2015 and just beyond our current guidance period. We are investing to connect the best supply areas with the best markets, but we're also investing in ways that focus on fee-based that is largely resilient to commodity market fluctuation businesses. This is the foundation of our strategy to reward our investors with growing cash dividends and distributions, and we believe those characteristics also will produce high-value growth. It certainly, from our vantage point, is the best opportunity we have to deliver great shareholder value both now and in the future. So let's get into the meat of the presentation today. Following a few comments from me as I go through these slides, I, along with the management team that John introduced earlier, look forward to hearing from you. Moving on to Slide 5 here, which covers the key headline for today's earnings and guidance discussion. The big stories here. First, the growth in our fee-based business at Williams Partners was a major driver in our second quarter results. Keep in mind that strong performance was up against even less favorable NGL margins in this quarter and the unexpected impact of our Geismar olefins plant, which was down for about 20% of the period, and obviously, related to the tragic incident that we experienced there in June. Second, we are, again, reaffirming our strong growth guidance for our cash dividends and distributions. We continue to expect 20% per year growth in Williams' cash dividend in each of the 3 years in our guidance period. And for Williams Partners, we continue to expect strong cash distribution growth of about 9% here for 2013 and about 7% annually in each '14 and '15. Third, we are updating our earnings and DCF guidance with the modest changes to reflect lower NGL margins and our assumptions related to Geismar, including the projected restart date in insurance proceeds. So we'll spend a little more time on that here in a moment. And I want to call out how things are developing from an investor perspective with our olefins business at Geismar. That's where, as you know, we experienced an explosion on June 13. For all of us at Williams, it was significant, both personally and professionally, and also from an operation standpoint. During my tenure at the company, we haven't had to endure -- experience anything like that. And I can tell you, it was an event that I am very mournful of on the one hand, on the other hand, I've been very impressed at how our professionals across this business have pulled together to respond to it in a way that is keeping with our culture and now getting back and working hard to overcome from the incident. From a financial perspective, we continue to expect that our insurance policies will significantly mitigate the financial effects of the incident. And we expect to resume operations at Geismar in April and bring -- in April of '14, and bring the expansion into operations immediately thereafter. We have updated Williams Partners' guidance to reflect our current assumption about the financial impact of the Geismar incident. In addition to the Geismar impact, our updated guidance also reflects the expected NGL margin to deteriorate in '14. Even though we did -- we have lowered our NGL margins for '13 and '15 as well. I would tell you that we were -- we've been able to overcome that with other positives. So really the only area that we're lowering guidance on is related to NGL margins is a little bit of modest reduction for '14. Fourth, we expect Williams Partners DCF to increase by 66% between '13 and '15 as our large inventory of projects and most of these, as you know, are fee-based, continue to come online. And what's notable here, as well is that we expect the impressive growth to come even as we see continued pressure on the NGL markets that I spoke to earlier. Finally, we'll quickly touch on the few of the recent operational developments that support our broader strategy. One that's particularly noteworthy is the progress that we're making on the Bluegrass Pipeline project that is now included in our guidance. Before we move to the next slide, I want to make sure that we're clear about Williams' support for Williams Partners distribution during this period of high investment in the extraordinary growth opportunities that we continue to seize. As you'll recall in May, Williams announced we would support WPZ's cash distribution coverage ratio at a level of about 0.9 by waving the $200 million in incentive distribution rights. Today, that $200 million is unused, untapped because Williams Partners' strong second quarter performance yielded a year-to-date coverage of 0.92. So great news there that due to the strong DCF at Williams Partners in the second quarter, we remain without having to use that IDR waiver. So we're very excited about that. Let's move on to Slide 6 here. The major story here is that we're seeing the tangible benefits of our growing fee-based businesses and what it meant in the second quarter is that we delivered solid results even in an environment of weaker NGL margins and the significant impact of the downtime at Geismar. At Williams, we had our second quarter adjusted segment profit plus DD&A was up 7% compared with the year-ago. And for Williams Partners, our second quarter distributable cash flow was almost 1/3 higher than the year-ago levels. The primary driver of the DCF increase at PZ of course, was the strong contribution that Geismar made to the quarter prior to the June 13 incident. And of course, as you recall, that asset was dropped down in the fourth quarter of '12. And, as you know, it is producing tremendous distributable cash flow. Also -- substantially secured as we've mentioned to you and we'll provide a little bit more detail. We know there's been quite a bit of confusion on the insurance coverage in this package that we sent out, we hope it helps to clarify that. But we're glad to say that our business interruption insurance is helping secure a significant portion of that expected DCF. Getting this asset back in service with safe and reliable operations and expanded volumes is clearly one of our top priorities for the company right now. And we've got a great team of professionals that have got their hearts and minds into making that happen and are making great progress on that. For WPZ, we are pleased to report that our fee-based revenue grew 9% over the second quarter of 2012. During the second quarter, we saw our Western volumes recover from the earlier winter conditions of the first quarter. And we also benefited from the continued volume growth in the Northeast, as well as the startup of some of our new facilities. Another driver of our improved DCF versus the prior year was lower maintenance CapEx and this is primarily driven by reductions in our Western segment as various projects wrapped up in 2012. Additionally, we saw another significant drop in NGL margins of 13% from the prior quarter, so from the first quarter, which were already pretty low compared with what we've seen in recent years. And in fact, the NGL margin for the second quarter were down a full 44% from the prior year. So I think this is very significant that even despite these continued declines in NGL margins, you're seeing our business start to ramp out of being affected by that and really start to grow from the strong impact of the growth in our fee-based volumes. So our strategy is really starting to take hold in terms of those investments, and we think this is really kind of a turning point this quarter as we start to overcome those declines with the growth in that business. We continue to be very excited as well about our Access Midstream Partners investment as they reported a strong second quarter with their adjusted EBITDA increasing about 71% over the prior year second quarter. And for our second quarter equity earnings, we recorded $18 million in our adjusted segment profit plus DD&A column. In Williams NGL & Petchem Services business, we saw higher volumes lead strong growth, up nearly 50% in adjusted segment profit plus DD&A versus the prior year. So with that good news, let's move on to Slide 7 and review the Williams Partners guidance. So now, we're looking forward here a bit. In addition to the strong second quarter, we remain very optimistic about our business for the balance of the year, despite the fact that we're lowering the margins on the heavies a little bit because we just haven't been able to see that increase that we've been hoping to see in the propanes and butanes and so we did lower that a little bit. But the fact that our fee-based business has been growing and we've been able to do such a good job around managing our cost, is allowing us to hold guidance. On that basis, what really is impacting guidance here in '13 was the impact of the Geismar incident. So the big story here is we continue to expect tremendous growth in the PZ distributable cash flow. And in fact, we're expecting DCF to grow by 66%, increasing over $1 billion in just this 2-year period from end of '13 to end of '15. This growth is driven by WPZ's end guidance CapEx, which is averaging about $3 billion per year right now. And our latest guidance for WPZ's DCF includes modest reductions for this year and next year. For 2013, the effect of the Geismar incident is the key driver. And if not for that, we would have seen, hopefully, actually a raised guidance because we've been able to reduce costs and continue to grow our volumes at a pace that is even better than we were hoping for. For 2014, our expectation of NGL frac spreads is remaining very low. And due primarily to the lower assumed values for the heavy part of the barrels I mentioned earlier, and this really is the key driver in the change here for 2014. There are a number of other moving parts in there. But including in some of our projects and first flow dates on some of these projects that are backing up. But for the most part, we're -- again, we were able to offset that through other improvements, so it really is just boiling down to the NGL margin reduction there and we think we moved this down to a fairly conservative level. I know there's a lot of interest now we're thinking about the Geismar effect in our financial forecast. We have a slide in the appendix of this presentation that shows what we've included for business interruption insurance and how it is recorded in our financials for both the GAAP and the non-GAAP measures. Our 2015 distributable cash flow guidance continues to be strong. And importantly, does not incorporate any support via IDR waivers from Williams and with more than 3/4 of our gross margin coming from fee-based business by 2015, we have created a cash flow stream that is more resilient to changes in commodity prices and our 2015 forecast it does, and include an expectation of lower commodity margins, yet we were able to hold it where it was again due to improvements on some other piece of our business. I do want to make 1 point on guidance within the segments of Williams Partners. You'll note that the Northeast gathering and processing segment profit guidance is lower throughout the guidance period. It's important to understand that this change is really driven as a result of a reallocation of support costs among our WPZ segments. It's not an actual increase in WPZ's overall cost structure, again just an allocation amongst the various regions. So bottom line, our guidance now more actively reflects support cost that are being increasingly allocated to support the tremendous growth that we're experiencing in the Northeast and this accounted for about $30 million of lower segment profit for '14 and '15 and a little less than that for '13. So that's a good overview of our guidance changes for WPZ, which, of course, is a major driver for WMD's earnings and cash flows. So let's move on to Slide 8 to review Williams and Williams Partners CapEx and investment guidance. First, just focusing on WPZ's capital, I point out that we did have a number of movements among the 3 guidance years. But in the aggregate, CapEx is consistent with our prior guidance. And of course, we have lots of additional information about CapEx guidance at the project and reportable segment levels in our data book, which you can find on our website. Outside of WPZ, we have a couple of major developments to discuss. First, and most significantly, our current guidance now takes into account the Bluegrass Pipeline project. Our board recently approved the project and we continue to be encouraged by the support we are seeing from the shippers who recognize tremendous value that Bluegrass has to offer these very large-scale, rich gas drilling programs, and I can tell you that the producer community out there sees this as a great resource. But frankly, they really are dependent and really extremely interested in making sure that these kind of large-scale solutions for clearing these products in advantaged markets are going to be in service. And so I would just tell you, we've been thrilled with the response and the interest in the capacity that we have available for this project. And frankly, I suspect that we'll look back in the not-too-distant future and wish that we had more capacity to have available for the area. We are basing our expected investment on a 50% ownership of the pipeline and related frac-ing storage facilities. And we also included a few notes on how we think about the financing of the project. We've updated our current guidance to reflect ongoing changes to our Canadian PDH project as well. We have increased our estimated cost of this project as we've seen similar projects in our sector experiencing some overruns and so we've always got our ear to the ground and really trying to gain intelligence on what's going on in the space and we've certainly noted that some overruns exist out there. And so we're now looking at pushing the in-service date into 2017, primarily to allow for the codevelopment of the derivative plants that would be designed to take advantage of geographically advantaged propylene supply. We're in the process of negotiating offtake agreements that will dramatically reduce our commodity exposure on the projects and I'll just tell you, the interest that we've seen has been tremendous, and we're very excited about this project and our ability to really convert this into more of a fee-based kind of opportunity for us and at a very minimum, really reducing our commodity exposure on the project. So still extremely excited about the project and frankly, one of the advantages we're trying to make sure we capture is to make sure that we get full advantage for the geographic advantage that producing propylene and propylene derivatives in this area has to offer. Let's move on to Slide 9. As we review the second quarter and the first month of the third quarter, it's rewarding to see how we are executing on our business objectives, bringing new projects into service, setting volume records and adding new growth projects. These achievements all serve to support our strategy of developing and operating large-scale energy infrastructure that is connecting the very best producing areas to the very best markets. And as I mentioned, the growing demand that we're seeing in really all areas that are really positioning themselves to take advantage of these great low-cost products that we have here in the U.S. As previously mentioned, our Bluegrass Pipeline project and the related frac-ing storage facilities are a major development. We executed a joint venture agreement with Boardwalk Pipeline Partners to continue developing this project and we've designed Bluegrass to transport natural gas liquids from the Marcellus and Utica shale plays to the rapidly expanding petrochemical and export complexes on the U.S. Gulf Coast. And, as well as the developing petchem market in the Northeast U.S. Williams board approved the project in June and we are now actively engaged in the development work, which includes surveying, environmental studies and permitting activities that are required to really keep this project on schedule. I can tell you from the shipper's perspective, maintaining that schedule is very important and a lot of people really have their eyes on that. We do have an aggressive schedule out there. And as a result, we've got to move quickly on the permitting and environmental stage. Of course the beauty of this project, one of them is the ability to use the Texas gas line, which greatly reduces the exposure we have to permitting activities along the large portion of the route. In our Atlantic Gulf business, we made significant progress on various fronts during the last 3 months. As I mentioned earlier, tremendous amount of growth going on, on Transco, but as well in the deepwater. We're pleased to have reached an agreement in principle, settling all issues in our Transco rate case during the second quarter and the agreement is in line with the new rates that we started booking the first quarter of this year. And as you would expect, the new rates are reflected in the current and the most recent guidance that we've provided in May. So in other words, steady as she goes on that front. Team did a great job of getting that settled quickly and in line with our expectations. So we're very excited to have that behind us and have that piece of our execution strategy checked off. In the deepwater gulf, we executed another tie-back agreement for our Devils Tower prospect. And we believe there's strong potential for another tie-back agreement as well in the area. These tiebacks are very powerful because of the very limited amount of capital required to bring these tiebacks on. And as you know, they produce a very meaningful amount of free cash flow. And certainly, this latest tie-back that we've reached agreement on is no exception. New projects coming into service are key drivers in the strong performance in our Atlantic Gulf operating area. On our Transco system, those expansions largely are in support of growing power generation load. We recently placed our Mid-South Expansion into service, this added about 130,000 dekatherms per day of fully contracted, long-term capacity connecting Transco Station 85 to serve power generators in the North Carolina and Alabama markets, as well as a local distribution company in Georgia. Just a note on that to remind you, last fall, we placed the first phase of this, which is about 95,000 dekatherms per day into service in -- same time last year. So we just keep clicking off these base hits. They continue to grow the firm revenues and firm service on Transco. Another important note for this period, I'm sure there's -- be a lot of questions around this. Because of our -- the Transco's positioning in the southeastern United States, we really are uniquely positioned to help meet the growing demand in Florida. As a result, we work with the Spectra to develop a winning solution to serve this large-scale growth opportunity as the FPL went out for an RFP for service in the area as you're all very well aware of. So as a result of that, Transco will be expanding its system from Station 85 up to an interconnecting point with Sabal trail and the near our Station 105 and the Sabal trail partners will then lease this capacity from Transco's on a long-term and cost-of-service basis. And in addition, Williams Partners has an option to acquire a meaningful, but a minority interest in the Sabal trails project. The option gives us a chance to better understand -- because of the timing of the auction, it gives us a chance to better understand the construction risk and the volume risk that ultimately will be associated with this bold project. We also took an important step on pace with our schedule for the Constitution Pipeline. In June, we filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to seek approval and build and operate this 124-mile pipeline that by 2015, will connect Marcellus gas production around our Susquehanna Supply Hub in Northeast Pennsylvania with key Northeast markets. And of course, these markets are continuing to grow mostly from power generation as well, and of course from the benefits of low cost natural gas. And that does interconnect into the Iroquois and Tennessee Gas Pipeline in upstate New York. The Constitution design supports transportation of about 650,000 dekatherms of natural gas per day. In the Northeast gathering and processing business, we're seeing important progress in putting the infrastructure in place to meet the demand of growth from the Marcellus and Utica shale plays and we're continuing to steadily increase gathering volumes in the Northeast. Keep in mind that we have exposure to this terrific growth through both assets that we operate and those investments for us that are operated by ACMP and our Blue Racer joint venture with Caiman and Dominion. Now on our operated assets, we set record monthly average volumes for June. And where we eclipse more than 1.8 Bcf per day of gas, not bad considering where we started just a few years ago there. And for the quarter, we gathered 76% more gas on our operated assets in the Northeast than we did in the second quarter of last year. So tremendous growth pace that we're on there. And I think, you'll continue to see tremendous record set there. And in fact, here in July, our team in the Northeast there topped their June record by gathering over 2 Bcf a day on our operated assets in the area. So our team just keeps expanding that. And so we're very excited to see the kind of volume growth we've got there. And also on the Susquehanna Supply Hub expansions, we're working very hard to keep pace with Cabot's rapid growth up there, team is doing a great job of working with Cabot and they are a formidable group to try to keep up with, with their very successful drilling program. And we are as excited as anyone to see them add their 6th rig coming up here in August. So a lot going on up there and great example of how infrastructure and drilling programs need to be coordinated well together. In our Ohio Valley Midstream franchise, we added another train there, so this will be the third train to our Fort Beeler facility. So continuing to execute on the buildout of our infrastructure there. And as planned, we placed into service 3 condensate pump stations in the second quarter to maximize liquids to Moundsville and to make sure that we're getting the liquids, the vast amount of liquids to continue to grow rapidly in that field. And so as Frank Billings laid out for you at our Analyst Call, he laid out several milestones that we need to execute on and we are clipping those off on schedule. On Slide 10, we'll review the array of growth CapEx spending and the timeline when to expect these projects to begin generating revenue. So if you look here at the large CapEx platform we're managing on the slide, you can see all of our major projects that will be coming online here extending into 2017 with our Canadian PDH project. Fundamentally, this is the same way we presented our CapEx by project outlook at our Analyst Day in May and in addition to marking a couple of projects that are now complete, including the Fort Beeler TXP III project. The most significant updates relate to the inclusion of the Bluegrass Pipeline project in the Canadian PDH project as we've just discussed. A few things to point out on this as well. First, the investment WMB made in ACMP is above and beyond what you see listed here, and we expect all of their strong growth prospects will be self-funded. Second, with the exception of the WPZ Geismar expansion and the WNB Canadian projects, all the remaining projects are backed by fee-based revenues. And finally, I would just highlight that this page concisely summarizes what we must execute on in order to achieve sustainable growth in cash dividend and cash distributions. These are projects that are well-known and well understood. Many are well into the construction phase. Our growth is highly dependent on our ability to execute on this vast array of value creating projects and not so much directly on NGL margins has been in the past. It also is obvious from looking at the slide that it will be 2015 before we begin realizing the full value potential of most of these investments and thus that 66% growth we see in DCF occurring in 2015 from our 2013 expected results. So moving here to the close. Before we move to the Q&A session, I'll just provide a few closing comments here. First of all, our fee-based business continues to grow and the second quarter results are a strong indication of the success of that strategy and our fast-growing resilience to commodity market fluctuations. In fact, when you think about it, in a quarter where were lost our single-largest commodity margin generator in the name of the Geismar plant for 20% of the period, we still had a very good quarter. We continue to make significant investments in areas where we can realize large-scale and lower cost of operations. And we are absolutely committed to focusing on areas where we can achieve our #1 or #2 position, not because we want that for bragging rights, but because we think that puts us in the position to have sustainable, long-term dividend growth of the kind you've come to expect from us. We've seen that in our Transco system and the west operating area and we're making similar investments in the Northeast to drive this additional growth, not just through this guidance period, but well beyond this guidance period. Williams is working to connect the very best supplier areas with the very best market areas and we've assembled a very strong management team in our operating areas and in our E&C areas and so we're very committed to helping deliver this growth and profitability that we know is -- that we can achieve as we execute against this strategy. The strategy is providing us with so many great investment opportunities that we are in the envious position of picking the very best risk-adjusted return projects that the market has to offer, and we think over the long haul, of course, that is going to provide superior shareholder returns over and above our peers, both in the near-term, but especially over the long haul and we certainly look forward to sharing our success with our investors as we move forward. Thank you for your interest in our company and we'll be happy to take questions now.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Stephen Maresca with Morgan Stanley.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Alan, I want to talk first on Bluegrass. You seem pretty confident in the project obviously, it's now in guidance. What's your view on what sort of commitments you expect to move forward on it? What are the next steps we should hear about in terms of permitting? You mentioned getting commercial agreements later this year and then finally on that, do you expect this own -- just 50% of this or more or less as the project plays out?
Alan S. Armstrong: Well, it's kind of hard to speculate on the ownership interest towards that. It's going to be up to Boardwalk and their decisions there. But I think as things stand we're so confident in the market demand right now on the asset that I would expect that they would carry through with their plans just because I think the returns are going to be very attractive relative to other options in the market. I would say from a volume commitment standpoint, remember that we have a number of opportunities that came to us through the Caiman acquisition in terms of the liquids there, at that facility, as well as we have the dedication that we receive from Chesapeake and we also have other parties that -- where we had the processing rights on various gas streams out there as well that give us pretty nice base, frankly, volumes to build off of and while we wouldn't be going forward on the project if we thought we could only get to that 200,000 barrels a day or so of production, I would just tell you that we're seeing very strong interest from some of the larger players out there that really recognize how much value this is going to mean to the acreage out there and perhaps even see it as a strategic advantage in terms of being able to acquire acreage in the area. So I would just tell you, the excitement has been pretty, pretty big on this from the customer base. These are very long term commitments that we're looking for and of course, those take some time to gain corporate approval on. But I would just tell you that I'm not sure we could be asking for any better response than we've received today from the shipper community.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And do you -- just a final on that in terms of the ownership. Is it something where you have an option to increase if you want, or is it again something where you both have to agree to change that ownership percent?
Alan S. Armstrong: I'm going to have Jim Scheel who's been right in the thick of that answer the point.
James E. Scheel: Williams and Boardwalk negotiated an agreement where they have an option to be a 50% partner. However, if they choose not exercise that right, Williams has the option to go ahead with the pipeline unilaterally.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful, appreciate that. And then moving, Alan, you talked about the opportunities at the Florida market for Transco has on the expansion side, but also you mentioned about potential ownership of Sabal. Would that be something again at your option you could purchase? Would it be from Spectra or would it be from the next terra portion of it or any sort of color on that?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes, sure. It would be from the project as a whole from the Sabal trail project as a whole is what our option would be on. And again, just to make it clear, we will be supplying basically the volumes in a phased approach on the front end of that project via Transco. So we're basically the supply source by expanding to a point that reduce the amount of construction -- the greenfield construction, required for Sabal trail. So we're kind of the front end of that. And Sabal trail is going to lease that capacity with a return that's consistent with our cost of service returns. So eliminates our construction and volume risk on that. And so we have that as investment, which we found very attractive. And in addition to that, when have an option down the road to invest in Sabal trails and of course, we really like that because it gives us a chance to see how the construction costs look like when they come out and the volumes will have a much better picture on what the volume commitments look like at that point.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Can you say a what percent you could potentially own of it?
Alan S. Armstrong: No. I would just say it's meaningful. But it is a minority position.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. Final one for me. You mentioned as -- I was going to ask you about the reduction in Northeast G&P at Williams WPZ in terms of the segment profit and DD&A. I think you mentioned that was -- so this is just higher cost that's what brought that down the $55 million in 2014 and $30 million in 2015? I just wanted to make sure I'm understanding it.
Alan S. Armstrong: It's primarily just an allocation. We have things like our engineering construction costs, our technical support for operations, accounting, all those things that we allocate as a corporation out against our various operating areas and because we've got so much growth in the area and we're applying so many resources it, we studied our cost across those areas and applied those more appropriately to the real expenses. So it's not really a shift in our overall cost against the company. That's just a reallocation of overhead cost to that area.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. So not a new cost or a higher cost, just taking it from where it was accounted or allocated before and putting it into this segment.
Alan S. Armstrong: That's exactly right.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Christine Cho with Barclays.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: CapEx looks like it went up by $2.7 billion across 2013 to '15. Assuming some sort of increase over the $1 billion cost number that I think you originally gave us for the PDH facility, is the remaining mostly tied to Bluegrass or are there other large ticket items in there that were either included or taken out, of out of the 3-year guidance.
Donald R. Chappel: Christine, it's Don Chappel, it's mostly entirely Bluegrass. There's some other moves as you mentioned, but it's largely Bluegrass.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then would you be able to give us, I guess, some sort of idea on what the cost increase is looking like for the PDH facility, is it materially over or like 20%?
Alan S. Armstrong: No. I would just say, again, we kind of came at that with an initial estimate that was very rough and the return was so attractive on it that we decided to proceed because even at an overrun, that would have been -- or an increase in our estimate, that would have been much higher which still would make sense. And I would just say, that cost did not go outside of that range. It was higher than what we early had in our guidance. But more importantly I think, the point to be captured there is that as we look at the project, we realized one of the fundamental benefits and what I would call industrial logic that underpins the project is the fact that we have got the ability to transport propylene derivatives rather than propylene itself into markets that are much closer than transporting the propylene all the way to the Gulf Coast and then turn around and transporting the propylene derivatives back to the Midwest markets and to the -- particularly in the Northern Midwest markets. And so by getting the propylene derivative business built there, we're getting -- we are positioning ourselves to be able to capture some of that transport and logistics advantage. And so we want to build that complex in concert with those derivative plant and there may be some optimization opportunity between the propylene plant and the derivative plant. Now having said that, don't hear us say that we're going into the propylene derivative business because that's not at all what we're doing here. And in fact we're going to do this in a way that's going to reduce our commodity exposure to propylene. But it does allow us to optimize the construction of the facilities. And again, to enjoy some of the benefits of the logistics through the pricing structure.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I see. So net-net, would you say that your returns overall look better than when you originally looked at it? Or do they kind of just off -- does everything just offset each other?
Alan S. Armstrong: I would say that our returns -- I would say our returns will be lower than what we originally thought. But I would also tell you that they're going to be a lot lower risk because you are converted to more fee-based business.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then in your presentation slide, when you talk about equity funding for Bluegrass, you say WPZ investment and then you wrote WMB and/or third parties. Can you just clarify, when you say third parties, do you mean that you're willing to sell a portion of your interest in the Bluegrass project or sell your interest in some of your other assets like we've seen you do with Constitution, I don't know, maybe with some of your assets in Canada, et cetera to raise the cash?
Donald R. Chappel: Christine, this is Don Chappel. I'd just say we have a lot of options. WPZ is our preferred funding source. So to the extent that we need equity, our preference would be for WPZ to fund that versus Williams. But there are a number of other sources we expect that other parties will have interest in equity in Bluegrass. We may not choose to give any of it up, but it's really -- what you see there on the slide is just an expression of we've got quite a few options. And in the near term to the balance of this year and into next year, at least, early next year, we'll be funding this with excess cash at Williams, and beyond that, we'll have some choices to make. But for the next couple of quarters, 2 or 3 quarters, it's really funding with excess cash flow at Williams.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, great. And then lastly, for me. In the Northeast, it looked like OBM volumes were slightly revised down in '14 and '15 while Susquehanna was raised. Can you verify that's the case and can you also provide a number for what volumes are today at OBM?
Francis E. Billings: Sure, this is Frank Billings. I would say that we did revise the volumes down a little bit. The majority of that is, as we actually have derisked a little bit it to the OBM volume forecast because we had a customer identified in our forecast and we've actually executed an agreement to have them become a true customer versus a forecasted customer. And with that, we've got a revised drilling program -- drilling schedule from them and we basically included that in our forecast, as well as one of our existing customers revised slightly their drilling program for '13 and '14. So that's the main driver for the volume adjustments, I would say, in OBM.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, great. And then can you provide a number for what volumes are today at Williams?
Francis E. Billings: Yes. Right now we're moving around $200 million today, kind of we're moving around $250 million to $260 million, but we do have some volumes that are not moving. We've hit a peak volume in excess of $300 million a day in OBM. And right now, what is happening is we have a couple of customers, one is drilling and frac-ing a new well, so they've shut in some production around that well frac so that they don't -- or for whatever reason, I guess they want to protect or manage that activity. And then we have another customer that is having some permitting issues on one of their well pad, so they had to shut in production as well. But I can tell you that we're also -- we have multiple producers out there that are in the process of completing some wells and I think -- we see the activity that we expected to see from the producers in OBM this summer as they're trying to get some work done before the fall and winter season hits. So I think we're on the right trajectory and I just think what we have is -- when we lose 30% of our volume or 10% of our volume, $30 million a day for producer activity, it shows up at this point. But I can tell you that in OBM today, we are operating well mechanically. All of our mechanical and operational issues are few at this time. And I think, we're in a good position to move the volume that's behind the system today. And when we complete the work for -- that we had talked about in the second -- the first quarter call around the CR -- or the facilities that we're going to get in place, I think we're going to be in great shape for the rest of the year.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Bradley Olsen with Tudor Pickering.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: My first question is on Transco and some of the opportunities you're seeing around that asset. We've seen Leidy pricing and just pricing around the dry gas pricing area, the Marcellus come under a lot of pressure. Is that adding to kind of inbound producer demand and maybe even some inbound demand side or utility demand for capacity on projects to get out of the Northern PA and Northern New Jersey markets like Leidy Southeast and Constitution?
Rory Lee Miller: Bradley, this is Rory Miller. Good question. In fact, when we closed out our Leidy Southeast project, we had very robust demand. But we've had a number of producers that have called back saying if they could get in to see if it was not too late to open the door and get on the project. So I think we've got over 8 BCF a day of pipeline, interconnects and capacity connected to bring gas into Leidy. And as those new connections see additional wells drilled behind our system and behind those interconnects, people are finding they need to get a way out. So we think there's an excellent chance for additional expansion up there, somewhere down the road. But very much a supply push situation. We've talked a lot about the quality of the Cabot reserves, the quality of their wells up there. But we're seeing that sweet spot extend west of there as well. So even though it's a dry gas area, the EURs on those wells are so robust that the economics of the current gas prices are very compelling. So we see a big supply push coming out of that area and we're looking at number of opportunities to help satisfy that demand from producers. Likewise, we talked a lot at Analyst Day about all the power generation opportunities up and down the system. We continue to see those opportunities roll in the door. So there's a fantastic opportunity for us to match up demand pull with the supply push, and we think that's going to keep new projects coming for years into the future.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: But no plans today on the table to expand either the Leidy Southeast or the Constitution project?
Rory Lee Miller: Right now, we're probably focused on the Leidy opportunity and I would just say, we're early on in that, but something could be coming out here in the near future.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And on the Bluegrass project. As you look at the pipeline fractionation storage, integrated nature of that project, is the 2.7, give or take, that you discussed as being largely Bluegrass related in your CapEx budgeting, does that include an export facility? And do you think that you would need to enter into a JV or some kind of economic sharing agreement with someone who has an existing export facility or existing acreage on the Gulf Coast in order to get that done?
James E. Scheel: Bradley, this is Jim Scheel. We have not included in the guidance number the export facility. We're still defining that at this point. We have seen a great amount of interest from our customers for that, they do view the international markets as the logical destination for many of the propanes and butanes. We have identified the site and we're moving forward to acquire that. As it relates to the cost of that, we're still defining it. We'll include that in future guidance.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And just a follow-up on some of the PDH questions from earlier. The PDH, as well as the ethane recovery costs appear to have increased since the Analyst Day. Is that, in the case of the PDH something related to kind of overall labor and cost trends in Western Canada? Or are those 2 separate issues? And on PDH, Alan, you mentioned that you would kind of rule out entering the propylene derivative business. Is there any reason, specifically, that you ruled out providing your own polypropylene facility just to expedite that process?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes, I'll take the last half of that and then I'll ask Fred Pace, who runs our engineering construction, to answer your question on the fundamentals in the construction cost in Alberta. On the derivatives side, I would just say that as you move further and further downstream, that starts to become more and more knowledge that is outside the base of our operations today. And I would just say, we have so many opportunities that are right down our fairway of knowledge that it doesn't really entice us to move outside of the area that we have strong knowledge in. And so we're excited to partner with others that have both the marketing expertise and the operations expertise that can help bring the value to that. So said another way, we're not really all that motivated to learn some new lessons when have such great opportunities in front of us right now. And so that's really driving that decision. And I'll ask Fred to answer the questions around the cost pressures in Alberta.
Fred Pace: Yes, on the PDH cost outlook kind of playing on Alan's earlier comment about our observance of other projects, having cost pressures, we've analyzed that. And did a much better job of also analyzing all of our other risks around availability of labor and contract personnel and materials, our entire supply chain around that. So that's just our best current thinking and guidance around our current risk analysis to come up with our current outlook.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And just one more and I'll get out of your hair. The Atlantic Gulf segment, you reduced kind of 2013 and 2014 guidance fairly significantly after the first quarter call. Now you've kind of printed 2 strong quarters in a row in the Atlantic Gulf segment, really the kind of Transco-related seasonality really wasn't visible on those results. And so you've kind of printed $300 million of segment profit in the first half of the year and you've kind of guided towards a full year segment profit in the low $500 million range. Is that -- is it correct to imply a decline in the second half of the year? Or is that just a segment that has, I guess, outperformed since the first quarter reporting?
Rory Lee Miller: This is Rory Miller again. I think the guidance that we included in the book showed us outperforming guidance, maybe $30 million on a full year basis. And I -- so I think we're going to be able to hold on to some of that, about 2/3 of that revision is attributable to lower O&M and G&A and we've been working hard I think as Alan mentioned earlier to control expenses. And I think a lot of that is -- will be sustainable improvements. We also had some other minor issues that are helping out. We did have an increase on our liquid transportation rates on Transco for condensate and retrograde. That combined with a little higher DD&A and then a reimbursement for some engineering cost from Gulfstream accounted for about 1/3 of that $30 million. So that's a lot of detail. But a number of those are sustainable type items. Of course, the engineering reimbursement would be a one-time event.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: A couple of quick questions. Does the business interruption insurance in the 2014, say, for the first quarter cover the delayed startup of the expansion on Geismar?
Donald R. Chappel: Craig, this is Don. I think answer is yes. Basically the policy covers our losses. So it's a comparison of what we would have made had the event not occurred to what we did or didn't make as a result of the loss. And obviously, we have a responsibility to minimize the loss and we would do that with or without insurance. So we're interested in getting the facility back up and running safely as quickly as possible, including the expansion. But the repairs are really the critical path item and the expansion will be complete along with the recovery and the turnaround. And we expect that to be covered.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Great. And Don, while I have you on the line, there was little uptick at least, for the quarter in the tax rate, but I don't think the full year has changed in terms of guidance. Can you give us some color around that?
Donald R. Chappel: I think the full year is down a little bit because of some additional bonus depreciation we were able to identify. And then just a function of continuing to refine the numbers, I think, the quarterly numbers are -- tend to move around a little bit, depending on the profitability and where that profitability is.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Great. And then finally, I wonder if you all could just give a little more color because I think there were some prepared comments regarding it and then also just recently some comments about attacking L&M and G&A that's helping the Atlantic Gulf segment. But could you all discuss in a little more detail the success you seem to be having with cost containment, especially in 2013 to offset some of the headwinds we're seeing?
Alan S. Armstrong: Well I would just say, we've all made a concerted effort on that front. As you know, we went through some very significant organizational restructure post the spin-off of WPX and I would just say that we are positioned and we reorganized ourselves in a way that we can really focus and bring some transparency to our cost structures and understand the areas of opportunity we have to put pressure on that and the team is doing a great job of doing that. So I would just say it's kind of the old-fashioned way. The good news I would tell you is I think it's very sustainable. And I think we have opportunities to continue to improve even more so as we kind of explore new opportunities in a much more integrated company. And so for instance, we're seeing areas of opportunity between gas pipes and midstream where previously, we operated as separate -- completely separate business units and now, we're seeing opportunities to save money because we're operating in a much more integrated fashion than we have previously. So more to come on that, but the team is doing a terrific job and very proud of the focus they've put on that.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Three, perhaps, cleanup questions. The first actually on -- just with respect to the insurance of Geismar. Obviously, you laid out the expectations and I guess with potentially only a 60-day lag that kind of implies a pretty smooth process. Has there been any contention or friction from the insurers at this point that would give you pause at all or is this -- do you expect to be a pretty smooth process?
Alan S. Armstrong: Carl, its too early to tell. We've not yet filed our first claim. But this is something where we'll be able to: one, we can present our forecast. The forecast we had before the incident and that was prepared without any knowledge of the incident coming, so I think that's pure. There's no bias in that forecast. We can present that to the insurers now. We would have our first insurer loss in the month of August. That would have been after the 60-day waiting period, but before the planned turnaround. So there's a small period that's insured. Just a couple of weeks of operation between that 60-day waiting period and when the turnaround would have happened. So we'll be able to submit that at the end of August, early September, and get response from the insurers on that payment, and that really set the stage for the balance and then we'd be in 50-day turnaround and so then in October, we would have a partial month again where we would have another partial month claim. We'd submit that claim at the end of October and then we'd submit a claim update every month. So we think that the 60-day lag is reasonable. It's possible we could get paid earlier or somewhat later. But right now, that's our best estimate.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Appreciate the color on that. The second and not to, perhaps, beat a dead horse on the PDH facility. But just given all the cost inflation that we have seen in Alberta and seem happening in such a quick period of time. When you look out with the major spend on when the PDH would actually happen. Is there any possibility of locking something up turnkey with someone in order to stem any possible future labor inflation?
Alan S. Armstrong: Well, again, I think by stretching our schedule out, we give ourselves a lot more opportunity around that. And as you'll recall and I think we mentioned this in our announcement -- original announcement with PDH facility that we were going with a little bit different design than some on the industry had because -- and a little bit smaller, so that we can build that business on a more modular basis. And so that allows us to bid out that modular construction on a fixed fee. And so the remaining portion would be the in the field construction. The good news about this project aside from some of the other projects we've seen a lot of cost pressures is this work is at Redwater, which is near Edmonton. A lot of the areas we really had a lot of struggle with in terms of low productivity and cost pressures has been in the Fort McMurray area where labor is more constrained, particularly skilled labor is more constrained. So I would just say, we're taking -- we're working hard to contract this in a way that really eliminates a lot of that build construction labor risk and productivity risk and stretching the schedule out gives us even more opportunity to do that.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Fair enough. And then last question if I could. Just on Bluegrass and if you could just refresh -- I think, you probably addressed this in prior conversations. But as you look out at sort of this large material investment, are you expecting from -- the feedback you've heard from shippers, are you expecting a return profile in line with other sort of large, almost, call it, FERC allowed type of traditional infrastructure returns? Or is it the uniqueness of the NGL solution would allow something higher more indicative of Midstream infrastructure?
Alan S. Armstrong: Well, I would say a couple of things allow us with a -- and remember, only a portion of this is regulated. The frac and storage business downstream of that is not regulated, so we have that opportunity, if you will, in terms of better than FERC return and I would just tell you, we have plenty of regulated cost of service returns available to us. And so we wouldn't take any additional risk or development cost like this if we didn't expect higher returns than that. So the answer to your question is, we do expect higher overall returns on the project. And one of the things that helps us achieve that obviously, is the benefit of the Texas Gas line and which provides us with a better solution than the market would otherwise had to offer. And gets us in schedule. Importantly, I can tell you from the shipper's perspective, this timing issue probably can't overstate that in terms of importance because people have all this acreage up there. They're very anxious to go drill, but they're seeing NGL prices continue to collapse up there in a very oversupplied market. Their only option is to transport out by rail and that -- even that is getting pretty congested. So I would just say that the market is very anxious for this solution and the return we're making is -- reaps the benefits of some of the things I mentioned.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Just wondering if you could maybe talk about the risk to achieving that April resumption date for you Geismar? Is it really just mainly, I guess, the pace of the repairs? Or does the status of the investigation play a part at all?
John R. Dearborn: A very insightful question. This is a John Dearborn, on the answer to that, if you take a look at it, we've got a few investigations underway, 1 by OSHA, 1 by CSB, and of course, the Williams' own investigation. We're collaborating there in a very open and transparent way with OSHA and CSB. And as a result of that, over time, over the last few weeks, OSHA and CSB have been, I'll say, giving back more and more of that plant so that the effective plant now that's still under the control of OSHA is a very small area around the fractionator itself. And so that's allowing us now to begin to, I won't say demolish, but begin to take apart the impacted part of the plant. So pretty quickly here, we think that the investigation is going to become a less of a risk to our path of rebuild. Then the question becomes, how quickly can we get the equipment and the necessary materials to plant and construct it and that in fact sets our timeline. Though it's not without risk, we feel pretty confident about the April 1 date, that's why we've been out with it.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And just another follow-up. In terms of the business interruption insurance, does that, like, cover, I guess, any obligations or contracts with your supply or sales?
Alan S. Armstrong: I'll let John take the question on the sales contracts. I don't think we expect to have any significant losses in that area. But yes, it would cover.
John R. Dearborn: Yes, and again, very insightful because of course, our customers are a very important stakeholder base for us right -- but we're going out to continue to build our relationships with our customers. All of our customers essentially are on force majeure at the moment and will be over time. We want to continue to preserve those relationships, so that they'll be there when the plant comes back up. So all these information is actually fresh for our customers in the coming weeks. We're going to be going out and speaking personally with our important customers out there so that they are with us on the other end of the startup.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And this also applies for any supply sources in terms of ethane?
John R. Dearborn: We really don't have a concern about the ethane. Essentially, the ethane goes back into the market and probably get used and consumed by others so it's not really an issue for us in our business.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I just want to understand the -- kind of picking up off of Sharon's question, sort of the range of outcomes if we're plus or minus the April 1 date on financials relative to kind of where you are with the insurance and the deductible let's say we push another quarter out, what does that do in terms of -- kind of the financial impact?
Donald R. Chappel: Ted, I think as John mentioned, we have a plan to get us started back up in April. If we push that back at some point, we would run out of potentially, or hypothetically, we'd run out of insurance -- business interruption insurance and the coverages combined $500 million for both business interruption and property damage. We have a current estimate on the property damage of $102 million, less a $10 million deductible. So that's $92 million of assumed coverage at this point. And then as you saw, we disclosed an estimate of $384 million on the business interruption coverage. So certainly, significant delays would expose us.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. But at that point then, it's just a matter of sort of the loss -- what's called the loss margin of the downtime from that perspective? And obviously, assuming the repair costs were the same. Is that fair?
Donald R. Chappel: Yes. Again, we have no reason to believe that the downtime will extend past April at this point, but certainly as you think about risk, I think you understand it well.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Great. Okay. And then just in terms of the distribution growth here at WPZ. It looks like you're still comfortable running a little below 1x in 2014. You've kept the idea wherever is the same. But again, there's some flex here in terms of what happens with Geismar. I was just wondering how we should think about what you'll target for coverage if the IDR waivers get increased from WMB or do we lower distribution growth, say, at WPZ, kind of how those all interplay?
Alan S. Armstrong: Those are, I would say, speculative questions at this point. But clearly, WPZ -- Williams enjoys about 75% of WPZ's distribution, so we have a big stake in it. WPZ is our primary equity funding vehicle and funding vehicle generally. So obviously it's very important to Williams. We did waive the $200 million of IDRs. We did not see any point to step forward further on that at this point. But certainly, we'll consider potential waivers, additional waivers if and when needed. So I would just say, we'll stay tuned here. If we execute as we had put forth in our plan here today, we don't believe any additional waivers are required. We look at 2014 at getting closer to 1x coverage again with a lot of fee-based growth. And by 2015, getting back to that 1x coverage number. So we're comfortable running where we are. And at Williams we'll continue to monitor the situation and see if WPZ needs any additional support and make the decision accordingly.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.
Jeremy Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: My question is with regards to the Western segment, seems like in the west, results were better than we anticipated and going nicely in the first half of the year. I was just curious as far as in 2014, you have a bit of a stepdown there as far as what you're looking for segment profit in DD&A, it was only marginally increased. I'm just wondering, is that a bit of conservatism or what's kind of driving the year-over-year step down in guidance there?
Allison G. Bridges: Well, partly because we do have some contracts that had changed in 2014. So that is some of the reduction.
Jeremy Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, great. And then last one for me. I was just curious, with this guidance revision, I think some of the other recent ones, it seems like maintenance CapEx has been ticking down a little bit for 2014, 2015. I was just wondering if you could touch on the drivers for that?
Alan S. Armstrong: Sure. One of the things is we had some, as we mentioned earlier, we have some time pressures on getting some of our asset integrity work done towards the end of 2012. We completed a lot of that work as we've laid out in the past so we kind of add an accelerated effort there to complete some of that work. And as well, we're continuing to take advantage where we can of the integrated nature of our business and looking to really invest that maintenance capital in the ways that reduce risk very best for this company overall. And so I would just say, we're continuing to really analyze that. Obviously, the thing we're going to spend our dollars on first is keeping the system safe and reliable and we certainly won't back off on the cost that it takes to do that and we'll continue to do that. But there are other areas that we can find ways to improve cost, purchasing power across a lot of our assets, which we -- when we combine our gas pipes and our midstream efforts, we got a lot of purchasing power. And so we're continuing to find ways to improve on that.
Operator: And we'll take our final question from Christine Cho with Barclays.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just some follow-ups. On the PDH facility, if it's going to be in service in 2017 is most of the CapEx going to take place in 2016 with maybe a little bit in '15? I just wanted to know how we should think about the timing of the spending.
Fred Pace: This is Fred Pace responding. That's exactly right, wrapping up in '15, but the majority occurring in '16.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then this is just an accounting question. But are you going to be consolidating your 50% interest in GulfStar and your 41% interest in Constitution? I wasn't clear if you guys -- how you guys are accounting for it in your segment profit guidance?
Alan S. Armstrong: John is going to take this one.
John Porter: This is John Porter. Yes, those 2 assets are shown on a consolidated basis with a non-controlling interest presented below segment profit.
Operator: And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional closing remarks.
Alan S. Armstrong: Okay, great. Well, thank you, all, very much. This is Alan Armstrong again, thank you all for joining us and we remain very excited about the future that we have ahead of us. And our showing of starting to really turn the corner on the fee-based projects really starting to kick in so thanks for joining us.
Operator: And that does conclude our conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams and Williams Partners First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John Porter: Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website, williams.com and williamslp.com. These items include yesterday's press releases with related schedules and the accompanying analyst packages; a presentation discussing these results; guidance updates and growth opportunities with related audio commentary from our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and an update to our data books, which contain detailed information regarding various aspects of our business. This morning, Alan will make a few comments and then we will open the discussion up for Q&A. We also have the 4 leaders of our operating areas present with us: Frank Billings leads our Northeastern G&P operating area, Allison Bridges leads our Western operating area, Rory Miller leads our Atlantic-Gulf area and Randy Newcomer is here from our NGL & Petchem Services operating area. Additionally, our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to any questions. In yesterday's presentation and also in our data books, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan S. Armstrong: Great. Good morning. Thank you, John. Well, first of all, our cash flow metrics for the first quarter remained strong and in line with our expectations despite a continued decline in NGLs. Earnings at WMB, however, for the quarter were impacted by higher DD&A, including an additional $17 million of noncash amortization related to the ACMP acquisition. But we were pleased with the 1.05 coverage at WPZ despite another 21% step down in NGL margins from the fourth quarter of '12 and now a 50% decline from the first quarter of 2012. Looking forward, we see some short-term painful but long-term healthy cross-currents as both the NGL markets and the natural gas markets continue to expand on the backs of low-cost supplies relative to global alternatives. The natural gas market right now is ahead as the demand decisions have already been made in response to an extended low gas price period. But the NGL demand side will also begin to respond but perhaps not as quickly and certainly to more limited options for market expansions. As a result, we see a couple of years where NGLs will be oversupplied and producer's response to natural gas price signals will be more -- or will be met by most people -- be slower than most people's expectations just because of the time it takes to set the flywheel rolling in these large-scale operations. Areas like the Marcellus and the Utica will be advantaged by the benefits of large-scale development because those major programs are already in place. For Williams, this results in great infrastructure investment alternatives to expand in the market, access for these large-scale NGL and natural gas values that still will be ready to deliver quickly against the positive market signals. So in the short term, the higher natural gas prices will be negatively impact -- will negatively impact our margins. But longer term, this will drive even more investment alternatives. So while our 62% growth in DCF from 2013 to 2015 is certainly impressive, we could see this improve even more if the forecasted pricing environment holds up long enough to spur more supplies and more demand because after all, our strategy is built around the volume throughput that will come with expanded markets with these great low-cost resources being developed here in North America. We're excited this quarter to announce the continuation of our 20% dividend growth at WMB through the 2015 guidance, and we look forward to sharing more about our large platform of growth capital projects that supports this continued growth in 2015 and beyond with our Analyst Day coming up here on May 21. And with that, we'll turn it over for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Brad Olsen with Tudor, Pickering.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Could you provide maybe some kind of breakdown of what is driving the CapEx growth in the Northeast segment particularly? Is that the result of regulatory hurdles, labor, materials or another factor?
Francis E. Billings: Yes, this is Frank Billings. The majority of the capital increase in the Northeast that we're seeing and forecasting for really '13 and '14 and a little bit of '15 is really targeted for additional capacity requirements to support the drilling programs for our customers in Northeast Pennsylvania. We're actually expanding market outlets to support those drilling programs and increasing our takeaway capacity to the current pipeline connections that we have, as well as setting up for Constitution coming on as well. The other thing we have is -- the other piece of that is we do have our Three Rivers investment in that time period as well.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: And when you talk about increasing takeaway alternatives, is that focused more on gathering? Or is that -- is there a specific long-haul pipeline that you're delivering into more than you expected or where you're building more capacity?
Francis E. Billings: It's spread out across the current delivery points that we have today. So we have our deliveries into Transco, Tennessee, Millennium, we'll have Constitution, and those are the primary ones we're going to continue to focus on. And that's the -- and those are the outlets that our producer customers are wanting us to focus on as well.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Great. And is there an update at this point on Bluegrass, how the contracting of the pipeline is coming along? And if Bluegrass does proceed, do you believe that it reduces the demand for local market fractionation in the Northeast?
James E. Scheel: This is Jim Scheel. Bluegrass negotiations are going very well right now. We have operations, legal and commercial folks working to finalize the agreements. It's my hope that we'll be finalizing those some time during this month so that we can go out to customers with tariff proposals early next month. Going to the next part of the question, yes, I do believe that Bluegrass will provide a great opportunity for wide-grade [ph] product to move to the Gulf Coast in order to meet the customer demand for NGLs in the large-scale fractionation facilities in that area of the country
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Great. And just one last question from me. In 2014, there was a revision to the Atlantic and Gulf segment EBITDA. It looked a little bit larger than just commodity impacts alone, and I was wondering if you could comment on that? And that's all for me.
Rory Lee Miller: Alan, do you want me to take that.
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes, please, Rory.
Rory Lee Miller: Yes. Just a couple of things going on there. Effective March 1, 2013, we have set new reserve rates and rates subject to refund. And the main driver there was we wound up with a little lower rate base to work against than we were forecasting in earlier periods. We had a little lower maintenance capital spending and so that drove the rate base down, which brought that kind of forward-looking base down a bit. And then there is an impact on Gulfstar. We're probably looking at a couple of months, potentially, delay there, and that effect is kind of amplified because of the accounting treatment that we're using with the Marubeni buy end of the project. As you recall, we sold half of that project to Marubeni and due to the accounting treatment, it shows the full impact to segment profit, but the impact on DCF is only about half of that. And Don, if you -- you may have a little more clear accounting explanation of that, but that's it in a nutshell.
Donald R. Chappel: Just to follow up on Rory's comment, again, we consolidate the Gulfstar project, so we show 100% of it despite the fact that our ownership is 51%. And our partner, Marubeni's interest, shows up as non-controlling interest, so you see segment profit move down as we've pushed the startup of that project back by a quarter. But the net effect of that is about half of what shows up in the segment profit change because of the non-controlling interest change that offsets it.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Faisel Khan with Citigroup.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: It's Faisel at Citi. I appreciate the additional guidance on the dividend for 2015, but I just wanted to ask a few questions on those assumptions in order to get to that number for dividend growth for '15. I guess if I look at the analyst package and look at your coverage ratio for the dividend payout for '13 and '14, it seems like you have enough coverage. But it looks like that assumption is based on a very low cash tax rate. It's also based on ethylene prices kind of holding up where they are, and I guess it also assumes that ethane rejection kind of continues for the foreseeable future. I'm just wondering, what gets you comfortable that you have enough wiggle room through the -- over the next few years to increase that dividend all the way to 2015 by 20%? I mean, the cash tax rate looks a little bit aggressive, and the ethylene assumption also seems -- it seems decent now, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of wiggle room.
Donald R. Chappel: Faisel, this is Don. I'll just take the first part of the question on the cash tax rate and then I'll turn it over to Alan. But you're correct, our cash tax rate through '14 is fairly low. And even into '15, it's less than probably the long-term rates. However, we have a forecast that goes out well beyond '15, and we do account for the fact that our cash tax rate will be moving up over time. And despite that, we're comfortable that we have the coverage, the capacity and the underlying growth projects to sustain that dividend growth through 2015. And again, I think we feel comfortable that we have strong growth beyond. Despite it, we're not providing guidance out in that beyond-'15 period.
Alan S. Armstrong: Faisel, I'll take the question on the pricing, particularly on the ethane and ethylene. At the WMB level, which I assume your question is pointed to relative to the dividend, don't forget that we do have ethane exposure, positive ethane exposure, in Canada that is not captured in a lot of that PZ analysis that we've shown in terms of our sensitivity of ethane to ethylene such that if you add back in that exposure -- now remember, that -- the way that contract is structured, we have a floor that's a cost of service basis for negative ethane. But when ethane goes positive, then that's long barrels that would offset that otherwise short position that we have against ethane. So at the WMB level, we're actually fairly neutral there. In addition to that, we also have the impact, and it actually showed up pretty significantly in these numbers as we went to full ethane rejection from our Overland Pass business, where we're showing full ethane rejection throughout this period. So even though that doesn't show up as direct commodity exposure, it's pretty significant in terms of its impact over this 2-year period. So if you really look at the full balance of our exposure there, I would tell you we're -- from a cash flow standpoint, we're pretty well neutral relative to that ethane assumption at the WMB level. And so -- and as to the ethylene and propylene margin, we're certainly showing that reducing by about 10% from what we saw here in the first quarter of 2013. So certainly wouldn't suggest that that's not without risk. But frankly, we're seeing a lot of pull through on the ethylene side right now, on the demand side for ethylene. So at this point in time, we think that's a sound assumption on our part.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And, Alan, just to make sure I understand the guidance going forward for '13, '14 and '15, the ethane equity sales that we saw in the first quarter and the ethane production numbers we saw in this first quarter, are we to assume that those numbers kind of continue with the same first quarter numbers kind of going forward, which would be a drastic short of reduction in volumes over the fourth quarter of last year and all of last year for that matter. So I just want to make sure I understand that number in the guidance.
Alan S. Armstrong: That is an -- I will tell you no -- even though we've said we will expect our pricing is done on a -- in terms of what we put out, is done on an annual average basis, and I will tell you, it won't be that smooth. And there will be periods where we have recovery and there will be a short period in there as prices inch up, and then we'll see rejection turn around. So when we say full rejection, we mean that in the sense that the pricing signal on an annual average basis will keep that. But we'll see spotting. In fact, I think we had some periods of recovery here recently here in the second quarter as well. So we'll see periods where we go in and out of recovery and rejection. But we think there's plenty of supply to hit that bid very quickly out there in the market, and I think one of the things that's kind of reset that market a little bit from what we would have seen maybe 5 or 10 years ago is there's a lot of ship-or-pay kind of contracts out there such that the variable expense to a producer is higher than what it used to have been. So they're making a decision against the ship-or-pay contract, which is kind of lowering the point at which people will go into rejection. And we as Williams really don't have that. And so we're right on the edge there and really looking at variable expense with the exception of the little bit of impact, the benefit we get from the Overland Pass transportation. So I think that's keeping that pricing level down below where you normally would see it for -- to encourage ethane recovery.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Maresca from Morgan Stanley.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: My first question is just on the IDR waivers. Alan and Don, you had 1.05 coverage in the first quarter. What made you feel like you needed to do the IDR waivers through the year? And how much of this was just a reduction in price assumptions? Or how much of it was kind of your view that volumes are not picking up quite as fast as previously thought?
Alan S. Armstrong: Steve, I'll take that. I would just tell you very clearly, the pricing is, by far, the primary driver for us on this. I'm actually encouraged, and I think there's a good chance that we'll see volumes respond even more positively than we have in our forecast. But I would say we're at a little bit of a cross-current here in the market where gas prices picked up. And yet, the producers -- we're not seeing that response from the producers quite quick enough. I think they're kind of looking at this pricing and wondering if it's for real or not in terms of this price pickup on natural gas, and they're not quite ready to put the capital back behind what might be a blip in price. So I think if that continues, that we'll see that. Nevertheless, I would tell you that, partially because of that response, we're showing higher gas price throughout this period, which is a big driver of that lower margin. And as we've said here in the second quarter, we watched butanes drop by $0.01 a day for almost 30 days in a row. And so I would just tell you, its hard to build a lot of optimism in that market, in that pricing looking forward, and we certainly don't have a good answer other than exports picking up some of that. We don't have a good answer because we continue to see the incredible amount of NGLs that are available in places like the Utica and the Marcellus and the Eagle Ford. And we just see those supplies continuing to roll in. And so yes, we've got expanding markets in the way of exports, but there's a tremendous amount of supply continuing to build here for the next couple of years. And we're going to need to see very large-scale solutions developed like the Bluegrass project to really provide big enough market access for these products.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then I believe you mentioned, Alan, also on the podcast, just some of the lower segment profit guidance in '14, including some changes in in-service dates for projects. Can you elaborate what is driving a little bit of that?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes. I think the primary driver there for '14 was the Gulfstar project that got mentioned. And again, that just hit segment profit by the larger number, and you cut that in half when you get down to DCF. That's probably the largest impact project that we have for 2014, and I think that's really the primary driver.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then final one from me, another thing you mentioned was being a little bit disappointed with the Ohio Valley cost environment, higher cost than had thought. Can you talk a little bit also about what is driving that? How you see that playing out over the next 6, 12 months?
Alan S. Armstrong: Sure. I'll take that and Frank can fill in where I miss here. But I would just say, we have really poured into that. But I think one of the things that might -- some of the way that language came off, a lot of the cost increases we're talking about, just from an accounting perspective, is much higher depreciation expense. And so that's really one of the primary drivers of expense on that. But I would tell you that we are working very, very hard to get our operations in line up there, and we're really trying to not spare a whole lot of expense on that. We're certainly mindful to it. But there's so much value in getting that system up and running and getting it up and reliable that we are -- we are bringing in a lot of resources from other parts of the country and really working hard. That's a very high-margin business for us, as you can imagine, on one hand. And in addition to that, it's certainly a reputational issue for us as well in terms of serving the customers out there. And so we're working hard. There's a lot of issues to overcome out there as a lot of that system really wasn't built in a robust enough way to handle the variability that we've seen in production out there. And so we're working hard to overcome that. And so I would just say we're going to get there, and we're having to pour the coals to it on the expense side right now to overcome some of them.
Operator: And we'll move on to our next question from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I just want to come back to the 2015 dividend. What is the coverage, by the way that you defined it, that you're looking for in 2015? I think you're at sort of 1.3 or 1.34 on '13 and '14, but what's your coverage on '15 that you're seeing?
Donald R. Chappel: Ted, we have not put that out yet. We'll put it out on Analyst Day. But we're comfortable we have more than adequate coverage in light of the assumptions that are embedded in our forecast. And again, we didn't put out all of our '15 detail and keep you interested and coming to our Analyst Day in a couple of weeks.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. I will be there. Just on Bluegrass again. I'm trying to understand the mechanics of kind of how -- the contribution that we'll get from Boardwalk. As I understand it, they'll contribute the pipeline, you'll contribute the cash. Is there any kind of crossover where, on capital or whatnot, they need to participate? Maybe walk us through that. And then also, this idea that ATEX, the enterprise line, might run more than just ethane, how do you see that impacting the Bluegrass pipeline?
James E. Scheel: Well, I'll start with the first question. Again, this is Jim Scheel. The anticipation right now is that Williams and Boardwalk will be 50-50 partners in the Bluegrass pipeline. Boardwalk will contribute part of Texas Gas that will have a value in the joint venture. Williams will true up through capital contributions for new construction. We'll be equal owners throughout the pipeline, as well as fractionation and storage facilities. To the extent there's customer demand for a export facility, we'd also anticipate sharing ownership in that on a 50-50 basis. That's the expectation today, and that's what we're working towards currently with them in those negotiations. As far ATEX going into additional products, actually, we would support seeing some of those opportunities to provide clearing for near-term liquids out of the Marcellus to meet customer demand. So I won't speak for enterprise, but that would be something that I think would help the market in the Northeast in the near term.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just a big-picture one. It sounds like you have a lot of great growth projects, a lot of capital going in. Is there any sense that you feel capital constrained at all? I'm just wondering if there's projects anywhere that you might be turning down, maybe the pipeline into Florida that folks are working on? Just kind of how you're thinking about how much capital you have available relative to the opportunity set?
Alan S. Armstrong: Well, we certainly are in a position to allocate capital, and we consistently do. And I would just tell you, we're very wary of risk as we do that. And so I would say we're allocating on a risk-adjusted return basis, and that's -- it's a good situation to be in. But we certainly are in a regular process of allocating capital and turning down alternatives that are put in front of us today, which are above our current cost of capital on one hand, but on the other hand, we've certainly loaded into our equity pretty heavily last year, and we've got such a great set of projects that provide so much value if we execute on those, that anything that can get in the way of that kind of value being realized is something that we're going to guard against pretty heavily.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Sharon Lui from Wells Fargo.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Just wondering if you could talk about, I guess, the decision to undertake Bluegrass at the WMB level and whether you envision this project to, I guess, generate primarily fee-based cash flows that would be appropriate of the drop down to WPZ some point in time?
Donald R. Chappel: Sharon, this is a Don. I'd just say that we felt that WPZ had a pretty full plate in terms of projects to develop and finance and that Williams had some excess cash flow, and the Bluegrass development was a good place to put it. So clearly, it's a perfect drop-down candidate, or it could even be jointly developed in time. But that was really the thinking around the decision to at least initially fund that at Williams.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then I guess just looking at the cash balance that you guys have and the projected -- the excess cash flow at WMB, do you envision, I guess, any equity requirements to fund CapEx at that -- the WMB level right now?
Donald R. Chappel: Sharon, there's no equity requirements contemplated in this plan that we put forth, but we wouldn't speculate as to what could occur. But again, I think as Alan mentioned, we're -- we have a vast array of opportunities. We're allocating capital very carefully, looking at risk as well as strategic value and near-term value as well in deciding what to fund. So it'll be based on the facts and circumstances and what comes forward.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then if you could just provide some color on the operational issues experienced at Ohio Valley and how that's being resolved?
Francis E. Billings: Sure. This is Frank again. Right now, we're really working to debottleneck the system with some near-term projects to kind of get some -- take some quick wins. Really, we're beginning to implement our long-term operating philosophy for the area that really focuses on removing the fraction of gas stream that wants to be liquid under the conditions we're realizing in the gathering system. We're still going to move those hydrocarbons to Fort Beeler and Oak Grove, but we're going to pull them out of the gas -- gathering line and put them into our liquids line and then handle the separation and product upgrading at those central facilities at either Oak Grove and Moundsville. The primary benefit that we're attempting to do is remove those liquids that are pooling in the line and driving up the operating pressures of the system, to the point that the liquids are curtailing the volumes. Another significant benefit of the change in philosophy is really a significant reduction in our pigging activity, which has been impacting our reliability but also creates a lot of operational complexity. As an example, we're going to get operating expense improvement as well out of that because today, we probably pig that -- pig those systems 3x a day, and with these changes we'll be able to do that potentially once a month. So we'll have significant reduction in those things that could impact our pressure. But what we find is when we pig the system today, we don't get very lasting benefit given the operating conditions. And the other thing that we're really setting up for. And you've got to remember, that system has only really been out there 12 months or a little over 12 months, but we have a wide variety of temperature and pressure that we see over a calendar year. And what we want to do is set up a system that we feel we can operate safely, consistently and reliably 365 days a year. So we feel like we've got the right path forward, and we're going to begin to implement some of those significant changes throughout the summer months.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Craig Shere with the Tuohy Brothers.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: A couple of quick ones. Don, did I see correctly that you all are guiding to slightly higher cash tax rate expectations versus the fourth quarter guidance? And what's driving that? And then, Alan, I had a quick question about the IDR forgiveness after that.
Donald R. Chappel: Yes, Craig, I think there was a very minor change in cash tax rate, and that's usually just a function of CapEx and taxable income. So I wouldn't read anything more into it than that. So it's just a tweak based on all of the other changes we made in our forecast.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. And, Alan, on the IDR forgiveness -- I mean, frankly, as a onetime event, as you fill in for commodity margin with your huge fee-based growth CapEx pipeline, a couple of hundred million dollars as an NPV is irrelevant on a pretax basis. The question though, would be is, is this really a onetime event as you are guiding to just over 1x, 1.03x, I think, in 2015 PZ coverage? Or could you envision a circumstance where this might have to be repeated?
Alan S. Armstrong: Well, I think you could certainly describe the time where we might repeat it if we saw conditions occur, but that's certainly not what our plans suggest right now. And I think we have a fairly conservative plan out there. I think it's really just the result of the amount of heavy investment that we're going through right now on the capital side to take advantage of all these great opportunities. And so we are very much investing into what we think is a great strategy and -- but that obviously has required a lot of equity issuance at WPZ to fund all that, and that certainly put a lot of pressure on that coverage. And you couple that, of course, with a rising gas price and drastically lowering NGL prices, and that's the circumstances we find ourselves in for 2013. None of that, from my perspective, overshadows the great growth prospects that we've got going on in the fee-based business, and I think our effort here is just to bridge into that more fee-based model that we're moving to. And so I think in the future, there will be less variables as we become less and less reliant on the NGL margin. I think there'll be less variables that would drive us or require us to do that. So I think that's the way I would answer that.
Donald R. Chappel: Craig, I -- this is Don. I'd just remind you and the others on the call that, again, Williams owns 68% of the LP units and the IDRs. If you look at our guidance, we enjoy 73% -- and I think of the cash flows out at WPZ in '13. And I think it goes up to about 76% by 2015. So the amount of IDR reduction that's given back to others is, call it, 25% of the total 200. So really, the lion's share of that is really staying, and to the benefit of Williams, it's just putting it in a different pocket.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Brett Reilly with Credit Suisse.
Brett Reilly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Can you just add a little bit more color on the OBM lower volume assumptions more in the '14, '15 time frame, recognizing the issues you face today?
Francis E. Billings: Sure. When we look at what's going on in '13, I think if you look back at some of the producers behind our system, they've openly said that they're scaling back 2013 drilling behind OBM as a result there, in response to the current operating capacities that we have there. There's still probably $100 million a day of volume that we're going to unlock over the next 4 to 6 months that we feel like we can bring to bear. But we really feel that the producers are really focused on the drilling programs for 2014 and '15. And given the things that we're doing up there, I think we're going to allow the producers and Williams to get to the levels that we've previously forecasted. I think in '14, our volume projection's not off that far. And I know we have a little bit of a step down in '15, but I really think that's less -- that's probably less a response to known information. I think it's really just when we try to just project what we think the producers can actually do out of that area and given their volume profiles, we're really just trying to forecast more of what we see the activity being. But really, we're going to get out of -- we know we're going to have reduced volumes in '13 for the known things we have, but we feel like we'll have the system capable of moving the volumes that we've had in our previous forecast, and I think we've stayed pretty close to that level in '14.
Brett Reilly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. Got it. And with the additional capital being spent in that area to resolve some of the bottlenecks today, is there an opportunity at all to recover some of that cost? Or is this all incremental capital just to get or satisfy the current contracts?
Francis E. Billings: That's a good question. And actually, what we're doing is we want to make -- we do have to do some of these things to make certain that we stay in compliance with some of our current contractual obligations for pressures at some of our field receipt points. But we have had some discussions with producers to looking at a value trade that could either be some -- maybe some acreage that is currently not dedicated or some other ways to get some improvements in revenues as a result of the improved level of services that we're going to see out there.
Brett Reilly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got you. And then maybe looking to the Western part of the portfolio, any update on recontracting some of those commitments you have out there so that it's more fee-based versus commodity-based?
Allison G. Bridges: This is Allison Bridges. Certainly, we are proactively negotiating contracts with producers as they are coming due. And I think that they are interested in moving away from pure keep-whole deals. So we are looking at different ways of contracting, whether it be fee-based or based on price of gas or other items.
Brett Reilly - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then last one for me, the $2 billion bump in your growth capital opportunity set at the MB level, is that really just a function of Bluegrass? Or is there a few other moving pieces within there?
Donald R. Chappel: Brett, this is Don. I think there's quite a few moving pieces. I think the biggest change is the expansion of the scope of the Bluegrass system to include, I think as Jim described, fractionation storage and export.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: Back on the cash on Page 79, the 2014 ending cash balance of $308 million at WMB level. How much of that is Canadian and how much of it is domestic? And then just along with that, with the Bluegrass project expected to come online in '15, I would expect a significant amount of CapEx in '14. So how do you kind of bridge that gap at the MB level?
Donald R. Chappel: Becca, the bulk of that cash is Canadian cash. How do we bridge that gap? Well, it'll certainly be from capital raising. And it could be debt, could be equity. We'll determine that when we finalize our joint venture agreement and officially sanction the project.
Alan S. Armstrong: Becca, a couple of things on that capital I don't think we've disclosed. I think Jim took a question earlier around Boardwalk contributing to the pipeline and us contributing capital, that's not an accurate representation at all of the funding situation there. And I think the question was that -- Jim didn't say that, but that was what the question implied. And so there is a contribution of pipeline, but there's -- and there's some recognition of that in value. But the sharing of the capital obviously is a lot more easily split on the pipeline. As well, I would just say a big chunk of that -- we'd love to be in the field constructing in '14, but I'll tell you, more likely, most the construction dollars will actually be in '15. And the project is scheduled to come on very late in '15.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: And then on the Northeast, the segment data shows I think a loss of $9 million in segment profit, and the guidance is $100 million for the year. Can you talk to us about how that ramps up? Is it ratable to get to the $100 million? Or is it more back-end loaded?
Francis E. Billings: I guess I'm not -- I need to see -- I'm not quite certain of the information. Are you looking at...
Donald R. Chappel: Just looking at the first quarter versus your annual guidance.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: I'm looking at the adjusted segment guidance within the PZ first quarter data book that's on Page 5. It shows guidance for Northeast G&P of $100 million for the year versus -- sorry, I've got so many pieces of paper around here. I think the first quarter was a loss of $9 million.
Frank Billings: Okay. Let me see if I can get that in front of me. Why don't we take the...
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: And then while you guys are looking then, Geismar. In your call, your podcast, you talked about cost overruns at Geismar. Can you quantify how big those are?
Alan S. Armstrong: Well, I don't think we have disclosed that. I would tell you it's still a little bit of a moving target at this point. But the -- what we do know is that some of the estimations of the amount of steel and amount of wiring and so forth came in at a higher level. So you can see on Page 61 there, you can see kind of the new range for that. But I would tell you, we are pretty far along on it in terms of the project itself and have a very good idea of the required additional materials and labor on that. And so that's reflected in there. But I don't think we've disclosed the actual amount on that. But again, you can get a very good feel for that on Page 61 in terms of the range there.
Francis E. Billings: Sure. And to your question on the first quarter versus the year guidance, this is Frank again. I think what you're seeing in the first quarter is we had some slip issues, and we also had the rupture in the -- on the pipeline system in the Ohio Valley that hit some of the first Q guidance. But if you look at our businesses up there, other than the kind of the -- what we're experiencing in OBM, our businesses in Northeast Pennsylvania around our Susquehanna County Supply Hub assets as well our LMM businesses are performing pretty well. And we should be seeing good cash flow and segment profit coming out of those areas. So it's not back-end loaded. We should see it start to come back quarter-to-quarter over the rest of the year.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: And then the last one is on IDR support. You talked about up to $200 million. That's really going to fluctuate depending on how much WPZ needs. So as we model that, do we look to you guys wanting to target throughout the quarters a 0.9x coverage? Or what kind of coverage would you give support to? Or what kind of -- how much cash to get to what kind of support level on the IDRs?
Donald R. Chappel: Becca, I think we've maintained some discretion over that. But we have 1.05 coverage in the first quarter. We'll look at what the second quarter results are on a year-to-date basis, as well as our outlook for the balance of the year and we'll make a determination. I wouldn't expect that necessarily we'll -- we won't try to put each quarter exactly where we would expect the full year to be, but we'll look at kind of year-to-date actuals, as well as the outlook for the year in determining how much to waive each quarter to get to the full year effect that we are looking for.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: The $200 million only applies to '13, not to '14. Is that correct?
Alan S. Armstrong: It is for the next 4 quarters. So it does -- it would be available. As you can see right now, we're not forecasting that we would need that in '14, but it is available.
Donald R. Chappel: Yes. Our guidance includes a waiver for each -- well, for the next 3 quarters. So if you look at Q2 through Q4 and the -- the actual payment for Q4 would extend into early '14. That's what's in our guidance model. However, the commitment is up to $200 million over the next 4 quarters, and we're targeting a 0.90 coverage ratio for 2013. And again, we didn't model any direct waiver beyond the next 3 quarters, even though we mentioned 4 quarters potentially.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: I think most of the questions here have been asked, but maybe just a couple of cleanups. And first, just to clarify, the projected spending on Bluegrass, that anticipates the 50-50 structure? Or is that being showed more 100% at this point?
Donald R. Chappel: It's in the 50%, Carl, but it's not in our guidance. It's only in the disclosure of projects that are beyond the guidance set of projects.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. And then lastly, if I could just clarify, and appreciate the extra information on Gulfstar. This is with respect to 2014 WPZ guidance. Is it possible to clarify -- maybe Gulfstar is the only major project of note, but is it possible to clarify of the reduction in 2014 segment guidance and -- so understanding this is segment, not the DCF, how much of that came from the collective shift of in-service dates?
Rory Lee Miller: I'm not sure I have that. This is Rory, I'm not sure I've got that. If I had to guess, I'd say it's around half of it. And then the other biggest driver would be the other item that I mentioned about going through a rate case and our reserve rate and just dealing with a little lower rate base. But the Gulfstar project is going extremely well. I was down there last week and looking at the hull. The project looks fantastic. It's, like a lot of these projects, very complex and we think it could be a couple of months' delay on there. So that's about half of that change for 2014.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: For 2014? Right.
Rory Lee Miller: Right. And then after that, of course there's no effect. There's no impact to any of the revenue streams coming off then.
Operator: Our next question comes from Selman Akyol with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Most of the questions have been asked. In terms of Geismar, do you have a turnaround scheduled for this quarter?
Alan S. Armstrong: Take that, Randy.
Randy M. Newcomer: This is Randy Newcomer. We are -- right now, we're planning -- we're finishing up the detailed planning around the turnaround and the integration of the expansion. That will happen -- the tie-in of the expansion will happen during the turnaround. Right now we're anticipating bringing the plant down for maintenance and for the tie-in of expansion latter part of August. So it'll be a third quarter kind of event.
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And how long would you anticipate being down at that time?
Randy M. Newcomer: We're planning -- right now, it's looking like -- and we have it in our forecast at about 50 days down.
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And then also in the quarter, in terms of production given the strength of margins, I think you were at 246 million pounds this quarter compared to the prior quarter of 261 million pounds. I was -- I would have thought you'd be a little higher than that given the strength in the market. Any comment there?
Randy M. Newcomer: Yes, a couple of things. One is that if you'll recall, the price of propane was down very considerably in the first quarter, and propane was actually the preferred feedstock during that time. And so we ran heavy on feed, which makes less ethylene, makes more propylene and actually higher profitability. So that's part of the reduction in the volumes in the first quarter. The other one was we had some furnace issues that kind of kept us one-furnace short for most of the quarter. And those have since been resolved.
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And then just more of an industry question, I guess we've been hearing that ethane rejection has been running at about 175,000 barrels per day. Does that seem like the correct number? Could it be higher than that from what you see?
Alan S. Armstrong: I would say from the vantage point that we have, the areas that we have, I would say that's probably fair of the ethane that's positioned to be recovered today. Obviously, if you included all the ethane that's being rejected up in the Northeast, it'd be considerably larger than that. But I don't think anybody is really counting that because it hasn't been in the market previously. But I do think that looking -- if you track propane volumes and then track those relative to ethane volume, a pretty good idea even though -- as people reject ethane, as I'm sure you're aware, it does lower propane recoveries a little bit. And so I think that's a good indicator. But I would say from our vantage point that 175 is probably in the ballpark. It might be a little north of that, but that's probably a pretty close estimation.
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: All right. And then finally, just for clarification purposes, you guys talked about your forecasting based on ethane rejection. Is that at the same level going forward for the next several years? Or do you have that declining in your forecast?
Alan S. Armstrong: No, we have the same -- really, when we estimate that for us, we're basically just looking at our plant economics and our variable cost economics and determining what we're going to do, obviously not determining what the whole market will do. And as I mentioned earlier, I think there's a lot of contract structures out there where there might be a percent of liquids contracts where the producer might be -– or sorry, the processor might be driven economically to continue to recover because they don't have the shrink risk, or there are take-or-pay or ship-or-pay obligations where the variable decision, if you will, is lower. And so they'll take a lower –- because they're going to have to pay the transportation and fractionation anyway. Therefore, they'll take a loss on the ethane. So I think those are driving some of those decisions. But for our decisions, we basically are forecasting that we'll be in full rejection at all of our plants throughout the period. Now as I said earlier, I can assure you that will not be the case, that there will be periods where we're up a little bit as margins pop up and we'll take advantage of those. But as it's modeled in our plan right now, it is in full rejection.
Operator: We'll take our last question from Helen Ryoo with Barclays.
Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Actually most of my questions are answered. But just on accept and rejection, is any of your keep-whole contracts on your processing plants have –- on those contracts, is there any must-recover ethane volume? Or could you just sell them at methane price when you have that negative spread?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes. Well, really, the way that works from a contract standpoint is we just replace any Btus that we take out. So if we don't -- didn't take the ethane out, we just leave the ethane in and we don't have anything to keep a producer whole on. So we're not really exposed on that provided that we reject it. It's just – we only have to replace any Btus that we take out.
Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then -- so I guess the full ethane rejection you saw in the quarter it's mainly affecting just the Overland and Conway fractionators?
Alan S. Armstrong: That's correct. Now the Overland Pass line, of course, collects the ethane from our Piceance and our Wyoming plants. So that's Opal, Echo and the Willow Creek facility, and those are a large producer of our equity ethane barrels. That's a very large portion of our equity ethane barrels. And so those are in rejection. But remember that those go into Overland Pass, they're not actually fractionated at Overland Pass –- sorry, they're not actually fractionated at Conway. They're fractionated by One Oak at their fractionation facility in the Mid-Continent typically. So those are 2 unrelated issues. I would just say Conway is seeing the impact of rejection in the Mid-Continent. Most of its barrels and its NGLs come in from barrels that are produced in the Mid-Continent area.
Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got it. And do you have any take-or-pay type contracts on the Overland pipeline?
Alan S. Armstrong: No, we do not.
Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, great. And then just a follow-up or it could be clarification, but I guess did you change your Marcellus gathering throughput expectations for 2015 compared to the previous quarter data book? And if so, how much of that is driven by I guess the spending reduction in the Laurel Mountain that was mentioned?
Alan S. Armstrong: Sure. Give me just a second to pull-up my notes.
Operator: And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Alan Armstrong for any additional or closing remarks.
Alan S. Armstrong: Let me get the answer -– finish the answer to that question. There's a few things that went on in the data book to data book. To your specific question, the largest volume reduction was probably around Laurel Mountain Midstream. And what we did there is we have basically forecasted, given that's a dry gas system at this point and really in anticipation of Chevron switching their drilling program into the wetter areas over the next few years, pulled out volume out of that area. But we also pulled back some capital as well. So it was a decision to reduce the capital that was associated with some of that volume growth. In ABA, what we did is we used to -- prior reporting, we actually had some volumes that were coming out of the William zone system and then flowing into the Laser system. Even though it was the same Mcf, we were showing those as being 2 volumes. So in the current data book, we've made a change to pull that out. And we're also doing some recontracting on that business. So it was being accounted for because we were getting a fee from Williams and then we were having a fee from Laser. So to make the -- we made that change. So that was probably the 2 largest ones. And then obviously, we did a little bit of a modification in Ohio Valley, which I mentioned earlier. Okay. This is Alan Armstrong. I'll go ahead and close out the call. Thank you very much for your continued interest in the company. We remain very excited about the environment we're in as we see the infrastructure requirements to build out for these very low cost resources here in North America. And we are still very lucky to be so well positioned in the locations we are to be a major player in providing this infrastructure and excited to see the kind of very long-term growth trajectory we have, not just a flash in the pan kind of growth but very long-term growth trajectory that's going to come off of these major investments that we're making here both last year, this year and into '15. So again, thank you for joining us, and we look forward to seeing you on May 21.
Operator: And that concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams and Williams Partners Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John Porter: Thank you, Glynne. Good morning, and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our websites, williams.com and williamslp.com. These items include yesterday's press releases with related schedules and the accompanying Analyst Packages; a presentation discussing these results, guidance updates and growth opportunities with related audio commentary from our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and an update to our data books, which contain detailed information regarding various aspects of our business. This morning, Alan will make a few comments, and then we will open the discussion up for Q&A. Rory Miller is here from our Midstream business; Frank Ferazzi is here from our Gas Pipeline business; and our CFO, Don Chappel, is also available to respond to any questions. In yesterday's presentation and also in our data books, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that's been reconciled back to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan S. Armstrong: Great. Thank you, John, and thanks to all of you on the phone and webcast, who have joined us this morning. I'm certainly looking forward to your questions. Before we open up the phone lines, I want to take the opportunity to briefly touch on a few key themes for the Williams and Williams Partners investment story. In short, we are rewarding investors now with strong dividend and cash distribution growth through the guidance period and we are expanding our business to create continuing value growth in a very resilient future dividend and distribution growth. First, let's take a look at our fourth quarter performance. We turned in solid results in line with our third quarter guidance, despite a natural gas liquids margin environment that dropped even faster than we expected. To give some scale to that drop and to the headwinds we were facing, it's important to understand that our fourth quarter NGL margins were down 46% from the prior year, margins took another 8% hit from what we thought were low third quarter levels; and from a financial perspective, our fourth quarter NGL margins were off about $75 million compared just to the midpoint of the forecast that we shared at the third quarter results. Much of this didn't show up in the unit margin because we didn't produce ethane when it was in the negative margin territory. So what you saw there is a little bit higher unit margin than you might have expected but lower volumes as a result of that ethane rejection. We provide some detail in our slides regarding the positions that allowed us to overcome these very low NGL margins but here are some of the highlights there. First, we're successfully growing our fee-based revenues in this business for Williams Partners. In the Midstream segment, we generated fourth quarter fee-based revenues 18% higher than a year ago. For both the Midstream and gas pipeline business, we generated fee-based revenues that were up 5% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. And second, we continue to benefit from the natural hedge against ethane exposure that our Olefins business creates. Williams Partners benefited in the last 2 months of 2012 with the acquisition of the Olefins business and there is even greater benefit for WPZ ahead with the well-timed expansion of the Geismar facility expected in service later this year. This combination supports our ability to reward investors with strong growth in cash dividends and cash distributions. We are reaffirming our guidance at midpoint to grow Williams' cash dividend by some 20% with this year and -- for both this year and next year. And for Williams Partners, we are reaffirming our guidance at midpoint to increase the cash distributions we pay unitholders by approximately 9% in both '13 and '14. When we add our large platform of growth capital projects and the rapid growth in cash distributions we're expecting from a recent investment in Access Midstream, what you'll have is a value-creation engine that is powerful, durable and resilient and will continue to grow for many years to come. In our earnings announcements yesterday afternoon, you also saw that we are lowering our 2013 and '14 earnings and cash flow guidance. We expect the growth in our fee-based business will partially offset the effect of sharply lower ethane and propane prices and ethylene prices in '14. And we will see Williams Partners benefiting from the late 2012 acquisition of Williams' Olefins business and a significant expansion of our Geismar facility in the fourth quarter. And I also would remind you that we have quite a bit of collared contracts that are expiring here in the first quarter of '13 and of course, those allow us to get even better exposed to the weak ethane price and continue our short position at Geismar there on ethane. Our coverage at WPZ is certainly being impacted by the heavy load of investing about $12 billion in growth capital during the 3-year period from '12 through '14. But we're deploying that capital towards a vast array of great growth projects across our operating areas from the Marcellus and Utica Shales in Canada to the Eastern Seaboard and the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. These are projects that we know and understand, many are well into the construction phase and the essential ingredient in these value-creating projects is largely within our reach, it's our execution. If I can direct you, for future reference, to Slide 13 in the quarterly presentation materials that are posted on our websites, you'll see here exactly where we are spending that $12 billion and when exactly it begins to contribute to our cash flows. I think you'll agree that these projects are very strategic, they are large scale and they move us even more significantly toward a business mix dominated by a revenue stream that can support strong continued growth in dividends and distributions, and these growth investments largely start contributing in meaningful value in 2015 and beyond. So there is much good yet to come with these major strategic investments that we continue to invest heavily into. This natural gas infrastructure super cycle is creating tremendous opportunities for North America, our industry and importantly, for Williams and Williams Partners. We are aggressively pursuing and executing on these opportunities to deliver shareholder value for years to come and we remain committed to the idea that there is a lot of value associated with this large-scale infrastructure. Now let's open the phone lines and I'll let others on our executive leadership team help answer your questions this morning.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Christine Cho with Barclays.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: How are you guys planning to fund the coverage shortfall at WPZ in '13? Is it going to be with debt or are you going to do IDR waivers? And can you just remind me what has been disclosed to date for IDR waivers, is it $105 million in '13 and $16 million in '14?
Donald R. Chappel: Christine, this is Don Chappel. In terms of the exact funding plan, we've not disclosed that but we do have a lot of flexibility around that. It will be a combination of debt and equity. Certainly, Williams is well positioned to support WPZ in many ways. But we have no additional IDR waivers contemplated at this time. The IDR waivers that are currently have been granted are very modest and I think you mentioned those numbers and they just go out for 2 years.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. Can you just talk about what your plans are for the extra cash at WMB otherwise? Especially with the...
Donald R. Chappel: We have a number of investment opportunities in the NGL pipeline, Petchem pipeline space, where Alan has laid out our strategy earlier about building that business and Alan can speak to that again. So that's an opportunity. And the balance, we have some flexibility. And so we'll look at the facts and circumstances to determine what the best use of that excess cash is.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. Can you give a little more detail about how the investment in ACMP brought your cash taxes to 0 in '13 and 10% in '14?
Donald R. Chappel: Sure. Our investment -- again, there is an allocation for tax purposes. The inside basis at ACMP did not change. Our investment was allocated between hard assets and intangibles. In terms of the hard assets, they enjoy accelerated depreciation. And the intangibles enjoy straight line depreciation. But it's really the depreciation of that investment that's creating a very large tax deduction for us, which, over the next few years, will significantly lower our tax rate. In addition, the January '13 fiscal cliff legislation included an extension of bonus depreciation. And given the large amount of capital that we continue to invest, that's pretty significant as well.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then, I noticed that your Geismar expansion, the start date was pushed back by a quarter. Can you talk about what's going on there?
Alan S. Armstrong: I'll address that now and I'll ask, maybe Rory, to hit a little harder on that. We really didn't push it back as much as -- that's not really the cause of the drop in volumes there. But we are giving ourselves some room for the tie-ins and some expanded tie-in work on there. So I would just say, we're being fairly conservative and knowing that when you go to start up a facility like that, often, there is bobbles and interruptions as you try to do that, and we're planning for that rather than explaining that later. So that's really the purpose for that, but really, the startup is still scheduled right into the October time frame.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then, you talked about how you started to recently see ethane rejection during the fourth quarter. How much did you reject in 4Q? And then, also, you've talked about how you're assuming that all your equity volumes are going to be rejected in the first quarter of '13, what does your guidance assume for the rest of the year?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes, let me take a look at that on fourth quarter. I know in the first quarter of '13, we've got rejection planned for the entire period. But if you can hang on just a second here. The fourth quarter, yes, looks like we had about 2 to 3 weeks in December of ethane rejection.
Donald R. Chappel: This is Don Chappel, just related to that, I'd just refer you to Slide #8 in our deck that illustrates the declining ethane margin with lower frac spreads but the widening crack margin at Geismar. And I'd note there that at our assumed about $0.06 of margin there, that equates to about -- I think, it's $27 million of remaining ethane margins. So we have very little ethane exposure left. And in fact, as ethane prices go lower, that $27 million does not include the benefit of Geismar's margins expanding. So if you look at the sensitivities in our data book, you can get some sense of the combined effect. But again, there is only $27 million of total ethane margin assumed in 2013. In our data book, we have the same slide for 2014, and you'll see with the Geismar expansion, while the ethane margin is assumed to be a bit wider, the Geismar expansion completely mitigates that. And I think I've mentioned to some investors before, if ethane prices go to the point that we are in full rejection and go even lower, then, we've taken all the pain on the ethane margin and then, Geismar starts to see even greater gains as its costs go down.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Right. And then, the last question for me. This is more of an accounting question. But how are you calculating the adjusted segment profit for Access Midstream Partners? Is that just net income that you expect at ACMP and multiply it by your ownership? It just seems a little light. I'm just trying to figure out, do the Class C units participate in earnings but not the Class B, is that how that works?
Donald R. Chappel: Our proportionate share of their equity earnings and then, again, our purchase price was allocated, in part, to intangibles. Some of the intangibles are contracts and we have depreciation or amortization of that. That totaled about $65 million in both '13 and '14. So [indiscernible] earnings are reduced by that amortization expense and you can see from a cash flow standpoint if you add that back, you get to a segment profit plus DD&A or an EBITDA number. Our pro rata share, it's $65 million higher than the earnings. So I think we are on, in terms of our share from more of a cash flow perspective, segment profit plus DD&A, so that's not actually the distribution, but is $103 million in '13, $160 million in '14.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Holly Stewart with Howard Weil.
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Just a couple of quick questions. First, maybe, start with the macro. Can you just give us a little color on what you're seeing right now in the ethane and propane markets? And anything maybe nearer term that could drive pricing? You probably know better than most that most of the E&Ps right now are forecasting ethane rejection for most of 2013.
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes, I think the market on the ethane side continues to struggle to balance itself with a lot of new projects coming on, continuing to come on, major NGL pipelines, major fractionators continuing to come on that will continue to provide plenty of supply into a market that is going to be slow to grow. I think, obviously, with our expansion and other expansions, we'll see a little bit of growth this year. But in -- it's probably a couple years out before we really see the market try to catch up with all that supply on the ethane side. So we really don't see a lot of upside. For us, the best thing that can happen for us is probably volatility here in '13. And then, a weak -- a very weak ethane price in '14. And if that happens, then, we'll have some upside to what we have forecasted here for '13 and '14. On the propane side, I would say the fundamentals are a little more positive there. Certainly, a lot of cracking going on right now. Propane is at a price that is encouraging. A lot of cracking of propane and our crackers running rich and probably any other light-end crackers running rich and running propane in it right now as much as they can because propylene prices are so high that, that's making that a favored feedstock. So that, combined with hopefully some larger export facilities coming on later this year, I think that will start to balance the fundamentals a little better on propane. So I would say a little bit of upside to propane, but still that market has a lot of supply still available in it. I would say this, that there is a lot of propane that is on the market that can be trucked and railed and so forth, that is already in the market supply versus ethane that is being rejected and not on the supply scene. Said another way, when a lot of these big NGL pipelines come online, they're going to have the capacity for ethane but a lot of that propane is already getting captured in local fractionators and being trucked and railed. So it won't be as large of an incremental supply into the market when that infrastructure comes online.
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then, maybe just sticking with propane. What's the latest on the PDH project?
Alan S. Armstrong: We're very excited about that project. A lot of things coming together quickly on it. And we've been -- we've contracted with an engineering firm to do a feed study on it. And I would say, we look forward to accelerating the decision on that project with continued strong fundamentals for low propane prices in Canada, with very little outlet for the propane out of Canada and as well, a lot of interest in the propylene supplies that we already have. As you recall, from our Redwater fractionator and splitter, we already have a pretty large propylene supply there, this would add to that and starts to get to a level that it could attract derivative investment downstream, which would really be a homerun for us because it would take that rail -- some of that rail cost out that we're investing in today into the Gulf Coast.
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: So maybe a decision by year-end?
Alan S. Armstrong: Oh, I would say, it would be quite a bit sooner than that.
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Okay, great. And then, I appreciate the additional Marcellus-related detail on your systems and expansion plans. I guess, bigger picture, what are the production bottlenecks today?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes. I would say that for the most part, it is around liquids, particularly, for instance, in the wet Marcellus and in the West Virginia area. That production has a lot more condensate and is a lot richer than really anybody, I think, expected -- certainly, we expected it, anyway, speaking for ourselves and I think for the producers as well. And so a lot of the facilities there really haven't been designed to be able to handle all those liquids. So there's a lot of redo work going on up there and there is a lot of production that is sitting, waiting behind infrastructure, on both our facilities and other people's facilities as well. And so we're working hard to overcome that. But I can tell you that we have a lot of frustrated producers sitting behind our production. And obviously, we're anxious to get things remedied and bring it online as well. But there is a significant amount of production that is curtailed, either by a lack of connection or in some cases, just unreliable operations where the pipelines continue to fill up with liquids and shut in the gas production.
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: And is there more volume on a particular system of yours that's backed up?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes. The Ohio Valley Midstream is really the one that's curtailed, the other systems are running fairly well. We have had a few struggles in getting the Laser pipeline up and running. And so we've had a little bit of curtailed volume in the Northeast. But as you can see, it's not curtailing it a lot because you can see how fast the volumes have come up, 80% year-on-year there. So hard to say it's heavily curtailed, but there is some curtailment there on the north end of the Laser system.
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then, one last one, I promise. Just a cleanup. What was your 4Q ethylene cracker spread? And then, the full year as well, that you realized?
Alan S. Armstrong: Randy, you want to take that?
Randall L. Barnard: Just a moment, I'll look that up so we can come back with a...
Alan S. Armstrong: Holly, was the question, what our ethylene crack spread was at Geismar?
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Yes, for 4Q and then full year, if you have got it. And that's it for me, so you can pass it on.
Randall L. Barnard: Full year was $0.40. I don't know what -- just the quarter was, but I think the full year spread was $0.40.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Faisel Khan with Citi.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I understand all the issues surrounding lower commodity prices and I appreciate the comments last night in your podcast on the constraints you're having in the Marcellus. I was wondering if you could quantify some of those constraints. It seems like if I -- if we look at your presentations in the past versus the presentation you put out last night, that your volume assumptions for 2013 out of the Marcellus and Utica, are lower than what you guys had anticipated previously when you looked at these assets last year. Can you quantify for us exactly what's going on? And then, I have a follow-up question to that.
Alan S. Armstrong: Sure. I'll ask Frank Billings to take that question.
Francis E. Billings: Yes, this is Frank Billings. I'd say, if we were going to quantify today the volume, kind of, curtailment issues that we're having in the Ohio Valley, I could put that at about 100 million to 150 million a day of volume that we have, that the producers could be producing into our gathering systems. For the forecast period, we're moving our volumes back to address kind of both the operating issues that were experienced in OVM and then, certain producers drilling investment to better align their drilling dollars with getting the best net backs for commodities produced. So I think that's the things driving our volume forecast today in that part of the Northeast.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: If I'm looking at your own '13 and '14 guidance for volumes, you'd say that those numbers have been curtailed by about 150 a day?
Francis E. Billings: Well, I think that's what's hitting us today. Our expectation is that we would be getting those volumes back online. But we have some operational things we need to solve and some asset modifications that we have to make at some of the central receipt points in the field so that we can get that volume flowing. But that volume's available to us today, we just have to get some of our assets better situated to handle the condensate volumes and get the -- so that we can get the production flowing consistently.
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes. I would say in general there, we are very encouraged with the resource and the value it can deliver to the producers. But there are a lot of infrastructure constraints, including both the upstream side and as well, the downstream market side. So us continuing to develop infrastructure for the NGL market outlets and the condensate outlets, is critical to the success of the producers. And so I think, even though there's already this amount of production sitting and waiting, I don't think they'll continue to drill so robustly if we don't start to provide the market outlets up there in an unconstrained way, and we're certainly working very rapidly on that. So a lot of great opportunity. The good news is, it's a great resource. And I would just say, it's even better than most people thought and therefore, it is requiring some -- pretty rapid expansions on the market outlets and the upstream infrastructure.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And Alan, do you worry about basis kind of narrowing in the Marcellus and Columbia pool area? It seems like we've basically gotten close to parity to Hub and in some situations, it looks like we actually moved into a negative basis in that region? Do you worry about that and that kind of crimping production volume growth?
Alan S. Armstrong: Well, I think what you'll see -- I think it will be hard to see what the actual basis differential. But the answer to your question is yes, we've got to continue to open up market outlets for both the gas and the liquids. But I would tell you right now probably, the liquids is the bigger driver on that. But I think what you really are going to see are kind of inter-regional spikes. And so it's not just what you could see as a East Dominion price or a Columbia price. It's really going to boil down to inter-regional prices and what pipes people are actually getting paid. Now if they have firm transport out of the area and they get into Zone 6 on Transco, that's a beautiful thing right now for somebody, but obviously, that capacity is limited. And so I would just say, I think it's very, very spotty up there. And I don't think those basis differentials really tell us the whole story for what producers are getting for their gas right now.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then, on the Western volumes. Is anything changed in your guidance or expectations in the West for this year versus what you had expected previously?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes, pretty limited change on that, I believe, and continued -- I would say the one thing that I'm aware of that's changed is -- and certainly embedded in our guidance at this point though -- is we did have a lot of production froze off in the first quarter, not from our facilities, for the most part, but certainly producer freeze off in the San Juan Basin and some in the Wamsutter area and so we certainly saw some impact here in the first quarter on fee-based volumes there.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then, last question for me. On the quarterly comments that you have in your press release, you talked about earnings being impacted by increased cost and lower NGL margins. Can you just give us an idea of what you're talking about, what you mean by increased costs?
Alan S. Armstrong: Well, certainly, getting all these businesses started up is a heavy load, developing a lot of these projects is a heavy load. So for instance, you'll see a little spike in cost in Canada, for instance, and a lot of that of course, is in developing a project like a PDH project. And so we've got a lot of upfront development expenses. You'll notice that we're pretty conservative how we book that. You'll notice in the fourth quarter, in the gas pipeline segment, we took a $19 million reduction in expense that basically was expenses that we had on capital projects earlier that we don't capitalize until we know that project's going to come through. And so in other words, we expensed those and hold them in an account until we're sure the project's approved and permitted. And so that's where some of that kind of expense is from. So when we've got a big, heavy capital budget like we have right now, a lot of the expenses in developing those projects weigh heavy against our expense line until those projects are capitalized.
Gary Stromberg - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And would you say that those higher expenses are running through your numbers right now are higher than what you guys had previously envisioned in your last guidance?
Alan S. Armstrong: I don't think there's too much more than what was in the last guidance, maybe, on the PDH project. But again, if we approve that this year, then that expense gets capitalized moving forward, so...
Donald R. Chappel: Just to be clear, the phenomenon that Alan mentioned in the fourth quarter is unique to our regulated gas pipeline business where, in that business, you expense it until you have a probable asset. And then, once it becomes probable, you can actually capitalize previously expensed projects. In the nonregulated business, you expense it and then, when you have a probable project, you expense going forward. But you can't go back and, call it, reclaim what you previously expensed.
Operator: We'll go next to Bradley Olsen with Tudor, Pickering.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Quick question on -- and I realize that it's a similar question to one that's been asked already. But when you talk about the volume impacts, the limited volume impacts between the guidance provided on the third quarter call and the guidance provided for the fourth quarter. Can you quantify, in terms of either segment profit or EBITDA, the expected impact from volumetric declines, either in the Western or the Eastern portions of the Midstream business on segment profit or EBITDA in '13 and '14?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes. I think in the -- I think the 150 or so that Frank talked about along with some other small things, I think it's about $85 million, maybe $80 million to $120 million in total there is about what's in there.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And one of the, I guess, notes in the presentation when you announced the Access transaction and mentioned again in your fourth quarter materials is the potential NGL pipeline project out of the Marcellus. And I guess, I'd be interested in your thoughts about how a heavy NGL pipeline out of the Northeast might potentially impact demand for local fractionation? And to the extent that a pipeline might reduce the demand for local, kind of, Northeast-sided fractionation, how a potential pipeline project maybe underwritten by Chesapeake volumes, would impact your plans for the development of the Caiman or the Ohio Valley Midstream assets?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes, that is an excellent question. And I'll tell you, we have a very good vantage point, as you can imagine, given our investment in ACMP and our investment in Blue Racer. We have a very good vantage point up there right now around the degree of fractionation and the degree of liquids that's available from this area. And I would just tell you, I don't think that local fractionation is the answer up here. It is certainly going to overwhelm these markets and something large-scale is going to need to be built. And even, frankly, as it supports an ethylene cracker that Shell has announced and others have talked about, that also -- having a big Raw Make line provides a lot of flexibility in terms of ethane access back and forth between those markets. And so we think that something definitely needs to be done there, and we're working very hard on that. You heard Don mention earlier when asked about what we were going to do with all the extra cash at WMB, and based on both continued cash distributions as well as -- I think, when you do the math on it, you'll see there's quite a bit of extra cash distribution there, particularly in '13 and '14 given the tax rate and the performance in Canada. And so that is a very interesting place for us right now and I'll tell you, we have teams working that very hard and it's not as simple as just building a Raw Make pipeline into the Gulf Coast. There's a tremendous amount of issues about where you land that product and having the distribution network to distribute that product into the market and into big market outlets as we go forward. And so I think, if it was just as simple as just a Raw Make pipeline, we'd probably be past that at this point. But there's quite a bit of work we're doing on the distribution and storage end.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Got it. And given your comments that fractionation will likely overwhelm local demand in the Northeast, does that make your Ohio Valley development more biased to focusing on just de-ethanization opportunities or maybe less focused on the fractionation and more focused on the gathering and processing side of things?
Francis E. Billings: This is Frank Billings. I'd say, it's a very good question. I think what we see relative to your fractionation investment is that Williams will still have the opportunity to make those fractionation investments. I think what we're really evaluating is the market location for those fractionation investments. The producers that we have behind our OVM assets are going to be looking for a portfolio of markets to get into. And I think we are well-positioned to provide local market opportunities for those producers that want to have access to those markets but then, I think we're also going to be able to provide Gulf Coast markets and Gulf Coast access. So we're trying to position the producers such that they can maximize the value of their net back, and we feel like we'll still be able to make those investments, it may just be in different markets. We are looking at -- behind OVM, and we think in this market place in the Northeast, we think there's opportunities to have some customized solutions or customized infrastructure investments that allow Shell and others that are looking at chemical expansions to have the ethane that they need and give them ethane supplies certainty so they can make their investments. And then we're looking at producers in Canada that want to have the condensates. So we're looking at ways to consolidate our commodities such that they can have access to those. And then, obviously, the local market, we'll look at -- to propanize our investments to the extent that the propanization option makes sense. But with access to the Gulf Coast, you're going to see -- you're going to start to see those different commodities being sold into those markets based on the best net back at that time. And I think what we're doing with the NGL infrastructure is providing the best opportunities for our producers. And we think that's advantageous for them long-term, but it also, I think, it allows for us to place some pretty strategic investments in that area, as well as the Gulf Coast.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Great. And just one last question for me. Given the fact that you guys have made moves in, say, Western Canada to take an area that's long propane and create your own solution to that with the PDH facility. When you look at the Northeast, really, Williams is pretty uniquely positioned in the sense that you are probably the only operator, either midstream or upstream up there, who's got the know-how, who's got the access to liquids volumes on the upstream side, as well as the know-how to execute an olefins or petrochemical project. Given the fact that, I'd say, the noises out of Shell, it sounds like they're probably a little bit more slow-moving and conservative than folks who are long ethane producers, who are long ethane in the Northeast would like. Isn't there an opportunity for Williams to get involved on the petrochemical side, and maybe preempt a third-party petrochemical project by building your own or JV-ing with one of those companies?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes. I would just say, first of all, our focus on the petchem side is to continue to provide market outlet for both our product and for our producers' product and not to go headlong into the petrochemical business. And so I think it's always important to remember that, that we see that as a great hedge to our business, and we think it's important -- an important part of a midstream company's role today with all the independent producers that we have, to develop the infrastructure and the market outlets. And so while 20 years ago, you would've seen the majors developing all of that infrastructure and all of that market outlet ahead -- or in concert with developing a big resource, we think it's the role today of the major midstream players to do that. And so it's not out of the question, but I would just tell you that we have looked at it and looked at it, and we think all of the investment required in storage, particularly underground storage -- which as you can imagine, is a challenge in the Northeast -- and all of the derivative market for all the product that's already interconnected in the Gulf Coast, is quite a bit to overcome. And so we certainly aren't the chemical players that Shell Chemical is and certainly, wouldn't doubt their understanding of that market. But from our standpoint, we'd have to get way into a lot of other derivative markets and so forth to overcome that. And so for us, we think the simplest way is to get some of that product into markets that are expanding. And frankly, we look forward to working with Shell to help provide supplies -- as that is another market outlet as well, and we certainly intend to be connected with that if they go forward with that project.
Operator: And we'll go next to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I want to come back to this question on the use of cash at WMB. And if you look at, I guess, Page 83 of the data book, you've got about $2.32 of cash flow you're going to generate even before the Canadian operations, but paying out $1.75. If I just kind of play back what I've heard, it sounds like your preference is to reinvest that excess cash flow into infrastructure rather than paying it out, maybe even, say, a special dividend or whatnot? Maybe you can just walk us through how you're thinking about that excess cash flow?
Donald R. Chappel: Ted, this is Don. Yes, I think we would prefer to reinvest it. We think that it's certainly, in terms of a dividend -- to increase the dividend on the back of accelerated depreciation with knowledge that the rate's going to go up in a couple of years, is really not that sustainable. Obviously, we expect to have much higher cash flows in a couple of years but nonetheless, just with the opportunity set that we see in front of us, I think we've talked a lot about -- Alan just put a voice to the opportunities we see around the NGL side of the business. We think that, that capital is -- could be strategically invested at very attractive rates of return. And we think that will really provide greater value for investors long-term.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. Next question was just on the WPZ and the cash distribution. I mean, we are forecasting sort of just over 1x in 2014 and you made, I think, a comment in the press release about getting back to normal levels. I mean, how are you seeing where you want normal levels for coverage to be, understanding that we've got sort of weaker propane prices and NGL margins and whatnot, but I'm just trying to figure out where we ought to think about as a normalized coverage ratio target?
Donald R. Chappel: I would comment that we would like to see the coverage at or above 1 over an extended period of time. I'll remind you over 2010, 2011, we were operating at kind of 1.3x, 1.4x coverage. So if you take the 2 very strong years and then, if you take '12 and our current guidance on '13, you still end way above 1. So again, I think there will be ups and downs in coverage. As you'll recall, when we had coverage up in the 1.3x, 1.4x range, a lot of investors and analysts were suggesting that we should raise the distribution and we said it's high because margins are high and we want to be in a position that when margins roll back -- and they will, because they always do and then they'll go back up -- that we're not under too much stress or strain. So we really look at it on a longer-term basis. So I think longer-term, we'd like to be 1 or better. And if we are better than 1, we're pretty happy about that.
Alan S. Armstrong: And I would add to that. It's certainly -- if we saw this as a business that wasn't growing and we had that kind of coverage, that would be one thing. But we certainly see it transitory in nature, and we certainly put a lot of equity into this business and funding a lot of this cash flow that's very -- that's yet to come on in terms of driving our distribution. And so I think we feel very good about where we are and as Don said, we're -- we really look to the long-term. But I think to answer your question, we certainly, if we were in a steady state kind of environment, we would want to be in the 1x to 1.10x range if we were in a steady state environment.
Donald R. Chappel: And certainly, our business mix will be a factor of that. As you know, we are moving more and more to a fee-based portfolio and as well, access is entirely fee-based, and as the cash distributions back to Williams grow off Access, that will further shift us toward fee. And then it's a question of what kind of margins we enjoy. If we're in a low-margin cycle, the coverage will be tighter and if we're in a high-margin cycle, it'll be more robust. But I think the business mix and you have to think about Access as a contributor to that as well.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Great. And then, last one, just small one for me. You talked about the attractive economics of running propane versus ethane. Just how much can you run through Geismar, sort of, an ethane-propane mix, if we think about that?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes. We can run about 30% on a inlet volume basis in propane.
Operator: We'll go next to Carl Kirst with BMO Capital Markets.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: At this point, I just have a few clarifying questions, if I could. And maybe the first is just on Ohio Valley and the 150 million a day that was referenced of delay. I didn't catch -- is that something that we'll sort of see kind of a consistent delay through 2013 and 2014? Or by 2014, for instance, should the challenges of getting the right equipment in place be surpassed where we don't have any of those curtailments in that $80 million to $120 million of EBITDA, Alan, I believe you referenced, won't be dragging anymore. Can I just get a little bit of clarification on that?
Francis E. Billings: Sure, this is Frank again. That 100 -- that volume that I referenced, that's volume that we know is available to us today. It's actually produced volume that's just behind our system and we feel we're going to get the majority of those operational issues resolved in the second quarter. So we're hoping that we have that volume flowing freely to our Fort Beeler facility and through our fractionation assets in 2013. So really, it's really on us to make certain that we get through the operating and asset issues that we've been dealing with over the last few months and we get the assets stabilized and when we do that, we'll have a nice base business for 2013 and we will be able to grow forward from there, per the guidance.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Great. So we actually have the -- or in the guidance, the volume is actually coming back, call it, by midyear then?
Francis E. Billings: Midyear to the end of the year. And I think the challenge is, all the time we're doing that, of course, there's new volumes being drilled. And so we constantly will be in a catch-up mode for some time. I think it's important to note, though, if you look at Laurel Mountain, we've been at that for a while now and we are now ahead of Chevron, finally, out there in terms of capacity. We're getting close to being there while, I would say, we're going to be on a treadmill for a long time in the Northeast with Cabot and some of the other produces there. I would say, we're pretty well at pace with those producers right now and we just -- things have moved faster in OVM particularly, again, from a liquids production standpoint, both in terms of richer gas and higher degrees of condensates. So I think we're very confident in our ability to catch up, but I would just say, given the productivity of those reserves, we're going to be on a treadmill there for a long, long time to come. And likely, we'll be having some lagging excess capacity or excess production held behind our infrastructure for quite a while.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: And Alan, if I could, just as a follow-up on that -- I guess, the producer frustration, is all of this, in effect, call it, industry rich gas related? Has there been any execution-type of issues where Williams has stubbed its toe? I just want to make sure there's no risk of brand franchise bruising for instance?
Alan S. Armstrong: I'll let Frank take that, but I'll just tell you, we're not the only one struggling up there. I think about anybody, if they're honest with you, would tell you that what's going on up there is a lot of this. And as well, the producers are having their own issues, upstream of our facilities as well. And Frank, I don't know if you want to add some color to that?
Francis E. Billings: Sure. I would say, the issues that we've had have been mostly around our field receipt points and obviously, those are vital to getting the production into our gathering systems and ultimately, into our processing assets. We've not completed those installations as timely as we would've liked and then, we have experienced inconsistent operations and reliability as production has come back up to those facilities. Again for 2013, I think our key operating issue for us is going to be to optimize and stabilize the current assets that we have in place and have the facilities better matched to the gas quality of the production. No one really knows with certainty the composition until it's actually produced and I think we've experienced some mismatched facilities to the production and the -- and what we're seeing out there. So the reserves are there, obviously, I think the producers would be producing more. But we have to reliably handle the production and move the production for these producers.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Understood. And maybe just last question, Don, just a clarification on the cash tax guidance, and understanding what's happened has been a benefit both of ACMP, as well as legislation on bonus depreciation. Is it possible to attribute that in any way, 90% to ACMP, 10% to the legislation? I mean, if we were trying to basically ascribe a benefit, if you will, even prior to legislation from the purchase price, for instance, of ACMP -- this is real value you guys are getting. Is there any way to do that?
Donald R. Chappel: I'd say both are significant. I couldn't give you the number -- the exact number off hand, but if you're interested in trying to learn more about that I encourage you to call John and Sharna and they can try to help you estimate the number. But they're both pretty significant.
Operator: And we'll go next to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: I had a couple of questions. If we could kind of dig a little deeper into the Petchem Services at the MB level, it's got the distinction of being kind of a growth opportunity that if you had 7x investments EBITDA, maybe having $100 million of EBITDA in a couple of years and can be dropped down because it's in the States. Can you discuss kind of the long-term vision of that, and at what point in parts or in whole, a drop-down might make sense?
Alan S. Armstrong: Certainly, that would make a lot of sense, I don't think there would be really any prohibition to the majority of the investments that we're making there from being qualified income. And certainly, we feel like WPZ is pretty full on capital opportunity right now. And so WPZ is well-positioned to do a lot of that development. And certainly, it centers around the kind of things we've talked about in the past, tremendous amount of liquids coming into the area and a lot of changes going on in the petchem space there where parties are trying to crack lighter products. And that changes a lot of things, it changed butane movements, changes propylene movements. A lot of things that change as a result of the feedstock coming into those plants changing. And we have been thinking for some time, there'll be quite a shift in logistics requirements for the business and that you can't build all this new cracking capacity in the Gulf Coast and not have a lot of new logistics issues. And so we've been working to get ahead of that, both in terms of getting our supplies and our producers' supplies access to better markets, but as well, helping serve the petchem market in an open access manner, which heretofore has been pretty much not the way business has been done in the Gulf Coast in terms of having open access pipelines for all these products in between the facilities. And so we think there has been a huge opportunity left to us there to be that open access provider for services. And so we continue to see a lot of opportunities. We've picked up pipelines from BP that were underutilized, we picked up pipelines from Exxon that were underutilized and we picked up a pipeline from Explorer that were underutilized and we have quite a bit of similar activity going on to continue to have distribution networks that move with an expanding market there.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Alan, do I understand what you're saying, is that there's not just obvious opportunities for the organic CapEx that you already laid out on the acquired pipes, but that there's incremental M&A opportunities in that segment?
Alan S. Armstrong: I would say it's pretty -- they're pretty modest relative to what we normally -- what you'd normally hear from us in terms of M&A. And so those acquisitions that we've made over the last couple of years, in total are, I think, $400 million or somewhere in that ballpark. And so I would say -- those combined. And so, I would say, it's those kind of pickups that we'll continue to assemble smaller investments like that and piece them together into a smart network.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Understood. A couple of other quick follow-ups. I noticed the CapEx cost on the Canadian offgas ethane project were up from 3Q guidance. Is this just incremental accretive CapEx on an expanding offtake or is it simply inflation?
Randy M. Newcomer: This is Randy Newcomer. The Canadian ethane project -- recovery project at Redwater is currently in construction and slated to be completed in May of this year. And so what that represents is additional or better cost estimation basically for completion of the project. So it's inflation in the cost of the project.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. And last question for me. I noticed that the ethylene price deck had some changes. We went up a little in '13, which is benefiting Geismar margins there. But then, we kind of flatlined into '14 versus what was previously assumed to be a steep contango into the following year. Can you discuss kind of what's driving the long term expectations there?
Alan S. Armstrong: Sure. We continue to really follow CMAI's forecast there and so you'll say that's right in line with CMAI's forecast. And that earlier, I think, $0.62 that we had in there was also right in line with CMAI. So a lot of moving parts in that space, and we think those guys did a pretty good job of providing that guidance. And so we take a look and certainly, are influenced heavily by their perspective, and that's actually what drove that.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: I got you. So this can easily jump around quarter to quarter in terms of long term guidance. It's not something you're trying to kind of neutralize by flatlining it?
Alan S. Armstrong: That's correct. And I would say, certainly this year, right now that forecast is conservative relative to what we're seeing on the ethylene and certainly, conservative -- our forecast is conservative compared to what we're seeing right now on propylene. But certainly, it'll be some volumes continuing, new ethylene production coming on as some of these new facilities get back online. So I don't think it's going to be really big, frankly, in '13 and maybe, not even in '14, but beyond that we'll probably see ethylene production pick up.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Looking at, I guess, your guidance for the Geismar volumes? Is the difference really just related to the timing of the expansion?
Randy M. Newcomer: This is Randy Newcomer. You're referring to the volume estimate of 125 million?
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Yes.
Randy M. Newcomer: Basically, it's several different factors, but the primary factors are related to the timing of the -- timing of the turnaround where we were running longer, moving the turnaround from the spring to the fall between turnaround cycles. And at the end of -- at the tail-end of the turnaround, you end up having a little bit of natural degradation in your production capacity over the course of the run. So that's impacting it a little bit. The second thing is, as we're planning this turnaround, obviously, it's a combination of both maintenance activities and tie-ins related to the expansion. And so as you might expect, there's a lot of complexity to that and the need for a lot of good planning effort. We're not quite finished with the final plan for the activity during that time frame, but we've injected a little bit of additional -- as Alan spoke to before -- a little bit more conservatism into the volume forecast, understanding that there will probably be a few bobbles as we come up from the expansion -- we're going to come up after the turnaround in full expansion mode. Whereas before, we were going to come up at the current rate and then bring expansion on later in the year. With moving the timing of the turnaround to the fall, we will be coming up off the turnaround in full expansion mode. So a combination of factors there. Additionally, when you crack heavy with propane versus ethylene, you make a little bit less ethylene and more propylene, and so we really have to look at total olefins production rather than just ethylene and 125 million pounds per year is related just to ethylene. If you'd net it with the other olefins that you produce, that certainly are valuable as well, like propylene, it's about 100 million pounds a year.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And do you anticipate, I guess, cracking propane at that 30% max or close to it this year?
Randy M. Newcomer: It just depends on the relative price at any given point in time. We tune that up each month.
Alan S. Armstrong: So basically, if you took our assumptions on the ethane to ethylene spread, anytime we are cracking propane to propylene, it's an upgrade to those economics. That's the only reason we would be doing that, is that if we see better economics. And obviously, right now we're seeing better economics cracking the propane. And so that's always kind of an upside to the basic ethane to ethylene spread.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, okay. And then, maybe if you could talk about Williams' competitive position in bidding for the new pipeline project in Florida?
Frank J. Ferazzi: This is Frank Ferazzi. We, like much of the rest of the market, have received the documents for FP&L's RFP and so -- it's complicated set -- it's a complicated RFP, it's 200 pages or more. And so we're in the process of evaluating both the commercial aspects of the RFP, as well as our financial planning people looking at the route and coming up with an estimate of capital. And so we have a lot of work to do between now and early April when responses to the RFP are due, and have not yet decided whether we're going to bid or not. I would say that I think Gulfstream is in a good position, currently, in the marketplace -- strong assets, strong relationships with the market. And so I think that will give us an advantage in the end.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And I guess, if you do decide to bid, would this be a project you're pursuing with Spectra, like a JV, 50-50 JV?
Randall L. Barnard: It would be a project that -- a bid that would come from Gulfstream, which of course, is owned by Williams and Spectra jointly.
Operator: We'll take our next question from TJ Schultz with RBC Capital Markets.
TJ Schultz - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Just following up on the NGL projects in the Marcellus and Utica, I guess, as the liquid takeaway options evolve and options for ethane take-away come along, what is the status or interest level of your proposed Confluence rich gas project there?
Alan S. Armstrong: Well, I would say Confluence has merged into a lot of different things, but we are in really good shape there. I would say, and have made good progress on contracting with parties in the area. A little different than what we've originally laid out, but in terms of investment opportunity, it'll look very much the same. And so we are excited about that and it's helping -- as well, it's helping to support our confidence in a large Raw Make system being built in the Gulf Coast as well. And so things are coming together there very nicely.
Operator: We'll go next to Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: Back to the question on the use of cash at WMB. The coverage ratio at PZ was 0.95x in '12 and we have talked about where it is for '13 and '14, it's 1x with some nice increases in ethane and propane. I guess, I'm looking for more on -- at what point does MB support PZ given that need to do equity and forego some RDRs [ph] with some of that use of cash given that it's a fairly weak outlook for the next couple of years?
Donald R. Chappel: Becca, this is Don. I'd say, it's a fairly hypothetical question right now. I mean, I appreciate the question but I would say, it would depend on the facts and circumstances that develop. I would say if, again, the plan that we laid out, we execute on the plan, we don't believe there is a need for support. And we'll see how things play out. And if the situation were to be more difficult, that'd be something we'd have to consider. But I think it's hard to be formulaic about it. Again, we look at -- and in terms of coverage, we looked at '10, '11, '12, '13, '14, so if you really look at kind of the 5-year average -- again, the 5 years is well above 1. Yes, we expect 2013 to be below 1 but again, we are also investing a tremendous amount of capital in fee-based growth projects that we expect to come into service in '14 and '15 and really boost the fee based cash flows and boost the coverage at the same time that we're raising distributions. And 2013 is burdened by the carrying costs of those projects, both in terms of equity and debt that have been issued to fund that growth. So it's not just about the commodity price but it's about the tremendous growth that's occurring in the carrying cost of that. So again, we think this is still just a near-term challenge. And again, with the business plan that we've laid out and assuming effective execution, we think we'll be through this in relatively short order.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Selman Akyol with Stifel.
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Just going back to Geismar for a minute or 2. First of all, can you just remind us of the contract structure, or are you just selling all into the spot market?
Randy M. Newcomer: Well -- this is Randy Newcomer. We have a number of contracts and our contract mix, as Alan alluded to earlier, is changing. A lot of our ethane plus kind of contracts and collared ethylene sales have rolled off. And in fact, as of now, we really only have one that is on -- sale on ethane plus basis. The rest of them are all contracts that are priced at market, basically. Some of them are spot, some of them are yearly contracts. But the pricing is based on more spot kind of pricing. And we purposely have done that because we believe in the fundamentals of that, that ethylene is going to continue to be in good demand and we'll have a great ethylene crack going forward. So we've positioned ourselves to be exposed to the full crack for the present and including our expanded volumes as they come on later in the year.
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, given your ability to, I guess, to crack propane into propylene, given margins have been extremely robust for propylene this first quarter, we could expect high margins, then, going into Q1?
Randy M. Newcomer: Yes, we do.
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, if you look out into 2014, it looks like your capacity utilization assumptions are pretty high then going into that as well, and you're seeing that, I guess, reflected by your customers too?
Alan S. Armstrong: Are you talking about on the volumes at Geismar?
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Yes.
Alan S. Armstrong: Well, yes, that's obviously a full year of the expansion coming up and naturally what's driving that. Even in the fourth quarter of this year, because of what we said, we've built in some conservatism. We normally -- you normally see us putting in a, depending on how many -- how much downtime we expect for the year, but normally, you'd see us running around 98% to 99% uptime on a facility like that. And I think we've got somewhere in the 92% range built in just following the startup there in the fourth quarter. Again, just trying to be conservative relative to the kind of bobbles we might experience as we bring that new facility up. So it's a combination of those 2 things that is driving -- but obviously, the big driver is the new expansion that will be online full year in 2014.
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Great. And then, just going back to your guidance. You have about $2 billion forecasted for distributions in 2013. Can you say how many units that's based on?
Alan S. Armstrong: Asking how many units.
Donald R. Chappel: That's a good question. We haven't disclosed the number of units, but it would be -- obviously, the current units outstanding in some plan for -- or some assumption on new units and we're not prepared to provide guidance on that at this point.
Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: All right. And one very small last question for me. The Mid-Atlantic Connector, when do you have that coming online in 2013?
Donald R. Chappel: Hold on just 1 second. Yes, Mid-Atlantic Connector actually went in service last week. So it was originally scheduled to be in service in November, but we had a 2-month delay.
Operator: And there are no other questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back to our speakers for any closing remarks.
Alan S. Armstrong: Okay, great. Well, thank you very much. On behalf of myself, our executive leadership team and our Investor Relations staff, I want to thank you for your time and attention this morning. A lot of moving parts that you all are all right on top of and I appreciate the opportunity to give you better explanation around that. We certainly look forward to sharing a more detailed, deep dive into all of our businesses with all of you at our upcoming Analyst Day that is scheduled for May 21, and we look forward to seeing you then.
Operator: Thank you, everyone. That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams Companies' Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John Porter: Good morning, and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams. As you know, yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website, williams.com. These items include the press release of our results with related schedules and our analyst package; a presentation on our results and growth opportunities with related audio commentary from our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and an update to our quarterly data book, which contains detailed information regarding various aspects of our business. This morning, Alan will make a few brief comments, and then we will open the discussion up for Q&A. Rory Miller is here from our Midstream business; Frank Ferazzi is here from our Gas Pipeline business; and our CFO, Don Chappel, is also available to respond to any of your questions. In yesterday's presentation and also in the quarterly data book, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that have been reconciled back to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan.
Alan S. Armstrong: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. First, let me wish everyone who has been affected by Hurricane Sandy, the best of luck in the recovery. As you know, given the significant disruption that occurred to the normal market activity, we decided to delay our earnings release webcast by a day. We also know this concentrated a number of earnings calls today, so thanks a bunch for joining us this morning for this webcast amongst a very busy morning. Hopefully, you had a chance to listen to my prerecorded comments released yesterday afternoon. But just in case you didn't, I'll quickly hit on some key themes and then we'll move on to our Q&A session. We have several really important items to communicate to you this week, starting with, of course, a review of our third quarter performance. So I'll quickly touch on the key themes from that discussion. For the third quarter, WMB's adjusted income was up about 17% over second quarter, in spite of NGL fracs that for -- sorry, frac spreads that were about 18% lower, on average, than the already-low 2 -- second quarter amounts and the impact of Hurricane Isaac, and I'll talk about that just a little bit. With regard to the NGL frac spread, we saw about a 9% lower average NGL composite price, but an even higher impact from natural gas Street [ph] prices that were up about 26%, on average. So certainly, the frac spread environment that we saw in the third quarter continued to decline from what was a heavy decline from first quarter to second quarter, and so we were not expecting that degree of decline into the third quarter. And again, a lot of that was impacted by gas prices moving up. Turning to fee-based revenues now for third quarter. This measure grew about 5% per -- year-over-year for the third quarter. And importantly, at the Midstream segment for WPZ, this grew at about a 12% rate, so continued great volume growth there in our fee-based revenues. And just to a highlight a few of the areas that affected that, our gathering volumes in the business, so that's as our natural gas gathering volumes in the Midstream business, were up 17% higher from 3Q '11 to 3Q of '12. And in the eastern onshore, which is basically at our Marcellus area and the Perdido Norte, which is in the western Gulf of Mexico, we saw both of those areas gathering volumes, actually double from year-to-year. The main driver of the 12% growth rate for -- overall for our business was the eastern G&P business, as I mentioned. And, of course, one of the drivers there was the acquisition from the Caiman, which we now refer to as the Ohio Valley Midstream in our business, and that was up about $30 million between years. Also, there was a couple of factors that brought that 12% growth rate down and tended to lessen it. The Hurricane Isaac reduced some of our Gulf Coast fee-based revenues, and in third quarter of '11, we actually had a pretty significant contract settlement related to some of our Perdido Norte business. So on a normalized basis, we see these fee-based revenues actually growing even stronger than the 12% for WPZ Midstream. Most of the Hurricane Isaac impacts were caused by interruptions in third-party operations. So while we did have some immediate interruption in our offshore assets, in particular, in terms of getting things back up and running, it really was due to some downstream oil terminals and some downstream NGL pipelines that held us up a little bit longer. So we really did fare pretty well against our assets, but there were some assets that we're integrated with that were a little more challenged. Hurricane Isaac also significantly impacted our results in the Midstream Canadian and olefins business as Geismar had downtime that affected its production volumes, as well as some damage to a furnace, as we tried to restart the plant after the hurricane. So all-in, this affected our segment profit from about $9 million to $13 million, and about $4 million of this was treated as an assessment for adjusted segment profit. So that's a quick look at our third quarter drivers. But again, given the continued lower NGL commodity price environment and the Hurricane Isaac impact, we actually had a pretty good operational period here for the third quarter. So next up, we have some important updates to our guidance for '13 and '14, from both WMB and WPZ. Included in these updates are the effect of the Geismar drop-down, which we've announced we will be closing very soon. But we've also got some other adjustments, including somewhat lower revenue growth rate assumptions for WPZ. And these are really being driven by a prolonged natural gas price assumption and some of the producers' reactions that we're seeing to that as we went through our September planning process, where we take in a lot of the input from a lot of our producers around our systems. And I certainly want to let you know this really is across-the-board, that we're seeing this in areas that where the -- where we may -- where the producer themselves is heavily impacted by the gas prices. So some examples of that would be areas where we hold the keep-hole [ph] rights for natural gas drilling operations. And so the producers are not enjoying any of the uplift from the NGLs, and so, of course, they're responding to lower natural gas prices. Those, of course, would be mostly out west, where that would occur. We also had some response in the Gulf Coast and then, to some degree, in the northeast. But we'll get into a little bit, the northeast. The good news, I would say, in the northeast is that the activities continue there. And for the most part, the activities, particularly in the Ohio Valley Midstream area, really have nothing to do with either prices or with the drilling results from the resources. Actually, those are coming in a little better than we thought. It's really just a delay in terms of the activity and our ability to get infrastructure into place there quickly. So all in all, I would say the environment's pretty good. But I do think with our gas price assumption at $3.25, that's in our assumptions and planning around that, we do expect continued reduction in areas that are totally dependent on just the natural gas price. So I do want to reaffirm our plans for a strong cash dividend growth where we're expecting a 50% -- 55% higher dividend in 2012 at WMB and, as well, the 20% growth in each 2013 and 2014, which would move our dividend to $1.20, $1.44 and $1.75, respectively. Our stated policy of paying out WMB dividends for all of the distributions WMB receives from WPZ, less taxes, corporate interests and corporate CapEx. However, we also want investors to appreciate how committed we are at sustaining the great strength of WPZ for the long run and, of course, that's what the Geismar drop-down is all about, and it clearly shows the evidence of WMB's commitment to keeping WPZ healthy and making sure that the commodity hedge, the natural commodity hedge there is shared with WPZ and not just held with the WMB level. So in that transaction, WMB is receiving nearly 43 million new WPZ LP units related to the Geismar drop-down. Assuming the strong WPZ cash distribution growth rate included in our guidance, WMB will see a significant increase in cash distributions from WPZ. This could result, of course, in an ultimately higher dividend growth rate from what we have forecasted right now for WMB. And certainly, if the forecasted pricing environment that we have out there, particularly around ethylene prices occurs, then we would certainly be in a position to further increase the dividend at WMB. So a lot of questions around that as a lot of people have snapped to the fact that our cash distributions will go up significantly from that. And we've certainly been clear that we intend to maintain the policy. And I think our response to that is we certainly agree with that calculation, but we do have quite a bit of risk embedded in that pricing at WPZ. And so we don't really want to go out any further on that distribution being 2 years ahead of time in terms of the dividend at WMB. I do think we intend to be very sure and really work hard to maintain the distribution growth rate at WPZ, however, and some of the things that we might respond to if we did see a commodity collapse, it would pull us down -- pull that coverage down, of course, would be our ability to impact the GP IDRs that we receive. So we remain very committed to WPZ and the health of WPZ, and we think we've got a great model. And certainly, if the pricing environment occurs, we're going to be in great shape to continue to increase that dividend at WMB even further. Of course, at the same time, WMB will no longer enjoy 100% of the cash flow and earnings it enjoys today. And as a result, you've seen a lowering of WMB's income guidance related to the non-controlling interest that arises in Geismar, once it's dropped into WPZ. So even though the cash flow piece of that looks stronger, the -- particularly with the capital burden being shifted over to WPZ, the earnings piece of that gets diluted by the issuance of -- to the WPZ LP unit holders. Additionally, as I previously mentioned, we have some other updates to our guidance for '13 and '14, including lower revenue growth rates across most of our operating areas that are exposed to natural gas prices, as I mentioned. And although we have some fairly low natural gas price assumptions in place for '13 and '14, you really should not misconstrue that, that we have a lack of confidence in the natural gas market. And in fact, I would tell you, we're fairly bullish about the long-term demand that we continue to see build for natural gas. But we also have been impressed with the capabilities of natural gas producers here in the U.S. to continue to lower their cost of production, and so we're balancing that. We do think it'll take some time for a lot of the big capital that's coming on to build that demand. But long term, I would tell you we're very bullish on seeing this natural gas market continue to expand. Finally, in the prerecorded podcast, we provided additional information about exciting new develops in our Canadian and Petchem Services businesses and updates on all of our end-guidance projects, most of which are fee based that really continue to demonstrate how Williams is perfectly positioned to take advantage of this long-term super cycle as a trusted name in the development, construction and operation of exactly the types of infrastructures needed to realize the full potential for producers and end users of natural gas, NGLs and olefins. So with that, I'll open it up for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Faisel Khan with Citigroup.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I think I understand your -- the lower guidance in '14. I just want to understand a little bit more, if you could, and I have a follow-up question. But on the guidance, it seems like your commodity price assumptions are roughly the same from the last time you issued guidance. And so the decrease in earnings seems like a meaningful decrease in volumes. Can you elaborate a little bit more on what the volume decrease you expect in '14 versus your previous guidance? And I understand it's because of low natural gas prices.
Alan S. Armstrong: Right. And I would just say this, Faisel, that really what we saw -- again, how our planning process works is that we start to pull that together in September, and we take in input from all across our systems, from producers' planned capital for the following year. Of course, it's in their best interests to have us educated on their plans as well because we've got to go build a lot of the infrastructure for those volumes. And so we've been going through that process in September, and I would just tell you that it's really across the board. And I would tell you if we thought gas prices were going to be $4.50 or $5 in '13 and -- and then we probably would have had a different perspective on that. But with our assumption of gas prices being at $3.25 for '13, with that assumption embedded, we'd have a hard time being more bullish than the producers in terms of their capital plans. And so we really basically took the capital plans from producers. Now remember, this was -- a lot of their ideas, of course, were formed over the summer when gas prices were even softer. So if we do see gas prices rebound, we probably would see some more activity and more rigs picked up. But, of course, then we would have to raise our gas -- natural gas price if we believed that. And that would -- of course, would come out of the margin for both the NGLs and the olefins margin. So I think there's a pretty good balance there. But in general, I would tell you that we gather a lot of gas. And there's just a lot of areas that are exposed to the natural gas price, and we're seeing drops in really all of our regions from what we had forecasted earlier in the year, based on producers' forecasts that we would have picked up in the first part of 2012.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And then on the olefins business and the chemicals business. How are you guys thinking about the distributions at WPZ once you drop these assets in? I mean, will some of the distributions be a little bit more of a variable rate? Or were they -- will you have some base level of free cash flows that'll be distributed to unit holders and then the rest will be kind of discretionary sort of use of capital? How are you guys thinking about this cyclical business within WPZ?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes, great question. And I would say that we do feel like we will need to maintain a coverage ratio there. Of course, one of the things that's heavily impacting our coverage ratio at PZ right now is the amount of growth and amount of equity that we've issued here in 2012. And so I would say that in a more normal environment, with not quite so much leverage to growth in that balance sheet, that we would expect to be seeing higher coverage ratios, despite even with these lower NGL prices that we're -- that we saw here in the third quarter. So bottom line is we intend to maintain a coverage ratio there at WPZ and try to let the swings. Good news is, is that there's a lot of cash flow in WPZ, and we would expect to let that coverage absorb a lot of those swings. If that wasn't enough to absorb that, then our next move in a more dire environment would be to waive some of the GP IDR, if necessary, to maintain WPZ's health.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Bradley Olsen with Tudor, Pickering.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Just to follow up on Faisel's question about the volume growth assumptions that go into your guidance. How -- you mentioned kind of broadly lower gas volumes across geographies. Would you say that this volume change is enough to impact your longer-term 5 Bcf a day estimate in terms of gas that you handle in the Marcellus?
Alan S. Armstrong: It certainly could in some areas. I would tell you the areas that are the drier gas are most likely to be the larger part of that impact. On OBM, I would say there might be some delays there. But currently, we're actually increasing that a little bit above, in the near term here, from what we had in our September -- sorry, in our June forecast for that. So it's really those areas that are just dependent on dry gas volumes and OBM, I would say, to the degree, that is lowered a little bit. That's going to be from just delays in getting the infrastructure and the drilling activity occurring there. But we certainly are very excited about what we continue to see in the OBM area, in terms of the producers' economics and their activities and the resource there.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And as far -- in the Midstream side of the business at WPZ, it looked like the OpEx, which had ticked up in the second quarter, was kind of flat sequentially. And I was wondering if there are items in there which are transitory in nature, or whether we're looking at maybe a kind of higher go-forward operating cost in that business.
Rory Lee Miller: This is Rory. I'd say for the near term, across Midstream on operating expenses, we're probably pretty flat with '12. And so in terms of thinking about a run rate -- now that's probably a comment that I'm making for '13. But we're expecting to be fairly flat with '12 for '13, and then after that, there may be some growth.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Great. And just one last question. Could you -- I realize that some of the petrochemical pipelines are making their way down to PZ, in conjunction with the Geismar drop-down. But there -- are there additional assets, as part of this Exxon asset package, that you've acquired, which will remain at WMB for the time being? And maybe if you could just give a breakdown of what percentage of those assets sit at PZ versus MB, that would be great.
Donald R. Chappel: This is Don. I could just mention that the assets that we announced, the petrochemical assets that we acquired from Exxon, will be owned at the Williams level for the time being. We felt that Williams had more financial capacity to hold those assets while they're being developed than PZ did, given the already large array of growth opportunities that PZ was holding. So that was the primary reason we moved that to Williams rather than WPZ. But that remains a drop-down opportunity that PZ will likely enjoy at a future date.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Maybe just thinking about the commodity exposure here at the WMB level and the increased investments in Canada. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the mix of maybe adding more commodity sensitivity with those additional investments, rather than -- and then kind of how you're thinking about what the cash otherwise you could do if there's tax issues with bringing it back, and maybe that's part of the reason why you're -- that you're driving more investments in Canada.
Donald R. Chappel: Just -- this is Don again. I would say that, again, for us to bring back $500 million, our cash tax rate would be about 50%, so about $250 million of that would be paid to the IRS. So that's a pretty -- a lot of value leakage. And the good news is we have some opportunities in Canada that we think are very strong with very high rates of returns. So if we look at that versus the opportunities here in the U.S., we just see -- despite the fact there's some commodity volatility, we just have higher hurdle rate on those projects, such that even in a low-commodity price environment, they're still very attractive investments. And in a more of an expected case, it's very strong. And when you compare that to paying all that cash tax and bringing it back and investing it in an opportunity here in the U.S., that the Canadian investment, despite the fact it's in commodity-sensitive businesses, tends to be something that we're interested in. I think the one area that we're exploring is PDH. And again, we think that propane in Canada is likely to be under tremendous pressure, and the margins on that business will likely be very strong.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful.
Alan S. Armstrong: I would add to that on the -- this is Alan. I would add to that as well that the -- for instance, the CNRL business, the ethane contract that supports that does have a floor for the ethane that's at a cost of service pricing for the ethane. So there is some contractual support for that risk that we're taking in that expansion up there, for both the new ethane capital that we're investing, as well as the CNRL expansion.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Great, got it. That's great. And can you talk a little bit on the price that you came to for Geismar? It's -- you could argue it's something of a low multiple for WPZ to pay. Just kind of how you're thinking was coming to that price.
Alan S. Armstrong: Sure. I think the multiple is always dependent on the amount of pricing risk and where you are, at a peak or a trough, and certainly, that is a build-out of a business. And so today's pricing, of course, if it was a steady, already-existing asset that didn't have a lot of growth in it, would deserve a higher multiple for those more sure cash flows. But I think with the pricing assumption, we -- that is our best guess at the pricing assumption that's out there. But nevertheless, that is a peak relative to the market, and so we don't think it would deserve such a high multiple. So a lot of -- as you can imagine, a lot of interesting debate amongst the conflicts committee to WPZ, and it's -- the folks that support that, as well as internally here. But we think we really hit the right spot, for both WMB and WPZ, in that transaction.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Sure. And then you touched on it a little bit. But maybe talk through a little bit more of your assumptions on the price forecast. I'm particularly interested in natural gas at $3.25. It looks like the forward curve is closer to $4 for '13. And then on ethylene, you've got this big jump in '14 going from $0.50 a pound to $0.63. Kind of what's driving both of those forecasts in your guidance?
Alan S. Armstrong: Sure. On the gas price, I'll hit that first. I think the gas price yesterday is coming off for year about $3.90 or so, up for '13. And, of course, that's been moving around quite a bit. I would just tell you, we certainly hope that. I think for the health of the industry, that's a good thing. But we continue to see supplies grow. And, in fact, our forecast of lower volume rates is not showing up currently in our growth rates. It's continuing to grow. And so we think that a lot of the demand that we picked up over the summer, obviously, was very price-dependent growth, and you can argue whether that price is $3.50 or $3.75 or $3.25. You can argue as to where that price that kicks coal out and brings gas in, but it's certainly not $4 from our vantage point. And so I think -- we think that, that low that we saw in the natural gas price is pretty temporary and is very price driven. So we continue to be impressed with the kind of drilling and growth around our systems as we sit here today. But we think, eventually, that's got to moderate, and obviously, that's the -- our reaction to it. On the ethylene price, I would just tell you that the -- what we saw in the -- what we continue to see is really a response between crude oil and ethane. As you get into '14, we're actually completely -- or almost completely neutral to ethane prices and, in fact, a little bit short ethane. So if our ethane price is wrong, that'll just show up in ethylene price, but we're really just driving that ethylene price off of CMAI forecast and oil prices then. So that's the best intelligence that we have based on the markets that we're seeing out there.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: A couple of questions. First, I apologize I -- there were some competing calls today. But I just want to clarify, the $600 million segment profit plus DD&A for the drop-down is a proportional number?
Donald R. Chappel: Yes.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: That's great. And, Don, can I stay with you for a minute? Speaking of taxes that have been discussed, can you speak to what the tax rate might be on the LP distributions from PZ? Would that be changing at all with the olefins drop-down? And also, would there be any potential, over time, as you invest more CapEx and get more depreciation in Canada for that 50% tax you alluded to, to come down?
Donald R. Chappel: I would say that our cash tax rate moves around a bit depending on when assets were placed in service, minimum tax, a lot of variables there. It moves around a bit. I think from a planning standpoint on this slide, we have it here in our dividend illustration. We've kind of normalized it at about a 25% rate on the distributions from WPZ. Some years would be higher, some are lower. We've normalized it, therefore, to take some of the volatility out of it. I would note that when we issue equity, including in the Geismar transaction, our effective tax rate goes up. Because in effect, to the extent that we issue units to the public, there's an embedded gain there from a tax standpoint. So it's pretty complex subject. But I think the way we've modeled it here, I think is generally representative with some volatility. I think you'll some years it could come in sub-20 and some could approach 30%. As to Canada, we've got a negative basis in our foreign assets. And so the issue there is that to bring cash across the border would trigger a gain, and that's a pretty substantial gain at this time.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Since they've never been taxed with U.S. authorities, when you reinvest money in the new projects in Canada, do you get credit for that when you bring it back?
Donald R. Chappel: No. I mean, it's -- it comes down to tax basis in all of our international assets. And again, we've got some legacy European and Venezuelan tax positions, so it's a big ball that includes a lot of legacy stuff. So it's going to take some time to unwind that. There is a -- we do have an embedded 25% tax rate in Canada. So we are providing taxes and paying Canadian taxes at about a 25% rate on Canadian income. But it's really that cash balance that we have sitting in Canada or the cash that we might generate is still working against a negative tax basis.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. And my last question, Alan, there were some questions around the changes in expected gathering with natural gas volumes. You alluded to trying to be a little conservative, especially as maybe CPG fuel switching eases off a bit and suggested that some of the numbers may change. If you're rolling [ph] to a high side, maybe the volumes will be greater. My question is many producers that have alternatives are saying even at $4 gas, they're not going back and turning on the spigot. Because they make just so much more money on the liquids part of the plays that they have, that there's a limited amount of capital and they just can't see putting it towards dry gas. And you all have mentioned him even the Marcellus, that some of the prolific dry gas areas are easing off, even though there's probably very respectable returns at some of those very good wells today. Can you speak to whether you really think the volumes will necessarily follow price?
Alan S. Armstrong: Well, that's a great question and one that we obviously wrestle with around here on a regular basis, and I honestly think it is very dependent on producers' capability. Certainly, not all these basins are created equal. There's quite a bit differentiation from one -- even in Susquehanna County, I will tell you, there's a pretty big spread in one part of the county versus others. And as well, I would tell you that some producers are better than others at getting their costs down and, as well, there's a major variability in terms of what their other options might be and what they're invested in. And so I would just say it's not as -- the market's not perfectly efficient in that regard. It is, remarkably, to -- from my vantage point, sometimes I always marvel at how efficient it is, particularly this summer, the kind of a pickup we saw with low natural gas price on the demand side. But in the producer side, it's not -- not everybody has the same number of options about where they might take the rigs, and some are more invested in others in getting their cost structure down in an area. And so we certainly saw that with our previous ownership of WPX in the Piceance, where they had a very low-cost structure in the Piceance. And we certainly see that in the Marcellus, with some players having a much lower cost structure and a -- and lower cash cost than others. So I would just tell you, it's pretty variable out there, and I think it's hard to draw it with a broad brush. And so that's not the way we do it. We do it kind of from a building it from a ground-up perspective based on all the different input we get from producers in each of our areas, and so that's really the -- how we come up with that.
Operator: Your next question will come from Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo Securities.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Just wanted to get your thoughts on what's an appropriate coverage ratio for WMB and WPZ longer term? Are you thinking about, I guess, the figures you outlined in 2014, meaning 1.2x for WMB and 1.1x for WPZ?
Donald R. Chappel: Sharon, it's Don. I would say it's a complete function of business mix and commodity prices and the growth rate. Because again, as Alan mentioned earlier, in the near term, we're burdened with an extraordinary growth rate. We're financing a lot of growth, and that means more units out, more interest expense, with little cash flow. But if you look at '14 and you look at the ethylene price, you can bury that ethylene price and you're going to get a of lot different coverage. You can move gas price, and you're going to get much different coverage. So I think it's really a function of what you assume on prices. So the 1.23 is built off the price assumptions we have here, price and margin and all the other assumptions. So if you have lower margin assumptions, you'll get lower coverage. If you have higher, you'll get higher. But again, I think it's going to be variable. Coverage would be variable based on where we are in a commodity cycle and a number of other factors.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then I guess looking at your 2013 guidance for the low end, are you comfortable at this point in terms of continue to deliver growth at WPZ and distributions and have a negative coverage, given the cash flow visibility in 2014? Can you maybe just talk about that?
Donald R. Chappel: I'd say we still have positive coverage in 2013 based on our guidance, though. Yes, we are comfortable. Obviously, there's business risks, including commodities that we'll face and there's upside opportunities. But at this point, we're comfortable with our guidance as being what we're certainly targeting, and we think that it's realistic.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And I guess the last question's just any operational impact of Sandy on your northeast operations at this point in time?
Alan S. Armstrong: Frank, do you want to take that?
Frank J. Ferazzi: Yes, I'll -- this is Frank Ferazzi. I'll take that question. We did lose purchased power in many of our compressor stations in New York and New Jersey and parts of Pennsylvania. But at those stations, we have backup generation capability that's powered by natural gas. So there's no disruption to flows. We do have our LNG facility that's located close to the water. And so we anticipated that we may get some minor flooding, and that did, in fact, happen. So in anticipation of that, we took the facility down on Sunday. We did, in fact, get some water. But once the facility dried down and we pumped a couple of feet of water away, we're not expecting any permanent damage there. No leaks on the system, no other disruptions in flow. And so I think on balance, we fared remarkably well. We're going to have to remove some trees from the right of way, some fences were blown down. But again, no permanent damage to the facilities and no disruption in flow.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: On the gas pipelines, it just looks like the EBITDA's a little bit -- or the EBIT's just coming in a little bit lower than, at least, we were expecting despite some double-digit increases in throughput. Can you talk about what you see going on in that business? And then just given where you are year-to-date, do you still think you're going to meet the low end of your guidance?
Richard Rodekohr: Yes. Becca, this is Rick Rodekohr. In the third quarter, we did see some higher expenses at our gas pipelines. Those were driven principally by the Pipeline Safety Act. As you know, we have to complete testing on our system by the end of 2012. So we're certainly on track to do that. But as we get near the end of that period, we did have some higher integrity and testing costs that we did see in the third quarter. And then, we also saw some higher benefit costs related to our pensions and our post-retiree medical expenses. So those were the primary drivers, I think, of the lower results in the third quarter. We are on track to hit the guidance that we have given for 2012.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: That would -- I mean, that would imply a really big fourth quarter of close to $200 million versus $178 million a year ago. So what's really driving that?
Richard Rodekohr: Well, we have some additional revenues from expansion projects that we put in service earlier in 2012. So we'll get revenues from there. And then we do have some projects that we look at expensing those dollars until they reach a level of probability. And so to the extent that we have some projects that move down the development path, we'd have some opportunities to reverse some expenses there as well.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: Got you. And then on the Caiman Utica JV, any status updates on that?
Alan S. Armstrong: This is Alan. I would just say there's a lot going on there. We're not in a position to announce anything new on there, but very pleased with the opportunities that are coming forward on that. So stay tuned on there.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: And then, on shared services, you guys talked about a new shared services undertaking in your second quarter 10-Q and then had a charge for reorganization in the third quarter. Is there more to come on that? And what kind of benefit do you see to Williams as a result of this?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes, great question, Becca. There has been a lot of efforts around the organization on that. And frankly, we were responding to overhead costs as one item that came at us from the spin-off of WPX and so trying to make sure that our overhead costs are in line with the size of the company and the complexity of the company today. And so we are going through a process of taking out some layers of management across the organization. But as well, I would tell you, very much on the positive side, we are bringing a lot of alignment and a lot of focus around our engineering and construction capabilities, as well as getting the customer voice from all of these various areas right up to the leadership table and getting that as close to our actions as possible. So a lot of very positive things coming out of this where we're really trying to get more of our resources focused on our areas of opportunity. And when I say that, I'm talking about people resources that are really focused on where our frontline opportunities, whether it's growing out our business on the E&C side or being able to be very responsive to customers' needs, as this infrastructure build-out continues to really amaze us; in fact, in terms the amount of demands and opportunities that are in front of us. So we're really trying to position the organization to be more responsive to the kind of build-out that's ahead of us and we continue to enjoy.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: Do you have a financial impact in terms of incremental savings or incremental costs?
Alan S. Armstrong: We have not. We don't have a final number to put forward on that yet, Becca.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then finally, on EBITDA guidance. It looks for the base business, it's coming down, and you talked about the gathering volumes. But we're also seeing CapEx for the base business come up once we net out the numbers for Geismar. So what is that higher CapEx related to on the base business?
Alan S. Armstrong: Is this on WPZ, Becca? I didn't follow that.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: Yes, yes. If you want, I can wait, announce that on the PC call.
Alan S. Armstrong: We'll get back to you on that, sorry. One item there, Becca, that I can think of that's in there is the gumbo [ph] acquisition and the capital that's driving that is a piece of that at Williams. And so...
Donald R. Chappel: Some of it is timing that we've shifted some capital from '12 to '13 and the timing of some other projects have moved around as well. So we'll dig out the detail here and advise you, if not on the call, after the call.
Operator: And we'll take our final question from Carl Kirst of BMO Capital Markets.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Just a quick question on the Petchem pipeline initiative. And I guess my question is, is since you guys have some of a first-mover advantage here, as we look at the return profile of that capital being deployed, should we be looking there in the sort of the return profile of a normal kind of fee-based contracted pipeline asset? Or is there the opportunity to earn perhaps significantly higher returns for that capital?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes. Carl, good question. And I would -- we didn't get it -- given all the other moving parts we've had in this earnings call, we haven't had a chance to focus very much on that. But I think we've forecasted that in the past in terms of our bullishness around the need for infrastructure as the Petchem business grows out from all the new NGLs coming into the market there. And we are more convinced than ever that, that is the case, and there's going to be a lot of infrastructure. We've made 3 acquisitions from pipelines that we are converting the service on here in the last 10 months or so, and have been doing that fairly quietly as we want to make sure we've got the business contracted for that business. But in terms of return expectations, I can tell you that it does vary according to risk. But I would say probably, on average, it's between about 14% and 20% pretax returns on those capital investments.
Operator: And we have no further questions at this time.
Alan S. Armstrong: Okay, great. I will close it up here. Thank you, all, very much for joining us. Very excited about our future. A lot of moving parts happening in this quarter. And I want to reiterate that we are very committed to maintaining the health of WPZ as you -- as I think we've demonstrated with the Geismar drop-down. And frankly, we -- as we've been forecasting for quite some time, we were concerned and had been concerned about the ethane supply getting out and ahead of the cracker capacity. We certainly think our Geismar expansion is very timely and is going to be able to take great advantage of new ethane supplies ahead of -- in the other cracker expansions. And so -- but we think eventually the petchem market is going to respond to the huge amount of NGLs that producers are going after today. So we're excited to be in this space and excited about the growth opportunities that are out for us, really across-the-board in our business today. So really feel very good about the growth prospects that lie before us in the company. And we've got a lot of to execute on, but very confident in our team's ability to do that. So with that, we'll close it up. And once again, thank you very much, and good luck in your recovery, if you've been impacted by Hurricane Sandy. Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today's program. You may disconnect at any time. Thank you, and have a great day.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams Company Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John Porter: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams. As you know, yesterday afternoon we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website, williams.com. These items include the press release of our results with related schedules and our analyst package; a presentation on our results and growth opportunities with related audio commentary from our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and an update to our quarterly data book, which contains detailed information regarding various aspects of our business. This morning, Alan will make a few brief comments and then we will open the discussion for Q&A. Rory Miller is here from our Midstream business; Randy Barnard is here from our Gas Pipeline business; and our CFO, Don Chappel, is also available to respond to any questions. In yesterday's presentation and also in the quarterly data book, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that have been reconciled back to generally excepted accounting principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan.
Alan S. Armstrong: Great. Thanks, John, and good morning. Thanks for joining us and it's a busy time right now, and so we appreciate you being able to take the time out for us. Well certainly, despite a very disappointing financial performance in the second quarter and significantly lower margin forecast for the balance of '12 and '13, we're very pleased that despite that, we're able to continue to remain confident in our very well-supported dividend growth, which is still at 55% here in 2012 and 20% both in '13 and '14. So a lot of our confidence on that continues to come from the degree of coverage that we've had built into our model, as well as the extraordinary maintenance costs or maintenance capital we have built into PZ right now, and as well a lot of continued strong growth coming from our fee-based business. Our second quarter performance was certainly impacted by a rapid decline in NGL prices, but a few things as well. There’s one thing, I think, that isn't always obvious in the way we report is that we also have a pretty significant amount of product that's in transit that is held in pipelines. And of course, that gets remarked each quarter based on the pricing decline. So in fact in this period, we had about $22 million impact on that over and above what you would see in your typical pricing model. So whenever we see prices move down, that gets somewhat accelerated. And when we see it move back the other way, it comes back to us. But there were certainly were other factors as well beyond pricing. Some growing pains, the Boreal Pipeline line fill. The high start-up O&M cost associated with the Caiman pipeline -- or sorry, the Caiman acquisition that we now refer to as Ohio Valley and as well, quite a bit of depreciation expense going on with that as well. But we also had higher maintenance costs, which we accelerated some of our work on a lot of our Western plants as we had a third-party fractionator being out during the second quarter that required us to take some of our plants down, so we took advantage of that and accelerated things like a lot of turbine overhauls, embezzled maintenance during the period. The good news for the quarter, a 19% increase in our fee-based businesses within our midstream portion of WPZ. And we certainly had great progress on our major project execution going on during the quarter as well. So we remain very confident in the way our model is growing, particularly on the fee-based business side. Just commenting quickly on prices. Certainly the second quarter drop that we had from the first and second quarter was over 20% on our NGL margins, and the balance of the year is forecasted to be approximately 30% lower than what we recognized in the first quarter of '12. So we certainly have, in this model we have taken it down to what we're seeing and certainly we expect for prices, particularly on the light-end products, ethane and propane, to be very choppy as we see a lot of new infrastructure and supply coming on of the NGL side, but a bit ahead of a lot of the Petrochemical build out and some of the export build out on the propane side. The NGL crude ratios are really what drove us. A lot of folks have thought about this from a crude standpoint, but really the crude price had very little to do with this. And we've got in our forecast, we've got NGL to crude ratio is running at about 40% here through the balance of the year versus historical average of 60% and the almost 57% that we realized in 2011. So certainly that disconnect that we saw on the ethane and propane side is what really damaged the second quarter from a pricing standpoint, and we expect that to continue as the market needs to be balanced on the supply side on both ethane and propane. The good news, of course, for Williams is with the Geismar facility. As we're expanding that, we moved away from a lot of the risk on the ethane choppiness. We're not all buried long term on NGLs as much as we are realizing that there's going to be a lot of infrastructure changes going on as this market tries to build out and we think there will be quite a bit of volatility associated with that. On the project news, a lot of great efforts going on around the company right now in terms of building out our $9 billion that's in our guidance for CapEx through 2014. The Boreal Pipeline we brought on, this certainly in the second quarter and that was brought on below budget -- below our planned budget, excuse me. And as well, brought in a little ahead of schedule. Our ethane extraction project in Canada is also going very well and that project has been very well executed. So this will really be the third project, the ethane extraction project that we've managed up there, the first being the BB splitter, the Boreal Pipeline and now the ethane extraction project. And our Canadian team continues to do a great job of executing on those projects. Likewise in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, our GulfStar project is going ahead very nicely, the Keathley Canyon project is doing very well. And I'll tell you, we remain very bullish on the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico as an oil province and we really think that we're very well positioned to provide a lot of the service as the Deepwater comes back. The Caiman or Ohio Valley efforts, a lot of effort going on in the build out, people from really all over our systems up there trying to assist with getting that business built out and the tremendous amount of activity going on, a lot of promise. And we're very excited about the way things are going so far on that acquisition. The Laurel Mountain Midstream build out, we're getting to the point where we're almost, I can say that we're not constraining production there with the infrastructure. We have, for sometime, a lot of that volume’s been limited by our infrastructure up there as Chevron continues to drill out that acreage. And we're about to get to the point where we'll be out in front of them a little bit with the expansion, so we're excited about that. And then of course, the Geismar expansion continues to go very well and it's well contracted at this point. And the gas pipeline space, the Northeast Supply Link project continues ahead, and as well our Rockway lateral. We are hopeful that we can get a positive response. That is waiting on a bill in front of Congress, and so we're looking forward to that. In addition, we also have a lot of new projects that have been recently announced, the Canadian propane dehydrogenation project, which would be there at our Redwater facility. We think we're extremely well positioned for that project and it's a very nice compliment to our propylene production that we have there today in Canada already. And then the Utica JV that we announced, we're excited about the promise of that, a little early to comment too much on that today, but that JV is completed and we're excited about the promises there. And you'll see in our capital guidance, you'll see that we've added in capital for that JV in terms of our expectation for that. We just announced Leidy expansion and really excited about the way that's gone. That project winds up being a very nice project for us in terms of being able to expand along our Leidy system and we think that’ll be both a lower-risk project for us in the immediate term but also provides, we think, a great value to producers and to our markets in giving them great access to the supplies up there. So we're very excited about that. And we certainly haven't shut the door in any way, shape or form on the Atlantic access, but we're not about to go ahead with a very risky build like that without very strong support from the producer community and in terms of contracts that make sense for the kind of return that's allowed in the pipeline basis. Finally, the Dalton lateral Mobile Bay South are also projects that are gaining steam here in the second quarter and into the third quarter. And so our backlog continues to mount as does our confidence in our strategy, in our growth, in our dividend. And so with that, I'll turn it over for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Kevin Smith with Raymond James.
Kevin A. Smith - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Can you speak on the Boreal Pipeline, how much that lowered your NGL volumes by this quarter when you started up and to fill it?
Rory Lee Miller: Yes. That was about a $9 million hit to us with the fill.
Kevin A. Smith - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Got you. No reason that any of that should impact 3Q, right? It's all behind?
Rory Lee Miller: I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. Could you repeat that question.
Kevin A. Smith - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: He ask if it would effect third quarter at all.
Rory Lee Miller: I don't think so. The line is full now and so we'll be gearing that, but there shouldn't be any additional hit after that.
Kevin A. Smith - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then my second question on the Geismar plant, can you kind of talk a little bit about how much EBITDA and cash flow that’s generating right now? And I guess where you are in your CapEx plans for it?
Rory Lee Miller: We typically haven't released individual numbers for Geismar. The second part of your question on the CapEx plans. We've got a couple of capital projects going on there right now. We're upgrading some of our furnaces. I think we've got -- that project is partially completed, but is ongoing. And then of course, we've got our major expansion, the plant being serviced in the third quarter of '13. Those are the main CapEx plans for Geismar at this point.
Operator: And Bradley Olson with Tudor, Pickering has our next question.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Couple of questions on the Atlantic Access and Leidy announcements. I assume it's safe to say that given that Leidy is kind of running along the existing lateral, that's going to be a higher return project than building out the new laterals to Butler and Natrium would have been.
Frank J. Ferazzi: Alan, is that something you’d like me to take?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes, Frank, please.
Frank J. Ferazzi: Yes. I think as Alan said, the fact that we have existing Leidy Line already there, that the execution risk associated with the new build would be less than a greenfield project. The economics of each of the pieces are going to be a function of the kind of shipper commitments that you get. And so as Alan also said, we're going to continue to monitor the interest along that new greenfield build, and we will proceed with that when we get enough interest from producers to support an economic project. We're just not there for in-service day of 2015, but based on the projections that we've seen on the production in the area, we think at sometime that will make economic sense.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: And as far as the Natrium lateral that was canceled, so that moves -- that was kind of designed to move gas out of Southwest PA and Northern West Virginia. Should we view the cancellation or at least the delay of Natrium as having any read throughs for your production forecasts in the part of the Marcellus, where the Ohio Valley assets are also operating?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes, I'll take that. No, that is not in any way, shape or form the case. We're very confident in the volumes there and the drilling activity that continues there. I think the producers are fairly confident in the area and are happy to take the prices that they can get on some of the systems that are further to the east over there. And so time will tell if that will hold up in terms of those net backs. But today, I think they are confident that there's adequate takeaway there today. And again, that becomes crowded. Once it becomes crowded, the price will decline. But I think today, as evidenced by the interest, they're pretty comfortable with the current gas markets coming out of that space today.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: That's really helpful. Another one on Transco operations. Looking at -- and I understand that most Transco revenue is firm, but there is a variable component that can move around quarter-to-quarter. And I know that this is a seasonally weaker quarter historically for Transco, but it looks as though there's -- that revenue or EBITDA per Mcf on Transco this quarter was kind of lower than it had been on a year-over-year and a quarter-over-quarter basis. Is that just because the nature of the volumes are just increasingly short haul? And so on a kind of per unit basis, you're seeing revenues decline or was there something operationally with Transco this quarter that made the results a little bit softer there?
Frank J. Ferazzi: This is Frank Ferrazi. As you indicated, we do have some costs allocated interruptible transportation and we tend to -- if that can be impacted by changes in seasons. Obviously we're going to do better in the winter there than we're going to do in the summer. There really were no operational issues that occurred in the second quarter that would have resulted in lower earnings.
Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then just one last one. I guess from an accounting perspective, why was it that the accelerated maintenance that you talked about in the Rockies, why did that show up in higher midstream OpEx as opposed to capital? And as a result of that accelerated maintenance, would it be reasonable to expect that maybe the run rate OpEx for the remainder of 2012 would be lower in the midstream segment?
Rory Lee Miller: Yes. That wasn't maintenance capital, it was just O&M that was accelerated. And mainly, we were moving forward from what would otherwise be spent in the third and fourth quarter. So we should see some moderation forward-looking for the rest of the year based on that work that we did.
Operator: Moving next to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: A couple of questions here. First, a follow-on to Kevin's Boreal question. Was that $9 million hit all expected just for packing the new line or was that inclusive of some impact from the Suncor plant being done?
Alan S. Armstrong: No. That was just from the line pack.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: And what was the impact from the Suncor plant?
Alan S. Armstrong: Hang on just a second, let me pull that up.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: While that's being looked for, on the prepared comments or the recorded comments, I was a little unclear on what the time frame was, the duration for the underwater ethylene supply contracts that kind of have margins at Geismar versus what the market opportunities really were in the first half?
Alan S. Armstrong: Those basically timeout pretty well at the end of this year, a little bit of run into '13. But by the end of '13, there's not any residual impact from that. So mostly by the end of '12, most of those contracts runout.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Great. And then if you're still looking up that Boreal question from Suncor, I had one last follow up here.
Rory Lee Miller: Craig, I do have that if you want me to interject that there.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Sure, go ahead.
Rory Lee Miller: Yes. It looks like it's a little over $4 million for Q2 that was related that Suncor outage.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. So the $9 million was naturally expected because you knew you had to finish the pipeline to fill it. The $4 million is the unexpected, is that a fair statement?
Rory Lee Miller: Yes, that is. And a part of that lapped into Q1 and then part into Q2.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Are now you're talking about the line packing?
Rory Lee Miller: I'm talking about the Suncor outage. They had 1 unit for about 15 days and another unit was operating about 75% load. So the $4 million is related just strictly to the Q2 outage and then the $9 million is isolated to just the impact the Boreal Pipeline.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Got you. And the last question, Alan, how do you avoid the issues regarding nonqualified income at PZ with a potential drop-down of Geismar. Because that seemed to be the logical thing all along, somehow that a contractor dropped down to make a true internal operating hedge rather than just a consolidated accounting hedge. But there's always this question of nonqualified income at the MLP. Did you find a way around that?
Alan S. Armstrong: Well, I would just say that -- I would say we took it head-on and I would say that we're very confident in how we're handling that and time will tell in terms of what gets exposed there about what supports that confidence.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: As far as details on any drop-down, I mean, how eminent do you think that could be?
Donald R. Chappel: Craig, this is Don. I think we'd be working through the process with the WPZ complex committee and their advisers, probably expect the closing in the fourth quarter.
Operator: Moving on to Carl Kirst with BMO.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: This is actually just a follow-on to Craig's about the qualifying income and recognizing was only limited, maybe you can say. But I guess regardless of how this is approached, just since this is somewhat of a precedent. Will there be some type of private letter ruling or some clarification from the IRS that kind of sets it in stone?
Alan S. Armstrong: Again, I would just say that we are very confident in how that's going to be treated and that's really all we want to say about it at this point.
Donald R. Chappel: This is Don. I'd just add that again, we think that it's some information that provides a competitive advantage for us, so that's the reason that we're not more clear in terms of the basis for our confidence.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. That latter statement is very helpful, so I appreciate that. And maybe just a couple of follow-ups, one, going back to the accelerated maintenance that was done on the midstream side. Did that actually, in the third-party fractionator outage, did that have an impact on the equity sales volumes for the quarter? And if so, by how much?
Rory Lee Miller: Yes. It did. We had a total production related kind of directly to the bush and frac outage was about 25 million gallons. And of that, about 15 million was related to our own equity account.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. Then one other question just on Geismar, this just goes to the utilization, the 74% utilization kind of on par with second quarter last year, but down sequentially. Was that just normal maintenance for this time of year or was something else going on there?
Rory Lee Miller: Yes. We did in Q2 have a determined issue there that had us down, I believe it was 7 days. One of those days was actually in Q1, and then the remaining 6 days was in Q2. And we were, I think that was related to about 28 million pounds total being down about $24 a day.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. Yes, that would explain the difference. Great. And then last question, and this really is just Caiman, Ohio Valley, I guess, just trying to set the baseline for where we are today. Is it possible to break out what the volumes were for the second quarter?
Rory Lee Miller: Let me see, I've got the right-hand man looking that up right now. But I will say in general, Alan mentioned a little bit about what's going on there from a producer input standpoint. In general, I would say the volume situation has been very positive and we've got producers waiting on pipeline, waiting on infrastructure, results are looking very favorable. I think all of the movement that we've heard on volumes from producers has been to the upside, if anything. So the area and the quality of the reserves was fantastic it. Let's see, yes, for second quarter we're right around 182 Bbtu, and about 20 million gallons of NGL production.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: I apologize, can you repeat those numbers.
Rory Lee Miller: 182 Bbtu per day.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: And you said 20 million gallons?
Rory Lee Miller: 20 million gallons, yes.
Alan S. Armstrong: And that's just 2 months of production.
Operator: Moving on to Steve Maresca with Morgan Stanley.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just some follow-ups on the Geismar proposed drop-down you mentioned in the release of taking units back. Is the idea that this would potentially be solely WPZ units going up the WMB to fund this?
Donald R. Chappel: Steve, this is Don. Yes, and that's really tax-driven. If we take cash, we'll pay taxes. And tax basis is fairly modest, so we're inclined to take the units to be tax efficient and have as little value loss to taxes as possible.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. I appreciate that you haven't released individual numbers on Geismar's cash generating ability, but did you put a chart in there that shows ethylene produced and the margin. Is there something else to it other than that arithmetic for us to figure out?
Alan S. Armstrong: Well, I would say that's the bulk of it. You also have propylene production and butadiene production as well. And so that and the operating costs are the other elements you'd have to get to, to see an [indiscernible]
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. Final thing on the Geismar. Is there a thought as to what -- right now you're forecasting 1.03 coverage next year at WPZ. Is there an idea of what this would take PZs coverage to where you'd like to see it after this?
Donald R. Chappel: Steve, I don't think we want to put any numbers out. We're in discussions with the complex committee at this point. So I think as we reach that agreement with the complex committee, we'll announce the transaction and provide updated guidance for both WPZ and Williams at that time.
Alan S. Armstrong: I would say, obviously we recognize that business is not a fee-based business. And so our coverage needs to be higher than, certainly higher than normal in terms of how that would impact.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then you talked about, I think, an ethylene margin rebound is part of the '14 earnings going up. Can you talk just a little bit about what the thoughts are behind the drivers for that?
Alan S. Armstrong: Sure. We certainly feel like that the U.S. continues to be the advantage in North America. In general, I would say, it continues to be the advantaged place to produce ethylene. And we see that demand continuing to come up on a global basis through the period. And so pretty confident in the general fundamentals around ethylene. And if you think about somebody trying to build ethylene capacity somewhere else in the face of this very low-cost natural gas, I think that drives our confidence and certainty we have a pretty good picture of what's going on in the ethylene capacity here in the U.S. Very fortunate to have Geismar on the front end of any these capacity expansions, but there's really not very much other coming on in the near term -- or sorry, in the near term to 2014. So we see a great promise coming on, a lot of NGL supplies coming on, but it just takes a while to build that cracking capacity to meet that increased demand that's coming on. And so that builds our confidence there.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. Finally, on the proposed PDH facility. A couple of things, you talked about, I guess transporting, I think, the propylene to the U.S. Gulf Coast. How would that happen? And then is that going to be funded with -- is there enough cash on hand to fund all that?
Rory Lee Miller: Yes. That will be railed, is the plan. And I think our belief is that with our current international funds offshore accounts and the cash flow from the existing business, that is growing along with our ethylene project that, that should be fairly well self-contained.
Alan S. Armstrong: We do rail, today, a tremendous amount of propylene out of Redwater already today. And so this would be just additive which is, again, a nice feature that a lot of the infrastructure in terms the storage of propylene and railing and loading of propylene, we already got all that in place. So this is just additive and I think that's why we feel very confident about us being the right builder of that PDH facility in Canada.
Rory Lee Miller: We've also got the BB splitter up there, which is going to help us with the products. We've also got a very unique situation with our sale to NOVA of the ethane/ethylene mix. And so those are advantages that we think we uniquely hold. And so it appears to be kind of an advantaged opportunity for us.
Operator: Moving on to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Sticking with the PDH unit here. Have you given any thought to actually contracting up the propylene volumes or do you want to kind of keep that price risk on the propylene side as well?
Alan S. Armstrong: We're looking at kind of all of our options right now. I would say right now, our main focus is on scoping, getting some of the initial engineering work done and we're looking at all the options and certainly, this decision of the propylene is one of the big decisions that we'll be making before we sanction the project. But that's an ongoing exercise.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then I appreciate the slides on ethylene crack. It looks like you're forecasting in 2014 that you won't quite get to the industry benchmark. I'm just wondering what would cause you to be short of that, plus or minus to hit it or try to be short of it?
Alan S. Armstrong: When you say industry benchmark, are you talking about the spot with the crack spread?
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Yes. That ethylene spread that you show in 2014, it looks like you realized margin might be short of that. I'm just wondering is there something with Geismar that you wouldn't hit the industry margin or is there just a difference in the definition there?
Alan S. Armstrong: There are couple of things that work there. And one is that even though I think we flagged earlier that in early '13 we'll have an opportunity to re-contract almost our entire portfolio, we still have a legacy contract out there that won't be fully exposed to the spot market. So that's one piece of the story. I think the other piece of the story is just a little bit of conservatism that's built into how we're able to execute in terms of putting those spot contracts into place. And at times, there is some give-and-take between a true spot market deal and a term deal that's tied in the spot market.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: But your intention is to pretty much be spot, in other words, to not do term deals with Geismar?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then just coming back a little bit to the questions on the ethylene margin. Do you care to share what your actual ethane price forecasts are that gets to that ethylene margin in 2014?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes. $0.55 a gallon.
Operator: Moving on to Holly Stewart with Howard Weil.
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Lots of questions on Geismar this morning, so just maybe trying to tie the bow there. In the slides, you point out the shift in mix to spot pricing. Previously, we had talked about kind of a half based on fee, half based on exposure to the spread. I'm assuming kind of addressing Craig's question earlier by the end of 2012, we'll be all based on the spread. Is that how to think about?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes. I think that's accurate. Of course, a lot can happen between now and then. But certainly, our goal there will be balanced against our ethane exposure.
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then you kind of give the chart here. Can you just tell us what your margin was that you realized on the spread in 2Q?
Rory Lee Miller: Stand by, Holly.
Alan S. Armstrong: That's $0.20.
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Say that again, I'm sorry.
Rory Lee Miller: $0.20 balance.
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: $0.20, okay.
Alan S. Armstrong: And that was down from $0.40 in the first quarter of '12.
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: $0.40 in 1Q, that's perfect. And then lastly...
Rory Lee Miller: Thinking about the portfolio mix, like Alan's referencing, the crack spread out there as opposed to our realized margins. So Q1 was $0.18 and 2Q was $0.20. That $0.40 which was first half '12, that's really what the broad market crack spread was. And so that's basically what we got built into our 2014 pricing is at that $0.40 level.
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. Perfect. And then last quarter, you gave some nice commentary on kind of the different rig counts that you were seeing across each of your areas. Is anything on the rig count side changed since last call that might impact things here moving throughout the year?
Rory Lee Miller: This is Rory. I think in general, that kind of step down in activity out West that we flag for you is still pretty consistent. I don't think there are any material changes to that level of activity.
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. Great. And then finally, just one kind of follow-up on the macro side of things. You're hearing commentary that most of those ethylene plants that were down for maintenance in the first half of the year are back up and running. Is there anything else that's kind of still weighing on that?
Rory Lee Miller: Yes. Right now, if you think about ethane supply and that's always a challenge to measure that accurately, but about 1 million barrels a day right now on the supply side, this is where we think it's at. All of the crackers are up and running now. Thank goodness. And that's about 1 million barrels a day of demand. So we see supply and demand very much in balance. I think in Q4, there are 2 crackers that are scheduled to go down temporarily. So that's all we see for the remainder of the year. So the situation should be a little more stable than what we saw in the first half.
Operator: Moving on to Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: It looks like for your MC&O business, the guidance refers to a coverage of 1.3x. I guess Geismar is dropped down to WPZ level. Do you think that type of coverage on the cash flow is appropriate or are you comfortable with something a bit lower given the natural hedge?
Donald R. Chappel: Sharon, I think you have to stay tuned for that, but clearly yes, it does sharply reduce ethane exposure or eliminates the long ethane position after the expansion of WPZ. So we certainly reduce that, but we'll have ethylene exposure and we'll need to make sure that coverage is sufficient to account for that. Again, if ethylene prices are very high, it is expected to have relatively high coverage on that part of the business. And that if ethylene prices are lower, we would expect less coverage just like our NGLs today. If you look at Slide #83, I think we tried to indicate that somewhat, but we'll be tuning that up as we go through discussions with the complex committee, as well as continue to look at our view of the forward market.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And I guess also related to the Geismar drop-down, should we just assume that it would be structured so that WPZ would not be paying, I guess, taxes on that cash flow?
Donald R. Chappel: Yes.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then, I guess on the PDH potential project, do you have like a potential in-service timing of that facility, the 2015 project?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes. I don't think we've released anything on that yet. And it is, as we noted, kind of in the scoping phase right now. So that's probably something we'll be able to give a little more color on in the coming quarters. But I think right now it's a little preliminary to drive a stake in the ground.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then I guess in terms of feeling comfortable to proceed with that comp -- with that project, would you be looking to secure minimum volume commitments or like a fixed propylene margin?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes. I think that kind of gets back to the earlier answer that I gave around disposition of propylene and we're looking at all the options. Of course, if you do lock something in fixed, you're probably giving away some upside. And those are decisions that we'll be making as the projects get fully bedded and pulled together. So we should have a good line of sight on that by the time that project is sanctioned.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Great. And then I guess the last question, in terms of the Leidy announcement, has that CapEx been included in your budget yet?
Donald R. Chappel: Sharon, it has not. So when we come forward again with guidance, we'll update to include that, assuming that the open season is concluded. And we've got all the contracts tied down so we know the size of that.
Operator: And moving on to the Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisers.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: Sorry, still one more question on Geismar. I respect your desire for the competitive advantage but when you do the drop since it is very significant, will you provide investors the basis for why you think that you will not pay taxes on the income.
Donald R. Chappel: Becca, I think you have to stay tuned for that. I think we'll have to see if that's something that is required or we feel is something that we need to author. Again, I think we believe that we have something that is unique at this point and we want to make sure we take full advantage of it without necessarily offering the roadmap for others.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then on the PDH facility, as I understand that you'll need about 20,000 barrels a day or 20 million barrels a day of propane, is that correct? And you would have 7,000. So where will the incremental come from to source that PDH facility?
Alan S. Armstrong: Well, as you're probably aware from previous calls, we do have other projects we’re working on out there. So over time we do expect our equity propane to increase. But there are plenty of places between now and then to buy propane in Canada. So we don't see the supply side as any particular challenge for us right now, and we're very comfortable with that. Whether we're going out on the open market and buying it or whether we’re just building it over time with our internal equity barrels.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: And then the rail cost to get it down to the Gulf Coast, what kind of delta in propane prices do you need relative to the Gulf Coast in order to make up for that $0.05 a pound rail cost.
Alan S. Armstrong: I don’t think we want to get into, probably, that level of detail yet. We've got ongoing analysis on that. And I would say let's leave that for future call, but we do think the situation is very favorable and are supportive of that project. But we have some continued analysis that is ongoing on that.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: And then finally on Marcellus. If my memory serves me well, you guys were expecting gathered volumes from the Susquehanna Hub of about 1 Bcf a day this year and Laurel Mountain about 250 million a day. Is that still the case?
Alan S. Armstrong: Those are generally in the neighborhood. I think on Laurel Mountain, we're probably already over that. I think we're over at 280, if I'm not mistaken, on Laurel Mountain. And I think our target on Susquehanna Hub is just shy of 1 Bcf a day by the end of the year.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: And where are you guys now on Susquehanna?
Alan S. Armstrong: Let's see. Hang on just a second, Becca, let me just track that down.
Unknown Analyst: I can get it offline if you want. I'll just follow-up offline to get that one.
Alan S. Armstrong: All right.
Operator: And next we'll hear from Nathan Copicar [ph] from Viking Global Investors.
Unknown Analyst: Actually, Igan [ph]. I had a similar question about the Geismar cracker, so we can move on.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn things back over to Mr. Armstrong for closing remarks.
Alan S. Armstrong: Great. Well, thank you again for joining us. And we look forward to continuing to share our growth with you in the future. Thanks for your interest.
Operator: And this does conclude our conference call for today. We'd like to thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams Companies First Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John Porter: Thank you, Corina. Good morning and welcome. As always we thank you for your interest in Williams. As you know yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website, williams.com. These items include the press release of our results, with related schedules and our analyst package, a presentation on our results and growth opportunities with related audio commentary from our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong and an update to our quarterly data book which contain the detailed information regarding various aspects of the business.  This morning, Alan will make a few brief comments and then we will open the discussion up for Q&A. Rory Miller is here from our midstream business, and Randy Barnard is here from our gas pipeline business. Additionally, our CFO, Don Chappel is available to respond to any questions.  In yesterday's presentation, and also in the quarterly data book, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it.  Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that have been reconciled back to generally accepted accounting principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan.
Alan S. Armstrong: Great. Thank you, John, and good morning to everybody. Thanks for joining us. I know it's a busy day for earnings releases.  Certainly, you've have all seen the strong financial results for the quarter, so this morning I hope to provide just some color around the business fundamentals that provide great transparency around the projects and the business growth that it supports our confidence in a sustainable high-growth dividend for WMB.  First of all, our quarter came out to about 8% above consensus due, to I believe, a combination of mild weather and continued growth in revenues from our recent capital investments that continue to ramp up. And then as well, the high ethylene margins in the first quarter as well. I think we're higher than most people expected. So let me hit on just a few of these things real quickly.  First of all, the mild weather, how that impacted us -- drove lower natural gas prices which of course improved our NGL margins despite some lower NGL prices. The very low natural gas prices actually helped prop up our key pulse margins.  Secondly, and probably less obvious is the fact that we had great operating performance during the quarter. Because normally in the first quarter, we have a lot of freeze offs of production from our producers and so forth. So in this period, we did not experience very much of that at all. So we've enjoyed the mild weather in those 2 ways.  Secondly, as I mentioned, the projects that we continue to bring online continue to grow our fee-based revenues and actually, in the midstream the fee-based revenues were up 19%. And really this was due to a combination of issues.  First of all, as I mentioned, projects that we've been investing in over the last couple of years continue to ramp up, namely, the Perdido Norte volumes continuing to come up, the Echo Springs -- fourth train at Echo Springs continue to enjoy more and more volumes from the Piceance. And the Northeast Pennsylvania assets were up and certainly the volumes there grew actually by a little over 160%. As well at our Markham, our new expansion at Markham, that also experienced new fee-based volumes from the Eagle Ford as well. So really across the board, a lot of the investments we've been making for the last several years really starting to pan out in terms of driving our fee-based revenues, particularly within midstream.  These 2 factors also drove strong operating statistics, the mild weather and the new projects online. Our NGL production was actually up 18%. Our gathering volumes were up 19%.  Of course, most of our capital expansion in our processing business has been fee-based so our equity gallons were only up 7% and I think probably the main driver for that is the fact that our, again as I mentioned, our plants were up and running more during the first quarter than we saw in the first quarter of '11.  Certainly the lower -- sorry, the higher ethylene prices were driven by the lower ethane prices during the quarter. And we continue to see strong demand for ethylene in that area, particularly there was a lot of outages and it drove the ethylene demand even higher in the area. So, pretty excited about the way that business is helping support our overall combined MD revenue.  And then certainly, our gas pipe growth continues on a steady pace as well, we actually saw a 6% growth in our fee-based revenues in our gas pipes areas as well.  And so, while we're certainly excited to see this continued strong growth in our fee-based revenues, we are not surprised because our project development and project execution continues to be the underpinning for our confidence in dividend growth of 20% in 2013 and 2014 on the back of the WPZ distribution growth of 8 -- 10% and of course continued growth in our MC&O area as well, even though we are putting a very high coverage ratio as we explained to you on that.  Certainly, the risk-reducing investment we intend to make in our ethylene-cracking capacity continues to support that dividend growth as well.  Looking ahead and even beyond the guidance period, you can see many of our larger projects don't even start up until 2014. And many of these investments are just reaching stride in 2015, like the recent Caiman acquisition, our Canada expansion that's continuing and certainly Northeast Pennsylvania with acquisitions like Laser really continuing to grow very steadily beyond the guidance period.  And as we mentioned several times before, we continue to be very encouraged by the amount of demand for services on Transco, as the market continues to look -- to take advantage of low priced natural gas.  So the opportunities really do just keep coming at us and we are fortunate to have a great operating and project management talent on board. And we certainly are mobilizing a lot of that talent from all over our system right now, help deliver these great opportunities safety, on-time and on budget and we're proud of the track record we continue to build in that regard.  So taking full advantage of North America's abundant natural gas and gas liquids resources, it is certainly going to take a tremendous amount of infrastructure, as demand for these great resources grows and continues to drive volumes on our infrastructure. And we certainly think Williams is the best positioned company to deliver the critical infrastructure required to take advantage of these great resources.  And I'll also remind you our Analyst Day webcast is May 22, and we look forward to being able to describe in some more detail all of the great projects that continue to drive our confidence and our growth. And with that, I'll turn it over for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And first, we'll go to Carl Kirst with BMO Capital Markets.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Alan, I think when we last spoke in March, I guess with the Caiman acquisition, there was hopes may be that by this time, we might have a little bit more color on the follow-on Utica joint venture. Is there anything additional you can share at this point?
Alan S. Armstrong: No. We still are under a confidentiality agreement there and so not ready to be able to disclose that in full detail. We're certainly expecting for our May 22 Analyst Day to lay that out in some more detail. So that would be our hope for this point. I really don't see any reason that won't occur at this point. It's just a matter of finalizing some things and dotting the Is and crossing the Ts on that.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, appreciate that. And just a lot of different projects kind of moving on, moving around. One of the latest is the Atlantic Access project of course kind of getting reengineered as I understand it, with respect to kind of what your customers came back to you on. It looks like a lot more paths are being, I guess, viewed access. But I wasn't sure with the Southern Pennsylvania sort of a new pipeline. It looked like it was being downsized. And I guess at the end, I'm trying to kind of figure out is this a proposal, that from a capital dollar standpoint? From investment standpoint, is this something that has, is getting larger, is getting smaller? I’m just trying to better understand the moving parts.
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes. I'll take that and Frank Ferazzi is on the line and if there's any detailed required data into that, Frank, you can do so. I would just say that probably one of the biggest changes about the project is the fact that by doing some of it along the Leidy Line, it allows us to do it in a scalable fashion. And so growing into the increments that the market is requiring. And so that's probably one of the big changes. In terms of the southern-most route, it is really a matter of delaying that. But certainly what we are trying to do here is add flexibility. Having said all that, right now, the project as laid out is larger both in terms of capital dollars and volumes than we originally expected. And primarily that is driven by demand along the Leidy route that came in as a result of the open season. As you recall, we opened that leg up to the Northwest, that leg up to butler to the Northwest and saw some very strong demand on that leg. So we had to decide how we best serve that load in Northwest PA, particularly volumes coming down from Northern PA as well.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Great, that's perfect color. And then just one final question if I could, and this actually kind of goes to the equity volumes if you will at midstream PC [ph]. Notwithstanding sort of first quarter being -- over first quarter of last year wells, freeze-offs and the like, we were down slightly from the fourth quarter. Between the fourth quarter and the first quarter, is this sort of your kind of expected run rate for the equity volumes as pretty much everything else kind of comes in on the fee basis?
Rory L. Miller: This is Rory Miller, I'll take that question. I think the levels that we're at now are pretty indicative of where we're going to be as we contract for new business. Most of it's going to be fee-based, consistent with our strategy. And frankly consistent with what most of the producers want. They need to see those margins back at the wellhead in order to keep their drilling rigs moving in the richer areas. So I think we'll be able to maintain that for the foreseeable future. At some point, it probably starts to fall off. But I think that's -- that 300 million gallon per quarter range is a pretty good spot to be thinking about our equity launch.
Operator: And next we'll go with Stephen Maresca with Morgan Stanley.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: You and the Marcellus talked about gathering, getting up to gathering about 5 bcf a day by 2015. How much are you gathering now? And can you talk about just any, what needs to happen to get to that 5? And sort of any concerns you have over the big gas environment over the next couple of years impeding that?
Rory L. Miller: Yes. This is Rory again, I'll take that. Just doing some quick math there. We'll probably turn volumes -- bcf, 1.1 bcf a day of current volumes gathered. And I'm including the Caiman asset in those numbers, which actually is closed tomorrow. So I maybe gun jumping just a little bit there, but just so you have some context to that question. The path to go from there to the 5 bcf a day number that we've shown in all of our materials, it's really around construction and that is not a straight-line event. I think we've been pretty candid about some of the challenges, but I think we've got the right team in place. We've got the broad resources across the organizations drawn and we continue to refine that construction effort up there. But that's kind of the critical path. The producers have a lot of the same challenges. So a lot if it is just working through the process and refining the process that would get wells drilled and connected up in the Northeast and it gets better every month. So I'm very optimistic about the progress that we're making. But that's probably one of the bigger challenges. And of course we're actively working with the regulators and the local governmental authorities that set the rules out there. And I think there's a pretty good dialogue going now and it's getting better. So it's moving in the right direction.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And you guys are moving much more towards fee revenues now. Are you seeing at all pushback from producers in well or gas or ethane price environment to not be as fee-based and want you guys to take on more risk? Or is that just not the case right now?
Rory L. Miller: We have not seen that. That's probably a short answer. But I don't know that it requires much elaboration either. The -- most of the producers, when they do get a chance to recontract are interested in getting that exposure to their -- the NGLs and their gas.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And my final question, you have a mandatory Transco rate case coming in March of '13. Is there -- can you elaborate at all? Is there anything we should expect out of that materially?
Alan S. Armstrong: Frank, you want to take that, please?
Frank Ferazzi: Yes, we do have as part of the settlement of our last rate case, we do have a filing requirement. Filing will actually be made in September of this year and we will file an increase. And so the commission will suspend it for 5 months until the rates will become effective March of 2013 and we're expecting a rate increase. It's difficult at this point to quantify exactly how much it's going to be.
Operator: The next we'll go to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: A couple of questions. Alan, in your recorded remarks online, you mentioned that the long-term growth was of course excluding any incremental M&A. And kind of it struck me with Laser having just closed in February and Caiman closing out tomorrow that for you to say that in your prepared remarks, well it sounded like there is more appetite despite all this activity. And I just thought you might want to flesh that out a little bit.
Alan S. Armstrong: Well, I certainly didn't intend to comment on anything other than the fact that our previous guidance hadn't included those acquisitions and certainly this hadn't. So I would tell you for right now, I’d say we certainly feel like we have our plate full, in terms of things that are back-end loaded cash flows much like Caiman and Laser are. So I wouldn't read too much into that other than we'd be making it very clear that all that is in there is identified projects sort of few relatively small acquisitions that are just kind of bolt-on assets here and there and there. But for the most part, it's all just organic growth and that was really the purpose of my comment there.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Understood. And as a follow up, I don't know, if Alan you want to respond or Don. But with the Caiman acquisition announcement and the increase in distribution guidance, it became clear that the growth in fee-based businesses is so transparent for a number of years and so great. That for an interim period to have some of your distributions based in part of commodity-sensitive operations that are doing well, isn't such a big deal since the fee-based stuff is going to catch up to it not too long anyhow. Given the fact that you're taking out so strong results particularly on the olefins' side, what's the appetite? Because like 6 months ago, you all would have been shy about making distributions contingent on fee-based businesses. But given the backdrop of all the growth in the fee-based stuff, what's the appetite for juicing the distributions a little more if commodities continue to be favorable like that?
Donald R. Chappel: Craig, this is Don. I think we've put out what we think is still industry-leading distribution growth at WPZ. We don't think that there's a great incentive to do more than that. And so again to the extent that we could put out something that we think is a sustainable, higher rate of growth, we'll do that. But we're not inclined just to call -- jump the distributions on the back of high commodity prices. But we think we're building a portfolio business that will enable us to have industry-leading growth in WPZ distributions over a number of years. And as has been pointed out in the call, we think we got great visibility to it. I think another way to kind of come out the M&A comment was really we don't need any additional acquisitions in order to drive this distribution growth or the dividend growth at Williams. So this is now all within our control. And I think we're delighted by that. And we're just taking excess cash flow and plowing it right back into building this fee-based business out.
Operator: Moving on to Brad Olsen with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Brad Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: I just had a couple of questions about the MC&O business. The olefins that are -- the MC&O business as a whole posted a really strong kind of margin expansion quarter-over-quarter as you alluded to a result of the ethylene and ethane spread. I think last quarter you mentioned that there are some legacy contracts that might limit, for the next 12 months or at least for the remainder of the year, your ability to capture the full ethane, ethylene spread. And do you have any comments on what that margin expansion or the quarter-over-quarter growth might have looked like if you didn't have those contracts in place?
Rory L. Miller: This is Rory. I don't have that assessment that you just asked for. But I can give you a little color on the contracting situation, just so you maybe have a flavor of what's coming. If you look at, say, where we're at in February, about 30% of our offtake portfolio had kind of unfettered exposure to the spot market. The majority of the rest was under collared deals. So meaning it had some exposure, but the exposure was limited. We page ahead to the end of the year in December, that exposure to the -- just the pure spot market is around 55%. And then by February of 2013, that exposure goes up to 84%. So if we had a -- let's just say a steady-state situation around the crack spread, we'd expect to see that open up significantly over that period.
Brad Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And now moving to Midstream Canada, you guys are working on that, the ethane extraction project to deliver up to 10,000 barrels a day to NOVA in Alberta. And I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about how -- I know there's not really a direct linkage between the Canadian ethane environment and the U.S. ethane environment. But does the drop in ethane prices in the U.S. affect the economics of that project at all?
Rory L. Miller: No, I don't think so. That project made a lot of sense, but the Canadian government also provided some subsidies that helped on that project significantly. The Boreal pipeline is I think set to start being filled in May 28 and then the ethane project I think is set to be online second quarter of 2013. And there is a floor in that contract that we think gives us the kind of earnings and performance that we're looking for, in spite of where the commodities go.
Brad Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Great. And one last question, we've seen some kind of dry gas Marcellus rig count declines recently. Do you guys have any comments on that? And also as we've seen kind of weak propane demand up in the Northeast this quarter, do you see any change, just kind of preliminary change in producer attitudes as propane is a large share of kind of the liquid yield up in the Marcellus, on how they think about operating rigs in that area?
Rory L. Miller: Let me take that first question. First about the -- what we're seeing in the dry gas and maybe some falling rig counts in the Marcellus. I just would say our approach has been start with the geology first. And we've tried to target the places that we think are the sweet spots in the Marcellus. It's not all created equal. But during the best parts of the Marcellus, in the dry gas windows, you're probably in the best place to drill United States of America for dry gas. So Susquehanna County probably being the #1 dry gas location. We have seen a rig or 2 come out of that area that we have access to with our system. But what the producers have been doing has been replacing less efficient rigs with more efficient rigs. And so it hasn't had any impact at all on our volume forecast. So the situation is very robust up there for us and we're very confident that, that system is going to perform. In fact, we've got the majority of that 3 bcf a day of capacity, takeaway capacity that we highlighted in the slides. We got the majority that's contracted for. There's a little bit of available capacity, hydraulically available, and we're in the process of sorting through the demand for that right now. We have more demand for it than we have space. So situation is still very robust, very, very positive. There are places in the Marcellus where it's fringier and those are not areas that we're in right now. But those fills will probably see less activity than the better areas. In terms of the propane demand, propane is a tougher commodity to predict probably right now just with the increases in supply and maybe a changing demand profile and exports and probably going to be a big part of that story going forward. We have not seen any changes in drilling in the rich gas areas particularly in the Northeast. All we've seen is more and more interest. So certainly, if propane is down, that is going to hurt a bit. But I still think it's not going to fall to the point where it greatly diminishes the drilling economics in those rich gas areas. They're some of the best in the nation right now.
Operator: And we'll now go to Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: You have I guess in one of the slides, a budgeted amount or percentage of projects potentially for the Utica. In terms of those types of investments, are you looking at gathering projects? Processing projects? And maybe if you could give a sense in terms of the potential timing of those investments?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes. Sharon, we can't really give you much in terms of timing on that. I would just tell you that the assets that we acquired or will be acquiring when we close from Caiman, those are well positioned to kind of be a first mover to attract volumes in from that. So initially probably that infrastructure would likely be more gathering that would be bringing some of those volumes over. But certainly, we'd be looking to take advantage of that first mover position we have and ultimately build the kind of infrastructure that would serve that area long term because the infrastructure that we're building for Caiman really is, to the large, very large community we already spoken for, from volumes just from that area. So we would have to be building further processing capacity for the Utica in the long term. But initially, it would just be a matter of being able to gather that into that -- those plants just as a temporary solution.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And I guess just following up on Carl's question about Atlantic Access. Do you have updated number for the potential CapEx? I think last time we spoke it might have been about $1.5 billion.
Donald R. Chappel: Sharon, this is Don. At this -- with this current proposal a top tier [ph], it's quite a bit bigger than that. We've not put a number out. I think we'll try to give you a better range at our May 22 Analyst Day. But again, it's quite a bit larger, if it went off exactly as it's currently proposed. But obviously, we have to get feedback from customers as [indiscernible] begins.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And I guess for the Constitution Pipeline, is the CapEx around $725 million?
Alan S. Armstrong: I think we're just saying it's between $700 million and $800 million at this point, Sharon. It certainly expanded as a result of the Southwestern Energy volume. But that's about as close to target as we're going to draw on that at this point.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And I noticed for 2014, the guidance for the MC&O business actually increased a bit. Maybe if you can just touch on the reason for the increase in guidance?
Donald R. Chappel: Sharon, this is Don. I'd just say that we have risked that. But I think upon further study, we decided that some of the, call it probability had improved somewhat, in terms of timing, just timing of cash flows. And that really caused us to increase the 2014 guidance.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll now go to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: We have heard a lot about the Marcellus here. But I'm just wondering if you can go back into your legacy areas, in the Rockies. Are you seeing with the low gas price, seeing the rigs call back? Surely, given that there's a lot of key pulse that the producers aren't really getting as much of the liquids uplift out there?
Rory L. Miller: This is Rory, I'll take that call -- or that question. Yes, maybe just starting out in Southwest Wyoming. We have seen a little bit of fall off there, probably down about $100 million a day from the first of the year. And I will tell you that we've got a lot of wells tied into those gathering systems. Most of it's coming out of tight-sands production and so it's a hyperbolic decline. The builder wells are on the very flat part of the decline. And so up in Wyoming, we've seen both shale and ultra have gone down to 2 rigs each, so that's a drop of about 4 rigs in total. That $100 million a day is probably indicative of the flat production that we were seeing. And we think it'll be pretty stable because we are on those flat parts of the decline. Over in Wamsutter, we've had 4 rigs drilling over there and we've had 1 pull out. And the other 3 are from producers that are getting the benefit to those NGLs and we don't anticipate those coming out of the equation. Piceance has been down to about 5 rigs and that had been running at about 8. So there's a little bit of slowdown there. Again, the producers are seeing the benefits of the NGLs there and we're not expecting any further decline there in the Piceance. Down in Four Corners, there are lots of wells tied into that. It's pretty resilient to any kind of drastic falloff. But we are down about 40 wells per year there in the Four Corners. So it's pretty modest and I think the fall offs that we've seen they've been minor but I think those are indicative of what we'll see going forward until we get a little bit of increase in gas price.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Yes, that's really helpful. And then maybe a question for Don. In terms of the equity that you did at WMB, it looks like you entered [ph] a little more equity than you kind of have indicated for the Caiman, Dow [ph]. I think you were -- you said you're going to give out 50-50 debt and equity for the $1 billion WPZ transaction. Can you just talk about that? Is that -- or is it more sort of a defensive move or maybe is it more offensive? Are you thinking about acquisitions or whatnot down the road?
Donald R. Chappel: I would say that on average, our debt and equity mix will be about 50-50. But in this case, these assets were not really cash flowing and therefore didn't really support much debt. So as we looked at our credit metrics, to really do much in the way of debt would have really either caused a ratings -- a negative ratings reaction, or really put us up against being really tight for additional growth. So we felt that was the right thing to do to provide ability to continue to execute on some of the additional projects that we're currently contemplating.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then just talking about the WMB equity again. Would you use that -- similar to this for a transaction kind of related to that. Or would you consider even just using it as an investment in WPZ? Do you have a lot of growth capital you're willing to do? And a lot of financing at the PZ level. I'm just wondering what's the best use of the cash flow? Is it WMB relative to the dividend increases?
Donald R. Chappel: I think to the extent that we have sustainable cash flows at Williams and kind of we laid that out in our dividend slide there in terms of the distribution from WPZ plus very strong distribution growth that MC&O after substantial coverage of both PZ and MC&O, yes, we think it's appropriate to pay dividend with the bulk of that. We see Williams’ currency as being kind of a backup currency. I think WPZ will be the primary financing vehicle for obviously, for Williams Partners. But certainly in situations like the Caiman, we're trying to do more with WPZ, may have put some stress on WPZ. We felt that having Williams step up because it was good for Williams as well as good for WPZ. So we'll use I think Williams very sparingly. That's the only acquiescence we've had in the last decade. But again if we see a situation that really is compelling, it's a tool in the toolkit and I think a real advantage that we have relative to a lot of our competitors.
Operator: Next we'll go to Tim Schneider with Citi.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: It's Faisel from Citi. Could you -- I just wanted to clarify on your Utica position, how much dedicated acreage do you guys have? I see your Marcellus acreage at 1.2 million, but what's the acreage I should look out, in terms of what's dedicated for the Utica?
Alan S. Armstrong: There's not -- we have some what I would say kind of historic acreage dedication that has Utica rights underneath it but we don't have any acreage that we've specifically done after for Utica drilling at this point. So there is some locations back from the, particularly from the Atlas dedication that had that -- had Utica acreage underlying it. But in terms of things that we specifically gone after for the Utica, we do not have any Utica at this point.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, got you. And then this goes in the Rockies, I guess it's been kind of a little bit of a discovery in the Paradox basin for liquids and oil. Can you guys just remind us how you guys are positioned in that basin?
Rory L. Miller: Yes, I'll take that. This is Rory. Paradox is something that I think was drawing some interest several years ago. And in fact, we built some early production systems out there. The resource is definitely in place there. Producers were working hard, including our affiliate at the time to kind of crack the code on how to commercially produce that. I think they're still working on that. So I would look at the Paradox as still a work in progress. We do have some minor facilities there in case things do take off. But I don't see that as something that we're real excited about right now. I think if I was to point to some of the exciting things that are coming out West, I'd point to the Mancos shale play down in the San Juan basin. It's like a lot of these shale plays. It's got 3 different windows, a dry gas, a condensate, wet gas window and an oil window and that's starting to attract a lot of attention. There's a very similar play in the Mancos -- in the Piceance with the same 3 types of windows and there's activity in that area as well. And although this is probably something I can't say nearly as much about, there is up in the Wamsutter area a shale play that's being tried up in that area as well. So as we're seeing these shale plays, particularly wet gas shale plays that are developing around the country, they tend to be in places where there's already production. And what we're finding is that's the case out West as well and there's activity in 3 of our 4 basis today pursuing that kind of a play. So I think we'll have some more exciting things to talk about in the next 6 to 12 months as those place get a little better understood.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then, Alan in your prepared remarks on the podcast, I think you talked about some opportunities in your Marcellus part of the pie to take advantage of power conversions, I think. I was wondering if you can elaborate a little bit about that? Was that coal-to-gas switching? Was there something that -- something else, I'm talking about new buildup of gas plants? And what was it that was opportunity out of your under negotiation of your potential part of the pie?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes, probably I was talking so fast I mixed 2 things there. Certainly coming for Transco, really the 2 primary drivers for Transco right now is serving the producers' needs, getting out in the Marcellus. But as well, we've seen a lot of interest from the market and wanting access to the Marcellus as well for long-term things like power plant conversions. And so I think there's a real concern on the part of the power generation industry about making sure they've got plenty of reliable access to supply us long term. And so I think Transco is perfectly positioned to do that because it can provide access from supplies in the South and even areas obviously like the midcontinent supplies and Barnett Shale and Haynesville and so forth. They come into Transco at station 85 and as well as of course the Gulf Coast supplies. But as well, now they would have access with supplies from the North. And so the power generation -- Transco is extremely well positioned if somebody is concerned about reliability, be it its multiple loop lines right through these populated areas and access, multiple access to supply points. And so that is driving a lot of interest and demand for Transco being kind of the pipe of choice out there for the power generation conversions.
Randall L. Barnard: Yes. This is Randy Barnard. I was just a blurb to add, in the quarterly data book, you'll see a couple of slides in there that attempt to quantify with little more exactitude the opportunities for conversions surrounding Transco, slide 53 in particular. There goes another one in there as well.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, great. And then last question from me. Also in your prepared remarks, you talked about in the under negotiation of potential category, 2 more FPSs. What's the -- I mean how do we look at converting that potential into a firm sort of project? What are the things that could happen or could go against you in order to turn that into a fixed, firm project?
Rory L. Miller: I'll take that. This is Rory. I guess what I would say is that the main competition out there for that kind of a product is the producers themselves. There aren't a lot of people out there right now with that kind of product. And the big advantage is really time to first oil [ph] so it's really around the producers wanting to accelerate their cash flows. We're standing ready with the product that can do that. The producer's option is to self-develop, but they're starting from a standing soft and has a fairly significant impact on the present value of the projects. So we think the financials on the product are very compelling. We've got probably 5 or 6 of those that are in various states of discussion. And one of the nice things about these opportunities is that the producers will make a decision. When they find and make a discovery, and they're probably in the 100 million barrels plus range, with the price of oil, where it is and the prospects going forward being pretty bright for crude oil. These producers are going to make a decision and they are going to move forward. And so we're really counting on a couple of more of them deciding they'd like to accelerate that cash flow and they'd like to outsource that business. And there are a number of producers that are getting interested in that even more so. They don't really get any credit on their balance sheet for adding steel. They get credit for adding proven reserves. And so it works well for both parties. And I think the confidence that Hess and Chevron has shown us in our first sale of a GulfStar augurs well for the additional opportunities for us out there. So just in terms of timing I think over the next 12 months, I think there's a great chance that we can add another one. There's no guarantees on that, but the deal churn that we've got, I think that's a possibility.
Operator: We'll now go to Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
Jeremy Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Well, Williams seems to have a very full plate of organic growth projects to drive growth going forward. I was just wondering if you guys could comment on any appetite for expanding or acquiring assets further down the NGL value chain.
Alan S. Armstrong: Well I would say that we do see a lot of opportunity. And as Rory mentioned earlier, in the Marcellus, we certainly are very aware that in fact even though it wasn't embedded in our economics for the Caiman acquisition, we think that puts us in a great position to be a solution provider for NGL infrastructure in that area where it's so desperately needed. But certainly, the Mont-Bellevue area is pretty crowded in terms of service providers in that area. But we're getting a lot of interest from the petchem side, in terms of providing more customized infrastructure and helping to move product around. You can't really go expanding the ethylene cracking capacity in the way the ethylene volumes are growing without quite a bit of infrastructure in and around the petchem space there. And so we are very focused on that area. So I think we see a lot of opportunity at the far upstream end of the midstream infrastructure and the far downstream end of the midstream infrastructure and are looking at some very interesting projects there that take advantage of our liquids and our production, but help petchems look out for the future where their supplies are going to be coming from. So to answer your question, it's yes. But I wouldn't translate that into thinking that we're going to be into the fray, where there's plenty of players right now in particularly -- in the Bellevue area proper as the merchant during that space. So we think there's quite a crowd there already. And we wouldn't want to butt in to that space just because we don't think we'd provide the kind of margin and return that we expect from our other opportunities.
Jeremy Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: That's very helpful. I was just wondering also if there were any updated thoughts on where the Confluence project stands?
Alan S. Armstrong: Confluence is moving ahead. We, of course, we announced there that Southwestern Energy had also -- oh, sorry, Confluence, sorry, I had that confused -- we have too many projects starting with C. Confluence is a lot of interest from producers in that area. But that area is very underserved with infrastructure in Northwestern PA, both on the gathering side and particularly on the NGL extraction. And that area is very rich with gas. So we like that area. We think it's going to need some infrastructure. And while we don't have anything new to announce there, we're having a lot of discussions going on with a lot of different large players in the area that understand the need for the infrastructure and see us as well positioned to providing that.
Operator: And we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Alan S. Armstrong: Okay, well great. Well, thank you. Appreciate all the great questions this morning. And we certainly are continuing to drive forward and execute. Very proud of the way our organization continues to execute in a very -- in an area that we got so much growth going on but very proud of the way we're executing on projects and continuing to run the businesses very well as we demonstrated this quarter. And so we look forward to continuing to talk to you about some more detail on these projects at our May 22 webcast. Thanks for joining us this morning.
Operator: Once again, this does conclude today's conference. We do thank you all for joining us.

Travis N. Campbell: Good day, everyone. I'm Travis Campbell, and I head up the Investor Relations team here at Williams. Before I turn it over to Alan Armstrong, let me go through a few housekeeping items. Today, we put on our website, williams.com, the slides that Alan will shortly be discussing. You can download those slides for viewing and a podcast of his remarks, if you desire. As always, we thank you for your interest in the company. In a minute, Alan Armstrong, our President and CEO, will review the slides that we have this quarter. Tomorrow, our business units heads and Don Chappel will be available to respond to questions on our analyst call in the morning at 9:30 Eastern Time. You'll notice that all the results and guidance in today's slides, including the EPS numbers, are presented excluding WPX. Be aware that this is different from the EPS guidance given on the third quarter slides. Don't let this confuse you because numbers on the Street have included the former E&P company and results presented today do not. At the beginning of the slide deck are the forward-looking statements which are included on Slide #2 and Slide #3. These are important and integral to all of our remarks. You should review those. Also included are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to generally accepted accounting principles. Those reconciliation schedules are available and follow the presentation. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan.
Alan S. Armstrong: Great. Thank you, Travis, and good morning, everyone. A lot of great information to go through here this morning and glad we've got the context set clear here now . Some of the things I'll be hitting on this morning here, first of all, talking about our 2011 performance, and then I'll work through some of the rapidly expanding growth capital that we've got out there and a lot of the projects that are behind that capital expansion. And then I will move to the guidance for 2012 and '13, along with an updated commodity price deck that reflects our latest thinking about the commodities environment that we look forward to in '12 and '13. First of all though, before we get into that, I want to remind you, certainly, we could not be more excited about Williams going forward and the way we're positioned in what we think are definitely the right assets, great markets and we certainly are excited about the strategy and how that is performing for us. Also, our MLP structure continues to fuel our dividend growth at WMB and allows us to continue to raise capital in a very cost-efficient manner for Williams shareholders and our high-dividend payout expect an increase every quarter now as we go forward rather than either annual or semiannually. We now have laid out our policy to increase that and are going to be increasing that at a rate of about 7/8 of $0.01. And that equates to a December '11 number versus a December '12, will give us a 14% increase in our annual dividend growth from '11 versus '12. So we continue to be very excited about our ability to grow the dividend. We think it's extremely transparent where that growth is coming from. And as we continue to add more and more capital projects to this, we expect to even be able to expand that further. We continue to be very committed to our investment grade credit as well. Okay, moving on here to Slide 5. Great financial performance for 2011, a 37% growth in our adjusted net income. That was $734 million versus $537 million from our continuing ops. Very strong business performance, growing at a clip of about 27% on our adjusted segment profit. And that was driven by a 24% increase in Williams Partners and a 67% increase in our Midstream Canada and olefins. Some of the drivers there, certainly, in the fee-based business, we grew our fee-based revenues by 12% in Williams Partners and a lot of that volume growth is coming from our Marcellus business, as well as our Deepwater business. The higher NGL frac spreads also were a driver for 2011, and our NGL production volumes were up. But as some of our contracts continue to roll into a fee-based business, our NGL equity volumes were flat. So our business is growing but more and more of our revenues are coming from fee-based business. We certainly, on the Deepwater Gulf business, as I mentioned, not only did we see growth in revenues for 2011, but we also signed up 2 very significant growth projects that will come on in 2014 and beyond, and that is the Keathley Canyon project and as well, the GulfStar FPS. And I'll speak a little bit more about that later. Our Gas Pipelines continued to grow as well. And really, the big projects for the gas pipelines, there was actually 4 new major expansions that came on in just during 2011. And most of these projects started up in the end of -- latter part of the year, and about $67 million in increased revenues from those projects. And then again in the Midstream Canada and olefins, higher sales prices really drove a lot of that, as well as increased volumes. But I think probably most important to note is that it wasn't just priced just that the market offered us, but our butane/butylene splitter that we installed in -- towards the last half of 2010 really provided tremendous margin upgrade for us in the 2011 timeframe. So a very high-return project as we continue to optimize the mix that's coming off the oil sands off gas stream. So we continue to be very excited about that. And as well, we had better margins in our Geismar ethylene business and somewhat impacted by some downtime that we had in the fourth quarter for Geismar. So here on Slide 6, we show the visibility to growth across all of our operating areas. And really important changes going on here. So I'll draw your attention to this. First of all, 2011 has been dropped from this. Prior, you would have seen 2011 included here, so you really have to look at things on an annualized basis to get to a more comparative viewpoint. So for instance, in guidance, we went from 3 years now to 2 years and on an annual average basis, you see that increase being up 47% on an annual average basis, moving from $1.7 billion to $2.5 billion here in the fourth quarter. And so some of the drivers, of course, for this, and a lot of this is weighted towards 2012, but some of the drivers here, primarily, the Laser acquisition and then some of the expansion cap around the Laser acquisition, as well as a small portion for Constitution. Both of those additions are included in that new Marcellus slice. Moving to the middle slice then, you can see now we're going from what was 6 years, 2011 through 2016, is now 5 years. And the midpoint on that -- or sorry, the annual average at midpoint on that was about -- a little over $1.5 billion. And before now, that is $2.5 billion and a 56% increase on the average annual growth capital spending for that period. The drivers on this, a lot of which is on the Eastern Seaboard, which is a number of small projects that are in-guidance quality projects, but the capital push is into 2014. So it's out of that guidance period that's shown to the left. As well as a pretty significant increase on Constitution, again, that's shown in the Marcellus slide. And then additionally, we've got some increases in the Deepwater and some increases in the area of our Midstream Canada and olefins, particularly some projects that we have serve, some pet chem infrastructure needs for third parties. We haven't disclosed those projects yet but are looking forward to doing that yet in the very near future. Moving over to the larger pie. Here, you can see this moves from $2.6 billion up to $4.2 billion on an annual average basis or a 62% increase. A number of large drivers here, but I'll tell you, probably the biggest single theme to this is the fact that we're seeing so much increase for demand on Transco along the Eastern Seaboard and the markets there. So our largest increase here is in the Eastern Seaboard pie that you can see there, and you can see Marcellus keeping pace throughout this as well. So a lot of great growth going on. And we just continue to see the demand for our infrastructure continue to drive our forecast for growth opportunities out in front of us. And frankly, we're going to be in a nice position to be able to prioritize to the very best capital opportunities that we have available for us looking forward. Moving on to Slide 7, as we mentioned in our capital explanation and the opportunities ahead of us, the Marcellus area continues to be an area we're extremely excited about and continue to grow a very strong presence in the Marcellus, and particularly, in the Northeast Pennsylvania area, we are making progress in growing out the infrastructure there, really leveraging off of a resource base there in the Susquehanna County area and our key customers there, Cabot, WPX Energy and Carrizo. And we are really excited about how that's coming together. We've got 2 new things to announce. Certainly we closed the Laser pipeline that we had mentioned earlier. But as of yesterday, we also disclosed the Constitution Pipeline project which will provide even greater access for our customers in this area into new expanding markets as we connect into both the Iroquois pipeline and a favorable location on Tennessee Gas Pipeline in New York. And Cabot is the anchor customer for that project, and we will be moving ahead with that project. The size and total capital on that project will be somewhat dependent on the amount of interest we have from other parties, but we are prepared to move ahead with the commitment that we have from Cabot for that project. So very excited about this. And really, this area, we believe by 2015, will have about 3 Bcf per day. Gathering capacity matched up with 3 Bcf a day of takeaway capacity from the area as well. And so this is exactly right onto our strategy of providing large-scale infrastructure solutions to producers in the right locations. And certainly, we think Susquehanna County in the Marcellus is the right location. Moving on to Slide 8. Here, you can see another exciting project that's leveraging off the growth in the Marcellus Shale as well. And this project is really aimed at serving both producers in Southwestern Pennsylvania and Northern West Virginia, and as well, potentially Utica Shale shippers as well. And so -- but the really unique thing about this project is it not only provides producers with access into these markets, it also provides these great, growing markets on Transco in zone 6, 5, 4 and even 3, it provides these folks with access to these growing reserve base as well with actual firm, backhaul capacity on Transco. And so Transco, as you know, continues to -- has been continuing to expand with moving supplies from the South to the North, but those expansions have been coming in such a rapid manner that we really -- or welcome a new supply source from the north to be able to expand our capabilities to serve these markets even faster. So this is not just a supply-based project. It also is providing a great opportunity for our markets along the Transco system as well. And you can see, we would expect this to be in service as early as December of 2014, and we do have an open season out there right now and look to conclude that on April 2. And we'll know a little more about the details of this project when that's concluded. Now moving onto Slide 9, in the Keathley Canyon Connector, and we've talked about this project. Fortunately, I won't spend a lot of time here. But this is a 215-mile project with a gathering capacity of 400 million a day. And these contracts were executed in late 2011, another great accomplishment that we had in 2011. This project will be expected to be in service in mid-year 2014. And I point that out because despite the great growth that we continue to have throughout our guidance period, a lot of these projects that I'm talking about will -- do not come into service in that timeframe and will continue to fuel our growth beyond the guidance period. Moving on to Slide 10, our GulfStar FPS, another project that we contracted during 2011, and you can see a lot of details offered for you here on the slide. This project is going extremely well to date and a lot of the major contracts for the fabrication and installation of both the spar and the pipelines that will tie it into our existing pipeline system have been executed, and are at or below where we expected the estimates to come in for this project. So getting off to a great start on this project and really excited about the degree of interest that we're getting from other producers in the Deepwater as well as they're starting to see the reality of this project come together and the speed at which this product can be deployed. Moving on to Slide 11, moving out West now. The West continues to provide opportunity to us and the Parachute Plant is a great example. It's a 350 million a day cryogenic train, almost completely fee-based project, and it will be in service in 2014. Major customer on this is WPX Energy, and this will really help them lift their cash returns on their drilling operations out there as right now, we continue to be a little bit short on processing capacity in that area. So very excited about what's going on out there. Another thing that's not mentioned here is the Overland Pass Pipeline, and that pipeline, that's the NGL pipeline that comes out of the Rockies and into the Mid-continent area. And that capacity is going to be increased up to 255,000 barrels per day to accommodate One Oak's new volumes coming out of the Bakken Shale, as well as Parachute TXP1 plant as well. Moving on to Slide 12. And you can see here great visibility along our gas pipeline system here and a number of projects that are mentioned. And I'll tell you that the drivers for expansion on Transco in particularly is largely driven by power generation load. And right now, we are pursuing projects. These aren't speculative matters. These are actual projects we are pursuing right now that are requiring an excess of 3 Bcf a day of pipeline capacity. And that's about $2.5 billion of pipeline investment to accomplish that. So that's outside of some of the things that we most recently announced. And as well, I will tell you, in a broader study that we looked at, about 30 gigawatts of new power generation load we expect within about 50-mile radius of the Transco pipeline. So you've been hearing a lot about this for the last couple of years from the industry pundits, but we are actually seeing it come to -- into very tangible projects for Transco, and we expect to be able to grow both our capital investments and our revenues from our Transco business here pretty rapidly over the next 4 or 5 years. Okay, now moving onto Slide 13 into Canada in our Midstream Canada and olefins area. Our Boreal pipeline is a great example of how well our project teams are executing up there. And this is a project that's being funded out of our international cash reserves, so it's not drawing down on any of our ability to provide dividend. And as we've mentioned before, a lot -- all of this Canadian business today is really being held in reserve from a dividend standpoint. We're not using any of these cash flows. But the point, really, of this slide is to show we continue to be able to execute our projects up here very well. In August of 2010, we brought on the BB splitter, and we brought that in below budget and on time. And also now, in Boreal pipeline, expect to be able to say that as well, and we're expecting that to come on in May or June of this year, and that will be slightly ahead of our schedule for that project. And as well, we now are forecasting that project to come in under the original budgeted amount. So great execution by our teams up here, and that's a good thing because we have a lot of remaining expansion projects to build with the next one that will come online will be the expansion for NOVA of our ability to extract the ethane and ethylene out of the gas streams up here as well. And that will come on in the first part of 2013. And as you can see here on Slide 14, we have a little more detail on that particular project. This is the NOVA Chemicals project, and we basically have contracted with NOVA to extract the ethane and ethylene out of the existing gas streams up there for them. And particularly, the first amount of work that's going on is at the Suncor facility. And this involves both some upgrades on the extraction facility, as well as some upgrades on the fractionator down at our Redwater facility. And as you can see here, that project is -- you can see that range of that budget moving down as well. So making great progress on all of our projects up here. The next project here on Slide 15 is our Geismar plant expansion, very excited about what this offers to us from a strategic standpoint. And we've got a very low cost expansion, and we think we're going to be well ahead of the market on most of the other expansions that are coming on in the ethylene cracking space. And we think this is going to be a good thing for Williams relative to the choppiness that we expect to see in terms of ethane volumes coming up in 2013. And we think this project is extremely well-timed in terms of being able to capture the spread between gas and ethylene. And so from a Williams standpoint, we are going to be rather insensitive to the spread between gas to ethane or ethane to ethylene because we'll perfectly balanced here between our ethane supplies coming out of WPZ and our ethane consumption in Midstream Canada and olefins. And so things are going well on this project as well, and we've got a really talented staff and a great operating team there at Geismar, gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to bring this project in on-time and on budget as well. Now we're going to move to Slide 16 here and talk about our perspective on the industry fundamentals that are driving our NGL margins and our olefins margins as well. So first of all, I'm going to kind of go through the general perspective that we have, and then I'll come back and talk about the specific changes that we've made to our pricing guidance. First of all, the crude-to-gas ratio continues to be at record high levels, and we certainly expect to see that in both '12, and to a slightly lesser degree, in '13, as we expect gas prices to rebound a little bit from '12 even though we don't expect dramatic movement. The NGL-to-crude ratio however, is really continuing to soften. We're certainly seeing that here in February and in March, and we expect to see that continue through the second quarter of '12. We may see some rebound, and hope to see some rebound in the second half of '12, as a lot of the ethylene cracking capacity that is out-of-service right now, some of that down time is related to expansion on some of those ethylene crackers. And so we expect to see ethane demand towards the second half of '12 rebound. And then as we move into '13, though, we expect to see some of the new processing and NGL transport and fractionation infrastructure start to come into service in '13. And we -- so we expect to see supplies getting a bit longer in '13 and expect to see some dampening of the NGL-to-crude ratio further into 2013. The natural gas-to-ethylene spread, really, is the thing you need to stay tuned about relative to Williams because we really have that entire space covered with our ethylene cracker at Geismar. And so we really aren't all that sensitive at the WMB level between gas-to-ethane or ethane-to-ethylene spread. In fact, in 2013 and mid-2013, when our ethylene cracker comes into service, our expansion there comes into service, we'll be almost perfectly balanced between our ethane production at Geismar -- or sorry, our ethane production in our processing business and our ethane consumption at Geismar. A very positive thing that we're seeing out of this commodity price environment that we're in is a tremendous demand for infrastructure on the market side on natural gas, particularly on Transco pipeline, and it's driving a lot of demand for power generation loads. But as well, this big spread that we continue to see between gas and crude oil-based products is continuing to demand infrastructure that helps us arbitrage that tremendous spread between domestic natural gas and world crude oil prices. And so it takes a lot of infrastructure to close that arbitrage, and we certainly have seen a lot of demand to get at that. So what this boils down to in terms of specifics for us, first of all, in 2012, we previously had $82.50 oil, WTI Oil, in our pricing environment. We're seeing that go to $100 here in 2012, and we're taking gas down from what was $4.25 at Henry Hub down to $3 in the period. That equates to a tremendous crude-to-gas ratio of 33.7. So -- and that's up from about 23 in 2011. However, the NGL-to-crude relationship, we really are expecting to diminish significantly, and we certainly have seen that, as I mentioned here in the first quarter. And in 2011, we saw that the 56%, previously in our guidance, we had a 58% NGL-to-crude relationship. We're taking that all the way down to 45%. So very conservative on our part, but reflective of a very warm winter for propane demand, and as well, this lack of demand we're seeing right now for ethane due to these ethylene crackers being out of service in the near term. So at the end of the day, we're taking our NGL margin down from $0.83 in 2011 down to $0.78 at the midpoint of our guidance. And on the frac spread side, that goes from $0.91 down to $0.83. So about 9% on the frac spread for 2012. Looking at 2013 then, pretty similar viewpoint, moving a $100 crude oil, and we also are seeing gas go from what was $4.75 down to $3.75. And that gets us to a crude-to-gas ratio of about 27 in 2013. And we're expecting the NGL-to-crude relationship to be 45% during this period. Additionally, our NGL margin is dropping again relative to 2011, $0.83. We're seeing it go down to $0.70 for that margin. So certainly, very conservative outlook here on NGL margins. But as you'll see, despite that conservative outlook, we continue to be able to grow the cash flows of this business and drive our dividend very substantially. And I really think that's the takeaway. We certainly hope that folks are cautious as they look at our growth against some of our peers' growth because we probably have one of the more conservative perspectives out here on this pricing level. And so, despite, though, this conservative picture, a lot of growth continuing in our business as you'll see on our guidance of the next page. Moving on to Slide 17. This really just lays out for you all of the adjusted segment profit, the changes that we expect the capital expenditure, the dividends and the EPS. And as you can see, a very nice pattern, with up into the right here in terms of adjusted segment profit. Our dividend, certainly strong increases there, and our EPS adjusted earnings. So the capital expenditure, as you can see, is very volatile over this period. Really, this is driven by, first, the Laser acquisition in 2012, and as well some dollars that we pushed from '11 into '12 in our capital -- in growth capital buckets. So 2013, you can see that going down. I would tell you, given the amount of demand that we've got for project and so forth, I would be surprised if we continue to see 2013 held so low as we get a little closer to that time and some of the projects we're working on become more of a reality. So, great picture here in terms of the continued growth in our business. And I'll remind you -- and I think this is extremely important, that when you're comparing our growth in these businesses, you recognize how conservative our pricing forecast is relative to what we've seen out there in the market from others. And despite that very conservative picture, we continue to see growth that looks like this. If we were to see this normalize with our -- from our 2011 margins, as a lot of folks are showing, you'd see a much higher growth rate in here. But we are very comfortable with the picture that we have here and our ability to continue to increase the dividend even over a more conservative pricing environment. So moving to our last slide here on Slide 18. As we mentioned before, we certainly have transformed Williams. We're very excited about the growth prospects that we have in the business and the demand for our infrastructure services as they continue. And we certainly very much appreciate the model that we have between Williams and WPZ and the ability to increase our dividends that comes from that. And so with that, thank you for joining us this morning, and we look forward to being able to talk you further about our growth.
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams Companies Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Travis Campbell, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Travis N. Campbell: Thank you, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to the year-end 2011 call. As always, thanks for your interest in our company. As you no doubt know, we released our results yesterday afternoon after the market closed. Also yesterday, Alan, using a few slides, had some commentary about the results, our new guidance and growth opportunities. That audio commentary and the slides are available on our website. So on the website, williams.com, you should be able to find a number of things that were posted yesterday afternoon. The earnings presentation with the audio commentary by Alan, our normal data book with the usual information we make available each quarter, the press release of our results and our analyst package. As usual, because we had the commentary yesterday, this morning's call should be fairly brief, and we'll get very quickly to your questions. In a minute, Alan will -- Alan Armstrong, our President and CEO, will make some brief comments, after which we'll open the lines for questions. Be aware, as always, all of our business unit heads are here, and they'll be available to respond to any questions after Alan's remarks. With me here this morning are Rory Miller, who oversees Midstream; and Randy Barnard, who heads up our Gas Pipelines; as well as Don Chappel, our CFO. On yesterday's presentation and in the data book, there is a disclaimer on forward-looking statements. This is important and integral to our company. You should review those. Also, there are non-GAAP numbers included in the various presentations. These have been reconciled back to generally accepted accounting principles. Those reconciliation schedules are also available. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan.
Alan S. Armstrong: Great. Good morning, and thank you, Travis. First of all, we certainly had very noisy result from the EPS as we spun off WPX. But really boiling it down and looking at the continuing operations, you'll see that our adjusted segment profit versus our third quarter guidance came in right in between our midpoint and high that we've given you for a guidance there, so our continuing operation is performing very well in the fourth quarter and throughout 2011. As we look forward, a tremendous amount of new growth and you'll see that built in to both our guidance and capital, as well as our opportunity pipeline that we continue to project. And one of the -- probably the biggest area of change that we had in that opportunity pipeline was a large number of increases coming from our gas pipe segment as major expansions, particularly on Transco, and a little -- to a lesser degree, on Gulfstream, really start to present themselves as the industry and power generation industry look to take advantage of continued low natural gas prices. So very excited about the way we're positioned in that space, and our opportunity pipeline certainly demonstrates that. On guidance, you'll note a raise in guidance for both '12 and '13, and this is an improvement in our adjusted segment profit plus DD&A of about $40 million and 12 at midpoint and $120 million in 2013. In '12, the drivers there are slightly higher NGL margins, the addition of Laser to our guidance, as well as some offsetting impact of lower volumes in some of our areas due to lower gas prices and our expectation of slow drilling in some of those areas. So overall, an improvement in '12, though. In '13, you'll see even lower NGL margins than we had previously in our guidance there, and I'll speak to that in just a moment. But those were -- are offset in '13 by higher ethylene margins in our MC&O areas, so a nice raise there for '13. And I think it really shows the strength of our portfolio, and a big part of that strength is the growth in fee-based revenues that we continue to see in '11, we're going to see in '12, and we certainly are going to start to see present itself in '13. Speaking of commodity prices and our changes there, what you'll note there is very high crude-to-gas ratios reflecting kind of what we're seeing in the current market out there. We've got gas now at $3 for '12 and $3.75 for '13, and we've got crude holding steady at $100. However, despite that very high crude-to-gas ratio, much as we usually see when we see that ratio blow way out, we do not see the NGL components keeping pace with that big separation. And so you'll see a very low NGL-to-crude ratio in our forecast of about 45%. And that has us have our NGL margin declining from '11 through '13 of just a little over 15%. But as I said earlier, we are projecting our ethylene business, particularly in '13, starting to take advantage of those lower ethylene prices. So -- but despite what I would say is a very conservative outlook in the NGL margin space, we continue to show very strong cash flow growth and very bullish about the way our continued cash flows from both WPZ and our Midstream Canada and olefin segment is going. And I would just remind you, as you're looking out there amongst our peers, making sure you're looking at it on an apples-to-apples basis, we feel like we've got a pretty good insight into the commodity prices. But I think what's impressive is we've got continued nice strength in our growing cash flow despite a 15% decline in our NGL margin, and I think a lot of our peers would be hard-pressed to show that kind of resilience and strength in a lower price environment. So with that, we will turn it over to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: A couple of quick questions. It looked like the Geismar olefin volumes were perhaps down a little sequentially in the fourth quarter. And I was wondering if you could discuss if that's accurate, what's driving that and prospects for the volume growth ahead of the expansion of the facility? And also, where you see potential weakness geographically in terms of gas processing and Midstream as producers pull back in this environment?
Rory Miller: I'll take that. This is Rory. We had a 10-day shutdown at Geismar. We had a problem with a missed pad there and that accounted for the lower volumes there in the fourth quarter. So that's something, obviously, that we're not planning for in '12, so you shouldn't put too much stock in that. Prospects for volume growth ahead of the expansion of the facility, I expect -- or I suspect that you're talking about the major 600-pound expansion that we've announced. We do have some furnace upgrades that are ongoing. Those are being done one at a time. And so we will see some very slow volume growth across the period as those furnaces are reconfigured and brought back up. But the big jump will come in '13 when we bring up the major expansion.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Will we see some downtime ahead of that to prepare for that?
Rory Miller: Yes, we have a turnaround planned, and our intent is that we would coordinate the activity as much as possible to limit any additional downtime associated with the expansion.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Great. And any slowdown geographically you could discuss in the Midstream area?
Rory Miller: Yes, yes. Good question there. I think any of the slowdowns that we're seeing, I think, we already have priced into our guidance. I'll just note that upfront. Out West, we're not seeing massive pullbacks of drilling, but we are seeing some moderation in the drilling out there. We've got one rig that we've just heard of. It's being laid down in Wamsutter, but everything else is still moving ahead. Generally speaking, say, from quarter-to-quarter, we're seeing a little softening in the drilling. But I guess, that -- one point I would make is if we do see fewer well connects for the year, we'll also see less well connect costs. So we think, at least, from a PZ standpoint, any slowdowns near-term ought to be DCF-neutral to PZ, and of course, that impacts WMB directly as we get those distributions.
Operator: And we'll go next to Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Just wondering if you could talk about maybe the cash flow contribution from the Laser acquisition and how you anticipate the cash flow to ramp-up over time.
Rory Miller: Yes, the Laser system acquisition, which I'm sure you've heard, has closed, is being looked at as what I call an integrated system. I think we're, in fact, we're going to be disallowed from using that name shortly. But one of the big values from Laser is it's coming into our complex up there to be operated and run as part of an integrated, holistic system. And so we'll be referring to that area up there as the Susquehanna Supply Hub. The project was, I would say, was -- the purchase price was more like what you would typically see on acquisitions in the Midstream space. We're -- if you're looking at guidance just for PZ, that's probably going to contribute about $25 million of segment operating profit in '12 and about $50 million in '13. That's the net impact. There's a little other noise in there, but we see that as being a nice driver overall in terms of improving segment profit and a big help just in general to that overall complex in the area.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. That's helpful. And I guess turning to the Constitution JV with Cabot, if you can maybe talk about the potential investment in terms of dollar costs and the expected returns for that project?
Randall L. Barnard: This is Randy Barnard. I'll be happy to answer that question. Sorry for my voice, it got a little froggy this morning. The stated investment for that project is around $700 million, actually $701 million, eight-eights if we build the 24-inch version. We've got an open season on that project. Now that may end up leading to upsizing on that project to 30-inch that would raise the capital by another $22 million or so. The joint venture between us and Cabot, us being Williams Partners, would be 75% owners. So that would be our share of the overall capital depending upon which version, the 24 or 30 inches built. Does that answer your questions?
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And then maybe just the expected initial returns on that project?
Randall L. Barnard: Well, we haven't negotiated rates for the project. But they would be -- I would just say consistent with regulated pipeline returns.
Operator: And we will go next to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just thinking about the pace of the dividend raise here. It sounds like with what you're going to hit for 2012, you're going to be above your -- the midpoint of your range, the 12.5%. I'm just wondering if you're thinking you can hit the high end of the range, maybe now that you're adding more of the fee-based earnings from WPZ with Laser and some of the new pipeline projects, or are you still thinking the midpoint is a reasonable way to think about the raise?
Donald R. Chappel: Ted, this is Don Chappel. Again, we'll stand with the range we've put out but certainly, our bias is to target the high end of the range.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. So the mix shift at -- I'm assuming PZ is going to be moving more fee-based here given that you are fairly call it conservative on your NGL margin. Does that change your thinking at all?
Donald R. Chappel: Right. I think we look at the whole portfolio and clearly, the fact that WPZ is building more and more fee-based business, gives us more confidence in support for distribution increases. So I think we're on the same page there in terms of -- we think the outlook is very strong. I think, as Alan said, the business prospects have never been better. So we're adding a lot of great assets. I think Rory spoke to Laser, and that's kind of the early innings for Laser. We think that '14 and beyond are even brighter.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just sticking with dividends, and I realize it's a little early to think about it, but we do have potential change in tax law here coming at the end of the year. I mean, how does that inform your thoughts about capital allocation, whether it's dividends, buybacks, things like that?
Donald R. Chappel: Well, I think it's way too soon to think that the tax law is can be changed. We certainly are mindful of the possibilities. We certainly are educating those that make those decisions, but I don't know that we want to speculate on what we might see or what we might do. But again, I think at this point, we think it's pretty low probability that anything happens.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. The -- you mentioned a little bit about expecting stronger ethylene margins. Can you just talk about what you're expecting for '12 and '13 there? And then is it a function more of lower ethane prices, or is it just increases in ethylene prices or maybe a combination?
Donald R. Chappel: Well, I would say a couple things here. One, most of the driver in '13 from our previous guidance is lower ethane prices. And so that's a big chunk of that. For '12, I would just say the current experience that we have out there is that because there are outages and that's driving these -- on the cracker side that is driving some of the lower ethane prices. But it's also increasing ethylene prices because those crackers are out as well. So we're on both sides of that coin. And -- but I would say generally, most of the driver that we're seeing in a longer-term despite this kind of current period that we're in with high ethylene is really driven by lower ethane prices.
Operator: And we will go next to Bradley Olsen with Tudor Pickering.
Brad Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: I think my question is really kind of a follow-up to Ted's. It looked as though the NGL pricing that you have in the February slide deck has declined over 20% at the midpoint from the November NGL pricing. And at the same time, the bump up for segment margin in MC&O in 2013 seems relatively conservative. Is there any of the, I guess, ethane price decline that -- or anything about the contractual structures that you guys might have with ethane suppliers that would prevent you from realizing all of the favorable impact of a decline in spot ethane prices?
Rory Miller: I'll take that. This is Rory. If you look at '13 and focus on that, we're down about $0.11 on our ethane assumption and up about $0.04 on our ethylene, which is driving about a $50 million increase in segment profit there. That's kind of the long and short of it. I don't know if that's helpful but we...
Brad Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Yes, that's helpful. And then there's nothing in terms of contractual structures. It's reasonable to think about segment margin in the olefins business as really being determined by just -- by spot prices?
Rory Miller: Yes, I think the good news there is if -- and I'm not going to get into a lot of contractual detail on our offtake agreements, but right now, we have a pretty high percentage of our agreements that do have collars on them, and so we're not getting full exposure to that pure spot market margin, which today, is around EUR 40 -- maybe even a little more than GBP 0.40. Most of those are rolling off, and so we'll have contracting flexibility in '13. And we'll -- we haven't made those decisions yet, exactly how we're going to play that, but at the end of the day, you want exposure to that margin and you want certainty of takes. So that's kind of the trade-off there.
Brad Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then I guess just as far as why the 2012 MC&O margin didn't move, that's more associated with the collars that you referred to?
Rory Miller: That's definitely part of it. We've got a much smaller percentage of our offtake that's purely exposed to that at spot margin without some kind of limiting collar.
Brad Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Great, and just one question on the Midstream side of things. As you think about the current low ethane price environment, when you think about some of your customers in the Piceance specifically, but in, let's say, kind of a variety of Rockies plays in the Green River and the Piceance where maybe you see anywhere from 1 to 3 gallons per Mcf on average so not extremely liquids rich, do you think of those rigs as being in danger of being laid down as you think of, perhaps, ethane prices on the Gulf Coast not being high enough to justify shipping ethane all the way from the Rockies down to the Gulf Coast and incurring those transportation costs versus just selling that, the BTU, locally as methane?
Rory Miller: Yes, well, it certainly doesn't help. The Rockies barrel does have a fairly decent percentage of ethane in it. But I think what I would say generally speaking, the lack or the slowdown in drilling that we expect to see, we've already got in our guidance. I think that impact has already been accounted for. I think the uptick or the strengthening that we're likely to see for ethane in the second half of '12 will help. And -- but I think generally speaking, we've got that impact and that effect already dialed into our guidance.
Brad Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: And you don't think that will affect utilization on the new capacity on the Parachute Plant coming online in 2014 or kind of similar deep-cut processing facilities?
Rory Miller: I think that in the Piceance basin in general, there will be some drilling slowdown there. I think WPX, in particular, has already made some comments about that. The good news I think there is we do have some Mancos acreage under contract out there, and that's kind of where I see a lot of the backfill coming and some of the interest building out there. There's some rich gas windows and possibly even some crude oil Windows in the Mancos and Piceance. And if we do have any slowdown here in the front-end, I think we've got a chance to backfill that eventually with Mancos rich gas production.
Operator: And we will go next to Carl Kirst with BMO Capital Markets.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: A lot of my questions had been hit, maybe just a few others if I could, though. And maybe, Randy, on the pipeline side, going back to Constitution, just noting that it's -- it looked like it was sort of an in-service date for early 2015, and we think a 120-mile pipe that could kind of be done in 1 season. Is there a reason why that's taking that long, or am I not perhaps thinking about it correctly?
Randall L. Barnard: Well, the timing, generally speaking, is the whole permitting process and FERC certification process. This would be a interstate-regulated pipeline. So we have to go through all the prefiling, public meetings, all the environmental studies, all the FERC certification and that generally chews up 1.5 years to even sometimes 2. So the actual in-service state that we're quoting on the project is fairly aggressive, believe it or not, from the perspective of the development cycle, typical development cycle of regulated pipe.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Great. So it's really all the regulatory issues, not necessarily waiting for more contracts, for instance?
Randall L. Barnard: No, sir. No, sir. The Cabot commitment to that pipeline is sufficient to anchor the construction of that pipe.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: No, that's great. And then just a question maybe on the further investment potential in Transco on the gas-fired power generation and, I guess, Alan even mentioned to a lesser extent, the Gulfstream. So as we think about that, and you guys have your wedge pie charts over the next 5 years, do you see that sort of developing as far as perhaps leading to announced projects, something that might be nearer term of the first half of that 5-year outlook, or is it more in the back half? Is there any sense of color on that?
Randall L. Barnard: Maybe I would cop out by saying about the middle half. Transco, in particular, is pursuing over 20 projects right now that are largely driven by power gen growth. And it's up and down the Eastern Seaboard. There is a slide in our packets that I'm trying to find so I can direct you to it. Slide 57 in the data book, we've just touted some future potential expansions on Transco largely -- either along the Leidy Line or in the Southeastern U.S. and in Gulfstream as well. All those is because of our view of potential power gen growth. And there's something -- and some of it would be actual growth, and some of it is driven by coal plant conversions. There's over 30 gigawatts within -- of potential either conversion or new power build within 50 miles of Transco. And we could see -- we are pursuing about the equivalent of 3 Bcf a day or about $2.5 billion of investment associated with -- or close to Transco right now. Now I'm not saying we're going to get all that. We're in competition for that, but it's a pretty positive outlook for Transco.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: That's great. And then maybe one final question, if I could, either for Rory or maybe for Alan. And this kind of turns up to Canada and just thinking about Williams 10 years ago. You guys had a pretty large Midstream presence in Canada. You obviously have a growing oil sands franchise right now. There's been a lot of shifting landscape up in Canada, claims to BP assets, Pembina Provident, et cetera. And I guess, my question is, do you guys, with all of the liquids-rich structures that they're finding out there, do you guys see an opportunity beyond the oil sands franchise, or is it more just to kind of develop that key area?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes, that is a great question. I would tell you that first of all, first and foremost, we are going to make sure that we monetize -- we take full advantage of the great competitive advantage that we have in the oil sands area first. And I would tell you there's a tremendous amount of opportunity to not only capture that existing business but to grow that business further and be able to optimize the value of those streams even better. Our BB splitter that we did in August '10 is a great example of that where we're further optimizing the value of those streams. I would tell you that from our vantage point, that a lot of the oil sands operations are fairly immature in terms of optimizing the value of those resources. And so things like hydrogen that is in big demand out there and will continue to be in big demand. Helium transfer, we think there's a lot of services up there that we have a lot of room to grow that business in. And so I would tell you, we're going to seek out those areas where we have the largest competitive advantages and provide us the highest return. And I would say some of those more competitive areas are going to have a hard time competing with those opportunities. Having said that, we certainly keep our eyes open if we think that some of those projects could demand a return that's competing with our other opportunities that we have both in the U.S. and in Canada.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will go next to Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: For you, one, on the gathering side, there's lots of moving pieces with the acquisition of Laser and the Springville lateral coming online and some declining volumes elsewhere. Do you guys have guidance for us on percent change in volumes in that segment in 2012 and 2013?
Rory Miller: Hang on just a second. Let me check on that.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then while you're looking, do you want me to ask the next one, or do you want me to wait?
Rory Miller: Yes, you can go ahead and ask another question...
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: Okay. The other is on NGL market. You guys lowered your NGLs as a percentage of crude. What was -- we all know that prices are low right now. So is it a function of what you're seeing today, or is there something else that's changed in the market that causes you -- caused you to change your guidance?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes, I'll take that second question, Becca while. Rory's gathering his info for your first one. I would say that certainly, the current environment has got us a little bearish on that. But I'll also tell you that if you just look historically, if you look at the gas-to-crude ratio or crude-to-gas ratio, and you realize how high that is relative to historical, there is an inverse relationship, generally, that occurs between high crude-to-gas ratio and the NGL-to-crude number. And so even though it seems unprecedented low number on that NGL to crude, we also are unprecedented crude-to-gas ratios as well. And so if you look at the overall margin, I'm not sure that it's that far out of line. And so -- but certainly, the current environment, the very warm winter that we're having, certainly is impacting propane storage. And propane is just as exposed to that as natural gas is. And so that could be a hangover certainly in '12. I think, '13 it's a little early to call, frankly, and we may be a little bit conservative in '13. But I think as we look for both ethane for the balance of this first half of '12 and propane for the balance of the year, that we could see some pressure there just because of what we're seeing in storage volumes on propane right now.
Rory Miller: Becca, just getting back to your question, and you stated it real accurately that there are a lot of moving parts up there on Laser and Springville and the way that they're priced. It gets a little confusing, too. But I think that the thing that we have given some guidance on is kind of where our total capacity is going with Springville. Right now, we're in the 300 range. We'll be going up to 625, 650 over the course of the year on Springville. Laser is going to be up around 1.3 billion a day of capacity. And then Randy talked about the $500 million in a Constitution project. And we also have about $500 million a day of inter-connectivity with Tennessee Gas Pipeline in that field. So that kind of adds up to that 3 Bcf a day of takeaway capacity. And maybe what you ought to keep in mind is that, that is one of the limitations out there. So producers are out scrambling to get takeaway capacity and then drilling to fill that, evidenced by Cabot's willingness to take the full 500 on the Constitution project. So it does take time to build. I think we exited the year, just say on our Springville assets, for instance, and '11 at around $600 million a day. That will be going up by well over 50% by the end of '13. And the Laser -- the whole Laser story is one that's unfolding. It obviously just started up. So volumes are building there. The earning potentials in '12 and '13 are just a shadow of what they're going to be. So we've got a real strong producer group right now behind those assets, and they're going to be ramping up quickly. Cabot, I think, has been pretty transparent about their plans. This is one of WPX's key areas, and they've been having good results out there. And the Carrizo volumes are backed by a drilling carry from reliance. So we're very excited about the opportunities up there, and I think you'll see these producers working hard to take advantage of that takeaway capacity.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: But no specific number for 2012 or 2013 on percent changes?
Rory Miller: No, we haven't offered that up.
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: Okay. And just one more data point on the 1.3 Bcf a day capacity on Laser, is -- where is it now? Just so we can get some kind of sense of how we can ramp it up.
Rory Miller: Yes, it's a little over 100 million a day now and that's a pretty dynamic number. But we're obviously in the early days of starting that out.
Donald R. Chappel: Capacity of that.
Rory Miller: Did you say the capacity of that?
Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division: No, no, the current throughput. I think you answered it, what I was looking for.
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Alan S. Armstrong: Okay, great. Well, thank you very much. As we said, we think we continue to have rock solid growth, and it's certainly not dependent on a rising commodity price environment. And if we get some of that and we start to see that at the back half of '12 or '13, we certainly will improve beyond these numbers considerably that we've got it guided for. We're very comfortable with what we have out there, and we think this is great growth in both the cash flows and the dividend that we can continue to produce. And so we're excited about what we have before us, and it's going to be a matter of prioritizing all of these great opportunities to continue to make sure we're executing as well as we have to date. So, thank you again for joining us, and we look forward to talking to you in the future.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference. We do thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams Companies Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Travis Campbell, head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Travis N. Campbell: Thank you, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to our third quarter call. As always, thanks for your interest in the company. As you no doubt know, we released our results yesterday afternoon after the market closed. Also yesterday, Alan, using a few slides, had some commentary about our results, the new guidance and growth opportunities. That audio commentary and the slides are available on the website. So on our website, williams.com, you should be able to find a number of things that were posted yesterday afternoon. The earnings presentation with audio commentary and a podcast by Alan, the data book that contains our usual information we make available each quarter, the press release of our third quarter results and our analyst package. Also for your information, the third quarter 10-Q has been filed as well. Because we had commentary yesterday, this morning's call will be fairly brief. I know there are a number of other companies hosting called this morning, so we'll go quickly to your questions so this call should be fairly short. In a minute Alan Armstrong, our President and CEO, will make some brief comments, after which we'll open the lines for questions. Be aware, as always, all of our business units heads are here and are available to respond to questions after Alan's remarks. Here with me today are Ralph Hill, who heads E&P Company; Rory Miller, who oversees Midstream; and Randy Barnard who heads our Gas Pipelines. Also, Don Chappel, our CFO, is here and available. On yesterday's presentation, there were forward-looking statements on Slide #2 and #3 and the disclaimer, oil and gas reserves on Slide #4. Those also included in our data book. Those are important and integral to the company, so you should review those. There are also non-GAAP numbers included in various presentations. Those have been reconciled back to generally accepted accounting principles. Those reconciliation skids are also available and follow all of our presentations.  So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan.
Alan S. Armstrong: Great. Thank you, Travis, and good morning, and thanks for joining us. First of all a great quarter, solid performance and significant growth in all of our segments. And certainly, we're excited that our continued better-than-expected cash flows in our infrastructure business have now provided us with the option to go directly to a spin without an IPO, if we don't see the markets become more stable and supportive of IPO. In the quarter, certainly you started to see the benefit of a lot of our projects that we've invested in the last couple of years really starting to kick in. Really across-the-board, the -- certainly, the Bakken's kicking in for E&P. The Perdido Norte project really starting to pick up volumes and help to fill up our Markham facility and as well, our Echo Springs facility that's now just had its 1-year anniversary of the new train being built there. We actually hit a record in the quarter of 41,000 barrels a day and are now operating a little over that. So you should expect to see more of this to come as these projects we've been investing in continue to kick in. Finally, our business really is perfectly positioned to reap the benefits of this U.S. turning to natural gas. I think you're going to continue to hear more and more about that. Our infrastructure will be very well positioned to help arbitrage, the tremendous spread between natural gas and oil-based products and as well, is positioned there to provide services to get natural gas into the critical markets and provide critical access. We're certainly starting to see a lot of strains on the infrastructure in some of the growing basins like the Marcellus, where infrastructure has become critical to getting the production on. So we're very excited about where we're positioned right now and excited to talk to about -- to you about the quarter. So with that, I'll turn it over for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Jason Gilbert from Goldman Sachs.
Jason Gilbert - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just a quick question. Post the spin on WPX, you're going to be left with the Williams Hold Co. It's going to have very few assets other than the Canadian Midstream and Olefins, and then the ownership in the Emaltino [ph]. I was wondering, what's your ultimate vision for how this Hold Co. structure is going to look? And is there a need for Williams Hold Co. down the line, or could we expect that to be collapsed at some point?
Alan S. Armstrong: I'll take that. Well, certainly, Williams Hold Co. will hold the general partner obviously for WPZ, as well as a large number of units for WPZ. And as we've explained in the past, eliminating that would come with pretty significant tax realization. And so we really don't see much reason for doing that. We also see an ability to continue to incubate and use Williams Companies in acquisitions as well when things aren't a perfect fit. So we like having that vehicle there and there's certainly a lot of financial reasons for leaving the Hold Co. in place.
Operator: And we'll go next to Ted Durbin from Goldman Sachs.
Unknown Analyst - : Randy [ph] from Fangles [ph]. It looks like your CapEx in the Midstream, in Canada guidance, is up a decent amount for '12 and '13. You didn't really lower '11. The first may be a timing issue, but maybe just talk to -- I think these numbers are higher than what they were at the analyst day.
Rory Miller: Yes, I think most of that change -- this is Rory Miller -- most of that change a result of us having better definition on the capital projects. We've advanced some of the engineering on that and those particular projects that are in guidance are in this negotiation tables have been pushed out. We also have in that same set of pie charts the Geismar expansion, I know you asked specifically about Canada, but the Geismar expansion is in those numbers as well.
Unknown Analyst - : Right. So I was asking about the whole segment. So I guess, would you say most of the delta is just Geismar? Or is there other Canadian spend as well?
Rory Miller: Yes. I don't think we've added any new Canadian things; it's really just more of refining the cost estimates.
Donald R. Chappel: This is Don Chappel. I just, again note that on analyst day, we spoke the Geismar, but it was not yet included in our guidance. So this is the first time we've included the Geismar expansion in our guidance numbers.
Unknown Analyst - : Okay. And then if I could just shift over to a couple of questions on E&P. I think your last sort of release, you said you're planning to run 8 to 9 rigs in the Marcellus by year end 2012. You're now saying 6 to 7. Was that just lower rig count just a function of kind of your lowering your gas price forecast or is there anything else going on there?
Ralph A. Hill: This is Ralph. It's a function of a little bit lower gas price forecast and living within our means and also, we're much efficient with our new fit-for-purpose rigs than we thought we would be.
Unknown Analyst - : Okay, that's helpful. And then just thinking about the Bakken, as those volumes come up. How should we think about your, I guess your takeaway there? What kind of realized prices we should expect, maybe discount to WTI or what kind of realizations there?
Donald R. Chappel: We have planned for approximately about a $10 discount and what we're actually seeing is less than that and the last few months is more in the $5 range, but we continue to plan about $10 -- $9.80 I think is what's in the actual data book. And we are at this point through rail, through pipe, through trucking we are keeping up with our production. And we think we have sufficient capacity to continue with our build up of volumes.
Unknown Analyst - : Okay, that's great. And then last one for me. Kind of really to Jason's point was just -- do you anticipate making any incremental debt pay downs now that you're not doing the IPO at the WMB level? Or are you just -- you're comfortable with the debt balances that you have staying there at Hold Co.? I’d just be curious about that. And where do ratings agencies come out as well?
Alan S. Armstrong: We're continuing to look at potential debt pay down with proceeds from the notes offering that would be transferred up from Williams. And we're in regular communication with agencies regarding our plans and again, we expect to maintain our investment-grade ratings.
Operator: And we'll go next to Carl Kirst from BMO Capital Markets.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Actually, maybe the first question just for Ralph. There was a mention, perhaps, of cost pressure going on in the Bakken and that sort of your oil service relationships are helping to hold the line. But I was wondering if you could give us any additional color there.
Ralph A. Hill: Well we've established a relationship with Halliburton for our stimulation services dedicated to us. Also for our directional services, we've also contracted for a whole new fleet of rigs, fit-for-purpose rigs. And we've contracted for a rig moving company, so we've taken a lot of the model we had in the Piceance and applied it up there. So while there are cost pressures, since we were so new to basin we feel we've really started to overcome a lot of those and as that model kicks in, we'll continue to drive our costs down. So there is a lot pressure up there, no doubt. But we feel with our relationships with our vendors and our alliances with them, we'll be in good shape.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Is there anyway to quantify that as far as what your expectation is on cost pressure, if you will, maybe 2012, just over today in that region?
Ralph A. Hill: I think our data book -- basically, we're talking about $9.5 million wells. We initially planned on those to be less than that. Some people were talking about their well costs are over $10 million, $11 million and we don't think we'll see that. So, I guess -- and we'll be able to hold -- we think we'll be able to hold flat at the $9.5 million, is where we are now and we hope to -- we'd like to see that driven down, but we're not sure yet. But we've been able to reach the $9.5 million. We've already got a couple of new rigs up there. We also have the alliance with our stimulation services.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Great. And then just a question, if I could, on Midstream Canada. Kind of continuing to get our arms around it. I know this is kind of a smaller piece of the business but one thing we noticed that excluding depreciation, the operating cost had a bit of a spike. And again, this is small part of the business, but I didn't know if there was any additional color to be had there.
Ralph A. Hill: Yes, we did have more planned maintenance, both in the North and down at Redwater. So I think it was around $10 million of additional maintenance capital that we had in the quarter. So that's probably accounting for what you're seeing.
Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: And then last question and, Alan, you knew it was coming, so just to go ahead and ask it. With respect to the Kinder-El Paso M&A, the things we've seen in other company filings. Is there any additional commentary to add to the whole Southern Union situation or should we just kind of take prior comments as is?
Alan S. Armstrong: Well, I'll clarify but they're not going to be different than prior comments. We continue to be very excited about the infrastructure play here as the U.S. starts to really take advantage of natural gas. And we think that the infrastructure assets are going to play an important role in that, so we continue to be very interested in that and we think we're very well positioned as a company to grow in that space and we'll continue to look aggressively at any opportunity we see out there to do that. So I think you should expect to see us to be continue to be aggressive in that space.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Just following up a little on Carl's question about the M&A environment. Perhaps Alan or Don, a, if you all could take a step back and just talk about the broader competition in the market for assets; and b, the potential impact on your near-term capacities now that perhaps you might have, give or take, maybe $1 billion plus less cash because you may not do the IPO.
Alan S. Armstrong: Craig, this is Alan. I'd say that lack of IPO proceeds has certainly been something we knew was a possibility during this entire period, so we're not at all surprised by that. And obviously it does make a difference, but I don't think it's going to make any strategic difference in terms of what we pursue. But obviously it is a factor but beyond that, we'll continue to look as assets. I think as Alan has said before, we're disciplined in our approach. Obviously it's a market where there's a lot of competition for assets and where we have unique advantages and we have a lot of such advantages and we'll look to use those.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: It seems that most are looking at acquisition as being, if not immediately accretive on the cash flow basis, at least neutral and then accretive very soon thereafter. From a strategic standpoint in terms of the M&A environment, are you all willing to look at things that, perhaps in the first year, may not help with dividend distributions?
Donald R. Chappel: Well I think certainly, there are assets that would be large growth assets in areas that would fit that profile. But for the most part, those are going to be smaller kind of assets that are emerging assets that we would pursue. But we certainly will look to those kind of growth assets in basins like the Marcellus where we feel like we've got great opportunities moving forward and we think we can build a great business there and a great franchise there. So we look at those kind of investments in those areas.
Operator: And we'll go next to Holly Stewart from Howard Weil.
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: First, just kind of following up on the M&A. Sorry to beat a dead horse here. But we did notice, in one of the ETE filings that you were having some conversations to buy some of Southern Union's assets. Is that door now closed?
Donald R. Chappel: I wouldn't say that the door is closed, but I would certainly say sub [ph] has been clear in terms of their position on that and in the immediate term. So I think in the immediate term that may be the case, but I don't think for the longer term necessarily. But I would just tell you we continue to be very disciplined on that, and we think we know what they're worth, we think we're the right buyer for a certain portion of those assets and we'll just see where that falls out ultimately.
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Perfect. And then maybe one for Ralph. Ralph, kind of just looking at my previous notes, I think you thought that Marcellus would get to 25% of production within the next couple of years. You had some delays on the infrastructure side and you've tweaked your rig count. What's kind of a latest thought process there, in terms of Marcellus?
Ralph A. Hill: I think we'll still get to that level in a couple of years. We feel very confident, especially there are -- our results are just starting in Susquehanna because laser's still in the start up phase. But even with a lower rig count, we think we'll be at those levels. I think we're going to be very pleased with the Susquehanna joining, in particular. And our Westmoreland and Clearfield and Centre Counties are also doing better than we thought.
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: If you had to break rig count out today up in the Marcellus, where are those rigs distributed?
Ralph A. Hill: They're going to be probably -- well we'll get to 4 in Susquehanna, it'll be -- it's rising from 2 to 4. And then the Clearfield -- or the Westmoreland County will have 2 but we may move one down from time to time to the Clearfield and Centre County areas. So really 4 in the Northeast area and 2 in the Centre part.
Operator: And we'll go next to Jusco Yellow [ph] with Tallenger [ph].
Unknown Analyst - : It's actually John Kiani [ph]. Can you talk a little bit about your level of comfort or confidence in eventually moving up to investment-grade rating at the Williams Legacy or stub company post the spin with the leverage you see there versus what you would have expected in an IPO scenario? And then second part to that question is, with the spin being what the current plan is, is there a range or certain area of the growth rate range we should expect for the dividend that's 10% to 15% in the spin scenario, based on what balance sheet and leverage you see versus the original IPO plans?
Ralph A. Hill: I'll start with the latter part of your question. Again, the 10% 15% is our guidance on dividend growth, regardless of spin versus IPO. We don't think that, that really moves the needle. In terms of credit rating targets, we're committed to maintain investment-grade ratings. The actual ratings will obviously be determined by the ratings agencies. But we think in terms of business risk and the quality of assets as well as the leverage and the like, we can conserve ourselves to be in a very strong position. But obviously the ratings agencies will decide where they come out based on their own views. But again, we're committed to those ratings. We've seen continuous improvement and we'll see where we go from here.
Unknown Analyst - : I appreciate that. On the dividend growth rate range of 10% to 15%, my question was really does the spin put you in a different area of that range than the IPO would have?
Alan S. Armstrong: No. No, it does not.
Unknown Analyst - : Okay. So you feel pretty comfortable with the midpoint in either of the spin or the IPO scenario?
Alan S. Armstrong: Yes, we do.
Operator: And we'll go next to Kevin Smith from Raymond James.
Kevin A. Smith - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: With laser pipeline starting up, is all of your Marcellus shut-in production essentially online now? Or where are we at within that space?
Ralph A. Hill: No. This is Ralph. Only a couple of wells are online and we have a number of other wells that will be coming online as we prepare our facilities and they prepare the start up. So we actually just are in the process of turning our second well. So we have, I think -- we reported, we think we have about 80 million a day of production that will be coming on over the next several weeks to months as the laser goes to full start up.
Kevin A. Smith - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay, fair enough. Maybe by year end, are you expecting to essentially know or shut-in volumes other than just maybe the normal amounts from joining completion?
Ralph A. Hill: Yes, absolutely. We think will we all -- it'll be normal during completion like you said.
Operator: And we'll take our last question from Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: It looks like Enterprise has secured the commitments for ethane pipeline at the Marcellus. Maybe Alan, if you could talk to how maybe this project would impact the need for blending projects that Williams is contemplating. And also support for the Atlantic access project.
Rory Miller: Yes, this is Rory, I'll take that. And our strategy I think, as you alluded to in the Marcellus, is to actively use blending in the basin, particularly with the pipes project that we've got close Atlantic access. We see that as probably the most cost-effective way to do things but we do have a project, I think we've talked about it some at the analyst day, our confluence pipeline that we are proposing is a Williams ethane solution. And that's something that would build a runway to a more complete answer, be it some petrochemical crackers up in the Northeast or be it an alliance such as the one that Enterprise proposed itself. Getting those kind of solutions up there, we see generally is a good thing. If there's a way to unlock value on the ethane commodity for producers out there, they're going to be drilling more. And as they gather and future processor up there, that's good to get the drilling going. So I think any of the solutions up in the Northeast is just a positive from herein.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And I guess based on your volume projections, do you think there's room or necessity for 2 or more of these projects actually get completed?
Rory Miller: For the long haul? Ethane pipelines, is that your question?
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: That's correct.
Donald R. Chappel: Yes. Well right now, I think one is a big first step, but probably the pipeline to Sarnia. I think that MarkWest is working on is probably the first tranche of ethane that gets cleared from the area. If we get one of these long haul pipes to the Gulf Coast, that's probably a bigger tranche of ethane that's cleared. If you do the math, if you look at the Penn State study where they were forecasting I think up to 17.5 Bcf a day in 2020. Yes, you can start doing the math and you probably could get to 2 pipeline projects, but I think that's a long ways down the road and probably so far out in the future that that's not much of a concern right now.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Any update, I guess in terms of securing commitments for the confluence pipeline?
Rory Miller: We are talking to a number of producers right now. As with any new project, we don't have any definitive agreements signed. We are getting a lot of interest. It's something that, I guess I would say generally is being well received, producers community out there. So we'll report on that.
Operator: And we did get additional question, it comes from Tim Schneider with Citi.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: It's Faisel from Citi. Just a quick question on the -- do you have any well results at all, from some of the activities in South America?
Ralph A. Hill: We haven't done any Vaca Norte [ph], if that's what you're asking. We're doing our standing drilling in our 3 concessions in Entre Lomas, but we do not have -- we have a couple of vertical tests we're going to do in the Vaca Norte [ph] type but there's no other -- they're not done yet, so not yet.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And Ralph, when will all those tests be done, you think?
Ralph A. Hill: We'll do some in early next year I believe. But we're actually kind of monitoring the -- since we have all the acreage already, we're monitoring the progress of other producers and trying to learn from what they're doing and then we'll enter into our program probably at a later date in a more robust program. So we have a couple of vertical wells we'll test probably early next year.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, got you. And then I think previously guys had talked about kind of the target production rate in the Bakken of sort of 20,000 barrels equivalent a day. Where do you think you guys are in that sort of ramp up?
Ralph A. Hill: What was -- in what time frame? I'm sorry.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I think it was 2013 or so. I think when you guys first made the transaction it was something along those lines, but maybe I'm mistaken.
Alan S. Armstrong: I think that was it. I think we would -- currently, we're slightly behind due to delay, with the weather we had, and the start up from all that. But we would expect to gain on that and get close to that level. I don't know the exact date of that, but we feel confident in our production profile going forward.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, understood. And then just a question on GulfStar, you're now with that -- with the tubular belts kind of being sanctioned. I mean, how does that project kind of move forward for you guys? And is there any sort of update on what that will cost and what kind of contribution that could bring to the Midstream business?
Rory Miller: Yes, this is Rory, I'll take that question. Well we had a reimbursement agreement in place with a customer many months before the definitive documents were signed. So the project is well underway, all of the major contracts for fabrication and heavy lift, and installation on the pipelines, those contracts are all signed and in place. We're well on our way, steel is in the yards, things are progressing nicely. So that total cost I want to say is under $1 billion with the pipeline interconnections. I think as we noted, we are still looking at taking on partner for that. So that's probably something that we just want to reiterate, but I don't know if we got anything else on that.
Operator: And we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back to you for any closing remarks.
Alan S. Armstrong: Okay, great. Well thank you for joining us this morning and appreciate the great questions you voiced and the interest in our company. And we look forward to telling you about our growth next quarter. Thank you for joining us.
Operator: That concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2011 Q2  (2011-08-09 09:30:00) =====
Executives: Sharna Reingold - IR Alan Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer, President, Director, President of Midstream Gathering & Processing, Chairman of Williams Partners GP LLC and Chief Executive Officer of Williams Partners GP LLC Donald Chappel - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President Randall Barnard - Senior Vice President of Gas Pipeline Rory Miller - Senior Vice President of Midstream

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams Companies Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Sharna Reingold, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Sharna Reingold: All right. Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Williams second quarter 2011 earnings call. As always, thank you for your interest in the company. As you know, we released our results on August 3 after the market closed. Yesterday, Alan Armstrong, our President and CEO, had some commentary about our results. This audio commentary and slides are available on our website, williams.com, that we will not be reviewing our slides this morning. In a minute, Alan will make some brief remarks, and we will open the line for questions. Please be aware that Don Chappel, Ralph Hill, Rory Miller, and Randy Bernard are all available for any questions.  Please note that all the slides are available on our website, www.williams.com. There are forward-looking statements on Slides 2 and 3 and the disclaimer on oil and gas reserves on Slide 4 of yesterday's presentation. They are important and integral to the company, and you should review those slides. Also included in the presentation yesterday are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to measures included in generally accepted accounting principles. Those reconciliation schedules and related information are included in the slides available on our website, williams.com. With that, I'll turn it over to Alan.
Alan Armstrong: Great, thank you, Sharna, and good morning. Thanks for joining us this morning in such a busy time in the markets. We certainly did experience a great second quarter. Our adjusted earnings per share was up 39%. We are increasing our full year earnings outlook based on the strength of the first and second quarter, and all of our business segments contributed to the gains that we had in this period.  While all our business segments are performing very well and growing according to plans, we also continue to work hard on restructurings at the corporate level to unlock value for our shareholders. As you're well aware, our WPX IPO, which I'll comment on in just a moment, continues to move ahead. And we are moving to a growing dividend company and expect that value to unlock significant shareholder value for WMB. Our WPZ Holdings and our Canadian midstream olefins give us a very clear line of sight to this sustainable growth for the WMB dividends for years to come.  We continue to be very focused on maintaining our investment grade credit and maintaining a very conservative approach to managing our margins within our WPZ segment. And this gives us a very clear growth trajectory and also gives us a very clear backlog. We have a very clear backlog of the great projects and we're very excited about for our future. So we've got great situations. We sit here today and we also have great transparency about where our growth is coming from. So we really continue to be very excited about how we're positioned today in these markets.  And so, before taking your questions though, I do want to briefly address our previously announced proposal to acquire Southern Union Company. But this time, Williams continues to closely monitor the situation and we are evaluating all of our options. We won't have any further comments today regarding Southern Union or the agreement they have with Energy Transfer.  I also have a few brief comments about our planned IPO of WPX Energy. We are ready to go with the WPX Energy IPO so as soon as market conditions are cooperative, we will be prepared to launch that. At this point, we still plan to get the IPO done in the third quarter and full spin no later than the first quarter of 2012.  So as a reminder though, the purpose of our call today is to discuss our very strong financial and operational performance in the second quarter and our new higher guidance for 2011. We intend to keep today's call focused on those topics, and so I appreciate your cooperation on that. We can now open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Just a very quick clarification, if I could, on the WPX IPO, because you just said market conditions are cooperative. Does that mean the SEC has declared it effective? I hadn't looked at that but I just want to make sure that that's not the hold up. It's now just more of your decision on when to go?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, it is just our decision on when we're ready to go. That is correct.
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. Fair enough. The questions from the quarter I guess really were twofold, really, on the Canada and the olefin side. And I guess on the olefin side, you had mentioned that it looks like we are going forward with an expansion of Geismar at least as far as some of the project capital that is now being put into the guidance. And I was wondering if you could give us a better sense of how you're approaching risk management to that kind of project with respect to ethylene prices going forward. Is part of doing this expansion an offtake agreement with someone, or how should we think about risk management in terms of the Geismar expansion?
Alan Armstrong: Sure, I would just first say that remember that on the ethane basis, we're still long ethane as Williams. And so that project actually gives us some hedge on the ethane pricing all the way through the ethylene margins. So as we've said before, we're fairly confident in the gas-to-crude ratio remaining and we're fairly confident in ethane continuing to be a favored feedstock. And ethylene continuing to have strength in the markets. What we're not so confident in is about who makes, who gets what cut of that pie. And so by having ourselves positioned all the way between the gas all the way to the ethylene, we feel like we're de-risking some of those margins and making sure that we're not getting somebody else stuck in between us and the full margin spread there. Having said that, we are talking to a number of parties about offtake agreements. And there is a lot of interest around that kind of project. We already have embedded in that.
Rory Miller: Yes, the other thing I would say is there have been a lot of announced projects. Probably they're not all going to get built, but a number of them can. And I think in terms of the Q, in terms of when this expansion could get placed, we think we are probably in the next tranche to pass it and come into the markets. So we think timing is right, and that there's a window of opportunity for us ahead of the other announced projects.
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: And, Rory, I'm sorry. Have you guys actually announced either the magnitude or when the expansion would be in service?
Rory Miller: We've not formally announced that. I think Alan mentioned it in the call in the pre-recorded reported comments. But it's about a 40% plus increase in capacity there at Geismar. And we're shooting for some time, probably late 2013, for in-service. But as Alan mentioned, that will be going before the board in September.
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Great. And then last question if I could, just on the Canadian side, with the olefins and the upgrader, it looks like more project capital is going to go into the upgraders as well. How should we, in that table we had the project capital, you guys also have been pretty good at laying out expected EBITDA and the like. Obviously it's a little premature at this stage. But should we be thinking about return potential in sort of the same ZIP code as say, for instance, the ethane recovery and kind of the 5 to 6x EBITDA deployment? Or can you give us a better sense of how we should be thinking about that deployed capital?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, I think the returns on the new projects are going to be generally in that same [indiscernible]. It's what we've seen so far.
Operator: And next, we'll go to Steve Maresca with Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Maresca - Morgan Stanley: I really appreciated that you can't really talk about the subsituation you're monitoring. I wanted to offer if I could now one very high-level question. Do you feel -- when will we expect possibly to hear something, timing wise or do you feel you're up against the cost timing wise to either say we're involved or we're going to try and do something, or we're going to move on?
Alan Armstrong: Well, Steve, you know as I said, we certainly are going to be a disciplined buyer. We certainly have exciting prospects for growth and value creation in our existing strategy in executing our existing strategy and our plan to separate off our E&P business as well. And so as I mentioned earlier though, we're going to try and address this call in the second quarter results and outlook. And so it's hard to get into a conversation without waiting outside of the strict script on that so I...
Stephen Maresca - Morgan Stanley: Okay. No, I appreciate that. Maybe you can talk a little bit on just with the weakness recently in oil prices and how should we be thinking about that impact on when we may be start to see switching, or moving away from use of ethane?
Alan Armstrong: Sorry, Steve. If you -- I don't think we quite understood the basis of your question there.
Stephen Maresca - Morgan Stanley: Just wondering if we're going to start to see, with the weaker oil price environment from your vantage point in the midstream side, are you going to start to see a move away from petrochemicals using ethane as a feedstock? Have you started to get indications of that? How do you think about that over the next couple of quarters?
Alan Armstrong: I think we've got a long ways to go before we get into that territory. Remember gas has moved down as well. And so, I don't think we're anywhere near that kind of ratio that we would get to that. We have seen situations where gas oil is at times pricing below ethane a little bit. But it's got a long ways to go. If people started getting on that, it would bring that price up pretty quickly as well. So I don't really see that in this, in the $80 price oil environment and the $4 gas. That's still a 20 ratio which used to be something that we wouldn't even dream of. And so, I think we're a long ways from getting to a point where ethane is not the favorite feedstock.
Stephen Maresca - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then the final question, can you just talk where you are right now on the next kind of several quarters you see some of the bigger bottlenecks on the oil and liquid side as opportunities for you guys?
Alan Armstrong: Yes, and I do think there's a lot of emerging bottlenecks, and we're seeing them in a lot of different places. And I think there's a lot of infrastructure acquired in the field and we certainly have our eye on some of that. And Ralph's team has certainly done a great job of getting their product moved out of the Bakken. But as that field grows, we certainly think it will continue to grow. We think there's going to continue to be a lot of need for a long term permanent infrastructure in those plays, as well as on the propane and heavies. And just general petchem business in general, there's a lot of shifting of volumes that is happening with this increased volume on both the light NGLs, the heavy NGLs and the olefins products. And so we are positioning ourselves to play and what we think will be a big shift. One of the shifts obviously is Bellevue products, to either locations like the Mississippi River markets. And so, we're certainly right in the middle of opportunities like that and we continue to pursue those.
Operator: Okay. Great. Next, we'll go to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Just going back to the Geismar question. I saw that you signed an agreement with Crosstex for some takeaways -- are you locking in any sort of feedstock costs there or is that just more pipeline services and frac and whatnot?
Rory Miller: That is obviously a confidential contract. But it is a way for us, we think, to get some advantage pricing in the river. Alan mentioned some of the bottlenecks out there. We think that that's a going to be a very valuable contract for us, particularly with our Geismar expansion.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay, and then just shifting over to E&P, you said you had 70 a day I think that's weighing on the laser pipeline. What kind of exit rate are you thinking about in the Marcellus as we come out of 2011 and then looking at the 2012, I think you said you were going to run 8 rigs in 2012?
Rory Miller: I don't think we've given specific by area by basin yet, so I'm not sure if I'm during this period I'm not sure I'm allowed to do that. But clearly, we have a substantial amount of back up in the Marcellus and Laser [ph] field is going to come on in September. We also have in the Westmoreland, Clearfield Centre County areas, there's a backup about another $30 million. So I would need to check and see what we've given out publicly before I can do that. But we obviously have said that in the future we expect the Marcellus to grow to be around when 20% or so of our volumes as we move forward.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the Canadian side, you talked a little bit about the sun greater -- the Suncor, excuse me, upgrade or downtime. How much did it actually hurt you from a volume and a margin perspective in the quarter?
Alan Armstrong: It was a pretty big blow from a volume perspective. The good news is the margins were so strong over that period, net-net we were about even with what we've forecasted. So the strong margins definitely helped there. But there's no doubt about it that it's hard to replace 49 days of production.
Rory Miller: It's really as simple as 49 days. We normally would see a couple of days of downtime. So you really could call it probably about half from a volume standpoint.
Operator: And next, we'll go to Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.
Rebecca Followill - Howard Weil: I apologize I did not listen to the podcast with the craziness in the market yesterday but and I know you're going to probably talk about it on the WPC call, but can you talk a little bit about Atlantic access project? It looks like that's gearing up again. And can you talk about cost estimates, time of open season, a little more color on that project?
Randall Barnard: Yes, I'll be happy to. This is Randy Barnard with the Gas Pipes. We've been out in the market surveying the interest in our project and are very encouraged by the recent visits. It's a predominantly a producer-driven project. It's evolving to recognize the different geographies of the source or the supply; also evolving to recognize the different timing of in-service needs for the various potential shippers. Bottom line is we think we could have a project to announce by Q4 of this year. Open season within the next 2 to 3 months, bore outs expiring October for shippers and a month later for ourselves. A possible slippage into Q1 next year, but it's very encouraging right now for a late this year announcement.
Rebecca Followill - Howard Weil: Any ballpark cost estimate?
Randall Barnard: It's in the neighborhood of $1.4 billion. But like I said, it's evolving. We may phase the project and there may be some telescope capacity. So as we refine it, that number could move. The slide -- once you get around to looking at the slides that were placed on our website, you will see that we have categorized the potential opportunities of the gas pipeline at around $1.7 billion. $1.3 billion of investment in guidance, $1.7 billion, if possible. And Atlantic access is the lion's share about $1.7 billion.
Rebecca Followill - Howard Weil: Okay. Yes, I saw the ones over at the WPZ. And is part of that a reversal of flow on Transco and just looking at the slides there's an arrow that points down.
Randall Barnard: Actually not immediately, but as Marcellus grows, the reversal of flow is truly within the realm of the plumbing there. The growth we expect to Marcellus will outstrip the zone 6 demand eventually. So physical backflows may happen. But what Atlantic access offers to customers initially is firm backhaul opportunities into the Transco zone 5 which its fastest growing markets today. I mean, a lot of PowerGen load coming on incremental and convergent from coal. And so it would be a firm transportation backhaul into zone 5, with some secondary rights into zone 6. And that would take their delivery points all the way down to the Georgia-South Carolina border at the end of the zone 5 Transco which would include Alba island as a potential if it's ever reversed and it includes cold point and everything in between.
Operator: And next, we'll go to Michael Karsch with Karsch Capital.
Michael Karsch: Two questions, my first one is on the IPO. If market conditions are not suitable, what could you just go right to the spin instead of having to do both steps?
Donald Chappel: Michael, Don Chappel, good morning. Yes, we could. Again our current plan is to continue with the 2-step process IPO, hopefully this quarter followed by complete spinoff not later than the first quarter but we certainly could change those plans if the market conditions remain challenging.
Michael Karsch: And then I guess the second question, I won't make it specific to the SUG acquisition, I'll ask it overall. If you bought an a company which you envisioned dropping down to WPZ, a substantial amount of assets which required an equity raise at WPZ, how do you think about -- let's just say that acquisition takes some period of time to close, how do you think about the accretion when your stock price could move, your WPZ stock price, can move very substantially between the time you agreed to a deal and the close? Are there ways to mitigate that exposure?
Rory Miller: Michael, I think as a follow-up to Alan's comments I don't think we want to go into the Southern Union example, but I mean, clearly, we're looking at that with every capital project that we put on...
Michael Karsch: Exactly, that's why I asked it generically. I guess what I'm asking is you have 2 structures. If you felt like WPZ stock was down too much, could you just hold the assets for a longer period of time at the WMB level and not feel like you have to issue equity to WPZ level.
Rory Miller: I would just say I think we have a lot of flexibility and the situation is different. And we're faced with changing markets on regular basis. Good news is again WPZ has a good strong base of assets and earnings and cash flows and great growth. We think it'll be a security that investors show strong preference to, we've great coverage. So we think it will outperform the MLP space. But there will be times when it's the whole market is tough and the MLP market's tough too. So we'll look to have contingency plans in everything we do.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Bradley Olsen from Tudor, Pickering & Holt.
Bradley Olsen: You mentioned earlier on the call the fact that as a company, your long ethane and just to kind of hit on that, that Crosstex Geismar agreement, what was the thought process, I guess, strategically when you are thinking about whether to supply Geismar with ethane from a third party versus ethane from either WPZ or from the WPX business?
Rory Miller: Yes, I think looking at that Crosstex deal, an opportunity to see a new pipeline built from Bellevue to the river area or at least to a point that it could get into our ethane system would be a great opportunity for us. Crosstex has got the kind of energy and the will to get that done. And it was way to help to get that project going and help make that a reality. We think that also is going to give us a preferred ethane price on the river compared to the other transportation options. And so for us, it seemed like kind of a no-brainer. They have the will to do it, they had some latent assets there that they can put back to use at Eunice, so it was a very good fit for us and we want to support it.
Alan Armstrong: I would also mention there that when we say we're long ethane, obviously that is at various cleared markets. And so as long as those markets are connected and fairly liquid between the spots, we're not obviously focused on just moving our molecules of ethane into our locations. So it's more a commercial link than it is actual physical molecules. We're concerned about managing.
Bradley Olsen: Okay. As far as the comment that it was good to see a new pipeline from Bellevue built into the region, does that imply that you guys were concerned about potentially being short-ethane in the absence of that Cajun-Sibon extension?
Alan Armstrong: Well, more is always better if you're buying ethane. And so there's been a pretty significant delta and price between those 2 points, and this was an opportunity really to close some of that gap.
Bradley Olsen: Okay. And just jumping to the Marcellus, it looked like there was, on the wet cash, you mentioned that CapEx budget was slipping a little bit in 2011. Is that associated with some slippage and the timing of Marcellus projects? And I guess to that, if it is related to that, if you could maybe just discuss the kind of state of permitting up in Pennsylvania, and whether you've come to an agreement on where Springville is going to enter Transco.
Rory Miller: Yes, just some general comments about Construction in the Marcellus, it is one of the tougher places in the country to build pipeline. The geography there is obviously not flat anywhere across the basin. There's a lot of farming, a lot of human interaction in almost every mile of pipe you build. And so the other thing I would add too around permitting is you have to deal with the townships there as well. So there's another level of permitting that you have to go through, which adds some complexity to it. The area in general has not seen the kind of activity that they’re seeing now, ever. And so, there is a lot of change in the rules, if you will, that adds complexity as well. So it has been a challenge I think over the last 2 years. We certainly perfected our model around how to execute significantly. But nevertheless, things are moving more slowly than we would like. I think it's the same on the producer side as well. Everything is a little more challenging to do in Pennsylvania than it is, say, in the highlands of Wyoming. So it is a challenge, and we think we're making good progress on it. But nevertheless, there's some slippage. It's not any indication of the quality of wells or the success up there, which has been phenomenal so far, particularly up in the Northeast area, all of the performances exceeded what we had in our plans. So we're delighted with the quality of wells, but the construction is the top spot. On Springville, we got all our major permits at hand that we need to get that pipeline built. We're under construction right now. We're clearing right away. We've got the major work going on the compressor stations. We have all of our permits in hand for our major bores that we got to do, some waterways and some roads. So everything that's on a critical path right now, we have a permit in hand for it. So that's moving nicely. We do have a couple of minor issues we're working out on the tie and point to Transco, but we're confident that going to be resolved shortly.
Bradley Olsen: And so you guys are still confident that Springville is a late 2011 event?
Rory Miller: Yes, we're looking at late 2011.
Operator: And we'll now we'll take our last question with Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: I guess, given the potential for a weaker economic environment and even potentially a double-dip recession, how do you think that would impact, I guess, the petchem's willingness to build steam crackers? Do you think that might delay the timing of their decision? And if so, could the market be oversupplied with frac capacity?
Alan Armstrong: Well, that's a very, very complex question, obviously. I would just say, first of all, that the market that all of the new olefin capacity is being built for in North America is not focused in North American markets. It's focused at exports. And so the global economy, obviously, is the thing to keep our eye on there. And expansions around the globe, I think are critical to that. So I do think that obviously, a continued downturn in the economy would have some people backing up. As Rory said, we think we are first in the queue there, so to speak with our planned expansion. But I do think that you'd have people checking and double-checking if we went into another recession like we were in before. There's not much doubt in my mind that, that would be the case. Whether there is ample frac-ing capacity to clear the fractionation capacity that's being built right now, I think it's a pretty complex question. Clearly, the NGL space is building up very rapidly. And there is going to have to be some cracking capacity built to consume that. And so I think it's a great question. I think it's a little early to call that, given the very near-term events we're seeing.
Operator: And that's all the time we have for questions today. I would like to turn it back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Alan Armstrong: Okay, great. Thank you all very much for joining us. Again, very excited about our second quarter. We continue to be very confident in the balance of '11 and '12 and beyond, given the transparency I think we have to a lot of great projects that we think the fundamentals remain very sound on. And while we didn't hear too much question about the current NGL market today, we can tell you that we remain very confident in the margins as they exist today, partially because of how high the margins got at the end of the second quarter and into the third quarter, how high they've been. We've got plenty of room for that to slip down and still be maintaining our guidance. So we really haven't seen the degradation in that market here in the last couple of days that you might be expecting. So we remain very confident about both the third quarter and through the balance of the year and excited about the growth in our businesses and the way those are all executing. And very proud of the way this organization is executing on both running the business, and as well as doing things like preparing for the IPO of WPX Energy. So great efforts around here and great results to show for it. So again, thank you very much for joining us this morning.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference. We thank everyone for their participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams Companies First Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Travis Campbell, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Travis Campbell: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to our First Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. As always, thanks for your interest in the company. As you no doubt know, we released our results yesterday after the market closed. Also yesterday, Alan, using a few slides, had some commentary about the results, our increased guidance and our growth opportunities. That audio commentaries and slides are available on the website, and because of that review yesterday, we'll not be reviewing the slides again this morning. So on our website, williams.com, you should be able to find a number of things that were posted yesterday afternoon. First, the earnings presentation with the audio commentary by Alan. Second, the data book that contains the usual information we make available every quarter. Third, the press release of the first quarter results. Fourth, our analyst package. And finally, a pod cast of Alan's remarks yesterday.  Also for your information, the first quarter 10-Q will be filed today. Because we reviewed these items yesterday, I expect the call today will be very brief and we'll get very quickly to your questions. In a minute, Alan Armstrong, our President and CEO, will make some general comments, after which we'll open the lines for questions.  Be aware, as always, all of our business unit heads are here and available to respond to your questions after Alan's remarks. Here with me are Ralph Hill, who heads up the E&P Company; Rory Miller, who oversees the Midstream Company; and Randy Bernard, who heads up the gas pipeline. Also, Don Chappel, the CFO is here as well.  As most of you are aware, last Friday we announced that our wholly owned subsidiary, WPX Energy, Inc., filed a registration statement related to the proposed IPO of its common stock. Because of security law restrictions, we will not be commenting at all on WPX Energy Inc. today.  There are forward-looking statements on Slide 2 and 3 and disclaimer on oil and gas reserves on Slide 4 of yesterday's presentation. Those are also included in the data book. They're important and integral to the company and you should review those.  Also, there are non-GAAP numbers included in these various presentations. Those have all been reconciled back to generally accepted accounting principles and their reconciliation schedules are also available. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan.
Alan Armstrong: Great. Good morning and thanks for joining us this morning. I'll just very briefly capture the highlights and key notes on what was put out as a recording yesterday and is in the slide material. First of all, we're very excited to tell you we're raising guidance, and this is based on both higher crude price expectations. We are now at $95 midpoint for '11 and '12 crude. And of course, that's still well below the hoard market and current pricing for crude. And current NGL margins, of course, are being lifted on that. And in fact, current NGL margins are actually just beyond the high end of range of what we have posted right now.  Also, we have greater confidence on timing and performance on a number of new projects that are going to add to the balance in 2011. So we are raising guidance for both '11 and '12, and you can see the details of that. We're now at a -- our midpoint for '11 is now $1.55 per share on an adjusted earnings basis.  In the current quarter, we had mixed results to combine and produce a very solid quarter. Our gas gathering production volumes were negatively impacted by severe winter weather, primarily in the Rockies and in the Bakken, with the Bakken receiving near record snowfalls. And of course, low natural gas prices also grows low quarter-over-quarter results in E&P.  However, our Midstream Canada and Olefins segment came through and posted a record quarter that helped to mitigate the weakness in the gas prices. And our Gas Pipe segment also came through with a strong quarter.  As we look into the second quarter, we are very excited about how our volumes have rebounded and conditions are currently very good for tremendous earnings results for the balance of 2011. Looking to the balance of the year, we now expect our midpoint, as I stated earlier, EPS to be $1.55. And we're going to hit now just some of the key factors that we expect to drive this even better performance for the balance of the year.  First of all, our operating volumes have really rebounded in all of our areas. We expect the balance of the year to be much better as the fruits of our labor in both the Marcellus and the Bakken begin to take hold both on the E&P side and in the Marcellus on the WPZ Midstream side. Also, we had some major maintenance to get through in the first quarter at our big Opal Plant, which is the largest single contributor to our NGL equity volumes.  Secondly, new projects that we are expecting. First of all, Perdido Norte project really will be a powerful contributor to earnings in the last half of the year and not so really dependent on permitting out there as much as some continued topside work that Shell is doing on their big platform that feeds both our oil gathering, our gas gathering and our Markham processing plant that -- and of all those facilities serving the Western Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. So we're really looking forward to seeing those volumes start to ramp up and we have confidence in that happening for the balance of the year.  Also, our Transco Pipeline just recently placed into service 2 new projects that will combine to generate over $30 million in additional profits for the balance of the year. And then finally the Marcellus, which is really infrastructure constrained on many fronts right now, will benefit from a lot of work that E&P did in getting a lot of small gathering systems in the field to serve new production in those areas as well as the laser pipeline, which -- and our very own Springville lateral, which we expect to begin in the third quarter. So a lot of things going on in the Marcellus, on the infrastructure front, some of which will directly impact our production and, of course, others that will drive earnings at the WPZ level.  Third, on margins. We anticipate continued strong unit NGL margins and olefins margins. Our current forecast in margins for NGLs are really below what we are currently experiencing, and if you've noticed, we've really seen a nice shift up in ethane and as well as the heavier products continue to provide really record level margins.  However, we also know that things can change pretty fast in this arena, so we are only raising our oil prices assumption to $95 and, we are holding back on our NGL crude ratio assumptions below what we're currently experiencing.  On the olefins margin side, we continue to expect robust margins on this on the back of high crude oil because the rest of the world is really dependent on olefin products that are produced from crude oil, of course, and we continue to see growing demand for olefin derivative products outside the U.S. So we're really -- in the past, the U.S. petchem market was fairly dependent on the U.S. economy, and it's really moved offshore right now in terms of what we're depending on.  We, of course, cannot say much at all about the spinoff of our E&P segment, to be known as WPX Energy. I can tell you that the recent S-1 filing is spot on with what we told you to expect at the last earnings call. I can also speak to the positive impact that we expect to see at WMB. WMB is going to be one of the top interviewed infrastructure companies in the nation, and it is going to be better-positioned than any that I'm aware of in delivering reliable growing dividends.  It will be investment grade and it will have the power of the increasing incentive distribution rights of the Williams Partners GP, and this is going to allow for continued growth and free cash flows and providing -- those will be available for dividends without dilution or financing expenses at the WMB level.  So the clear and transparent growth at WPZ should provide confidence regarding our continued ability to grow distributions at the PZ level, and we have already declared a 60% increase for the WMB June dividend, and are targeting a 10% to 15% increase in dividend for the June 2012 WMB dividend. And, of course, these targets were set before the latest increase in guidance at both PZ and MB.  So overall, we're very excited about the amount of value we expect to generate in the foreseeable future for our WMB shareholders, and we really are sitting at the right place, at the right time, with the right assets, the right experience and a great financial position to rapidly expand our business' earnings power. And with that, we'll turn this over for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital Markets.
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Nice results and certainly appreciate the streamlined version here. Alan, maybe if I can start just on the olefin margins, and certainly we've seen a good deal of new announcements to Dow, CP [Chevron Phillps] Chem, Formosa, everyone looking to ramp ethylene production in the Gulf Coast. And I'm trying to figure out with respect to Geismar and you guys trying to get a larger market share. Is that something where their interests should help where there's more opportunity maybe to find someone with an offtake, or are you finding more sort of direct competition as overall ethylene expansion perhaps, ramps?
Alan Armstrong: Carl, for some reason we're having a really difficult time hearing you, but let me paraphrase what I thought I heard you ask and then hopefully, you can line me out if I didn't hear that right, but for some reason our audio on this end is breaking up. I think the question was around the -- what we expect in terms of the increase for demand in the petchem space and recognizing the new announcements from Dow and Chevron, Philips and some of the new announced Formosa, some of the new announcements on the petchem side. We are -- and I think then another question around what we would do at Geismar. First of all, on the ethane side, I think that we're pleased to see the big petchems continuing to see the same opportunity we see in terms of being able to export ethylene derivative products and having a very low-cost feedstock here in the U.S. to continue to provide that. And so I think it's really going to be a matter of timing in terms of when those facilities come up versus when the ethane shows up. But I will tell you that it is going to take a lot of the ethane projects and ethane supplies aren't going to show up tomorrow either. There's a lot of infrastructure required to get that ethane in place as well. So I think it's going to be a matter of how those things show up.  But on balance, it looks pretty good from our vantage point in terms of the demand picking up with the available supply. And I would tell you that there's also going to be a lot of interim small projects. We announced our own small project there that we had at Geismar. I think we spent $18 million and got a small, I think a 3,000 to 5,000-barrel a day increase in ethane demand there. And there's going to be a lot of those kind of projects that continue to come out and what used to be referred to as refinery tree. We're going to see in the petchem space as well because the margins are absolutely there, and so I think those short-term kind of increases that people can squeeze out of their facilities, they're going to be doing. So I think -- hopefully that answered your question. I apologize, we couldn't quite hear it on this end.
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Mainly, I was trying to figure out if the increase from the big petchem guys would be an opportunity for Geismar, i.e, they would be an offtake of Geismar or if its direct competition to Geismar.
Alan Armstrong: Those plans really are, at least what's been announced for the most part, is direct competition with Geismar, in terms of producing ethylene. But I would tell you that beyond the ethylene, obviously, is derivatives like polyethylene and ethylene oxide, ethylene glycol, and those derivatives are a lot less capital intensive. The facilities required for that are a lot less capital-intensive, and we're pretty well-positioned there at Geismar. There's a lot of growing derivative demand there at Geismar, and we're very well-positioned to be able to deliver against that. And we certainly have a lot of conversations going with folks that are wanting to expand the offtake there.
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Great, and then one other question if I could, just with respect to natural gas liquids production. I know there was a mention of a keep-whole contract that shifted a percent of proceeds, so I could understand why your equity production may have been down slightly, but from sort of the gross NGL has produced, I was surprised to see that sequentially off from fourth quarter and didn't know if you could maybe comment as to where you saw that going for the rest of the year.
Alan Armstrong: I'm going to have Rory Miller take that one, Carl.
Rory Miller: Carl, that's true, we are down first quarter. Other than the Exxon contract -- excuse me, some of the contracting issues that we had out there, that's a big part of the step down in production. But the other items, I would say, were our severe winter weather. We were down significantly at Opal in our volumes, Echo Springs and in Four Corners. So that had a pretty big impact on our total production and of course, our equity and NGL balance as well. We also had some major maintenance that was underway at Opal, and that's has been finished. And so we expect to see volumes in the second quarter back on the growth trajectory that we had planned and we forecast.
Operator: For our next question, we'll go to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: First question is just on some of your Canadian spending. You talked about additional upgrade or processing, potentially adding a lot more project spending there. You've identified some spending. But I'm just wondering if you would expect to see the same returns on that or what the variability might be on the returns if you were to add on some of that greater processing?
Alan Armstrong: The opportunity is there and/or returns there probably will remain the same. I will tell you that I would kind of put them into maybe 4 different baskets of opportunities up there. And if you'll look at our slides, I think it's Slide 18 in our package, you'll see there we've got some of the segment profit, first year segment profits of those projects versus the capital shown there. And you'll see, for instance, the first category I would put as an optimization project, like our BB splitter, and you'll see there that's about a 3x cash flow kind of project. We invested $52 million, and our range is $15 million to $20 million in segment profits for the first year there. And so those kind of projects will be very high returns like that. The Boreal pipeline you'll see is quite a bit lower return, and part of that is just because we were building for capacity for the future, and all you see there is just the first-year volumes before these additional projects come on. But I would expect those kind of projects to be in the low teens kind of returns for those pipeline kind of projects. And then the upgrader projects, where we actually are going in and building new upgraders, will be a matter of negotiation but are driven by a very high propylene margins. So there's quite a bit of opportunity there for us to capture, and it really boils down to how much we share with the upgrader. And we're in very good competitive position there in that we've got the pipeline now and the fractionator there at Redwater. But those would be probably in the high teens kind of returns. And then the ethane recovery project that we did with Nova, not going to comment on that in terms of where that return is, but you can see what we expect for our first-year profit on that versus the capital investment on that. And you'll see that's about a little over a 5 multiple in terms of what we're getting from that project. So I think that gives you a pretty good range of our expectations in that area, and we're certainly anxious to get more of that business up there.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And then my other question was just -- if you look the dividend at WMB, and I appreciate the language that you expect strong increases beyond 2012. You raised the guidance at WPZ. Olefins and Canada are all doing well, so there's a lot of cash that's going to be coming out of WMB. I'm just wondering if you can comment on where you might see the growth in the dividend, whether it's even higher even in 2012 or as we go past 2012.
Donald Chappel: Ted, this is Don Chappel. I'll take a stab at it first here, again. A lot of the upgrade in our guidance is related to very strong commodity price, and we certainly don't count on that when we set WPC distribution and count on that for our Williams' dividends. So we really look at a much lower price margin environment as we think about WPC distributions and the Williams' dividend. So that would really guide our thinking, but even at that level, I think the 10% to 15% that we provided for guidance in '12 and strong growth beyond is still, we believe, is a conservative view of what we can accomplish. So we'll continue to look at it. We certainly appreciate that our stock price will, in large part, be driven by our ability to pay an increase of dividend, and we'll remain very focused on that. So I'd say, stay tuned beyond that.
Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: So I guess -- and it's probably early to talk about this. If you did have, let's say, excess returns on margins for, let's say the next couple, 3 years, would you then flip over to a buyback, or what would you do with the excess cash?
Donald Chappel: Ted, I think stock buyback would certainly be in the cards. I think, again, we're blessed with a lot of very attractive investment opportunities, so I think it'll be continuously weighing the potential reinvestment opportunities versus stock buyback. And again, if it was a more sustainable cash flow stream, and then dividend would be the likely outcome.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Next we'll go to Tim Schneider with Citi.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc: It's Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Alan, on the -- going back to the Canadian business for a second. How do you guys go about capturing some of the existing barrels in operation in Canada? You guys have put together this slide where you show the barrels that you guys are currently recovering right now in the midst of the NGL and olefins volumes in Canada, and the future barrels that are coming online. But there's this large kind of yellow sliver that still can be captured. What's your status in negotiation in kind of capturing some of those barrels and moving some of those projects forward and where are you in that timeline?
Alan Armstrong: Yes. Great, great question, Faisel. That yellow is -- basically represents the barrels from the existing upgraders as you picked up on, which is CNRL and Syncrude. And we're pretty far along. These are big projects and complicated and things don't move real briskly on that front, but we're confident in ultimately the liquids being lifted from those streams. It really doesn't make any sense at all not to because it produces higher emissions in the air, which is obviously a critical issue as well. There's a tremendous amount of value being burnt there as that gas today is being consumed in boilers. So there's a real big opportunity to get that and then the real question just boils down to who gets it and extracts it.  So I have great confidence in that yellow being captured. And I would just tell you, I think we are very well-positioned to capture that, and negotiations are ongoing on both fronts. I would tell you the CNRL negotiations are ahead of the Syncrude negotiations. That's about as much as I can care to share with you on that at this point.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc: And can you give us an update on your kind of your dry-tree spar product in the deep gulf, and where are you with negotiation with customers on that particular product for that solution?
Rory Miller: This is Rory Miller. I'll take that question. That's actually a wet-tree spar that we're calling GulfStar project. I think there was an announcement that came out last week from Gulf Marine that mentioned they'd entered into an agreement with us to build a spar hole in the Gulf of Mexico, and that is correct. We have a letter of agreement signed with a couple of producers in the Gulf. We are not at liberty right now to reveal who those players are, but that is in place. The letter of agreement includes a reimbursement provision, so we can start spending money today on long lead-time items on major construction contracts and pipe contracts in anticipation of signing definitive agreements. We're looking at probably a third quarter signing of those definitive agreements. So that is moving ahead. That would be our first GulfStar project. I think we mentioned the last call the connection pipeline, those are around $1 billion a piece. And on this particular project, we're looking at bringing in a JV partner, so I think in all the guidance numbers that we're giving, the capital is about half of that number. So that project has been in the works for a long time. We've been able to get much of the engineering, much of the design work and much of the critical thinking done on that product done ahead of time so that we're not parallel-pathing a lot of engineering and construction at the same time. So we think that's going to reduce a lot of the construction risk on that project, and we're very excited about that. So in terms of more details, though, as to the counterparties, that's probably going to be more of a third quarter type of announcement.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc: And I wonder if I could ask a question on the E&P operation, is that a possibility? Or is that kind of off limits right now?
Rory Miller: Go ahead and ask your question.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc: I was wondering if you could kind of give us an update on what's going on with Apco Oil and Gas? Kind of what's going on with the operations there? What kind of opportunities do you see down in South America, specifically in Argentina, that seems to be a lot of the focus right now in terms of resource potential. I'm just trying to get our guys' idea of how that is taking place.
Ralph Hill: This is Ralph. Well, we've got several things we're doing. Obviously, we're with Apco and the Entre Lomas concession. We continue to do well in our major concessions down there, which is the Entre Lomas, the Bajada del Palo, and Agua de Marga. We also are in the process of testing some recompletion in that area of the Bakken Norte Shale, and we're just in the early stages of that. It's an old vertical well that we're testing, and we have a substantial amount of acreage that is exposed to the Bakken Norte and we look forward to continue to test that acreage as we move through. Early on, we'll just be testing some vertical wells in the Gulf, and then we'll do some horizontal drilling also as we find areas that we like.
Operator: Next we'll hear from Holly Stewart with Howard Weil.
Holly Stewart: First, couple of questions for Ralph. Ralph, the Marcellus volumes are, I think, still a little bit light. Can you just walk us through the infrastructure constraints? Is it just the laser pipeline? And then maybe some specifics on where those 5 rigs are currently working right now?
Ralph Hill: Holly, basically it's a combination of waiting on laser and also some waiting on infrastructure in the Westmoreland and Centre Counties. And those, the Westmoreland and Centre County are in the process -- they will be fixed here, most of that, in the very near future. So about half of our 30-some wells that we're waiting on completion are in that area, so we look forward to those coming on. In fact, had 2 wells come on in what's called a U-shack area just over the weekend. So we do believe, as we said in the -- on our slides that production should ramp up rapidly as we alleviate the concerns of the transportation, particularly the laser pipeline comes on it. I think we put that we would have a total volumes -- and just Susquehanna by the end of the year is 70 million a day, so we look for a rapid ramp up. Our wells, our rigs right now are operating in the -- 1 in Susquehanna and the others are -- 1 in Columbia County and the Geismar and Westmoreland, Centre and Clearfield Counties.
Holly Stewart: Is there like a well backlog number that you have? Maybe a number of wells that has been drilled and not frac-ed or drilled and just awaiting hook up that we can kind of continue to model this ramp?
Ralph Hill: Yes. We have about a total of, I believe, 25 wells that are waiting on completion and have a total of -- in the 30s. They're waiting on either -- in addition to completion on our pipeline facilities. So when I say waiting on completion, even if we completed them, there's a lot that we have to do on the facility side. So the total backlogged wells is currently 31 wells.
Holly Stewart: And then just maybe a bigger picture question for Alan. Do you guys have an internal forecast at this point of what you expect the ramping ethane supply, say maybe between now and 2014?
Alan Armstrong: We don't have a specific number. We watch that and we watch that balance very closely, but we do not have a specific volume forecast for that, so the answer to your question is no. I would tell you that we remain pretty confident in -- as I said earlier, in the creep that will go on in all of these facilities that are either heavy crackers, continuing to convert to light, and there's still a lot of efficiency being gained in that area. And I think we'll see that for the next couple of years. And again, as I mentioned, projects like our own at Geismar. And so I think we'll continue to see that, and then I think those big projects in the 3 to 4-year timeframe, those big projects will start to kick in. Some of those projects that have been announced are very large-scale projects and will take a long time.  In between those 2 things, there's also going to be I think expansions to existing facilities that will be rather significant. And I think the current margin environment and the confidence in crude to gas right now is going to continue to have people investing in that space as well. And so I think it's rare that we have on the ethane and ethylene side, ethylene cracking, it's rare that we see the 2 things build at the same time. But because the margins in this environment, the margins are so strong in both spaces, I think we'll continue to see the ethane supplies build, and I think we'll continue to see the ethane cracking capabilities build as well. And there may be a few rocky steps here and there, but right now the trajectory looks pretty good.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good quarter. A couple of quick questions about de-risking from a commodity risk standpoint. Alan, you've been talking for some months about the possibility of finding long-term ethane off-takers with the petrochems, but in some of the more recent earnings calls, industry peers kind of commented something similar to what you've just said that, that it's not overly tight, it's not overly loose, but the petrochems see sufficient supply at this time with no immediate need for long-term bilateral contracting. Can you comment on this and whether you see a different line of thinking from the petrochems as some of them contemplate some of these larger greenfield construction projects of worldscale crackers.
Alan Armstrong: I certainly think the folks that we talk to, and of course, we have our own vantage point via our own petchem space there. But I certainly think that the investors in that space recognize that there's very high margins right now available to them, and I think they are leery of seeing the demand get overheated in the space right now. And so, if I can just tell you folks that we continue to talk to and continue to work towards some structured arrangements like that are obviously very concerned about long-term supplies. And I think the effort that I think is the smart decision for the industry to look at is to look to the total pie between gas and crude, and that comes back to gas to polyethylene or other ethylene derivatives. And to figure out how they can assure themselves a portion of that margin that allows them to invest in infrastructure going forward that's got more stable earnings behind it, rather than a winner and a loser across that chain but figuring out how that margin can be shared in a way that allows both parties to invest going forward in a very adequate return that exists out there. And I hope, I certainly think, that the current margin environment in both those sectors doesn't lead to arrogance that will cause people to forget the past. And certainly right -- I know the folks we're talking to, anyway and are interested in working with, I don't think that's the case.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: In terms of the timeline, I think last call or the one before, you may have mentioned that it certainly wouldn't be before second half of this year, possibly into early next year that we see some long-term agreement if it came. Is that timeline still there or is it maybe being pushed out a little bit?
Alan Armstrong: I would say we're up against those discussions, and it's kind of hard to call the counterparties' moves on those. I can tell you there's nothing imminent at this point in time, and we would certainly have liked for it to be there, but there's nothing imminent at this point in time. But again, I think the motives are strong for the players, and we'll continue to push in that direction. Obviously, one of the options we have is to do similar arrangements with our own ethylene cracking and look to margin sharing at the MB level and so those are the kind of things that keep us from being too soft in our negotiations is our ability to do it ourselves there at our Geismar facility.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Understood. And last question, given the international demand and competitive global pricing versus global opportunities in the olefin space, do you have the ability to de-risk pricing volatility for the Olefins business as well?
Alan Armstrong: You know, that's starting to be explored by folks. You're starting to see a lot of people that are exploiting their contacts in India and China and places like that where the demand continues to grow and so I would keep tuned to that space. That's a great question and I'll tell you that's where a lot of the air traffic is right now is between India and China in the petchem space and a little bit of South America as well with people wanting to make sure that they can shore up those markets and have some risk reduction in those forward-looking markets out there. So there is a lot going on but it's brand-new and most of those -- a lot of that buyers on that end aren't used to doing these longer-term structured contracts so even though there's a desire and a need there, there really hasn't been a blueprint there in the past. So there's some new ground being broken in that area but you're spot on with kind of where the thinking is going in that area.
Operator: Your next question will go to Kingston Capital, Christoph Seifert [ph].
Unknown Analyst - : First question relates to the Midstream Canada business. It saw the $111 million in gross profit and obviously, the volumes coming out of Geismar are a lot higher than out of Canada. But just wondered if you could have named just in general rough numbers how much the gross profit is from Canadian propylene versus Canadian NGLs and versus Geismar.
Rory Miller: Yes, this is Rory. You're breaking up a little bit there. But I think what I heard is that you were looking at the breakdown between the Canadian and the Geismar plant. Is that correct?
Unknown Analyst - : Yes, exactly.
Rory Miller: I don't think we're -- we didn't include that in the book and I think at this point we're not prepared to provide that. We've got a small number of contracts at this point and we feel like that's probably a little too much transparency.
Unknown Analyst - : Okay. Maybe just kind of directionally then on how margins compare at -- just very broadly between an ethylene cracker on the Gulf Coast and on the Canadian Olefins business.
Rory Miller: I think there is a Slide in here that does a pretty good job of that. It's titled, "The Canadian Operations Focusing Feedstock Cost Advantage." And that's in the floor. It kind of shows the difference between the margin processing the off gas up in Canada versus buying ethane and cracking it, which is the business that we're doing down at Geismar. So the total uplift is about -- and this is a rough estimate, about 2/3 -- well not -- let's say a 150% better than what we would see down in Geismar.
Unknown Analyst - : Okay. And then with respect to the growth in Canada, do you expect that it'll be able to fund itself or do you need to divert cash from WMB to pay for it?
Rory Miller: The business up there, as you can see by the numbers, is performing really well. I think at this point our cash demands aren't going to be totally funded by cash flow up there, but a very large portion of it is going to be paid out of current earnings. We also have some offshore accounts that we'll use to fund international investments like Canada. And so for the most part, we think we're going to be able to handle that load with dollars that probably wouldn't be available for the dividends anyway.
Unknown Analyst - : I guess just lastly maybe a broader question related to WPC and the coverage ratio, I just wondered if you could comment broadly how you see that evolving over time and I think maybe that excess cash at PZ because you set the dividend based on lower commodity assumption. If you'd do a special dividend or do you continue to fund your growth through stock and debt at PZ as you've historically done.
Donald Chappel: This is Don Chappel. I would say that we just don't foresee a situation in which it's likely that PZ is going to build cash. Since we have such abundant growth opportunities, I think the excess earnings will just be reinvested, which will reduce our needs to go to the capital markets to raise capital at PZ. So I would say with the high margins, PZ becomes more self-funding, not to say that the plan won't require outside financing but all that excess cash to the extent that it's at a level -- it's based on margins that are at a level that we don't think are prudent to build into distributions will just be reinvested so we don't see idle cash sitting at PZ at all.
Unknown Analyst - : And then with respect to whatever your view is on normalized commodity margins, what kind of distribution ratio or coverage ratio rather do you think is appropriate to target at PZ over time?
Donald Chappel: I'd say it's a function of business mix and we're continuing to slowly add more and more key business in the Midstream business. Not to say that we're not adding commodity exposure as well, but proportionately, we're adding -- focused on adding a bit more on the fee side than we are on the commodity side. So we would expect our Fee business to creep as a percentage of the total, which will enable us to, over time, have a lower coverage margin. Then it's a function of how comfortable are we with margins. So I think it depends where we are in the range and at what moment in time but we'd certainly like to see that drift down. I think right now, we're kind of looking at a kind of 1.2x coverage under something that might have been more like the beginning of the year margins versus what we're seeing today.
Operator: Next we'll go to Harry Mateer with Barclays Capital.
Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital: I think it relates to the prior questions on usage of cash, but can you just talk about what you view as the optimal capital structure up at the WMB level? I think given all the cash you have coming in there, you could certainly take out a lot of debt, and I know, you've stated publicly, you do you plan to take out debt. How much debt reduction should we be thinking about versus other uses of cash up at the WMB entity?
Donald Chappel: Craig, I don't think we want to speak our thoughts on that given that we have some pending transactions including the WPX transaction. But I would say again, we're targeting capital structure that would put us at that BBB minus level, so investment grade, with PZ being a bit higher as we announced back in February. And the ratings agencies gave some guidance on as well. So that's the capital structure and I think you can probably do the modeling to figure out what band that puts us in.
Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital: And in terms of other uses of cash...
Donald Chappel: We'll be more clear on that after the IPO.
Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital: Okay, and then in terms of other uses of cash, are acquisitions possible at WMB in the future? How should we think about other calls on cash down the road besides just a high dividend yield?
Donald Chappel: I would say that acquisitions are possible, but certainly they'll be competing against a very clear and transparent dividend value uplift, but nonetheless, again, we think that we have plenty of opportunities or potential opportunities, at least, to look at. But right now, we have nothing particular in our sights other than some modest investment opportunities around the U.S. Olefins business.
Operator: It does appear that there are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the conference over to Alan Armstrong for any additional or closing remarks.
Alan Armstrong: Okay, well great. Well, thank you for the great questions this morning and appreciate the folks tuning in and being prepared from the information we put out last night. We look forward to your feedback on this different format and see if that was helpful to you or not. And so I just want to, again, say thanks for your interest in the company. We're very excited about where we're positioned right now, really across all front, and are looking forward to being a little more transparent with you, obviously, once the WPX Energy IPO is concluded and we'll be in a position to be a lot clearer around dividend and corporate structure at that point. So with that, thank you, and have a great day.
Operator: Once again, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you again for your participation.

Executives:  Travis Campbell – Head, IR Steve Malcolm – Chairman, President and CEO Alan Armstrong – President, Midstream Gathering & Processing Ralph Hill – President, Exploration and Production Don Chappel – SVP and CFO Phil Wright – President, Gas Pipeline
Analysts:  Craig Shere – Tuohy Brothers Investment Research Lasan Johong – RBC Capital Markets Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs Carl Kirst – BMO Capital Markets Jonathan Favreau – Wells Fargo Securities Steve Maresca – Morgan Stanley Faisel Khan – Citi Holly Stewart – Howard Weil Incorporated Kevin Smith – Raymond James Yves Siegel – Credit Suisse
Operator: Please stand by, we’re about to begin. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams Companies’ Q3 2010 earnings release conference call. At this time for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Travis Campbell, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Travis Campbell: Thank you and good morning, everybody, and welcome to our Q3 call this morning. As always, thanks for the interest in the company. Steve Malcolm, our President and CEO, is going to review a few slides that we have prepared for this morning, but be aware though, as always, all of our business unit heads – Alan Armstrong, Ralph Hill, Phil Wright – as well as Don Chappel, the CFO, are here in the room ready for questions that we’ll take after Steve’s remarks. This morning on our website, Williams.com, you should be able to find the slides, the data book, the press release which were all issued this morning. The Q3 10Q will also be available today and you’ll be able to access that on the website as well. At the beginning of the slide deck are the forward-looking statements and the disclaimer on oil and gas reserves. Those are both very important and integral to the remarks, so you should review those. Also there are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to generally accepted accounting principles. Those schedules are available and they follow the presentation. So with that I’ll turn it over to Steve.
Steve Malcolm: Thank you, Travis. Welcome to our Q3 earnings call and thanks for your interest in our company. Let’s just dive into the slides. Slide 5 shows the key financial results. Of course adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations is $0.22 for the Q3; year to date of $0.86 is 28% higher than 2009. Our 2010 through ‘12 earnings guidance is relatively unchanged. We’ll go into some of the tweaks that we’ve made here a little later. And we did record a $1.7 billion non cash impairment due to the recent decline in natural gas prices. Slide 6 please. Some of the major highlights from the quarter. We did reach agreement to sell our Piceance Basin gathering and processing assets to WPZ. I have a slide later that goes into more detail on that transaction. Secondly, we’re very excited about the progress that we’re making to grow out businesses in the Marcellus Shale, and let me just offer some color on that. In the E&P space, we’re now operating three rigs. That number will be increasing to six by the Q4 of 2011. Current returns are greater than 30%. We have seen and expect significant continued improvements as Williams becomes operator and as we proceed with the large Susquehanna drilling program. As you know, we now have 100,000 net acres at an average cost of less than $7000 an acre, gross production near 20 million a day at the end of the Q3 and the Westmoreland County Slavic Trust wells have been the best performing to date. As well, good growth in the mid-stream space. We’re rapidly expanding the Laurel Mountain mid-stream gathering system. Projects there will ultimately provide over 1.5 Bcf a day of gathering capacity, and 1400 miles of gathering lines including 400 new miles of large diameter pipe. As well construction has begun on our Shamrock Compressor Station, where we’ll have an initial capacity of 60 million a day, but is expandable to 350 million a day. And that Shamrock Station will likely be the largest central delivery point out of the Laurel Mountains System. As well we have the Springville System and we now have all of the right of way. We expect to begin construction in the Q1 of 2011, in service in 2011. And given the demand from customers we’ve upped the project size from a 20-inch to a 24-inch diameter pipeline. So a lot of really exciting things going on in the Marcellus. Moving back now to talk a little bit more about the highlights on the slide. We did close and finance the Overland Pass pipeline transaction, and there was strong demand for the WPZ share offering. We did complete the restructuring transaction with the PZMZ merger. We’re prepared for a November startup of Sundance Trail. We brought the new Echo Springs TXP4 into full operation at the end of the Q3. And just to remind you, the TXP4 plant adds about 350 million a day of processing and 30,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids production and capacity, roughly doubling what we already had there at Echo Springs. We increased the WPZ distribution by 1.5₵ and did announce as you well know the leadership secession plan effective January, 2011, which has Alan coming on board as President & CEO. Slide 7 please. This slide just gives the guidance range and midpoints for Henry Hub and Rockies net gas prices, crude oil, and NGL margins and our assumed NGL to crude oil relationship. I think there are just two points I want to make here: one, these are unchanged from the commodity price assumptions that we gave you at Barclays; and I guess the second point is yes, we have seen natural gas prices fall since then but we’ve run the numbers. And if you used strip prices you would really see the minimalist impact on our earnings per share for ‘11 and ‘12. Slide 8 please. Steady growth even on expected low nat gas prices. This shows adjusted EPS, adjusted segment profit, cash flow from operations and capital. And just the key points here: earnings per share reflects some tightening of ranges in ‘11 and ‘12. Segment profit reflects tightening in ‘11 and a slight increase in the range in ‘12. CFFO tightens the range consistent with earnings. 2011 CAPEX, we’re seeing some carryover from 2010; as well as PZ, with its Laurel Mountains and Piceance growth, that’s added a little capital. 2012 capital as well is up a little bit as a result of Laurel Mountains and Piceance growth. Slide 9. Again, segment profit moving up even during a low nat gas price environment. That’s good stuff. Slide 10, please. This is the slide that we have been showing the last couple of years, which shows the maintenance cap, the maintenance to maintain volumes, the growth projects by year and divided out by WPZ, E&P, and other. A couple points here: you’ll note in 2010, the blue WPZ growth bar is a little larger, and that’s obviously associated with the bar gas transaction, the Piceance gathering and processing transaction that I spoke about earlier. As well you’ll notice the growth capital, the yellow bar in ‘10 and ‘11 and ‘12 continues to grow quite nicely. Of course that includes that yellow bar, the other category includes Canada where, due to our first mover technological advantage we continue to anticipate making significant, attractive investments over the next three years. Slide 11. This is our familiar pie chart for WPZ midstream, and as you well know we’ve had success in moving projects. Due to our success from the left to the right we really see huge growth opportunities in the Marcellus, opportunities out west to expand on our already significant position out there, and we’re still excited about what the Gulf offers. Slide 12, please. The WPZ gas pipeline, inventory of projects – $1.3 billion represented here. PZ franchise, or the gas pipeline franchise is a major segment of the nation’s energy infrastructure, transporting 12% of the country’s gas on any given day. And our gas pipeline enterprise produces consistent low risks of substantial free cash flow. You know, we’ve talked about the base hit approach that we’ve used here. Most of our growth has been and will continue to be from market whole projects within our exiting footprint, as opposed to in my view the more risky producer-push pipes which are dependent on a given supply basin. I would say looking out into the future there’s a significant opportunity for expansions to serve power generation, particularly in the Southeast US. Slide 13, please. I think you’re familiar with our Premier E&P portfolio, and we have talked in the past that the Marcellus will soon become our second largest producing basin. A couple other key points: our drilling returns remain strong and our major operating areas of the Piceance, Marcellus, and Powder River with returns ranging from 17% to near 40% – even in this low nat gas price environment. A major reason for this is our industry leadership position on low costs. And I think a great example here is in the Piceance for 2010 we’ve improved our well costs by 3% to 6% versus 2009. We have a unique industry portfolio that allows us to flex up our drilling program, up or down, without losing value or losing leases. And as discussed in our September guidance update we decreased our rig counts for 2011 by nine rigs and 2012 by 17 rigs from our previous guidance, and simply put we can do that and yet preserve our value and leases while we wait for gas prices to improve. And we still expect to grow our production by 3% in 2011, 7% in 2012.
 : We still get a lot of questions and there’s a lot of dialog in the industry about what’s going to happen with NGLs and ethane and ethylene, and I’m certainly not going to read all of these bullet points but there are some points I want to make. And we’ve made these in the past and continue to believe in them. Short-term the fundamentals remain very strong for near-term ethane demand, as ethane is maintaining its favorable position in being the low cost feedstock for ethylene production. A lot of people are worried about the shale plays and the large supplies of ethane that are going to come on, but you have to remember – large supplies of ethane from the shale plays will require significant infrastructure and infrastructure takes time. The very strong ethylene markets will incent plants to invest in small plant expansions and WMB, Williams, has a low cost expansion investment ongoing at Geismar which is going to increase our capacity by 12%. Longer-term, clearly the US right now holds a large advantage for being the next low cost traunch for ethylene production given the abundant natural gas supplies. The US should be in a strong position to export its ethylene derivative products at a lower cost than incremental production elsewhere in the world. And I think ultimately the big question is will ethylene capacity be expanded to keep pace with increased NGL supplies here in the US? And given the high ethane to ethylene spreads that exist, we think ultimately that conversions and low cost capacity increases will happen. Slide 16 and 17 talk about the progress we have made for 2010 priorities for value creation, and you can see more and more of the boxes now have checkmarks. And so we’re pleased with the progress that we’re making there. Slide 18, please. The “Why Williams is a Winning Investment,” no change here. We think that we have the assets, the people. We have proven that we can execute crisply around our strategies. We are committed to financial discipline and believe that we’re going to have very, very attractive results in the future. Before we go to Q&A I’ve got a few comments and Alan will as well, but I wanted to address questions about my decision to retire. There’s no hidden intrigue or back story here. As Gwen and I were thinking about the next chapter in our life, and having been with Williams for 26 years, nine of those as CEO, we decided that again, started talking about it over the summer and ultimately decided that it made sense for us to retire at the end of 2010. And as you know, the requirements are such that once you make your final decision you need to make it public in four or five days. So it’s a decision that we’re very excited about. But the board was well prepared for this decision. We’ve had an active and comprehensive secession planning process in place. The board and I are confident in the team and confident in Alan Armstrong, and believe that Alan will take the company to new heights. I’ve had the great opportunity to work with Alan, not only in his role as heading up our midstream group but I’ve worked closely with him back in the 1990s when I was running midstream. And I don’t want to get too carried away here, but the experience and culture here at Williams is very unique and I’ve been proud to work here for the past 26 years. I truly believe the Williams experience, the Williams culture is a competitive advantage for us. So with that I’ll turn it over to Alan.
Alan Armstrong: Great. First of all, Steve, I want to make sure that we acknowledge the accomplishments that Steve brought forward. If you think back to the very difficult and tenuous circumstances that Steve was handed, and to where he’s brought us to today with a very strong, very stable company with tremendous potential to create shareholder value from where we sit today- We have that potential in terms of financial resources. We’ve got extremely well positioned assets in the markets they serve, and we’ve got tremendous organizational capabilities in terms of exploiting resource plays, both in our E&P group and in our midstream group. And our pipes are well positioned to serve the change in the markets today that’s associated with the resource plays. And certainly as Steve mentioned, our culture with one of the most passionate and committed workforces in the business today, leaves me with a tremendous amount of optimism about where we can take this. And I just want to say a big thanks to Steve for giving us such a tremendous platform to take the company from today. So we are in a very enviable position. We’ve got all the tools necessary to really accelerate shareholder value. We’re going to be reviewing all alternatives and I’m charged up and can assure you that with the great platform, the well positioned assets, and organizational capabilities that we have today, we will not be sitting still. I don’t have any particular bias other than to assure ourselves that we are creating the most shareholder value that is enduring and allows our businesses to be the most successful they can be for the benefit of our investors. And with that I will turn this over to Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions.) Our first question today comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers Investment Research.
Craig Shere – Tuohy Brothers Investment Research: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. And Steve, congratulations on really rebuilding the company from some dire days early in the last decade, and good luck with your retirement.
Steve Malcolm: Thank you.
Craig Shere – Tuohy Brothers Investment Research: A couple questions here. Ralph, can you comment on how the commodity price assumptions underlying the guidance of 3% and 7% production growth the next couple years differs from the decision to write down some E&P properties? And at the current lower strips, is it reasonable to assume that gas production may be declining?
Ralph Hill: Well, the goodwill impairment and the impairment of primarily the Barnett area really is an accounting exercise that we work on, and it’s basically there’s several models there. It’s the fair value model, and gross cash flows are discounted against that. So as we look at that for example on the goodwill, the internal fair value was slightly less than the carrying value, and in that case it caused an impairment in our goodwill which was, the goodwill for us was associated with a 2001, almost a decade ago acquisition of Barrett. And it wasn’t cash out the door; it was really a deferred tax liability gross up if you will. And that became our goodwill, and over the course of the last decade as we looked at prices and all that, we really didn’t have any opportunities for impairment. And then with the poor price curve it’s gone down greater than 22% since the beginning of the year. That caused us to look at that and that caused that write down. For the Barnett it was simply just a factor of the fair value again versus the carrying value. Our Ford prices have come down substantially and we have that impairment. That really doesn’t have anything to do with go forward on where we’re headed primarily in the Piceance and the Marcellus, where most of our draw is, and a lesser extension, the Powder. So those are just accounting exercises. You look at it, you understand the value of what you’re carrying versus the value of the fair value, and those are impaired from there. And I don’t know if your last question is more about the industry or us. We know that the level of rigs, which we did drop a substantial amount of rigs in our forecast at the Barclays conference for ‘11 and ‘12, but we know that we believe our production wasn’t growing that much. I think the industry in general hopefully at some time we’ll see our competitors put on more of a return hat and finish drilling for holding leases, and finish drilling for holding JVs and we’ll see a more rational response to the gas prices. And therefore, at that point I would expect you would see some of the gas supply to decline.
Craig Shere – Tuohy Brothers Investment Research: Well, I guess what I’m trying to understand is, is the write down based on forward strips which are meaningfully below your midpoint guidance for the next two years? And if we incorporated that more conservative assumption, given the wide range of CAPEX guidance for the next couple of years, is it reasonable to assume that we trend towards the lower end is what I’m trying to get at.
Ralph Hill: It is based on, really what happened is the strips through 2025 is down about, as I mentioned, greater than 20%. And I would say at this point I would not trend towards the lower part. We feel confident that our drilling program, as I think Steve mentioned, our returns in the areas we’re drilling are going to be anywhere from 17% to near 40%. We have cut our drilling program substantially but at this point we feel that we’ll be… We don’t give out the exact but we give a pretty wide range, and I think most of you guys look at the middle part of that range and that’s kind of what you assume, and that’s generally where we try to come out. If prices would continue to come down substantially we always have the ability as Steve said to flex our portfolio down, our drilling program down, and to respond accordingly until prices come the right way.
Craig Shere – Tuohy Brothers Investment Research: Great. And one other quick question, guys. I don’t know if Don or Alan or Steve want to field this, but do I understand that the latest drop down to WPZ pretax to WMB may have been 7.5 times EBIDTA, and after tax may be 6.5 times? And does that seem a little low for fee-based business, and how does that correlate to maybe future drop downs in how you’d envision pricing?
Don Chappel: Craig, this is Don. I might just comment – you have to remember that Williams retains its GP interest, and with that we get a substantial, you could call it a royalty but we get a substantial profit participation in that asset despite the fact we dropped it down. So I think when you look at the GP interest on top of what we actually sold it for in terms of cash, I think you get a much higher valuation. In terms of what’s left to drop down, you know, we have a 25.5% interest in Gullstream, which is eligible beginning late Q1. That’s not guidance in terms of what we may do but it would be eligible for drop down kind of late Q1, and beyond that we really haven’t earmarked any other assets.
Craig Shere – Tuohy Brothers Investment Research: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Lasan Johong with RBC Capital Markets.
Lasan Johong – RBC Capital Markets: Thank you. Recently a couple of your competitors have decided to dance and leave you guys out of it, creating some new projects in the Marcellus and the Eagleford. Does this signal a change in how you would pursue the McMullen lateral expansion in the Eagleford and the Keystone Connector in the Marcellus?
Phil Wright: This is Phil Wright, let me tackle the Keystone Connector. It doesn’t change anything with respect to what we’re pursuing on that project and we continue to work with producers. As you know, the difficulty in achieving success on any of those large infrastructure projects is getting producers to a position where they have a clear enough vision of what their needs are going to be and what market they want to try to serve sufficient to sign a precedent agreement that would produce enough security around a project that would have an investment profile attractive enough to proceed. And I think that chicken and egg problem persists. With respect to the McMullen Lateral. I know Alan will have some thoughts probably from the midstream perspective, but from the pipeline perspective I can tell you that as more drilling is done out there and as the lenses of liquids-rich and oil-rich finds sort of move northward, we’re seeing a higher level of interest in dry gas but nonetheless a very high level of interest in the McMullen Lateral.
Alan Armstrong: All I would add to that in terms of the, first of all in terms of the Marcellus is we have a tremendous joint venture in our Atlas joint venture with Atlas, Laurel Mountain. Outstanding growth alternatives coming out of that and we’ve got some exiting developments going on on the north end of our Springville Lateral. And so I don’t feel like we’re being left out in any way, shape or form. In fact I would tell you we probably have one of the strongest JVs in the Marcellus from a midstream perspective in terms of creating shareholder value going up there. So I’m very excited about that position. In terms of the Eagleford, the Markham plant, which is primarily positioned to serve the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, does stand ready. It’s got great liquids outlets and we just basically want to make sure that we don’t sell out that capacity too cheaply. There’s not a whole lot of that existing capacity and a great liquids market available, and we’re going to make sure we get a premium for having that space available.
Lasan Johong – RBC Capital Markets: I see. In terms of the transition of management team, I’m assuming this is more of a, I think Alan said this is more of the same as opposed to a signaling of a strategic break in how Williams looks going forward?
Alan Armstrong: Are you asking a question there, Lasan? I’m sorry.
Lasan Johong – RBC Capital Markets: Yeah, I’m asking do you expect to do anything majorly different than what Steve has laid in terms of foundations for going forward with WMB?
Alan Armstrong: Well, I would just say this. I think the integrated model from my vantage point of being in the business and working with our E&P group and our gas pipe group has absolutely created a lot of value. However, I think we’ve certainly got to look to see the markets fully appreciate that value, and that’s certainly going to be an important consideration as we look at our alternatives going forward. So I think it’s very early for you to conclude or anybody to conclude really where we stand on that because we will be looking at our alternatives, but I can assure you that everything is on the table and we will be not looking to sit still. And we’re looking to create rapidly accelerate shareholder value.
Lasan Johong – RBC Capital Markets: I see. One last question. If Ford curves materially improve, let’s say, 20% from where it is today how much more ramp up do you have in terms of E&P spending that you think you can do within a six month period?
Ralph Hill: This is Ralph. We had a previous forecast that had I think our growth was going to be 12% next year and then 16% the year after, and what we did is we essentially dropped about 10 rigs in 2011 and about I think it was 17 rigs in 2012’s forecast. So you know, we have the ability to go out… And that wouldn’t all happen in six months but we have the ability to rapidly ramp it back up if price signals would show that. And obviously as Don would point out, that as our cash flows would grow then that’s when we try to live within our means. So I don’t know how much would happen in six months, but I can tell you a few months ago we were planning on, with a different price deck, to have a substantially higher level of growth and we dialed that back due to prices.
Lasan Johong – RBC Capital Markets: So instead 12% and 16%, you’re going to keep doing 3% to 7%.
Ralph Hill: Correct. Yeah, 3% in ‘11 and 7% in ‘12. And that’s down from what was 12% and 16%.
Lasan Johong – RBC Capital Markets: So that means in theory you could ramp up about 9% or 10%.
Ralph Hill: We could at some point. We’d have to get the rigs and do all that, but we’ve been very successful in always being able to get good rigs, good crews. Our alliances with our vendors who pays out very handsomely in times of ramp up and it also helps when we ramp down.
Lasan Johong – RBC Capital Markets: That’s great, thank you very much.
Ralph Hill: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll move on to our next question from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Thanks, guys, and Steve, congratulations on your career and best of luck in the future.
Steve Malcolm: Thank you.
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: I wanted to ask first question, just in terms of the drop down itself on the gathering assets, what drove the decision to take cash versus units, kind of the split that you took there? Why did you take one, why not take all of one or all of the other?
Don Chappel: This is Don. I’ll just note we had some tax considerations.
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Okay. We can follow up offline. Maybe Ralph, then, just on the rig count, where do you see the rig count going by basin? And over time, how many rigs do you plan on running in each one given the new CAPEX budget?
Ralph Hill: In 2011 we are now, we’re projecting about where we are today in the Piceance. We’ll have 11 rigs running, nine in the valley and two in the highlands. In the Barnett we’ll be down to one rig, and in the Marcellus, it’s going to, as Steve mentioned it goes from three and ultimately ends up at six at the end of the year. So on average in the Marcellus it’s more like, I hate to do this but it’s 4.75 rigs in the Marcellus. That’s more than the four rigs we had planned earlier. And as I said the Piceance is down five rigs and the Barnett is down two rigs.
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Got it, got it. Okay. That’s helpful. And then again just on E&P, it looks like you’re (inaudible) on a lot of expansion opportunities. You mentioned on one of the slides I think Marcellus, Eagleford, even Bachan. How are you thinking about each of those opportunities? How do those fit in with your expertise, your footprint, etc.?
Ralph Hill: I think they fit in well. Obviously the Eagleford and the Bachan bring a different look to our portfolio in the sense of liquids and/or condensate oil, which we’d like to have that. But expertise wise we’ve drilled hundreds and hundreds of horizontal wells. We understand how to do that so each of those areas work for us. Now we have a substantial position in the Marcellus of 100,000 acres. We’d like to continue to evaluate opportunities there and we are. Eagleford’s had some great looking opportunities out there and obviously there’s other areas such as the Bachan. We think they fit right in with what our expertise is.
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Okay, thanks. And then since you issued the guidance a month and a half ago, gas prices are obviously lower, NGL prices are higher. Are you thinking any differently now about capital allocation between E&P and midstream? Or kind of how are you thinking about that going forward given where the prices have moved?
Don Chappel: This is Don. We’ve asked our E&P business largely to live within its means, so to the extent it generates cash flows we would expect that they would likely consume those cash flows to reinvest in the business, again with a bias towards liquids-rich areas like the Piceance. In fact, we do get a lot of liquids out of the Piceance. And I would say the WPZ midstream and gas pipeline assets are well capitalized with a very low cost of capital, so we really don’t see too much in the way of corporate capital moving back into that business for the foreseeable future.
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: We’ll move on to Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.
Carl Kirst – BMO Capital Markets: Hey, good morning, everybody, and I’d also like to throw in my congratulations, Steve, you and Alan. Alan, actually let me ask a question just on the Marcellus with respect to projects. With the curve coming down, the conversations with 40 some odd producers I guess continuing, should we think about these as more incremental projects or do you still see sort of more Laurel Mountain-ish type of potential, singular, large scale projects that may come over the end zone some time in 2011 for instance?
Alan Armstrong: Well, certainly we are pursuing those that give us a large scale position up there and I’ve got pretty high hopes that we’ll be able to deliver on something of a similar nature to what we had in the Laurel Mountain area. On top of that, however, there are a tremendous amount of those producers that we’re talking to that infill into those assets that we’re developing, and things like the Laurel Mountain JV and other alternatives up in the Northeast Pennsylvania area, we think are going to give us first mover advantage to allow us to serve those remaining producers that we’re talking to. So we’re out there aggressively pursuing large anchor customers and then we’ll be in a position to better serve the balance of those customers.
Carl Kirst – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, so the back end of the curve coming down hasn’t necessarily eliminated or drastically slowed down talks around these large scale projects then, just to confirm.
Alan Armstrong: I’m sorry, I think we dropped you there for just a moment.
Carl Kirst – BMO Capital Markets: Just paraphrasing what you said there, it doesn’t sound like the back end of the curve coming down – again, just because of the better marginal returns in the Marcellus – it doesn’t sound like that has necessarily jettisoned or eliminated the potential for large scale projects in the Marcellus.
Alan Armstrong: The Marcellus is well positioned to survive a very low gas price environment and we’re certainly not seeing any signs of people backing off in the most prime parts of the Marcellus.
Carl Kirst – BMO Capital Markets: Fair enough. Maybe if I could kind of go further north to Redwater, what do you think has to happen? The returns are there. Clearly given all the rhetoric we’ve seen with Congress and the left on the environmental with the oil sands, there seems to be a lot of driving factors that would continue to get you guys more business up there. What has to happen to kind of break that logjam?
Alan Armstrong: Well, I would just tell you that the process of negotiating – these are very long-term, obviously those reserves are very long life. And so the contracts for them are fairly complex because they’re meant to be very enduring. And so it just takes a while to get through the contracting stage, but we are making very good progress on those fronts and look forward to making some announcements on that in the not very distant future. So don’t assume lack of us announcing anything is lack of progress. We’ve got actually quite a bit of progress that’s gone on in the last quarter up there.
Carl Kirst – BMO Capital Markets: I appreciate those comments. Maybe one other question if I could for Ralph. Recognizing this is always a bit of a moving target, but in conjunction with the back end of the curve coming down as you guys are looking to potentially deploy more capital outside of the Rockies, what should we think about what you guys are using for sort of a long-term clearing price for oil and gas? I mean should we be using the strip or you know, if you guys were to say for instance to deploy $1 billion somewhere, what do we take as far as ‘Boy, this is where they ultimately think gas and oil prices are going to trend out in the…’ call it 2020 area for instance?
Ralph Hill: Well, we have obviously several things we do. We have a point of view that past 2012 we haven’t published. We also have the market that we look at closely and we monitor what’s going on in the market at all times. And then we run low cases and we run high cases and we run stress cases. So I’m sorry I can’t give you an exact answer because we run a number of cases. Typically our point of view from time to time is pretty close to what the market’s doing. That just happens, it’s just the way it works out. But we look at so many different scenarios it’s hard to tell you exactly, but I can tell you when we do look at all these we severely stress test them to understand what it means in a low price environment, both for the oil side and the gas side.
Carl Kirst – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll move on to our next question from Jonathan Favreau with Wells Fargo Securities.
Jonathan Favreau – Wells Fargo Securities: Thanks, and let me start by congratulating Steve on his retirement, and Alan as well. Just most of my questions have been touched, just wanted to ask the announcement to sell the midstream assets to PZ, I mean it sounds like you want to deploy capital into more E&P assets. How do you weigh that against potentially doing a share repurchase?
Don Chappel: This is Don. I would say we’re looking at capital redeployment at very attractive after tax rates of return using kind of the price scenario that Ralph laid out with we think a reasonable view of prices, and then also stress testing that and say “How bad could it be and would we still earn a return that’s worthwhile?” And if we have terrific opportunities, and particularly if we can do so in a way that broadens our footprint and perhaps also broadens our commodity mix, that would be interesting to us. In terms of stock buyback, I think our view to date has been in this very low price environment and in a very uncertain economy we just don’t have much in the way of firepower to buy back stock without facing ratings downgrade. So as Alan said, all the options are on the table. We continue to look at all the options but to date we have not chosen to go down that path, but as Alan indicated we continue to look at all the options and we’ll do that whenever we make a decision on redeploying net capital.
Jonathan Favreau – Wells Fargo Securities: But if I hear you correctly the preference is to do an E&P acquisition versus share buybacks.
Don Chappel: I think, I mean clearly we think that the share price is an attractive one but we certainly don’t want to face a downgrade in order to do that because that has broader implications. So we’ll look at all the options, we’ll look at the potential consequences and benefits and make a decision that we think is in the best interest of the company and the shareholders.
Jonathan Favreau – Wells Fargo Securities: Thanks so much and thanks for the time.
Don Chappel: You’re more than welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Maresca with Morgan Stanley.
Steve Maresca – Morgan Stanley: Hey, good morning everybody, and Steve, I’d also like to wish you thorough enjoyment of your retirement.
Steve Malcolm: Thank you.
Steve Maresca – Morgan Stanley: So a couple questions. I see you got cash on this drop down, and I know you’ve discussed and I’ve read under review Bachan, Eagleford evaluating. How imminent is something? How available are properties in these areas? Some color on that maybe.
Ralph Hill: This is Ralph. I wouldn’t comment at all on the imminent side of the world, but I can tell you as you probably know there are a number of opportunities in all these basins. There always are but there appear to be more than normal at this time. So there’s just a lot of opportunities there. But as Don has said, Steve has said and Alan said that there are a number of things we take into account when we look at that. So we evaluate continuously, my group and the rest of the groups here at Williams, opportunities. We see one that we think creates value we bring it to the table and we talk about it, and we try to see if that’s something we want to do. So there’s just a lot out there right now but there typically is in this industry.
Steve Maresca – Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then looking at your guidance, I don’t think you changed production guidance for this year which would sort of imply pretty significant sequential growth in the Q4 from the Q3. One, am I accurate in looking at it that way? And I guess two, what would be driving that?
Ralph Hill: Well, it’s just the- Yes, you are accurate in looking at it that way. And it’s just we, the rest of the decline that we had, when you’re coming off of for example 28 rigs in the Piceance and you’re going down to what we went down to was then and now we’re at 12, that’s a huge decline that you overcome when you just look at the way these (inaudible) wells come on, or any kind of wells that we drill now. So we’ve overcome that decline from the number of rigs that we’ve dropped, and now that we’ve done that the volumes are starting to tweak back up. You see that we had a 2% growth I believe company-wide sequentially and in the Q3 versus Q2 I think Piceance itself was up 5%. So the big driver will be the Piceance and then also we have the new basin where we’re starting to get a little traction on in the Marcellus. But you are seeing it correctly that we have arrested the decline, we’re actually growing again and we’d expect a decent growth in the Q4.
Steve Maresca – Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then my final question is, so you updated guidance a month ago and gross CAPEX went up at WPZ and obviously some of that has to do with this recent drop. Is there anything else that was added in the past month or is it all because of the new assets coming in?
Alan Armstrong: There is some additional capital in there from the midstream side associated with the more rapid expansion of our Laurel Mountain System, and so that’s one of the primary drivers of additional capital in there.
Steve Maresca – Morgan Stanley: Okay. Alright, well thanks a lot guys, and again, best of luck, Steve, and thanks.
Steve Malcolm: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citi.
Faisel Khan – Citi: Good morning. Steve, congratulations on your retirement and we wish you all the best here.
Steve Malcolm: Thank you.
Faisel Khan – Citi: Alan, on the liquids volumes for the Q3, they were down sequentially versus the Q2. Can you comment on any outages or what was going on there? Maybe main rejection?
Alan Armstrong: Sure. Really there was two primary issues there that did effect it, and you are right – it’s actually a pretty substantial reduction in our equity gallons. First of all in the Mobile Bay area, we had Exxon, who is the big producer into Mobile Bay, had some outages on one of their offshore pipelines completely unrelated to the drilling moratorium that reduced input coming into the plant substantially. In addition to that, though, we also, the way those contracts work, they have rights to take their liquids for a certain number of months over the year, and it just so happened that that piled up, their option piled up in this quarter. It’s actually our election and so with their outage we elected to give them the liquids in that period when there was an outage. So that was by far the largest. And then out west we had reduction related to a forced measure that we got from One Oak at their Bushton fractionator, and that backed up all of our plants in the west. They had some difficulties maintaining with the volumes ramping up so rapidly coming out of the west. They’ve had some difficulties keeping their infrastructure out in front of that, and that resulted in a forced measure that did impact our western volume. So all in all we are really well positioned right now with our Echo plant being now up, which just really got spinning here towards the end of September. And we’ve gotten some of the line problems resolved that we had on the Perdito tie in, which were effecting our Markham volumes as well. So going into the Q4 here we are really well positioned to get back on track on our liquids production and grow that pretty rapidly.
Faisel Khan – Citi: Okay, great. On the E&P side, Ralph, is there any point in time when you look at price that you maybe look at shutting in production?
Ralph Hill: We’d done that a little bit last year and the primary was in the Powder. And so we look at it from time to time, but at this point we’re not contemplating any of that. We’re about 56%, 60% hedged. We have a number of things that go into that; if you’re shutting in it’ll complicate that. So it would need to be for a substantial period of time – we don’t see a reason to do that.
Faisel Khan – Citi: Okay, gotcha. And if you look at these kind of more liquids-rich opportunities, do you think that given all the transactions that are taking place the prices are too high? Or do you think they’re still reasonable?
Alan Armstrong: Well, it depends on where you’re looking and if you’re in the sweet spots or not, but we think in the- Generally we think we know where the market is in our areas of interest. We feel we know what it takes to win in certain areas, so to the extent we find something we think from a technical standpoint hits our sweet spot then I think that’s when we’d try to move something forward. So, so many transactions are out there it’s hard to say which ones are good or bad, but we look at it first from the technical standpoint. If our exploration team likes it, our engineer likes it, it hits in what we evaluate, what we call the sweet spot, then that’s something we’ll be more aggressive in looking at than other fringe areas.
Faisel Khan – Citi: Okay, gotcha. And then with the write down that you guys took, is there going to be any impact to DD&A or reserves?
Alan Armstrong: The reserves report will come out at the end of the year. We don’t, the reserves are based on different things. The reserves are basically on the average of the first month prices for twelve months and the gas prices this year are higher than last year if you average that in. So that’s not really an impact on reserves. On DD&A, yes, we do see an impact to our DD&A. It’s probably going to go down about $0.10 to $0.15 company-wide for 2011 and about $0.10 again in 2012. That has been baked into the guidance. Basically as you can see the previous guidance, at that time we owned what we call the Piceance gathering assets, we also called that Bargatt. We owned those, they were previously in our guidance – not it’s out of our guidance. But we did get some DD&A pickup on the other side, so in general you see our guidance didn’t really change – they kind of offset each other.
Faisel Khan – Citi: Okay, gotcha. And last question on (inaudible). I notice you guys put a couple slides into your data book on Echo, Argentina, specifically I guess some of the exploration plays you have in Columbia. I guess are those sort of prospects pretty substantial or how are you guys looking at that?
Alan Armstrong: Well, the activity around us, the other operators around us, they’ve had great successes there. So it’s, we’ve bought into those concessions. We’re excited that in one of them we’ll start drilling next year and the other one we’re still doing seismics on. But the operators in that area have done very, very well so we think it’s time to make sure everybody understands that we have interest in those areas.
Faisel Khan – Citi: Okay, great. Thanks for the time.
Alan Armstrong: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Holly Stewart with Howard Weil.
Holly Stewart – Howard Weil Incorporated: Good morning, guys. Congratulations to Steve and Alan, both of you.
Alan Armstrong: Thank you.
Holly Stewart – Howard Weil Incorporated: Most of my questions have actually been answered at this point, but Ralph, I know it’s still very early in the Marcellus for you guys but you’ve outlined some particular areas in your presentation. So can you just talk about well results to date? I know you referenced in the slides some of your best wells being the Westmoreland County. Can you just kind of talk about that from a bigger picture standpoint?
Ralph Hill: Yeah, the Westmoreland County area, and again, we took over operations just a few months ago but what we’re seeing in our first handful, our first several wells there is that 90-day flows in some of the areas are still above or at the 3.5 million a day tide flows, so we’re impressed with that, we like that. So we’re just still learning, understanding, but we like all the areas we’re in. And obviously we’re excited to do a lot more in Susquehanna County. We’re only running one rig up there now and obviously we have some completions that we’re backing up on because of the delay in the Laser Pipeline. But in general all the Clearfield, Westmoreland and Centre Counties are doing very well; Westmoreland’s doing slightly better. And I think Susquehanna as you know will do much better than any of those once we get there. So we’re excited. We’ve brought in a fit for purpose Patterson rig, we’ve brought in a rig from H&P from the Rockies, so we’re happy to have at least two of those rigs that are fit for purpose. We’ve contracted for some more. And again, it’s just kind of like what we see happening in the Piceance – when you get the right crews, the right equipment, and get the opportunity to move it into more of a scale operation we think the efficiencies will come like we’ve seen in the Piceance.
Holly Stewart – Howard Weil Incorporated: Any test rates on the Susquehanna wells?
Ralph Hill: Not from us, but we’re intermixed with, for example, Cabot and others, and you’ve seen their results. And we’re right in the middle of all that so we’re anxious to have it when that comes on. And hopefully Laser will come on mid next year so we’ll start completing before that, and have some good results for you.
Holly Stewart – Howard Weil Incorporated: Okay. And given the delays that you’ve seen with Laser and then your pullback with capital, what’s your kind of expected timeframe now to achieve this goal of the Marcellus being the second largest producing basin for you guys?
Ralph Hill: Well, we said that would happen by I think within this, when we gave our kind of longer-term forecast which I think went through 2015. And based on the four rigs averaging in the Marcellus going up to, in 2012 we currently have a build up to ten rigs and it goes up a little bit more after that. We still can easily make that in the next four years or so.
Holly Stewart – Howard Weil Incorporated: Next four years.
Ralph Hill: Yeah.
Holly Stewart – Howard Weil Incorporated: Okay, and then finally just from an integrated model standpoint, how can that help you alleviate the delays you’re seeing in the Marcellus from an infrastructure standpoint?
Ralph Hill: Well, at this time the only delay we have is with Laser and we’ve got our other facilities in what we call the Shannon Compression Station and the other gathering facilities and all that, and the other areas in Clearfield County and Westmoreland – they’re in good shape. The Laser is not part of us or our midstream group so that doesn’t help us in that particular area. However, as you know, Laurel Mountains has really more of an outlet to the south, what it’s got there, and there is- As LMM continues to grow and expand maybe there’s opportunities in the future – who knows – for consolidations. And that would be great if LMM would be out there being a consolidator and being able to take over some of those things.
Holly Stewart – Howard Weil Incorporated: But you feel like you’re pretty set in terms of- You’re growing production or you’re anticipating growing production in a pretty meaningful way here in the Marcellus. Do you feel like you’re pretty set from an infrastructure standpoint over the next couple of years?
Ralph Hill: We think we will be, yes.
Holly Stewart – Howard Weil Incorporated: Okay. Great, thanks guys.
Ralph Hill: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin Smith with Raymond James.
Kevin Smith – Raymond James: Hi, good morning, gentlemen. What do you think your rates of returns are now in the Piceance Valley and Highlands on the drill bed?
Alan Armstrong: We’re showing in the Piceance Valley we believe our returns are, I’ll just give you a range – 35% to 40%, and in the Highlands they’re more upper teens, so 17%, 18% type returns. And the Highlands next year all we’re going to drill at this point will be in the Ryan Gulch area. Obviously we pulled that capital so those returns are really focused in the Ryan Gulch, although that still is kind of a combination of what we would call Ryan Gulch/Trail Ridge wells. So Ryan Gulch would have a slightly higher net; the number I gave you in the upper teens is really kind of a hybrid of the Trail Ridge and the Ryan Gulch.
Kevin Smith – Raymond James: Okay, so are you going to be having enough activity now in the Highlands to keep production flat and then slightly grow it in the valley? Is that the right way to look at it?
Ralph Hill: Well the valley will clearly grow, and the Highlands has been growing. It’ll be a challenge to keep it flat but the teams, we probably would need to, with two rigs it’ll be tight. We may decline in the Highlands some.
Kevin Smith – Raymond James: Okay. And outside the Marcellus is there any other areas you’re actually expecting to grow production?
Ralph Hill: Production generally will be flat in the San Juan and it’ll be slightly declining in the Barnett.
Kevin Smith – Raymond James: Okay.
Ralph Hill: We have a number of completions we’re backed up on in the Barnett that’ll keep that so it can remain- It will go down but it won’t go down as much as you think by dropping to one rig.
Kevin Smith – Raymond James: Are we still seeing takeaway activities backed up in the Barnett or is that just sort of timing of when you decide to do the projects?
Ralph Hill: Really Barnett is much more of a permitting side of the world, which basically is somewhat strange, but it’s on the compression facilities and water facilities. It’s not the takeaway capacity for us as much as it is on just permits in some of the areas we operate in, on trying to do what we think is the best practice – build centralized water facilities and larger compressor areas just to be more efficient.
Kevin Smith – Raymond James: Fair enough. All my other questions have been answered, thank you.
Ralph Hill: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Yves Siegel with Credit Suisse.
Yves Siegel – Credit Suisse: Thanks. Just some quick follow up questions. One, on the E&P side do you think of asset dispositions at all? I mean does it make sense to maybe exit the Barnett shale and redeploy cash flow elsewhere?
Alan Armstrong: Yeah, I think we look at all options like that and that is an option that’s out there. It depends on what’s going on in the marketplace but Barnett has been frustrating simply from a standpoint of a lot of what we saw was just a complete delay in the opportunities to get the facilities we needed to. It wasn’t the drilling permits – just actually to get the facilities done to get our gas to market, and that caused a chain link or chain reaction in losing value.
Yves Siegel – Credit Suisse: Did you have discretion in terms of the timing of the write down? Could you have waited until you reported year end to do that or was it something that you were required to do at this time?
Alan Armstrong: Well, it’s something yeah – we’re required to do. And really in this aspect it’s something we actually look at all the time and in last year’s queue we basically talked about that there are certain triggers we would look at. One would be if the forward market price, and again this is the forward market price through 2025, would happen to decline by more than 20% we would have to take a look at this. And it did, but we look at it every quarter anyway, but for this particular quarter the forward market price is down substantially and it’s just an automatic check. We don’t have the opportunity to pick when we want to do that.
Yves Siegel – Credit Suisse: And then if I could, just two other quick ones. Do you have an opinion on using shale plays as storage type of facilities at all? Do you have an opinion on that one way or the other?
Ralph Hill: This is Ralph. I do not. I don’t know if any other team does here. No.
Yves Siegel – Credit Suisse: Okay, that was just an off the wall question. And then the last question is when you look at potential growth CAPEX, it looks like there’s a real big chunk of opportunity in the Gulf of Mexico. Could you elaborate on how you think about that going forward?
Alan Armstrong: Sure. A lot of continued opportunity out there. The (inaudible) Canyon area continues to be a very active area and certainly underserved from an infrastructure standpoint, and we think we’re very well positioned to capture some of that business out here, and as well continuing to grow the infrastructure out of the Eastern Gulf area out of our Devil’s Tower facility as well. So we continue to see a lot of opportunity out there. And our GulfStar generic platform, basically, that is now well designed and really ready to be deployed we think can add a tremendous amount of value to producers out there, and we’re continuing to have a lot of interest in that. I think all that has to really change out there, and I’m not predicting how rapidly this will change, but I do think that what’s going to be required is for the producers to gain confidence that even though the moratorium is lifted that permits will actually be processed in a timely basis and in a reasonable fashion. And I think everybody’s waiting to see on that front. But if that does happen then there is a tremendous resource out there and it’s going to need a lot of infrastructure, and we’re very well positioned to serve that.
Yves Siegel – Credit Suisse: And just from the realization of cash flow, is that a long lead time? Would you be able to do it incrementally or would there be a big lag between dollars invested and the start of incremental cash?
Ralph Hill: I think generally from the time that we really start investing dollars on many of those projects to the time we’ve got cash flow is about, the smaller projects would maybe be a year and a half and the longer projects would be three years. So the answer to your question is yes, in terms of that capital, those large capital dollars being deployed; however, as you know where we’ve got infrastructure already there and production gets tied into that, that comes on pretty rapidly for us. And so there’s a mix of that, but in terms of the capital, those large chunks of capital that you see in our potential pie there, most of that would be probably in the 2.5 year range from the time that we would be investing heavily to the time we’d see cash flows come back.
Yves Siegel – Credit Suisse: Got it. Thanks so much.
Don Chappel: This is Don. Just on your impairment question, I’ll just remind everyone that in 2008. 2009 many, many companies across the industry took very large write downs. We did not, so while we took a write down this quarter we hadn’t had any large write downs back in the ‘08/’09 period when many, many other write downs were taken.
Alan Armstrong: Yeah, Don, just to follow up on that. The 20 peers that we track, I think they took write downs of approximately $52 billion those two years.
Operator: That concludes the question-and-answer session for today. At this time I’d like to turn things over to Mr. Steve Malcolm for any additional or closing remarks.
Steve Malcolm: Well thanks for tuning in. We’re excited about the future. Our best of class assets, a strong balance sheet, significant inventory of growth opportunities and a talented and dedicated workforce we think will translate into significant shareholder value growth in the future. So thank you very much. Bye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Williams Companies' Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Travis Campbell, head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Travis Campbell: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to our second-quarter call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Williams. Steve Malcolm, our Chairman and CEO, will review the few slides, we have this morning. Be aware, though, that as always, all of our business unit heads and Don Chappel are available for questions that we'll take right after Steve's remarks. Also, as usual, we've put together a data book, which includes the normal information which we provide each quarter. So this morning on the website, williams.com, you should be able to find the slides, the data book and the press release that was issued earlier today. The second-quarter 10-Q will also be available today and you'll be able to access that on the website as well. At the beginning of the slide deck are the forward-looking statements on slide two and three and the disclaimer on oil and gas reserves on slide number four. Those are important and they're integral to our remarks, obviously, so please review those. Also included are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those schedules are available and they follow the presentation. So with that, Steve, I will turn it over to you.
Steve Malcolm: Thank you, Travis. Welcome to our call and thanks for your interest in our company. Let's jump right into the slides and I'll start here on slide five. I am most pleased with our ability to strategically expand our business lines during the quarter. As you know, we completed a major E&P acquisition at the Williams level that establishes a significant and growing position in the Marcellus, we now have just under 100,000 acres there. And Williams' partners just recently announced two major Midstream business expansions, the increased stake at Overland Pass and the new cryo plant at Parachute. So continuing with the highlights, second quarter recurring adjusted EPS was up 35% versus the second quarter of '09 on the strength of higher NGL and olefin margins. We've kind of passed over the breakover point in terms of production growth. I think second quarter production marks a resumption of the expected growth and you can see we're expecting 12% in '11 and 16% in 2012, while we live within our drilling cash flows. We are expanding our Marcellus position in all lines of business. The business development opportunities are extraordinary. We are benefiting from increases in the Williams Partners distributions, what is good for WPZ is good for Williams and we've increased some of our cash flow certainty with some new E&P hedges. We've taken some of the risk off the table. As you know, we're 64% hedged in 2010 from a revenue standpoint. We've increased our hedge position in 2011 from 30% to 50% during the quarter. Turning to slide six, please – certainly a consistent theme that we have presented really over the past few years is the attractive, organic growth opportunities that exist at Williams and that's certainly reflected on this slide, one that you've seen before but which shows for the 2010-2012 timeframe, the capital intended to be spent on maintenance of facilities, on maintenance of volumes and for growth by business unit. I don't think I need to say anything more about this. Again, it shows $6 billion in growth during that timeframe. I would like to make one comment and this is the only comment I'll make about Canada, but you see the yellow growth capital in 2011 and 2012. It's fairly significant and most of that that's shown in yellow is associated with three specific projects in Canada, again continuing to take advantage of our first mover technological advantage that we have up in Canada. Turning to page seven, please, or slide seven, continuing to talk about the theme of growth and this, of course, talks about our E&P production growth during the period. We have adopted a very disciplined approach. We are living within our cash flows until such time as we see the macroclimate improve but even though we're living within our cash flows, we are growing production at 30% over this timeframe. You'll also note that Marcellus is becoming a bigger part of the mix. We expect to drill 100 wells in the Marcellus in 2011, running about eight rigs, close to 200 wells in 2012 as we run 14 rigs. So, clearly, Marcellus is becoming a bigger part of our mix. By 2013, it will be our second largest producing basin, by 2015, we would expect that Marcellus would be producing in excess of 500 million a day. As well, the Piceance will continue to be our low-cost workhorse basin that continues to generate very strong returns. Slide eight, please. Continuing again to talk about growth and here we are talking about WPZ Midstream growth. You've seen this slide before. The slices of the pie there show where we will be spending our capital and I think there are just three points that I want to make here. Overland Pass and Parachute capital is now in the guidance pie chart. Secondly, that when you look at the potential spending in each of the categories, obviously, the activity, the business development activity, continues to be very robust. And we would expect that you would see continued growth in the Marcellus, out West, where we already have a very significant position and we continue to be excited with respect to deepwater Gulf opportunities. Slide nine, please. Again, the WPZ Gas Pipeline growth. You've seen this slide before. This talks about the base hits approach that we've used in gas pipes, where all of our projects are backed by long-term commitments with creditworthy customers and so this slide simply shows the $1.3 billion worth of inventory that we have associated with our gas pipeline projects. A few updates – projects placed into service. The 85 North Phase 1 and Mobile Bay South projects in service now. Under construction now, the Sundance Trail. FERC certificates received with respect to the Pascagoula expansion and the Mobile Bay South 2 project, precedent agreements executed on the Midsouth expansion and I'm referring there to the remaining capacity and as well on the Cardinal expansion. And we have an open season ongoing with respect to the Opal Market Link project. So, a lot of activity – bite-sized in nature, although some of the projects, like Northeast Supply Link, which is a $307 million project and the Midsouth expansion, a $214 million project, are fairly large in terms of capital spending. The next few slides I will endeavor to answer some of the questions that we receive most often from investors as I'm out talking, as other officers are out talking or our questions that we're receiving in IR by telephone. But the first one here relates to the slide 10 now – questions asking for more specifics about what's going on in the Marcellus. We've talked about all of the very exciting opportunities that we have there and so let me run through quickly some of the details. As you know, from an E&P perspective, we're approaching now 100,000 acres in the Marcellus. We doubled our E&P lease acreage with the most recent acquisition. Our all-in costs for the now-97,000 acres we hold is just under $7,000 an acre. With respect to the Rex JV, 12 wells have been drilled under that JV, seven wells are now producing, we have one rig operating. Since we took over operation earlier this year, we've drilled one well. That's the Westmoreland County Slavic Trust Well and it appears to be our best well, flowing approximately 4.9 million a day on a 30-day test. We would note that the 70,000 of our 97,000 acres are not part of the JV. We are ramping up our drilling activity. We're adding rigs. We just signed a contract for two additional fit-for-purpose rigs, one comes to us in late August; the other in February of 2011. The first rig will likely be employed in the Rex JV area; the second in the Susquehanna area. With respect to Midstream, the opportunities really here are special. We have the huge JV with Atlas, which clearly was enhanced by the Reliance deal, which is going to allocate more drilling capital near-term. Springville is just proceeding. We may even upside this pipeline depending on business demand. There's a lot of business around the system. We're talking with many other players. I think this project will be a catalyst for other deals. You see a new green dot on the slide there, which shows the location of our Shamrock compressor station. This will likely be a central facility for us and will be the largest delivery point out of the system – out of the Atlas gathering system or the LMM system. We're building or expanding 11 compressor stations in support of Atlas' ultimate production targets and third-party growth opportunities. So a lot going on with respect to the JV with Atlas. But in addition to that, we've talked about the fact that we have 30 confidentiality agreements, we have identified 80 prospects, a lot of deal activity. We continue to work with a number of large parties in the Northeast, Pennsylvania area around significant gathering stepouts. We continue to offer producers a short-term blending opportunity for their ethane. We think that makes a lot of sense near-term. So, a lot of activity, a lot of excitement, probably so much activity that we may need another General Manager to handle the level of activity in the area. In terms of Gas Pipeline, we show two potential projects here, the Keystone Connector and the Northeast Supply Link, both shown on the map. These continue, I believe, to be viable pipeline projects and we continue to talk with shippers. Slide 11 is designed to answer the question. Are you going to exercise your option with respect to Overland Pass Pipeline? And obviously, we answered that earlier this week when we went forward with a press release announcing that we were increasing our interest to 50%. We do have an option to operate there. This is a $425 million transaction. The pipeline is nearly full now. It's expandable to 255,000 barrels. You see some of the announced expansion shown at the bottom of this chart. I would say these are the ones that have been announced thus far. We certainly expect more opportunity to expand beyond this and in fact, I would be disappointed if we don't see more expansions occurring during the near-term. This is clearly a strategic pipeline for us. You look at current volumes flowing and about 60% of those are associated with Williams Midstream and E&P businesses. Slide 12, what's happening with the Rockies basis, is a question that we have been receiving here recently. Certainly, we've seen the Rockies basis forward market for '11 and '12 move to about $0.50. We think the recent moves had to do with unusual weather, on excess hydro, on regional transportation issues but again, as we've pointed out in the past, I think the key is that E&P's exposure on a revenue basis is very modest, some might say de minimis. As a result of the transportation options that we have and the hedging that we've done and so you can see in 2010 that the exposure is about 5%; 2011, it's about 12% and we would expect to bring down the 28% in 2012 as we are successful with more hedging. I would also point out the fact that PZ Midstream benefits from the Rockies basis differential and I would encourage you to look at the data book, which we have a slide in the data book which shows our commodity exposure and we are, clearly, with respect to Rockies exposure, we're flat gas and – for the balance of 2010 and 2011. So, turning to slide 13, a lot of questions about the impact of the moratorium on WPZ and again, you can see that we have tried to give you some numbers associated with the estimated financial effect of a six-month drilling moratorium and a one-year moratorium. As you can see, our expectation is that the moratorium shouldn't last much longer than six months and the 2011 effect is about 2% of expected WPZ segment profit in DD&A, a one-year moratorium effect would be less than 4%. Looking at slide 14, we could probably speak at length here. I'll try to summarize my comments here and we can go into this in more detail in the Q&A session if you would like. But we have had a lot of questions about, well, what happened with NGL and methane prices in the second quarter? What's your short-term outlook? What's your long-term outlook? So let me just organize my thoughts and comments around each of those three main categories. And so in terms of what happened second-quarter versus first-quarter, we saw a steep decline in ethane margins during the second quarter. The primary contributors toward these ethane margins were several outages that went on longer than expected at ethylene plants, which dramatically reduced ethane and EP mix consumption, particularly in the Midwest and so the bottleneck for ethane was ethylene cracking capacity during the second quarter. The ethane price decline was not caused by lack of demand for ethylene as evidenced by the very strong margins that we experienced at Williams' Geismar ethylene facility during the second quarter. What I would point out here that, due to Williams' acquisition of BASF's capacity two years ago at Geismar that we continue to consume about half of our ethane exposure at our ethylene cracking facility at Geismar. So, the lower ethane margins were partially compensated for, during the quarter by the higher ethylene margins that we were able to capture at Geismar. So, turning now to a few comments about the short-term outlook. We believe the fundamentals continue to be very strong for near-term ethane demand as ethane is maintaining its favorable position in being the low-cost feedstock for ethylene production. We are seeing EP storage at Conway is being drawn down to more normal levels as the Midwest ethylene plants have returned to service. Large supplies of ethane from the shale plays require significant infrastructure. So we are not going to see the ethane production from some of these shale plays occur overnight. A great example of that is the Bakken infrastructure project that was announced by ONEOK recently. That's going to take three years before the planned startup. So we see very strong ethylene margins, likely incenting plants to invest in small plant expansions and certainly, Williams has a very low-cost expansion investment going on at Geismar right now, which is an example of that – the actions that the plants may take. Longer-term – longer-term outlook, we believe that the U.S. right now holds a large advantage for being the next low-cost tranche of ethylene production, given the abundant natural gas supplies and we believe the U.S. should be in a strong position to export its ethylene derivative products at a lower cost than incremental production elsewhere in the world. I think the key question long-term will be, will ethylene capacity be expanded to keep pace with increased NGL supplies here in the U.S. and given the current high ethane to ethylene spreads that exist, we think, ultimately, that conversions and low-cost capacity increases will, in fact, happen. Slide 15 just graphically shows you what margins have done over the last few quarters. We have seen strong NGL margins in recent quarters. They came back in the second quarter but again our expectation is they will continue to be very strong relative to historical averages. Page 16, slide 16, the financial guidance update. In terms of earnings guidance, our 2010 midpoint is moving down a nickel to $1.23 on lower NGL margins and a delay with respect to the Perdido Norte startup. 2011 and '12 are unchanged. With respect to capital, 2010 capital is increased for acquisitions, the Marcellus acreage and the Overland Pass pipeline interest and in 2011, capital is increased for the Parachute processing expansion that we talked about earlier. 2012 consolidated shows little change. Slide 17, we introduced the slide on 17 and 18 at our Investor Day meeting. These are the 2010 priorities for value creation, things that we need to do well during the year; things that we need to execute crisply around, in order to have a very successful year and so with respect to infrastructure projects, bringing those online, we now have construction completed on five of the projects that are checked here. We continue to make progress with respect to maximizing growth in the Marcellus and the Eagle Ford. We have already talked about some of those opportunities. On slide 18, we have been successful in initiating growth in the West where we already have a significant position. I'm speaking there about the Parachute cryo and with respect to the WPZ merger with WMZ, just point out that on August 31, the WMZ unit holders will vote to approve the proposed merger. Proxy materials have been sent to unit holders. The record date is July 15. A majority vote of the outstanding WMZ units not held by Williams affiliates is required for approval and assuming unit holder approval, we intend to close the merger transaction shortly after that special meeting. Slide 19, why Williams is a winning investment. We continue to believe that we have the superior assets. We have the very exciting growth opportunities. We have the balance sheet and the discipline to create significant future value for our shareholders. So with that, I will – we'll move into the Q&A session. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And we’ll take our first question from Steve Maresca from Morgan Stanley.
Steve Maresca – Morgan Stanley: Good morning everybody. So my first question is on gas production and I appreciate how you guys have started to grow in the second quarter sequentially over the first quarter. But just what, if you guys are such are a low-cost operator in the areas that you're in, what holds you back from growing even more than you are right now in this gas price environment and what would change that?
Ralph Hill: This is Ralph. What you also heard Steve talk about is we're staying within our cash flows, which is what we did. Last year, we actually did cut our budget severely to save even more than that. So bottom line is, it's just a function of what we're – how much we're drilling now that we've gone to nine rigs in the Valley and four rigs in the Highlands. When the breakover point hits, which it's hitting now, the volumes start to expand rapidly and that's what we expect will happen. So what you really see is the effect of going from basically 28 rigs down to eight and now we're at 13. And we're just starting to – as we move back up from above eight, you'll see that the volumes will start to take off. Other areas such as Powder River, our partners had a delay in the dewatering process of their volumes and that's caused the Powder River to not come on as fast as we would like that to come and then you'll see, as Steve mentioned here, in the near future, as we start to add in the Marcellus and start to drill out the acreage that we already have, the 97,000 acres, you'll see a rapid growth in the Marcellus volumes.
Steve Maresca – Morgan Stanley: Okay. In terms of using WPZ as a source of cash, you get the general partner and the dividends from the PZ stock. What are the thoughts on the remaining assets at WMB migrating into WPZ in terms of timing for that?
Don Chappel: Steve, this is Don Chappel, good morning.
Steve Maresca – Morgan Stanley: Hi.
Don Chappel: The remaining assets include an interest in Gulf Stream pipeline, a 25.5% interest, because of a partnership agreement related to a tax matter. We were precluded from dropping that down in the same calendar year that we did the initial drop-down. So that is eligible and certainly one that we would certainly expect to drop down at a future date. We are certainly not providing any guidance on timing. Second is the Canadian assets. The Canadian assets are relatively modest in size today but growing very rapidly. We also think that – we also have nearly $500 million of international cash at Williams that will fund the initial tranche of that growth. So, I think we're several years away from considering the possibility of a drop-down. So I'm not signaling that we will or will not, but I think, certainly, while we're still consuming Williams excess cash that's held internationally, it would not be prudent.
Steve Maresca – Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thanks a lot. I'll get back in the queue.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Lasan Johong from RBC Capital Markets.
Lasan Johong – RBC Capital Markets: I'm actually interested in the other way around, Steve. What flexibility do you have to push E&P production down next year if things – if pricing doesn't improve?
Steve Malcolm: Well, Lasan, you've seen us have the ability, as Ralph indicated earlier, to ramp up and ramp down. And here most recently, we've ramped down. We moved from 28 rigs in the Piceance down to eight. And so we have the ability to ramp down as necessary, depending on what kind of price signals that we're getting. So, the short answer to your question is that we certainly have the ability to ramp down if the price signals become very weak, as well as having the ability to ramp up if the price signals exceed our expectations in '11 and '12.
Lasan Johong – RBC Capital Markets: But I'm assuming that in order to plan for your CapEx spending, you've already contracted for a certain number of rigs next year. But I'm assuming also that you have some flexibility in whether you take those rigs into operation or not. So I'm wondering how much rig flexibility you have over and under your contracted position?
Steve Malcolm: We do have some rig flexibility and I'll let Ralph go into those details. But keep in mind that we have endeavored to do a little bit more hedging that allows us to implement the drilling program that we have in place. And so that takes some of the price risk off the table. Ralph?
Ralph Hill: I would agree that – the unique thing about our portfolio is that we can't flex it up and down without losing value. I think we're – many producers you see out there drilling full-out right now is because they have lease obligations or they have to satisfy a new JV agreement they just got into. Even in our newest area, we don't have expirations for several years in the Marcellus and those that do expire can be – 80% or 90% of those leases can be rolled over in a very minimal amount. What we try to do is we have a staggered amount – staggered contracting strategy in our rigs and most of them are not that long-term at this point. We have the option to make them longer-term. You always have the opportunity or option to lay the rigs down and pay the penalty, which happened last year. So there's a lot of flexibility in our portfolio. If we would have to flex down, the unique thing about us is that we wouldn't lose our value. And since – when I say lose our value, we wouldn't lose the value of the reserves; we wouldn't lose land; we wouldn't lose leases. So we can go up or down in that.
Lasan Johong – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. In the Marcellus, have you – what's the discussion, the tone and tenor of the discussion around the Keystone connector? And have you made any decisions as to whether you want to put a liquids processing plant on the western side of that liquids divide?
Steve Malcolm: Could you repeat that question please?
Lasan Johong – RBC Capital Markets: Yes. Wondering what kind of tone and tenor you've had in terms of discussions around the Keystone connector? In other words, is the market enthusiastic, kind of base, interested, not interested? Second, in terms of the western side of the liquids divide, has Williams made any decisions as to whether it wants to put a processing plant there or not?
Phil Wright: This is Phil Wright. We haven't decided on the need or location of an extraction plant just yet. In fact, one of the things that we're in dialogue with producers about is whether we want to make Keystone connector a wet gas line and perhaps locate extraction facilities eastward, if that makes sense, largely that will turn on the total scope of the project and how many people sign-on. In the ensuing period of time, one of the advantages we think we have is that we have a lot of blending capability and to the extent that it takes awhile to ramp up, to have ample liquids coming through, we have capacity to handle that as long as the heavies are knocked out in the southwest end. So, literally, we are evaluating the range of alternatives there and will optimize and select the most flexible one but we think that, again, an advantage is that we'll be able to ramp into that decision with more cards onto the table in the way of knowing exactly how much volume we're talking about, when it's going to come online and an ability to deal with a lot of liquids in the ensuing period of time.
Lasan Johong – RBC Capital Markets: That's very interesting. Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Seinly Aou [ph] from J.P. Morgan.
Seinly Aou – J.P. Morgan: Good morning guys. I have a question on your 2011 and 12 production growth, 12% and 16%. Is that just adding rigs from the Marcellus and do you see any shift in your rig count in other regions?
Steve Malcolm: It is essentially, it's primarily driven by the Piceance and the Marcellus. We are showing a modest uptick in rig count in both '11 and '12 to do that. We would average about four more rigs on average in the Piceance side of the world if in 2011. And we'd average about four more rigs in 2011 in the Marcellus. So it is an addition of that and you can see that, in our capital guidance, goes up in the year 2011 also.
Seinly Aou – J.P. Morgan: Okay. And I see you're still running four rigs in the Barnett. And when I look at your IRR returns, at current spot gas prices you're below 10% there. Why are you still running four rigs over there?
Steve Malcolm: Actually down to 3%. I don't – we'd have to – offline, we can talk about the return there. We think our return is higher than that, but we just dropped a rig down to three so that's at the point. The biggest problem we have in that Barnett area is basically facilities permits. It's not actually the drilling. It's just a matter of getting the drilling completion done. It's just a matter of various air permits and compression permits and pipeline permits. But we have dropped a rig in that area.
Seinly Aou – J.P. Morgan: Okay. It's not because of your return?
Steve Malcolm: Right.
Seinly Aou – J.P. Morgan: Okay. And shifting to your Overland Pass, do you expect the volume to ramp up to above like 200,000 barrels?
Alan Armstrong: This is Alan Armstrong. Yes, ultimately we do. And a lot of growth opportunity out there. You saw the ONEOK announcement on their plans to bring Bakken production down in 2013. We, of course, are proposing the Parachute TXP1 plant there in the Piceance and we also have the Opal TXP4 plant that is just be coming online here in the third quarter. So we have a lot of new production and a lot of new volumes that we can point to very specifically and beyond that, there's a lot of other opportunity for growth out of there, like places like the Uinta and a lot of new production. So what we have in there is very specific. We know exactly where it's coming from. And then on top of that, because Overland Pass is really the only system that is easily expandable out of the Rockies, we think it will capture any incremental volumes out of that area.
Seinly Aou – J.P. Morgan: Okay. So in terms of the incremental barrels, is it extracting the barrels from existing production that haven't been extracted or it's new – how much of it is from new production versus…?
Alan Armstrong: Most of that is from existing flowing production.
Seinly Aou – J.P. Morgan: So those barrels haven't been extracted?
Alan Armstrong: That's right. Sorry, the gas production with the NGLs are flowing; the extraction facilities are not in place. That's correct.
Seinly Aou – J.P. Morgan: Okay. Got you. Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Ted Durbin from Goldman Sachs.
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Hi. My question is really about capital allocation at E&P. You've always talked about the Piceance being very strong returns. Can you just talk about the returns that you're expecting in the Marcellus and how you would decide whether to ramp there rather than staying with ramping the Piceance, assuming that the commodity works out the way you think it will?
Steve Malcolm: The Piceance returns, in the Valley, are better than the Marcellus returns but not by that much. So the Marcellus returns we think are going to be very strong going forward. And we think as we really get into the newest area, the Susquehanna returns, that on an incremental basis, those will probably be potentially as good as the Piceance if not slightly better. So I think they'll probably end up being exactly the same. On the Highlands, returns are slightly lower than the Valley because the Highlands by definition has a couple extra thousand feet to drill through before we get to the level where you start in the Valley. So going forward, I think that you'll see that the Valley and the Marcellus will be side-by-side in the capital allocations followed thereafter by the Piceance Highlands. So capital allocation-wise, I think living within our cash flows, we feel we can ably execute on all three of those areas without hurting one or the other or trying to disadvantage one over the other.
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Thanks. And then just again on the Marcellus, how are you feeling about your acreage position now? I mean, do you think you're going to be big enough to reach sort of the operational synergies that you'd like to have? Would you need to add some more acreage?
Steve Malcolm: Well, we really feel good about the positions we have, particularly in Susquehanna and Clearfield Center and Westmoreland Counties. We also have a growing position in another county there that we haven't officially announced yet. I'd like to see us continue to add to that. As you can see, I think we were talking about 92,000 or so acres recently and now we're at 97,000 acres. So there's all kinds of opportunities up there. I think you see some of the operators that have a substantial amount of more acreage than we have, are starting to say, well, maybe we need a partner. Maybe we need to do a little bit more than what we're doing here and find somebody else. So since we're in the area in a major effort and based on the expertise we've developed in doing a world-class resource play like the Piceance, we hope that we can talk with some of those producers and maybe do some additional JVs and other things to expand our position or continue with what we've done in the past, which is grassroots leasing and/or acquisitions. I will say all that saying, as I look at Don Chappel, that we will do that in a very disciplined manner and we're going to make sure that we do everything we can and do what it takes to make sure our balance sheet stays very strong. But I see a lot of opportunities out there and I see some that are very attractive financially for us.
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you. And then if I could just ask a little bit of a detailed question, but you really had on the E&P side, the third party gathering and processing, so the costs have stepped up pretty significantly both in the first and second quarters. Is there anything going on there that we ought to be aware of? Most spreads just going down to PZ or what's – that trend has really picked up over the last couple of quarters?
Steve Malcolm: Is that our Willow Creek processing, I think? So that's full scale. But I'll have to – let me get back and make sure I gave you the right answer on that, but I think that's what that is.
Ted Durbin – Goldman Sachs: Okay. That's great. Thanks very much.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Carl Kirst from BMO Capital Markets.
Carl Kirst – BMO Capital Markets: Nice. Good morning, everybody. Ralph and actually, I guess, Steve, you mentioned – I just want to make sure I heard it correctly, that the first rig at Susquehanna is coming in February '11, meaning we'll probably not get first results from that area until mid-next year? Is that about right from a timeframe standpoint?
Ralph Hill: Well, there's actually, there's a rig there already.
Carl Kirst – BMO Capital Markets: Okay.
Ralph Hill: So what Steve meant is the new one, one of the new ones is going to – end of this month we'll probably dedicated more or end of August, I'm sorry, will be dedicated to the Rex JV area and then we'll have a new fit-for-purpose rig coming on early next year. There is a rig running that we inherited from Alta in Susquehanna. We've got currently 11 wells have been drilled up there. They are all horizontal wells. They are – I'm sorry, nine horizontals. They're all waiting on completion as they wait for the infrastructure to be developed. So we have a number of wells that have already been drilled that we're anxious to put on when the time is – when the infrastructure is done and we'll also continue to be drilling up there. So, hopefully, whenever that infrastructure is done, we're hearing late this year, could slip to early next year, we'll have some good results to start showing you about it. If you look at some of the producers right next to us, if you've seen their quarterly calls and other things, the results in that area are really doing very, very well and we're excited to start showing you that.
Carl Kirst – BMO Capital Markets: Great. No, appreciate the clarification. And then with respect to some of the other questions, obviously, you're continuing to look at acreage growth in the Marcellus. In order to reach those goals that you have laid out as far as the 12% composition going to give you the second largest basin, is that contingent upon any new acreage being added or can you do that with what is a fairly sizable acreage position right now?
Ralph Hill: It's really what we have – it's based on what we have today. We do have built in the forecast a little bit of what I would call blocking and tackling – a little bolt-on leasing here and there, but basically it's what we own today.
Carl Kirst – BMO Capital Markets: Great. And then one more if I could. And this is may be a question for you and Don. As you look at trying to do more acreage diversifications without having to perhaps tap the debt markets, we look at additional assets that could make their way into WPZ. And then one of the things we talked about prior was perhaps the Dew Point plants that are currently housed within E&P. And I just wanted to get a sense of what you guys are thinking about strategic necessity of continuing to hold those plants within E&P, if they, in fact, would make strategic sense to make a drop-down. And if so, is there any sense of size maybe that you can help us with there?
Steve Malcolm: Probably, Carl, there's not many details that we can offer you there. You are correct, that we do have Midstream assets embedded in our Piceance E&P operations. And we've acknowledged that fact and we've talked fleetingly about that opportunity, but – and it does exist and – but we wouldn't want to offer any guidance on that at this point.
Ralph Hill: It is actually a large complex.
Steve Malcolm: Just to remind you, it's about 1.2 Bcf a day of trading capacity. Because we've built all that out and have facilities and all that, that's why the cryo potential plant that Midstream is talking about is really a very economically-advantaged plant compared to what somebody else could do grass-roots there. So we feel very strong about the infrastructure we've built up there and the opportunities going forward.
Carl Kirst – BMO Capital Markets: Okay. No, understood, but no sense of magnitude of EBITDA, for instance, that those treating plants are throwing off?
Steve Malcolm: No. Carl, we're not prepared to offer anything like that.
Carl Kirst – BMO Capital Markets: All right. Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Holly Stewart from Howard Weil.
Holly Stewart – Howard Weil Incorporated: Hi guys. Good morning. Just a couple of quick ones. I guess, Ralph, I'll start with you. The ramp – the data in one of the presentations this morning, the nice ramp in the Marcellus, I think my notes from the Analyst Day – of course, that was pre-acquisition – have you trying to get to 100 million a day in the next five years. Now you're saying 500 million a day by 2015, so obviously very impressive numbers. And the second largest producing basin for you guys by 2013, which would surpass the PRB volumes in a relatively short period of time. Can you just give us a little color on how you get there? I mean, I see the ramp and rig count, but any other specifics?
Ralph Hill: Well, Holly, we really believe we can get there with what we own today and we're looking to be at about eight rigs next year. And as I mentioned, we're two currently; we're adding another one in August, so that will be three in the Marcellus. And then our current projections for '12 – of course, it's a couple of years away – show us at about 14 rigs. So really it's just looking at what we own, adding rigs, building out the infrastructure and doing what we do – taking basically the Piceance model and moving it there. So we feel that that kind of rig count and since we're not giving guidance past '12 – but that rig count stays at basically in that range going forward and that will get us to that 500 million-type level.
Holly Stewart – Howard Weil Incorporated: Okay. Do you have a Marcellus production number for the quarter? I mean, I know it's probably pretty minimal, but do you have that breakout?
Ralph Hill: You know, we're only producing – it's a good growth. I mean, right now we're producing 5 million or 6 million a day, basically. So it's very – as you know, we just got in. The Rex JV has drilled some wells. A lot of facilities are just now coming on so we have a lot of wells just waiting to be turned on. I think we have half of the wells in the Rex JV are just now coming on based to as we finished out our compression and gathering projects.
Holly Stewart – Howard Weil Incorporated: Anything wet over there yet?
Ralph Hill: No. No, we're still basically in the dry window.
Holly Stewart – Howard Weil Incorporated: Okay. And then I guess just on the – you know, you lay out the ramp in production over the next couple of years. I know we've already hit this, but as a four-handle – I mean, are you still comfortable doing this with a four-handle on gas heading into '11?
Ralph Hill: Well, we've upped our hedges to about 50%. So really the comfort level is – and we've shown the economics we believe are pretty strong at that level still. But it will be a function of what our cash flows are as we continue to help – do our part for WMB to manage the balance sheet also. So it will be a function really of the cash flows. I think you see our forecasts are more, I think, in the $5 range going up over the next several years to maybe $6 on a NYMEX-type range. So it's not a large price increase. I know it's in our slide deck somewhere, but those are the – we're not seeing a huge uptick in pricing. But we're writing more our numbers based on the, I think, combined with our hedges and our price forecast going forward, so I don't have right in front of me.
Holly Stewart – Howard Weil Incorporated: Got you. Okay. And then I guess, Alan, can you give any specifics on what's going on with Perdido Norte? And sorry if I missed this, but just – I know there's been a delay due to the moratorium. Can you give us any color?
Alan Armstrong: Well, we really have to let the producers speak for themselves on that. There was – we had a hydrate in our line that was affecting the Boombang Nansen pipeline and so we – during construction process, we got water into the riser and that formed a hydrate. And we have remediated that. And so that production will be coming back on at Boombang, but that was part of that construction. But the actual delay that is experienced right now is related to operations from the actual production platform that we're not involved with.
Holly Stewart – Howard Weil Incorporated: Okay. And then just one macro …
Alan Armstrong: Let me add to that just so I don't leave people the wrong impression there. As far as we know, that is not related to the drilling moratorium itself. In other words, it's not related to any delay in drilling. The well is drilled; it's a matter of getting those production facilities up and running.
Holly Stewart – Howard Weil Incorporated: Up and running, okay. And then just a macro question, you guys talked about your exposure to the Rockies basin. Can you just give us basis differential – sorry – can you just give us a little color on what's going on right now in the Rockies? I mean, it's widened and I guess we wouldn't have expected it to. So can you just give us from a pipeline and production standpoint, give us your perspective?
Steve Malcolm: Well, there was several things that happened just for the May/June time period. And when it did get up to a couple of times, it came closer to $0.80, $0.90 on a daily basis. But we really had some – we had some transportation maintenance; we had record hydro; we had a strong weather, as in very warm weather in the eastern part of the United States and we had cooler weather in the western part. So a number of things like that just kind of combined, I think, to make the cash basis on a monthly basis seem like the basis was increasing. So going forward, we think all those things work themselves out and normalize, a little more normal weather patterns. Obviously, the transportation and maintenance goes away. The hydro goes away and we see, that's why you look at the forward curve, it's more like in that $0.50 range. So we looked it really as just kind of several things lined up together to make a blip on the screen of a higher basis for a couple months.
Holly Stewart – Howard Weil Incorporated: Got it. Alright.
Alan Armstrong: Watching the ACO [ph] pricing level is a really good indicator for the kind of pressure that is coming into supply in that Western area as we add hydro and cooler weather. So Opal tends to have to eventually compete with ACO [ph] pricing and that's been very low.
Holly Stewart – Howard Weil Incorporated: Got it. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Rick Gross from Barclays Capital.
Rick Gross – Barclays Capital: Good morning. Yes, I've got one on, we'll call it the Overland Pass corridor. And that the slides indicate that you think you'll be able to take it up to full capacity, which is over 100,000 barrels more a day going into the Conway area. ONEOK just announced 15,000 barrels a day expansion on Sterling. What I'm trying to figure out where the incremental barrels that come into Conway – and there may be some that sneak in the back door down enterprise from the Marcellus – where that goes. Because the incremental user in the Midwest is already an ethane EP mix user and the marginal barrel conversions in the Gulf. So how do I think about more barrels into Conway and how they get utilized, dispersed from growth in Overland Pass?
Alan Armstrong: Rick, this is Alan. I think what you have to look at is the fact that there's been a long-term consistent spread between Conway and Belvieu on ethane that supports some type of infrastructure development. And that remains with the low-cost transportation available on Overland Pass, we think it remains one of the cheapest incremental sources of ethane into the Belvieu area. So we think there's quite a few things that will drive an answer to that bottleneck that you speak to.
Rick Gross – Barclays Capital: Okay. Alternative is there's a mistral pipeline going up to NOVA Geoffrey [ph]which consumes 180,000 barrels a day of ethane. And those folks are worried. Is the expansion of Overland Pass and some of the things around that system that ONEOK has indicated – and this may be a ONEOK question – is that project, Alliance taking wet barrels versus Prairie Rose, all of those things – are these competing projects, kind of like the Bakken [ph] and the Marcellus or are these individual projects that are stand-alone and there's a lot of barrels coming out of the Bakken?
Alan Armstrong: Well, I think you'd have to, again, direct that to ONEOK in that regard, but I do think there's a lot of barrels. We're certainly very well aware of the ethane demand in the hole there in Canada and we think that that presents an opportunity for U.S. ethane; but, as you know, that's a pretty expensive ticket. So – but still, compared to the other alternatives that you look to for additional incremental ethane supplies, like the Marcellus and so forth, we think it can still compete effectively, because we think Geoffrey and the Alberta ethane consumers have a high demand there and have a very low-cost efficient infrastructure up there, that's a good place to consume some of that ethane. So I guess what I would tell you is I think Overland Pass will provide a connection for supplies, whether it is ultimately for feeding ethane supplies into Canada or whether it is to Mont Belvieu. But I think Overland Pass clearly provides that connection for the production out of the Rockies into either one of those markets, ultimately.
Rick Gross – Barclays Capital: Okay. Financial question, we've indicated that we're going to, at least for awhile, live within cash flows on the E&P company. We're going to fund the Canadian expansion with international cash. We've got CTLT [ph] cut money coming into the parent. We mentioned, in a variety of ways, kind of balance sheet, protect the balance sheet kind of thing, which are into investment grade. The question I have is, at what level of balance sheet coverage – are we looking at BBB flat kind of, BBB plus kind of metrics before we get to the point where we can put major stock buybacks into the value creation tool kit or is there a time frame when this might materialize? Because there's going to be cash buildup, you're going to have choices. One of those choices in a down market, people mentioning $4 gas prices, would be to buy in stock relative to spend it to create value per share E&P-wise.
Don Chappel: Rick, this is Don. I understand the question. I would say that we're certainly looking at all the options. I would say that with low commodity prices and the down market, our credit metrics don't look nearly so good as they look in a more, I'll call it normal market. So I think one of the challenges is in a down market, it's even more difficult to buy back stock without a ratings consequence. So we're continuously looking at all the options and looking at where we stand within the credit framework. But you also have to look at what those metrics look like in that low environment. And again, the agencies also not just look at the environment in which we're living, but also look at an even more dire environment so, as they make their ratings decision. So it's hard to answer your question other than to give you some of the considerations. But I would say we're always looking at all the options. But I think stock buyback is something that's certainly not on the table this year. We'd like to have the flexibility to be able to consider that at a future date, but certainly it's not now. And I guess we'll take a look at where everything lines up in 2011 and beyond and see if that's something that's appropriate.
Rick Gross – Barclays Capital: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Faisel Khan from Citi.
Faisel Khan – Citi: On the E&P side, in your Analyst meeting, you talked about the EURs or the ultimate recoveries improving in the Highlands and you gave some data on your best to date wells. Ralph, can you give us an idea of where those EURs are trending right now, where you are today?
Ralph Hill: Really, no change. So we just added the rigs, one earlier this year to get to two, and now we're just in the process of where we just brought our third and fourth on. So we're just in the midst of the drilling program. So we still believe that we're in the areas that we want to be in, that we're in a little sweeter spots in some of these areas and that we hope to see that the trend you saw will continue and normalize out to be at better levels than they were in the past. But it's just a little early this year.
Faisel Khan – Citi: Okay. So you still think that that trend actually continues upwards?
Ralph Hill: Well, we felt pretty good about it and I don't know if it goes upwards from there, but basically, we'd like to at least get to where those were. And those were – that was a nice uptick from where we'd been last couple of years when we were still in the process of delineating the field.
Faisel Khan – Citi: Okay. Do you have any update on the exploration wells that you may have drilled recently?
Ralph Hill: Well, there's one in the Paradox that was drilled by our partner and that has been completed – or drilled but not completed yet. And we're looking to put a very large volume frac on that and a large amount of sand and water that we've done in any of the previous wells. So that will happen sometime this summer. And we have completed a – one exploration – well, we've drilled one exploration well in the San Juan Basin that we've looked at. In the Mancos, we're in the process of drilling our second, but we're going to complete those at the same time and that will be later this fall. And that's the Mancos shale type look we're doing down there.
Faisel Khan – Citi: Okay. Got you. On the natural gas liquid side, seeing your NGL sales from your processing trend down in the quarter, what's your expectation for the third quarter in terms of those NGL sales?
Alan Armstrong: Well, about almost half of that was from an inventory shift, so just timing of sales. So kind of looking at our production as a piece of that. And then we had, as I mentioned earlier, we had one of the big deepwater wells – or deepwater platforms down in the Gulf that affected our volume as well. But a lot of that was just timing of inventory shift. And so we obviously wouldn't expect that to recur other than just the normal shifts in inventory that we see. But that was the largest driver in that. So nothing fundamentally is shifting on that in our business.
Faisel Khan – Citi: So the 272 of that million gallons of NGLs sold in the quarter, that's kind of a steady-state number, do you think?
Alan Armstrong: No, it'd probably be best to average the first quarter and second quarter to get to a more steady run rate there. Because that had the inventory shift from one quarter to the next in it.
Faisel Khan – Citi: Okay. Got you. On the balance sheet and specifically the cash that you have in the international part of the business roughly, I think it's roughly $450 million or maybe $0.5 billion, I know you've talked about using some of that cash to invest in the Canadian Midstream operations. Would you also consider using that cash in maybe Canadian upstream assets?
Steve Malcolm: No.
Faisel Khan – Citi: Sorry. I didn't hear that.
Steve Malcolm: No.
Faisel Khan – Citi: Okay. Got you. All right. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Ray Deacon from Pritchard Capital.
Ray Deacon – Pritchard Capital: Thanks for taking my question. Ralph, I was wondering, just curious what your thoughts were on the Rex JV in terms of deliverability out of that area? Like how much do you think you can scale the area? I know you're very early on in the development there. And I guess just a general comment on the, I guess, 7,000 or 5,000 acre increase. Are you kind of more interested in the southwest part of the Marcellus or the Northeast at this point?
Ralph Hill: Well, we're more in the middle to the northeast part of the play, as you can see. And on the Rex side, we like what we've seen so far. I don't know the exact size of that yet, so I shouldn't, let us continue – we just took over operations. We drilled our – we're on a process of drilling our second well, so give us a little time on that to let you know what we think we can get there. But primarily, where you see our activity is from the Westmoreland and Clearfield Center Counties going out towards Susquehanna on our area of emphasis at this point.
Ray Deacon – Pritchard Capital: Okay. Got it. And the primary takeaway I believe is going to end up being Equitrans, right? Is that a fair statement in Center Clearfield, Westmoreland?
Ralph Hill: I think so. There's some other opportunities in there too, but I think that's one of the primary areas.
Ray Deacon – Pritchard Capital: Okay. Got it. Thanks very much.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Andrew Gundlach from Arnhold Bleichroeder.
Andrew Gundlach – Arnhold Bleichroeder: Good morning. If I look at your guidance where you're on the E&P side of taking your volumes from 1200, 1250, 1500, 1700 and what you said about the Marcellus, Steve, it sounds like about half of that growth will come from the Marcellus drilling and about half of that growth from the Piceance. Is that the way to look at it?
Steve Malcolm: Yes. Yes, Andrew.
Andrew Gundlach – Arnhold Bleichroeder: Okay. And the numbers that you gave on the Marcellus, which are impressive – 500 by – would you say 2015? Can you help me think about how that will translate into proved reserves over that time? So, will the Marcellus by then be bigger than the San Juan, which is about 500 or so, if I remember correctly? I mean, how will this translate into proved reserves, is the question?
Steve Malcolm: Well, we can't really give that. Yes, I can guide you to the press release, which we thought with the Alta deal and the unnamed additional 8,000 acres, we thought that has a potential. And that's not proved reserves; that those two transactions just by themselves had a potential of, like, 1.3 Tcf, I think it was in the press release. But we can't guide on proved reserves at this time at all. But we felt very good on the potential of the area. So that would be a substantial addition if those things would come true, to our proved reserve base.
Andrew Gundlach – Arnhold Bleichroeder: I understand, okay. And then the other question I have is – I guess it's for Don and Steve. WPZ now has an under 6% yield and in my opinion, is one of the best positioned companies in the Midstream space out there. How can use that equity as an acquisition currency to increase your cash flows in ways that you could never do before. And thus increase your cash flows into WMB parent to deal with the opportunities that you're speaking about?
Don Chappel: Andrew, this is Don. I agree, it's a terrific currency, well regarded by the market. I think the key is finding quality assets; assets that we like and then at a value that creates value for both WPZ and WMB. So we're certainly mindful of that opportunity and certainly would like to be able to take advantage of it, but it will be depending on those considerations.
Andrew Gundlach – Arnhold Bleichroeder: I understand. But you see it strategically the way I'm thinking about it, is that correct?
Don Chappel: Yes.
Andrew Gundlach – Arnhold Bleichroeder: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Craig Shere from Tudor.
Craig Shere – Tuohy Brothers Investment Research: From Tuohy Investment – Tuohy Brothers Investment Research. Hi, guys, I missed a little of the call so I apologize if there's some redundancy here, but I know you were speaking to the opportunities with commodity pricing and recovering ethane prices. But in some basins, I think the ethane can be as low as maybe one-third of the mix, but in your Midstream, it's perhaps closer to 50%. Can you talk about the ethane mix that your equity NGL exposures have going forward, as you convert some things to fee-based and put on new projects?
Don Chappel: Sure. First of all, you are right – our ethane mix today is about 50% and people have all kinds of different mix formulas for when they get to a consolidated barrel. But our number is around 50% and in terms of shift, things that might move that over time, we do have – we had had some contract changes in the San Juan that heavy-up our barrel a little bit and as we do the deepwater projects and those are percent of liquid contracts for the most part, those barrels are pretty heavy if you are – sorry, that mix is pretty heavy on those streams coming in. So we'll see a little bit there. But as big as our portfolio is, it takes a lot to move that very much, as you can imagine. So I wouldn't expect any dramatic movement in that. What I would suggest that from an MB investor perspective, that you take a look at is the fact that much of our ethane, a little over half of our ethane, on a – if you looked at our commodity exposure, is going into our ethylene cracking business at Geismar, where we consume about 30,000 barrels a day there. So for some piece of that, you really need to look all the way through the ethylene pricing if you're trying to get to a Williams earnings impact on that but we do continue to do fee-based contracts but that won't necessarily, just a straight up fee-base contract won't necessarily change our mix; it will just lower our overall exposure to commodity – but to both the heavies and to ethane.
Craig Shere – Tuohy Brothers Investment Research: Sure. I appreciate that explanation.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Brad Lundy from Ivory Capital.
Brad Lundy – Ivory Capital: Good morning. I certainly apologize if this has been addressed earlier in the call, but as you pointed, Don, the PZ transaction has been well regarded by the market and you can certainly see it with the equity up 50% year-to-date. Unfortunately, it has not translated into the same appreciation in the MB side. And I'm curious from your point of view at what point the Board starts to reevaluate the current structure?
Steve Malcolm: Yes, this is Steve. You're right – the PZ deal has not yet translated into good things to WMB. We think it will over time. We think that as we grow PZ, as we grow distributions – I mean, we wouldn't have created this vehicle had we not had intentions to grow it over time. And so there are a lot of opportunities out there. We've talked about some of those opportunities in our last few calls and during our Investor Day; but while the market hasn't yet appreciated the transaction from an MB standpoint, we believe that it will over time. And I think it's up to us to execute on the PZ opportunity, to use that wonderful currency. And we believe that as we do that successfully, that the wonderful cash flow aspect of this structure will benefit Williams in a big way.
Brad Lundy – Ivory Capital: Is there a defined timeline as to which the current structure will be reevaluated?
Steve Malcolm: We – I mean, truly, we look at strategic options at every Board meeting that we have. So there's not a specific timeline because we're always looking at strategic options that might make sense.
Don Chappel: This is Don to just add to Steve comments. Again, when we developed the WPZ transformational transaction, we did not expect that we would get great lift in the WMB stock price as a result. We really thought it was more a long-term strategic issue, to provide that advantaged and reliable capital source to our Midstream and Pipeline business and thereby enable them to grow at a much more rapid rate than they would absent that access to capital. And that really has come true. So, you can see Midstream and Pipeline is now developing the opportunities without fear that we cannot finance them. So it's really turned our Midstream and Pipeline team loose to really develop all the opportunities that add value and do so on a disciplined basis. Again, I'd just remind you that when we did the transaction and really through this date, our earnings did not change, our cash flows did not change. We highlighted the value of those two businesses in WPZ, but our earnings and cash flows did not change in the near-term. But we're very confident that, over the course of a few years, that we will see very high returns from those incremental investments that are made in those two businesses.
Brad Lundy – Ivory Capital: Indeed. Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Don.
Operator: This concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to your presenters for any additional or closing remarks.
Steve Malcolm: Yes, this is Steve. Thank you for participating on the call. We think that we have a very bright future. The opportunities, the growth opportunities are extraordinary. And we look forward to a very bright future and look forward to talking more about those opportunities in the future. Thank you.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Also as usual, we've put together our data book which includes the normal information we provide each quarter. So, this morning, on the website williams.com, you should be able to find the slides, the data book, the press releases and the 10-Q, which was filed this morning as well.  At the beginning of the slide deck is the forward-looking statements on slide number two and the disclaimer on oil and gas reserves on slide number three. Those are important and integral to our remarks this morning, so please review those. Also included are various non-GAAP numbers which have been reconciled back to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those schedules are available and follow the presentation. As I suspect the call today should be rather brief because as you know we will be hosting the Analyst day in New York next Tuesday. At that time, all of our senior management will be there to go into a much more robust look at each of our businesses.  So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.
Steve Malcolm: Thank you, Travis. Welcome to our first quarter call. Thank you for your interest in our company, and as Travis mentioned our discussion today should be very crisp as we are looking forward to our analyst and investor day next week in New York, and at that we will be talking more about strategies and tactics and the various growth opportunities at that meeting.  So, this would be pretty quick, so looking at the first slide, slide four. A few of our first quarter results and accomplishments of course, first quarter recurring adjusted earnings per share is $0.36, which is up 64% over the first quarter of '09 results as well recurring segment profit of $589 million; it's 43% higher than our ' 09, first quarter.  We increased our quarterly dividend by 14%. Of course, we completed our transformational transaction, which created a much larger WPZ. We've grown our position to Marcellus by adding another 11,000 acres in Columbia County, Pennsylvania, which brings our total acreage position in the Marcellus to above 45,000 acreage at a weighted average cost of about $2800 per acre.  Began startup operations at Perdido Norte in the Western deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and I believe on Monday of this week we brought Transco's Mobile South expansion project into service adding deliverability to Southern markets.  Turning to slide five, we are offering guidance for 2012 for the first time, but this shows that we are all about returning to significant value creation. Let me go through the prior guidance here. In 2010, our prior guidance mid-point was $1.35 you see here were to $1.28, and that's driven by obviously changes in our commodity price assumptions.  Crude oil from $75 to $80, but Henry Hub nat gas from $575 to $450, and so that creates the change that we're reflecting here. As well, in 2011, $1.83 versus $1.87, driven by an increase in crude oil prices from $80 to $86, but nat gas going from $650 to $550.  And then we're showing for the first time again, mid-point guidance for 2012 of $2.38, that all represents about a 36% CAGR with respect to our earnings per share. Slide six, please, shows the higher segment profit growth and shows the relative contributions by WPZ and our E&P business.  And overall, you see a 78% increase in total recurring adjusted segment profit over this period of time. Slide seven, we've talked about our many growth opportunities, and as you see here, we're expecting to invest over $5 billion in growth in the 2010, 2012 timeframe. This slide is one that the investors are appreciative of, in that we do break out our capital by business unit and by category -- capital for maintenance of facilities, capital for maintenance of volumes and growth projects.  So, obviously, a lot of wonderful, exciting growth opportunities during this three year timeframe. Slide eight just gives you -- reminds you of our premier E&P portfolio, anchored by our position in the Piceance. And we are a proven optimizer of resource plays; year-after-year, a leader in terms of costs. We believe that the Piceance is competitive with the best of the Shale plays.  And I think we have a unique portfolio that allows us to ramp-up or ramp-down, depending on the price signals that the market is offering. Slide nine; if you look at all three of our business units, probably there are more growth opportunities in the midstream space. And again, we'll talk more about these in New York next week, but looking at this map, we have the growth opportunities in our traditional basins.  Out West, we have Wamsutter TXP4 or Echo Springs TXP4, adding about 350 million a day of processing capacity, which will come on in late 2010. We have the Paradox Basin, where we continue to build toward a large scale midstream solution for producers in this promising basin. And then we're looking forward to a full year benefit of the Willow Creek facility, which is a course of 450 cubic foot per day processing facility.  In the Gulf, Perdido Norte went into operation in late first quarter 2010, and so we'll be getting the benefit of that project. Probably the most exciting opportunities are in the Marcellus, and there we -- of course, done the Laurel Mountain Midstream, LLC. We've done the Springville project, but we just have a lot more opportunities, as producers seek to focus their resources on their E&P activities and in many cases, they are looking to outsource some of their midstream requirements.  Slide 10 just gives you the universe of gas pipeline projects, and there are a lot of base hits here, obviously, and the outlook is excellent for steady, stable cash flows backed by customers with high quality credit. So, this is a business where you won't see us taking big risks, but all of these projects are backed by our customers. Before I conclude, let me cover a couple of questions that we have received from investors over the last couple of weeks.  One relates to the Gulf of Mexico situation. Are we faced with any potential exposure to the efforts to clean up the oil slick? Is our production impacted in any way? And the simple answer is no. Our assets have not been affected by loss of production, have not been affected by the spill, have not been affected by any of the cleanup activities, and we have no reason to believe that they will.  The BP platform was the drilling platform that was not connected to any infrastructure. We don't anticipate any problems related to the spill. We did limit work on Canyon Station just as a precaution, but again, we don't see any impact to our operations in the Gulf. As well, there have been questions about the WMC Exchange Offer, any updates there on timing?  And I would just say, again, that representatives of Williams and WPZ have commenced discussions with representatives of the Conflicts Committee, of the Board of Directors of the WMZ general partner regarding the exchange offer at the ratio that was discussed earlier. And the parties are considering structural alternatives for completion of the exchange in a single transaction, including without limitation, a potential merger transaction.  So, we're still moving ahead. We would expect a second quarter kind of close. It could slip into third quarter, but I think it will still be done on the basis that we've essentially described to you in the past. Concluding then on slide 11, we do believe that Williams is a winning value creator, and I think the key points for you to have in mind -- we've never seen as many growth opportunities that we are seeing today. Those will clearly generate value for the Company.  And I think the fact that we have gone forward with the structural transformation that we closed earlier in the first quarter will ensure that we're able to capture these many growth opportunities. The integrated business model is working well for us. The Piceance Basin, where our production is over 600 million a day, is a world class resource, as good as any of the Shale plays. We are committed to going forward in a very disciplined manner, and a strong growth outlook, and we expect 2012 recurring adjusted earnings per share to exceed our record 2008 results.  So with that, we look forward to seeing you next week and I'll be happy to take any questions that you have this morning.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions). First is Steven Maresca of Morgan Stanley.
Steven Maresca - Morgan Stanley : First question, you talked about production levels that you think will ramp-up throughout the rest of the year, and the first quarter was about 1.1 in the U.S. Bcf a day. Are you -- can you talk about all where you are right now, and then in the second quarter have you started that ramp-up and are you above that level?
Ralph Hill: This is Ralph Hill. Yes, we have started it up. Let me just go through our volumes just for a minute to take advantage of that question. We did drop last year from 28 rigs in the Piceance down to about as low as seven. We're currently at about eight in the Valley and two in the Highlands, and we'll add a few rigs in both those areas during the course of the year. We also deferred about 70 completions in the Valley, and those things are all starting to be completed now.  We've got a few more -- a couple more rigs running, so we do expect and we have seen our volumes are starting to turn back to where we'll be essentially for the year, will be flat with 2009 volumes. So, we do see that come out, and so we're right on plan, right where we thought we'd be, and the volumes are starting to turn back around a little bit.
Steven Maresca - Morgan Stanley : Okay. As a follow-up to that, you guys obviously added some acreage in the Marcellus. What is your ultimate goal in the area over the next year or two?
Ralph Hill: Well, we like the area, as Steve mentioned. We now are about 45,000 acres. We'd like that position to continue to grow. I think a meaningful position would be about double that at some point. Again, we'll be disciplined, but we see good opportunities. We've been able to grow our -- double the position we started out with, which was the 22,000 acres with Rex. And we would like to continue to grow our position and we'll continue to work towards that in a disciplined manner.
Steven Maresca - Morgan Stanley : Okay and final quick question. I see that you guys in the NGL to Crude Relationship and your forecast kind of tails off a little bit. Is there a reason you're thinking that we'll see a weakening of that relationship?
Steve Malcolm: Really that's just driven by continued strength in crude oil to natural gas, and so we're not predicting that bigger change really in the gas to NGL ratio; so basically, our margins are held fairly flat on a pure gas to NGL relationship. We did have very strong ethane demand going into the first quarter, and that was subsided a little bit as there were some ethylene crackers being out towards the end of the first quarter. So that's tapered demand. We've certainly seen ethane fall off a little bit in terms of how strong ratio was earlier in the first quarter.
Steven Maresca - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Thanks a lot and look forward to seeing you next week.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Carl Kirst, BMO Capital.
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital : Actually, if I could, Ralph, just piggyback off the Marcellus. The 11,000 acres that were acquired, are you basically building out separate from your Rex position but near the Rex acreage, or you going off in a different area? Can you give us some color as to where you're looking? 2800?
Ralph Hill: We're doing both. We have added what's called bolt-ons, and those clear fields, Westmoreland, and Center Counties, which is where Rex is. We've also picked up some acreage in Columbia County now and got some acreage in Bradford and Susquehanna. So we're kind of -- we're staying in the Northeastern part, from the middle to the Northeastern part at this point, but adding to our position around the Rex Basin, and we're seeing other areas we like and trying to get sizable blocks that we can drill in efficient manners.
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital : And then this is sort of a combination question for both Ralph and Alan. Just as far as we look at the Shale map and we look at the opportunity, just noting that the Eagle Ford is not on that list and then maybe we will talk more about it next week, maybe but is that something that we should be keeping as perhaps optionality of where you guys might go? What is right now what you're seeing in the Marcellus and the deal flow that you're a part of right now is basically too compelling to look elsewhere.  Ralph Hill Well, from the E&P perspective we do like the Eagle Ford. We've looked at in a number of opportunities there and continued to do that. So, w will obviously if we can put something there that makes good economic sense. We'd like to be there.  Alan Armstrong On the midstream side, we've got a real opportunity there right now with our Markham that we just completed the expansion on, and we have frac capacity, transport capacity out of that plant as well. So, pretty rare situation there what we've got available capacity that we basically would just be pushing out some very lean offshore volumes that are coming into Markham today, and that so we would have space available for the Eagle Ford and we're working with other pipeline including Transco to see what other capabilities are there to get that gas transported and accessed through the Eagle Ford. So, the McMullen lateral that Transco has is very well positioned right along there, and so we think we got some great opportunities and some competitive advantage there in that base. 
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital : Great and maybe last question if I could really fulfill on the pipeline side. As we look at the range of the EBIT guidance if you will, can you help me better get a sense of what's going to push pipelines to the higher or to the lower end of the range. Is it specific regional bases? Is it interruptible volumes? Is it just simply price of gas on retained fuel?
Phillip Wright : Carl, this is Phill. You kind of put out there on the table the range of some things that are possible, but I would take off the table the variability on like basis differentials and interruptible because on the down side, about the only spot we have that's vulnerable to that is in the production area on Transco under the IT Feed rate. And we've got a pretty healthy decline baked into our forecast on the interruptible in that end, but it's only a modest piece of the total cost of service on Transco.  Just for round numbers, in the ballpark of $60 million, $66 million. So it's not a huge part of the cost to service on Transco. On the upside, it will be a successful completion of growth projects, and so we'll have expansions that will bump that up along the way. And then we're always seeking opportunities to achieve better outcomes on our costs. But we'll just have to take a look at that. We have to come back in for rate cases in 2013 on both Northwest and Transco. We have come back provisions on both of those.
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital : Thanks for the color, guys.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Ted Durbin, Goldman Sachs.
Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs : I just had a question -- first question is on the dividend and just thinking about cash. The shareholders get a pretty big dividend hike in percentage terms, maybe not in dollar terms, but maybe just walk through how you're thinking about your payout ratio and generally returning cash to shareholders? Don Chappel  This is Don Chappel. Good morning. Well, as you know, we did not increase the dividend in 2009 as a result of the global financial crisis and recession. Following the WPZ transformation, and the very stable business and the growth that we enjoy from WPZ and the growing distribution, we felt that an increase in the dividend was appropriate, and we thought at a level that was exceeding the level of increase that we passed on, back in the 2007, 2008 period. So that's how we're thinking about it.  I think it will be a function of those reliable cash flows coming up from WPZ as well as alternative uses of cash. But I do believe Steve and the Board also agree that dividend is an important part of the total picture for our investors. So, I'm not sure if that helps. We don't have a formula, but we are committed to the dividend and increasing the dividend over time.
Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs : Now it's helpful. And then if I could just come back to the E&P side, you raised the mid-point of the CapEx guidance. Can you just give us a little more detail on what's behind that and just the moving pieces there? Steve Malcolm Yes, essentially it was just some of the lease acquisitions that we've done and exploration opportunities we're doing. And we're going to break that out next week to show that the base development side -- base development drilling is about the same as we were. It's just we've in guidance now; we're putting in some additional CapEx that we anticipate we will spend on new opportunities.
Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs : That's helpful. 
Operator: Holly Stewart at Howard Weil has the next question.
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil: Just real quickly a macro question really, for Alan. Alan, we've seen a lot of producers, most recently, Chesapeake yesterday, talking about shifting quite a bit of their capital from gas toward liquids. What is your thought on this change, and just really as far as kind of the potential impact towards the liquids market? Alan Armstrong Right. Well, certainly, NGL margins are very beneficial to producers today and adding a lot of value. But I would certainly say in the case where they're going into new exploration areas like Chesapeake announced that that's a long ways away from actually producing NGLs into the market. And a lot of things will change over time by the time those NGLs get into the market. So, there's a lot of infrastructure.  The Marcellus is a great example of that, where a lot of rich gas, but we're a long ways away from having the infrastructure available to get those NGLs into the market. And so I think over time, I think if we continue to see high margins, we should continue to see NGL supplies increase. And on the heavier's end, I don't see that being a big problem because as long as crude to gas ratios remain where they are, that will still be a favored product in terms of and gasoline into those markets.  On the ethane side, we certainly would have to see some expansion in market. We're seeing that today through conversion of heavy and cracking capacity, but eventually, there's a limit to that. Our hope, obviously, would be that we see an opportunity to long-term to expand demand in the U.S. on the petchem side, if those NGLs continue to be such favored relative to naphtha and other products that are cracked globally.  So, certainly though, I would say the fundamentals are that we've got strong margins. We should expect supply to be chasing that margin, and I think that's what we'll see for some period of time.
Operator: Up next we'll hear from Faisel Khan, Citi.
Faisel Khan - Citi : If I'm looking at the -- Ralph, if I'm looking at the volumes in the Piceance sequentially from fourth quarter to first quarter, the drop-off seem a little bit steeper and I think you said you deferred 70 well completions. But can you talk a little bit about the steeper drop-off sequentially from fourth quarter to first quarter?
Ralph Hill: Yes. We did defer completions, but the fourth quarter versus the first quarter has a -- the fourth quarter had about $50 million of positive accounting adjustments in there, which really should have been spread out through the year, just normal adjustments that come through and they kind of were all lumped in the fourth quarter.  So, that volume should have been spread out flatter during the second, third, and fourth quarters. So if you smooth that out as it should have been, then we actually had a sequential decline of only about 2%. And that will be -- you'll see that catch up during the year. So the sequential decline looked like it was more about 11% or 8% to 11%, depending on which basin you're looking at. In reality, that was about a 2% decline.
Faisel Khan - Citi : Okay, got you. And then I guess, if we're looking at your exploration project for this year versus the last two years, I mean, how would you compare this year's budget to the last couple of years? Would you consider it kind of more robust, the same? Or are you guys hunting a little bit more than you were in the past?
Ralph Hill: It's more robust. And it's -- and we also, in the past, we've just added as we've added deals, we put that into guidance. And this year, we're putting it into guidance before we're actually adding deals, just to let you know the flavor of what we think and anticipate we could spend.
Faisel Khan - Citi : Okay, and then on a total kind of corporate sense, if you're looking at your strategic opportunities and you guys have a strong liquidity position, I know you said that you were going to be disciplined about how you allocate your capital, but is there a preference of where these dollars go, whether it's midstream or upstream? How are you guys looking at those sorts of opportunities right now?
Don Chappel : Faisel, this is Don. We see WPZ to be self-funding; while Williams could make incremental investment in WPZ, it's more likely that the excess capital that we have would be pointed toward E&P or some other corporate use versus plowing it back into midstream or gas pipelines in light of the very advantaged sources of capital that the MLP space, WPZ enjoys.
Faisel Khan - Citi : Okay, got you. I guess on that point, looking -- if you were to -- I was going through your data book, and I didn't see sort of a breakdown of what Williams C-Corp as a standalone entity had in terms of net debt after at the end of the quarter or cash on hand. I think I saw some of the data, but isn't WMB as a C-Corp have a much higher level of liquidity and a much better balance sheet than it did in the past?
Don Chappel: Williams has about $2.3 billion of debt at the corporate level, in addition to the debt that's consolidated at WPZ, and it's -- and the pipeline debt that's part of WPZ. In terms of total liquidity, it's largely -- cash is about the same as what you've seen before. It is in the data book; I'll find a page here. It's reported the ending cash of $1.64 billion.  Beginning of the year, it was $1.86 billion, so still very substantial cash balance. Again, about $500 million of that's offshore. International hasn't been taxed in the U.S. That's earmarked for our Canadian expansions, which we didn't talk about today but we'll talk about next week. And we have some exciting opportunities up in Canada.  So we take that out of the equation, and then the balance is available for our opportunities here in the U.S., and largely focused on corporate and E&P opportunities.
Faisel Khan - Citi : So, C-Corp debt is $2.3 billion and $1.6 billion of cash? Don Chappel Including the international cash.
Faisel Khan - Citi : Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Operator: And we'll now go to Jonathan Lefebvre, Wells Fargo.
Jonathan Lefebvre - Wells Fargo: Most of my questions have been asked. Just on the Rex, or the Appalachia, Marcellus transaction, I was just wondering if that was in the [AMI] with Rex sort of that was outside of it? You may have already stated that, but just wanted a clarification.
Steve Malcolm : Part of it was bolt-ons to the Rex area, but a big part of it was outside of it. So we've now got about -- initially, I think Rex was 22,000 net acres to us and we'll -- that's probably 24,000 or so. So then the other 21,000 or 20,000 plus acres is really 100% Williams outside of that [AMI].
Jonathan Lefebvre - Wells Fargo: Can you give us a sense for what type of royalty rates were on those leases and terms?
Steve Malcolm: They're exactly where you see most of the industry right now. The royalty rates are -- I think we're getting in the 80% net range in those kinds of things.
Jonathan Lefebvre - Wells Fargo: And then just finally, in terms of pursuing other opportunities in the Marcellus, are you guys still -- would you consider any JV type of structures, or would you prefer not to at this point?
Steve Malcolm: We're actually looking at it in kind of a three pronged way. We're doing some leasing, as you can tell. We're doing some JV discussions and looking at JVs. And then there's also the acquisition side of the world. So we're looking really on all three facets.
Jonathan Lefebvre - Wells Fargo: Okay, thanks. I appreciate it.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Craig Shere, Tuohy Brothers Investment Research.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research: I'm sure you're going to talk about this in more detail next week, but can you speak a little more in detail to the decision process and how to handle excess cash and free cash flow at Williams Corporate? Is it just when we have higher prices? I think you all had guided that you would kind of go pedal to the metal and push our production growth organically from, say, 2011 guidance into the 12% range to more like 20% plus, which you have the ability to do at Will. But then at lower prices for the commodity deck, you're just looking to be an acquirer? Is that basically how we should be thinking about things?
Don Chappel: This is Don. Certainly, we have a vast resource of low cost opportunities with attractive returns. However, cash and credit are limiting factors as well as our desire not to flood the market with gas and drive prices even lower. But clearly, as prices go higher, our operating cash flows go up and we have more cash to reinvest in that business without stressing credit or raising capital.  On the other hand, as prices go down, we have the ability to pull back on our drilling so as not to suck too much cash in a low price environment and negatively affect our ratings. So the ratings agencies, I will tell you are very focused, not just on Williams, but all companies in the E&P space as well as more broadly in terms of outspending your operating cash flows in the E&P side of the business.  So not to say that it can't be done, but certainly the credit agencies are very focused on that, and so we tend to flex our production up in the period of high prices and down in the period of low prices, so that our Capex tends to match our operating cash flows. Now I would say that given that we have a very substantial and excess cash balance at corporate in excess of our needs, we have an ability to spend some of that excess cash, and we focus that on diversifying our portfolio rather than just drilling more wells.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research: I guess that's what I was alluding to that in a less favorable commodity environment, are you focused a little more on growing the business versus weighing that against avenues of kind o distributing cash to shareholders in one form or another? Don Chappel Again, I would say, and I've said this before that our credit metrics are not where we'd like to see them today in light of the low gas price environment. And certainly a stock buyback, if that's the code, would be off the table in terms of our rating. So it really gets down to the extent that we reinvest in good assets in the business, that tends to be a credit positive. But if we take the cash off the balance sheet and buy back stock, that's a bad credit answer.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research: Understood; thank you.
Operator: Up next is Andrew Gundlach of ASB Holdings.
Andrew Gundlach - ASB Holdings : Steve, this is probably a question for next week, but hopefully, you'll allow me to ask it right here. Since your MLP restructuring, there has not been an energy conference or MLP conference I've gone to where someone hasn't said, haven't you looked at Williams? And aren't you going to do the same thing? And of course, you can guess the companies I'm talking about.  It's a groundbreaking transaction. It's been bondholder-friendly and WPZ-friendly; but WMB's stock really hasn't moved all that much. I guess you could say the same thing about Questar. I'm curious how you see all of this restructuring ultimately paying off for the WMB shareholder?
Steve Malcolm: Well, thank you, Andrew. We look forward to seeing you next week. Williams stock, WMB stock, has performed pretty well since we made the announcement, relative to some of the other so called integrated players. As you said, it was a groundbreaking transaction. We really like it in that. It's created a large-scale MLP that will have access to low cost capital, and that's going to let us capture the many growth opportunities that we see before us.  I think Andrew that, again, as we continue to execute on the plan, as we continue to grow PZ, as we grow the distributions, I think that people will see how attractive the cash flow movement is to Williams. And I really think that there are some investors who are sitting on the sidelines saying, okay, let's see how Williams and how PZ execute on this plan. So, I'm still very excited and optimistic about the new structure. And I think, over time, that it will translate into very good things for Williams and its shareholders.
Operator: And, everyone, at this time, there are no further questions. I'll turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Steve Malcolm : Well, again, thank you for your participation and attention today. We look forward to an exciting Investor Day next week and we'll see you then.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. We would like to thank you all for your participation.

===== 2009 Q4  (2010-02-18 09:30:00) =====
Executives: Travis Campbell - Head, IR Steve Malcolm - Chairman, President and CEO Ralph Hill - President, E&P Don Chappel - SVP, CFO Phil Wright - President, Gas Pipeline Alan Armstrong - President, Midstream Gathering & Processing
Analysts: Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research Faisel Khan - Citigroup Mark Caruso - Millennium Partners Jessica Chipman - Tudor, Pickering & Holt Yves Siegel - Credit Suisse Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets
Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Williams Companies fourth quarter year end 2009 earnings release conference call. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Travis Campbell, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Travis Campbell: Thank you and good morning everybody, welcome to our fourth quarter call this morning. As always thanks for your interest in the company. As we've done in the last few quarter, Steve Malcolm will review a few slides. Be aware though, that all of our business unit heads and Don Chappel are available here to take questions which we will do right after Steve's remarks. Also as usual, we've put together our data book that includes the information that we typically provide each quarter. So, this morning, on our website williams.com, you should be able to find the slides, the data book and press releases that were issued earlier today. Those press releases are the release detailing our 2009 results as well as an additional release reporting our 2009 natural gas reserves. Last evening, I'm sure you also saw the release announcing the completion of the asset contribution between Williams and Williams' Partners WPZ. I should note that post that transaction WPZ is a significant part of Williams. WPZ will be having their 2009 earnings call this morning at 10 a.m. Eastern. At that time WPZ management will be available to talk more about their results and their future. It might be worthwhile to tune in for that call as well. At the beginning of the slide deck are the forward-looking statements and disclaimer on oil and gas reserves. Those are important and integral to our remarks, so you should review those. Also included are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those schedules are available and follow the presentation. So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve Malcolm.
Steve Malcolm: Thank you Travis. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Thank you for your continuing interest in our company and as Travis said we are going to use the same format that we've used in our last few earnings call. I will be the sole presenter but the entire team is on hand to answer any questions. We continue to get good feedback on that approach and we will continue it today. So starting with slide 4, this slide talks a little bit about our 2009 results, recent developments, let me tick through the list here fairly quickly. 2009 recurring adjusted income was $552 million or $0.94 a share for 2009. I think most importantly we completed our asset contribution transaction with WPZ which is clearly designed to drive growth and value creation for our shareholders. Our year end 3P US and International reserves are up 14%. We continue the expansion of our Marcellus Shale position with a new long-term agreement with a major producer which will expand our business in the Marcellus, allow us to construct a new 28 mile natural gas gathering pipeline which will move gas into Transco. Construction on that project is expected to begin in the latter part of 2010 and is expected to be placed into service during 2011. We also brought other expansion projects into service on Transco and Northwest. I am speaking here about the Sentinel Expansion Phase II which is a little over 100 million a day of additional capacity which went into service in the fourth quarter of '09. The Colorado Hub Project which increases access to the Piceance Basin for our northwest pipeline customers that went into service, fourth quarter 2009. And our Eminence Storage Enhancement Project, which was placed into service in October 2009. As well, we recorded peak day delivery records on all three of our pipelines this winter. It's good to see that our pipes are getting a strong usage during peak days. Next slide is slide five. This is a slide that investors have appreciated in the past and so I'll spend a few minutes on this slide. It shows the reconciliation of how our domestic reserves grew during the year. So starting with that first bar there, we ended last year with 4.34 Tcf of proved reserves. We added a 159 Bcf through the Piceance acquisition that we closed in the third quarter. Our wellhead production was 435 Bcf. Then we go the next three bars, which show how the new SEC rules for reserves blow through our numbers, and so this year the rules call for using at the 12-month average price for the year rather than the year-end price and this resulted in a base in price of just over $3, which is a 33% drop from the price used for our year end 2008 proved reserved. And so at the lower price, we had 336 Bcf of price related revisions. Also the new SEC rules are much more specific about what undeveloped locations can be counted as proved. The rules restrict development time to five years and require for the first time that we consider the conversion ratio of probable to proved locations in our drilling program. This rule requires we reclassify 496 Bcf from proved back to probable. On the plus side of the new SEC rules for the first time allow us to count undrilled locations that are more than 1 offset way from a producing well as proved where we have a reasonable certainty of production. This allowed us to add 454 Bcf as shown on the next bar. We also added a net 570 Bcf of proved reserves through the drill bit. making our net proved reserves at the $3 price 4.255 Bcf. This is a very similar result as we've had the previous several years in spite of using a capital budget of about half the level from 2008 which reflects the strength of our overall 2009 drilling program. However since the 2009 price was unusually low and is much lower than current gas price expectations, the next couple of bars show important price sensitivities. Our proved reserves are 4.581 Bcf. If we simply add a $1 to the SEC price, hence we get back almost all of our price-sensitive reserves at about $4 in the basin. That's an apples-to-apples comparison; our proved reserves using the same price that we used last year or $4.61 in the Rockies, our proved reserves are 4.632 Bcf. This constitutes 7% reserves growth in the year where we significantly reduced capital spending and 167% domestic reserves replacement. We reduced our three-year finding and development cost to $2.38 per Mcf and our one year drill bit only F&D was $1.53. We were very pleased about this reserves performance which continues our multi-year trend of strong proved reserves growth and best quartile F&D costs. Looking at proved probable and possible reserves, the 3P side of the world, the story gets even better. We ended last year with 12.6 Tcf of domestic 3P reserves and have now grown that 14% to 14.4 Tcf of domestic 3P reserves. Turning to slide six, I'm not going to spend much time on this slide. This just shows US and international reserves and I think the key takeaway here is that proved, probable and possible, 3P reserves are up 14% year-over-year. Slide seven, yesterday we closed our $12 billion strategic transformational restructuring designed to drive growth in shareholder value. Clearly, it significantly accelerated our dropdown strategy and let me quickly run through the key points. This transaction created a large diversified MLP that has investment grade credit rating, much more reliable access to the market. It significantly increases our capital availability, improves I believe the competitiveness of our midstream and gas pipeline operations E&P and our Canadian projects will be funded from their own cash flows and WMB funds and WPZ distributions.  Importantly, Williams is able to maintain scale, earnings, cash flows IDRs and control of the assets. This deal enhances our Williams growth profile and I think overall simplifies our corporate structure and creates a public marker in terms of having investors being able to value our company.  The next slide I think shows that Williams and WPZ interests are clearly aligned. The moves that we've made result in two well capitalized entities that are better positioned to pursue value adding gross strategies. Certainly growth and projects at PZ lead to more value at Williams. And as you can see on the slide here, the ability of WPZ to fund the capital projects for its midstream and gas pipeline projects means that Williams can focus free cash flow on growth and diversification of our E&P portfolio.  On the WPZ side, increased EBITDA and distributable cash flow translate into higher earnings per share for Williams, and as PZ increases its unit distributions, Williams receives more cash. And through William's significant ownership position in PZ, Williams will enjoy the value benefit of growth in PZ's unit price.  Slide nine please; our guidance is unchanged, but just as a reminder, as you can see here, we expect that earnings growth will continue in a very strong fashion and yes, improving energy commodity prices do play a role in that earnings growth through 2011, but as you can see in these arrows in the lower left hand corner, we expect our earnings growth to be significantly greater than the improvement in commodity prices during that period. The green arrow shows 99% growth in our adjusted earnings per share from 2009 to 2011 and we don't need $100 oil, we don't need $10 gas in order to get there. You can see what assumptions that we're making with respect to crude oil prices and natural gas prices during the period and importantly the midpoint of our guidance range for 2011 moves us close to the record high earnings that we produced in 2008.  So, clearly we're investing today in future growth. We have projects coming online this year and in the future that we expect to make significant contributions to our earnings growth.  Slide ten, please. Here we take a look at what the 2009, 2011 growth looks like from a segment profit standpoint and overall we're expecting the increase our total recurring adjusted segment profit by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2011. We expect to see a greater than 100% growth in our E&P segment profit based on higher commodity prices and by 2011 increased production volumes, and in the WPZ and other course we're expecting increases there associated with the many growth projects that we're investing in over that time period.  Slide 11, this slide shows the maintenance capital and growth capital for WPZ and E&P. This is a good reminder of the clear path that we have to our earnings growth. We're investing in excess of $3 billion in growth projects during 2010 and 2011 and I would remind you we're making investments with a continuing commitment to live within our means. Slide 12, I am not going to spend much time on this slide. This type of slide is appreciated by investors as simply shows the specifics on some of the growth projects and growth CapEx that we'll be spending in 2010 and 2011 on WPZ and on E&P projects. You might be surprised when you see a fairly large number that shows up under the other category and I would just remind you that much of that capital is tied to the Canadian NGL pipeline which is a new 12 inch pipeline project that will transport NGLs and olefins from our extraction plant in Fort McMurry to our Redwater processing facility. It's expected that we'll be spending somewhere between $275 and $300 million on that project, constructed using cash previously generated from our Canadian operations or other international projects and the construction is expected to begin in November of 2010 with an anticipated in-service date in the second quarter of 2012. Slide 13, the next few slides offer detailed comments on growth projects within all three of our business units, and I'll start with some comments on E&P and certainly in the E&P space most of our capital, most of our growth will be focused in the Piceance space, and so it's always worthwhile to emphasize the value creating strength of our Piceance space and strategy. Clearly, this is a world class resource. The drilling economics are Shale play strong.  I've got my next slide talks a little bit about the typical well economics for a Valley well and just to foreshadow for you, the returns that we're looking at after tax returns based on current prices, current costs and the current basis differential. We're looking at after tax returns in the 53% range. So clearly, this is a world class resource that has drilling economics that match those that people are talking about in the various Shale plays as well our cost are low. We have a track record of high returns. We enjoy that benefits of scale. You know that there is extensive infrastructure in place including our own gathering, processing and pipeline assets and compare that please to the extensive investment that's still needed in some of those new Shale plays.  So we expect to grow production. Our capital guidance numbers deliver about 12% production growth in 2011, but as the last bullet mentions, we are poised as we check sign posts along the way along the way, as we see what futures prices are doing and as we get through the heating season, we are poised to begin to accelerate our drilling activities by mid year and such an acceleration could if we decide to proceeded with that, could increase our production growth to back to the 20% range by 2011. You know we've been at that rate in the past and I think this demonstrates our ability to ramp up quickly if the commodity prices are attractive.  I mentioned earlier next slide 14 is an update of our typical well economics for Piceance Valley well. I think we talked about this during our May call and just to compare the numbers, our net cash to margin back when we talked about this in May was $2.60, our after tax IRRs were 28% and you can see we now are looking at a net cash margin of $3.45, after tax returns north of 50% and it is simply a case of higher prices, lower basis differential translating into higher returns for a typical well in the Piceance Valley. Slide 15 please. This just highlights some of the strategic growth projects in the midstream space. Obviously we are very excited about expanding our footprint in the Marcellus. Of course, we did the Laurel Mountain JV in 2009. We have expanded upon that with what we are calling the Springville Project which I described earlier which expands our business in the Marcellus has us building a 28 mile natural gas gathering pipeline from a central delivery point in Susquehanna County Pa to Transco in Luzerne County, Pa, a 20-inch pipeline which is expected be placed into service in 2011. Other major PZ projects, Perdido Norte we are expecting to begin contributing to segment profit in mid 2010. Wamsutter TXP4, we expect to bring in additional 350 million a day of processing capacity onstream at our Echo Springs plant in late 2010, and the Willow Creek will be enjoying a full year of operations at Willow Creek. We achieved full processing operations in September of 2009 and are currently recovering up to 20,000 barrels of NGLs at that facility. Slide 16 please, gives a quick overview of all of the projects that we have in the gas pipeline space. We continue to receive long-term customer support to expand our footprint, along Transco, along North West pipeline and along Gulfstream. I would remind you the blue box projects are in guidance, the grey box projects are not in guidance and some of the more significant projects noted here are the 85 North Expansion is a $240 million expansion from Station 85 North to zones four and five adding over $300 million a day of capacity, that will be a two phase project going into service in mid 2010 and mid 2011. We have the Rockaway Lateral which is $120 million Lateral into National Grid's Distribution System in New York. The Mid-South project, a $195 million expansion from Station 85 to points North. So a lot of exciting projects and again all of these are backed by a long-term customer support. I am going to pause here for a minute in terms of my slides and go through some Q&A we did last time and deemed to play well, but we have been getting some questions from investors and some of the common themes of those questions I might cover right now, there have been a lot of questions on drilling cost on the Piceance side. We had the ability to lock-in any of the costs and as I am sure you are well aware of the cost for drilling and completion came down in 2009 and we have made efforts to try to contain future increases for 2010 and some of the success that we've had, we have locked in day rate costs for all of our rigs through 2010 in the $16,000 to $17000 per day range and I would remind you that about $2000 to $4000 a day lower than the average rates in 2009. Pumping service costs for cement and stimulation are also under price agreements through 2010. Other key service costs such as mud, water handling, rentals, construction, these are all looking to stay flat with 2009 based on discussions with many of our vendors, probably the only area where we are seeing some upward price pressure is on steel costs. We have also had a lot of questions about midstream economics with people who have recognized that economics are very strong right now and they have been asking what's outlook for the future and so you are absolutely correct. Our realized margin has risen from a three year low of less than $0.20 in the first quarter of 2009 to more than $0.50 in the fourth quarter of 2009 and given the current market and our assumptions about commodity relationships, the 2010 and 2011 margin should easily surpass what was achieved on average for all of 2009 and could even exceed the high point that we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2009. We also continue to be very pleased and optimistic regarding demand for our NGLs and the resulting NGL margins. Ethane demand in the US pet-chem industry averaged in excess of 900,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2009 and this is a new record high for demand on a quarterly average basis. We continue to expect to see demand stay high as the global oiled gas relationships continue to place the US pet-chem industry in a very competitive position globally as well as the continued conversion to a more light-end feedstock slate.  NGL inventories continue to get worked off as the combination of gas plant production and other sources are not able to keep up with demand, and so this inventory work-off will continue to put strength around our NGL pricing complex as has been recently exhibited in the NGL to oil ratio which is now exceeding 60% on a composite basis versus a year ago's quarterly average of about 55%.  So let me turn now to our concluding slide I think its slide 17. This shows just the key takeaways around the theme that Williams is a winning long term investment. Certainly as we have gone through the slide deck here, I hope you believe that we have a wealth of value creating growth opportunities which lead to the sustained growth ahead as reflected in our 2010 and 2011 guidance. The transformational transaction will clearly help fuel that growth. The integrated businesses, the integrated model I believe gives us a competitive advantage particularly as we intend to increase our footprint in the Marcellus. I believe that we are able to offer producer, customers a more comprehensive midstream pipeline in gas marketing solution to their service needs.  The Piceance basin is a world-class resource continues to performance very positively and I think I would refer you back to the very attractive value returns that are reflective on that slide.  We are committed to financial discipline as we grow. We've achieved investment grade ratings, we intend to keep those ratings and I think the final point we expect 2011 earnings per share to be double our 2009 performance.  So with that, we will be delighted to take your question. 
Operator:  The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers Investment Research. 
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research:  Ralph can you talk through what basins were most affected by each of the respective price related and five year SEC development reserve revisions? And Steve can you kind of put more flesh on the bone regarding what kind of price points you're looking at before you start to decide to press harder on the gas pedal for E&P production? 
Ralph Hill: This is Ralph, on the price side really it's proportional to the amount of reserves we have in the various areas. So on the 336 Bcf of price revision, first of all, about a 100 or so Bcf of that was just a tail reserves that would come off to become economic based on the lower price way out in the future. We obviously believe those will come back but proportionally most of our reserves are in the Valley and the Highlands so thus on a proportional basis, they came out of the Valley and the Highlands. 
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research: Okay and five year development?
Ralph Hill: Five year was interesting. Really the way that works is about 80% of that was in the Highlands and the way that truly works is, its very complicated but in the past basically it was in our drilling program, it basically counted as approved and developed and we were able to count that. Not if it's in the drilling program but it might be a probable location because we haven't taken advantage yet of the Highlands and the one-off rule. We were only able to book the [part] side of that world. So most of that was in the Highlands and the interesting thing about the Highlands as we increased our drilling program which were in the process of drilling went from one rig last year, we're going to be at four. In August as Steve mentioned, we may pull the trigger and do some more. As we prove out more in that field and actually what we call triangulate some of these areas, the one-off rule could be a very big thing for us in Highlands since we have over five Tcf of problem possible in the area. So we look for that one-off rule to be a tremendous advantage for us in this five year limit to be a one-time disadvantage and we look forward to the opportunity to continue to drill, delineate the rest of that field, triangulate around that areas where we can call more than one offset and really take advantage of over 5 Tcf of problems and possibles.  And in terms of the second part of your question, what kind of price points we're looking for. I mean there continues to be a great deal of uncertainty with respect to where prices are headed. We've been delighted by the winter, we have been delighted by the fact that storage inventories have been pulled down, but there remains uncertainty. I think people are trying to figure out the EIA supply data, trying to understand to what extent we have seen deliverability reductions, but I think the short answer would be if we get through the heating season and futures prices continue to be strong, particularly strong to the point where we are still able to capture the kinds of well economics that are shown for a typical Piceance Valley well, I think that under those circumstances we would want to accelerate our drilling activities in the Piceance.
Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research: While your guidance for 2011 assumes 650 still or somewhere around may be a 612 strip right now, if you are given the profitability in the Piceance if you are still north of $6, after the withdrawal season here, would you still feel like it's $6 plus, there is no reason to hold back?
Steve Malcolm:  Yes I think the short answer is yes if we are still looking at that futures price is north of $6 given the kinds of returns that we are seeing in the valley I think that we would want to accelerate our activities.
Operator:  Our next question comes form Faisel Khan with Citigroup.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: If I could ask a couple of questions, first on the Midstream segment, I noticed that the NGL equity sales volumes were down sequentially from third quarter to fourth quarter and it looks like a lot of those volumes were in the Gulf Coast region, could you guys talk about what was going on over there?
Steve Malcolm: If you are looking at just the fourth quarter to fourth quarter?
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: From third quarter '09 to fourth quarter '09?
Steve Malcolm: We had a couple of issues one, we have a contract in the Mobile Bay area there with Exxon and Shell. Shell had a quite bit of work that went on, on one of their plants and Exxon had the right to have monthly right once a year to be able to elect out their liquids and take their liquids and take their liquids and so that's one of the primary drivers on that drop there in the fourth quarter. 
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Should we see those volumes bounce back in the first quarter, is that fair?
Steve Malcolm: That's correct.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup:
19:
Don Chappel: That's consistent with that and that's the cash portion from a net income standpoint, we earn somewhat more, but with the coverage ratios and all those numbers on the slides there are cash numbers, but that's consistent with what we put out before.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: On the E&P side, the higher DD&A expense in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, it looks it's ticking up. Is there something going over there or should we continue to see DD&A kind of go up through the year?
Steve Malcolm: If you are talking about the rate, it is just a function of the capital investment over the last couple of years. So, it is going up slightly as we continue on.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: I also want to make sure I understood the last answer of the last question on the revisions related to the five-year limit. So, 80% of that was in the Highlands area and that was because of lower drilling activity last year in the Highlands, is that fair?
Steve Malcolm: It's one way to look at it, because of lower drilling activity, we weren't able to really take advantage of what we did in the valley and the one-off rule, so essentially when you look at it, under the new rules, it's your historical conversion rate, I can go on and on but yes, I would say when we get back in the field which we are, and start drilling more and as prices improve which they have, I expect to see very positive results, assuming prices stay where they are and assuming also that we get back in the field which we are already in the process of doing.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: The CapEx guidance for 2011 for E&P is pretty wide, $1.3 billion to $2.1 billion, what does that large bandwidth sort of contemplate?
Steve Malcolm: You are talking 2011?
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Yes 
Steve Malcolm: It's essentially the opportunities that Steve talked about, we already are moving from about 12 rigs in the entire Piceance complex area in 2010, the plan in 2011 is to go to 22 and we have the opportunity to do more so that's why the range is so wide plus there is some of the other new things we are looking at, could possibly play into that, so we are just giving it a wider range to what we hope we have succeed during this year
Don Chappel: We have a fairly wide range on commodity price. I think the market is fairly close to our mid-point. So that's I think the best way to think about it, but if prices were very low, we would restrain our drilling activity, if prices were exceptionally high, we might put more capital, even more capital to work in E&P, than we would at something close to current market prices.
Operator: We will take our next question from Mark Caruso with Millennium Partners 
Mark Caruso - Millennium Partners:  Just a few follow-up questions or a clarification actually. The first question is, could you give the capacity on the new Marcellus pipe. I know you are saying mid 2011, but I didn't hear a capacity on how large that pipe could be.
Phil Wright:  That will be a little over 350 million a day of capacity.
Mark Caruso - Millennium Partners: 350 a day and is that a 100% contract with Cabot or is there still opportunity for you to equity volumes or more third party volumes?
Phil Wright: There is some additional space. We have got the ability to expand that pipeline beyond the Cabot piece there initially.
Mark Caruso - Millennium Partners: And then on the guidance side, it looks like if I do the math right midstream fracs on a gallon basis are higher than guidance but you guys didn't increase guidance for 2010. I didn't know if gave a little more color around that. Or there is a range of 27 I guess on midstream?
Phil Wright: On midstream, well certainly if you look a the current markets, the current markets are certainly exceeding those guidance numbers that we've got in there as we head in the first part of the year. However if you look in any of the forward market that certainly is not supported above that and so we want to see what happens when we get through the first quarter. Here I will say that the fundamentals as Steve mentioned, the fundamentals are probably better right now than they have been in a long time and give of some optimism just looking at storage volumes in the way we are continue the Q through some of the light end production and storage right now, so we're hopeful that we will be able to do that but a little early to call it at this point.
Mark Caruso - Millennium Partners: Okay and then just one last question looking at the 2011 numbers. It looks like E&P went up but overall didn't change. Is that just a matter of when I was looking at the slides getting lost in the consolidation, given the fact that you're now own 80% how it consolidates up?
Don Chappel: Yes I think that was just a bit of refining in our guidance, we didn't think the changes were sufficient to warrant any overall change. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jessica Chipman with Tudor, Pickering & Holt.
Jessica Chipman - Tudor, Pickering & Holt: I have a question related to Marcellus. I know that you guys are in the beginning stages there. My question is whether I can get a little more color going to 2010? I think that as of last update you had one rig running per year, Rex, JV and the Marcellus. And since then you have also added about 6000 net acres outside of that JV if I understand that correctly. My question is, if you wouldn't mind giving us a little color on where that acreage was added. Is that around in the current footprint? Are you looking at areas outside of those counties and also how you plan on allocating capital in the Marcellus? Do you plan on drilling on that acreage outside of the JV or at least take first via Rex JV?
Ralph Hill: Well, the acreage we acquired some of it is in the around the Rex deal and other acreage is up primarily in the North East areas some of the more active counties that you've seen the Susquehanna side of the world and surrounding counties. We actually have a large by- area that we have both starting from the North East side going down to the South West side. So, we're actively prospecting in the really the entire play.  We currently have as we've just now taken our operations just the one rig that we will be operating I believe Rex will be operating on another part of rig or two. I think they'll give their update in a couple of days. So, our plan is going forward allocating capital would be, we will continue in the Rex area and we also would like to at some point add another rig into our new acreage and also, we would hope that we have some other successful deals concluded in other parts of the play. 
Jessica Chipman - Tudor, Pickering & Holt: Okay, and if you do a rig outside of that acreage in your JVs, will you press release the results or will you wait an update quarterly for the Marcellus?
Ralph Hill: We haven't really thought about that, we'll not want to ever beat the drum on an initial production that comes out of a well but we will probably, after we fill the wells in good shape, then we will probably give updates as needed at least quarterly but we may do it more often.
Operator: We will take our next question from Yves Siegel with Credit Suisse.
Yves Siegel - Credit Suisse: Couple of questions, one, Alan as it relates to processing margins being so good right now, how does that figure in your decision to perhaps hedge or not hedge?
Alan Armstrong: Well we certainly feel like the forward market right now on NGLs, if you went out and tried to hedge right now, we think is really over saturated with sellers largely I suspect driven by MLPs that don't have enough fee based business to produce the volatility in the kind of situation where they are having to go in and re-up those hedges and so there is just tremendous pressure on the self side in that forward market. And really the only buyers appear to be in that, appear to be the banks and so we just look at the value to spread between gas to crude going forward versus the gas the NGLs, it's a dramatic decline in fact forward market on crude, the NGLs is declining about 15% when even with crude in Contango, so we really feel like there is not much value right now in that forward-looking hedge. We certainly continue to look for opportunities there, but as it appears right now, it is more of a buyers market than a sellers in that forward market.
Yves Siegel - Credit Suisse:  Philosophically have you laid out any new guidelines in terms of how you want to approach hedging?
Alan Armstrong: No we really haven't, we continue to look at that on an opportunistic basis and if we think the market is a fair reflection of the forward value and we need to reduce volatility, then we will certainly act whenever we see those opportunities, but we haven't laid our any new philosophy on that.
Don Chappel: I would just add that again we have a very strong balance sheet at WPZ, we have a strong coverage ratio and we think we have strength to weather that volatility. Despite the fact we love to hedge more, but nonetheless I think as Alan points out, we are unwilling to give up a great deal of value because we don't need to, so we will be more opportunistic in terms of taking risk off the table. 
Yves Siegel - Credit Suisse: If we just turn back to the Marcellus number one, can you disclose how much of the pipeline will cost? Then number two, could you also talk about how you see gas flows going forward? I am talking about the dry gas that gets into Transco, is that going to be staying up in the east or do you think you might see a backhaul and then thirdly, have you given thought perhaps to the liquids in the Marcellus in terms of perhaps coming up with a solution, either going up to Canada of going down to Mount Bellevue? 
Alan Armstrong: Don't get me started on that third one, that third one has a lot of opportunity around it and certainly an issue in need of a solution right now that we are working hard. On the first matter, no use for competitive reasons we are not releasing that capital investment just for transparency sake on that and secondly on the question of volumes back on, certainly let Phil speak to his perspective on Transco on that I can tell you from our advantage point, that it's pretty early. There is not near as much production as there is talk of production just yet and so certainly I think it has the potential but we are [ways] from that and I let Phil speak what he is seeing. 
Phil Wright: This is Phil. I agree totally with Alan, I would say that the opportunities to do backhauls are clearly there and we have customers interested in backhauls and we have been doing it for a long time on Transco for instance. Customers in the southeast region have benefited from taking gas from Cove Point via the Leidy Hub into the Transco system and down for a long, long time. And so to the extent that volumes in the Marcellus ramp up and we have customers throughout the Transco system that through displacement want to do backhauls and like we can accommodate that very nicely.
Operator: We will go next to Carl Kirst with BMO Capital Markets.
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets: Ralph, you were mentioning that we are hopeful we are going to see some things shake loose here. I was wondering if you could comment on, we just had Anadarko which looked like a pretty good price for some of its acreage, are you seeing the land value is kind of continuing to heat up to the point where you know beyond you guys might be working on today, there will be further opportunities from sort of an acquisition side or are we kind of shifting back to more sort of a slower boot strapping approach, again like we saw in this last quarter where we will just kind of see the earnings release and every quarter we might be adding 5000 acres of quarter so to speak?
Ralph Hill: I would say that obviously as Steve mentioned we are going to very disciplined in what we do, but we are looking at it really from the grassroots leasing side, the joint venture side and obviously again in a very disciplined manner there are number of big players, small players, medium-sized players up there, so we are also looking at from the A&D side. So I think from an E&P perspective we are going to continue to look at it from all three of those angles and hopefully through a disciplined manner, you see some good growth there. I do think that we do bring to the table as Steve mentioned a very strong William story to the Marcellus. If you think about it, obviously E&P expertise that we have, our midstream expertise and the need, a desperate need for some midstream solutions up there. Transco runs right through the heart of the play and then our gas marketing people have been very successful in helping out in some of the ventures we have going and actually taking the producers staff and market it for them. So we are looking at it from E&P, from a three-pronged approach, that really Williams is looking at from a four-prong approach, so we think we have a great Marcellus story and we are getting a lot of good feedback on it and a lot of good meetings held, so hopefully we will see some success with those conversations we are having
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets: Where are we on the latest with respect to the Paradox?
Ralph Hill:  On the Paradox we continue to be encouraged, I know [Baird] has their comps gone a couple of days, so we're encouraged with the thirteen H wells we caught that we've been monitoring for quite a while. I think Joe is actually going to give some decline curves and some tight curves around that. What we're really looking forward to is the ability to repeat that in that area and also in the area of extent of repeating that. So as we continue to work with them we hope to, if we remain encouraged which we are, probably drill at least a couple of wells continuing to delineate and see if there is an opportunity to find that area of extent of the play and see if it works like it is in that [costly] area so we're cautiously optimistic and looking forward to hopefully drill in a couple more wells and give you some more tests in some more areas defined out there.
Operator:  We'll go next to Andrew Gundlach with ASB.
Andrew Gundlach - ASB: I have a question on the Piceance Highlands and Valley, on the economics that you put in the data book I don't know if this is for Ralph or for Steve but I understand the difference in the drill and complete what I don't fully understand and which leads to a lower but now insignificant IRR is the location difference and differential and transport differences between the two areas and also the working interest. Could you just put a little light on that?
Ralph Hill:  Yes on the working interest, what we have done is we have blended the various areas up there. For example we own on the trail ridge area we basically own all of that and the Ryan Gulch area we own 51% and (inaudible) owns 49% so that blends the working interest and this year we are drilling about two third Ryan Gulch and one third trail ridge out there. On the differential side, location and differentials, it's all in the liquid value basically. It's included between the two and the amount of reserves differentials, essentially the Highlands area has a little deeper formation that we're also tapping into a little thicker columns so a little bit more reserves in the Highlands area.
Andrew Gundlach - ASB: I see and what explains geologically or reservoir wise the much higher IP rates in the Highlands?
Ralph Hill: Yes, in the Highlands its again it's a thicker column. It's the ability to tap into a little deeper formation also then just the (inaudible). 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Lefebvre with Wells Fargo.
Jonathan Lefebvre - Wells Fargo: Thanks guys. Most of my questions have been answered. 
Operator: Or if you have any other questions?
Jonathan Lefebvre - Wells Fargo: I do not. Thanks. 
Operator: Okay. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Holly Stewart with Howard Weil.
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil: Two questions, one for Alan following up on Mark's question on the new Marcellus gathering line. Is the 350, is that all for catheter or do you guys have some volumes on that as well?
Alan Armstrong: No. it is not all for catheter. We do have some remaining space on that. 
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil: Can you break that out for us?
Alan Armstrong: No. We're not disclosing that detail.
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil: Okay and then I guess follow-up for Ralph. 4Q volumes a lot better than our expectations considering kind of the pull back in capital during the year. It looks like you got a bump in the Powder River and the San Juan. Can you provide a little color there for the Q and then thoughts kind of moving into '10?
Ralph Hill : Well, for the quarter basically, the Powder is just always a function of the dewatering side of the world and we had benefits from that. San Juan is just we actually did some additional drilling there that we haven't done before and under format. So just some good surprises, they are not surprises but just good timing of those things coming on. For 2010 essentially the plan and the guidance you've seen so far as it just basically shows like flat production for '10 and then growing to about 11% to 12% in '11 and that goes into what Steve talks about that to the extent we get back in the field earlier. We obviously plan to have a go from 12 to 22 rigs for example in the Piceance from 2010 to 2011 and you see that kind of growth as we come out with good strong prices. One of the goals would be to get into the field quicker than we are right now and since start adding rigs earlier than what the current plan has. So if we do that then we can have stronger production growth.
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil: Okay, do you have an exit rate for the year you can share?
Ralph Hill : I don't have that in front of me. I think we can share that I'll just need to get that to you and if can give it out, (inaudible). 
Operator: And our last question comes from Todd Godfrey with UBS.
Todd Godfrey - UBS: Could you just give us pro forma corporate debt and corporate cash position and postal transaction last night? Thank you.
Don Chappel: Pro forma corporate debt $2.3 billion cash position was $1.2 billion before closing the transaction, now draw our cash a little bit on a pre-tax basis and that will take the tax deduction and throughout the year and which would get the free tax cash back by the end of the year. So, does that help?
Operator: And with no questions remaining I'd like to turn the call over to your speakers for any additional or closing remark.
Steve Malcolm:  Yeah this is Steve. I would just say that the transformational transaction that we completed yesterday really puts us in good shape to capture all of the growth opportunities that we've spoken about today. We also believe that the Marcellus represents a wonderful opportunity for us and the integrated model is really working well for us there. And then the Piceance is a world class asset and it is every bit as good as any of the Shale plays out there. So with that look forward to talking to you next time bye.
Operator:  Once again that does conclude today's conference call and we thank you for your participation.

===== 2009 Q3  (2009-10-29 09:30:00) =====
Executives: Travis Campbell - Head of Investor Relations Steve Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Don Chappel - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Ralph Hill - President, Exploration and Production

Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Williams Companies Third Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Travis Campbell, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. 
Travis Campbell: We do have a few slides to go over in our presentation this morning. Steve Malcolm will be going through those in just a minute. Be aware though, that all of our business unit heads are available for any questions. Also as usual, we've put together our data book that includes all the information that we provide each quarter. So, this morning, you should be able to find the slides, data book and press release that were issued earlier today on our website, Williams.com. At the beginning of the slide deck of the forward-looking statements and the disclaimer on oil and gas reserves. Those are important and integral to our remarks, please review those. Also included are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those schedules are available and follow the presentation. So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve Malcolm.
Steve Malcolm: As has been the case with our last few earnings calls, I'll be the only presenter today, but the entire team is here to answer any of your questions. We've got a lot of good feedback on this approach and we'll continue it today. So slide four, please. We enjoyed a strong third quarter. We like the earnings growth trajectory that we're showing on this slide. In the third quarter, we grew recurring earnings per share 25% over our second quarter, and we're on track to deliver earnings for the second half of '09 that are 33% higher than the first half of the year. We're raising our guidance today for full-year 2009 to a range of $0.95 to $1.00. We're calling the midpoint of that $0.98, and that's 18% higher than when we last updated guidance, which was when I spoke at Barclays and BofA conferences in September. We've noted the key drivers of our strong third quarter and of our higher expectation for the full year in the upper left quadrant of slide four. Commodity prices have improved. Our net realized price for natural gas production was $4.18 in the third quarter; that's up 6% from the second quarter. We are continuing to benefit from lower operating cost and I'll cover that in more detail here in a minute. NGL margins are making significant improvements. The progression of $0.20 in the first quarter, $0.35 in the second; $0.45 in the third. That's a nice upward trajectory. We've seen the Rockies basis differential cease to be an issue. Following production levels combined with expanding takeaway capacity have tamed the differential. In fact at times recently, we've seen markets be higher for Rockies gas than at the Henry Hub. These are the key drivers in our ability to build that strong upward trend for earnings growth. Slide five, please. As you can see here, we expect earnings growth to continue in very strong fashion. Our earnings growth engine is certainly alive and we're rapidly regaining our ability to create significant value for shareholders. Yes, the improving energy/commodity prices play an important role in that earnings growth through 2011, but as you can see from these arrows, we expect our earnings growth to be significantly greater than the improvement in commodity prices during that period. The green arrow shows 91% growth in our adjusted earnings per share from 2009 to 2011. The $1.87, at the midpoint of our guidance range for 2011 would move us close to the record high earnings that we produced in 2008. We're basing that expectation of sharply higher earnings on commodity price assumptions that showed crude prices improving less than 40%, and natural gas moving up just over 50%. We're not relying on $100 oil and $9 gas to get back to where we need to be. Slide six, please. Here we take a look at the 2009 to 2011 growth and how it looks from a segment profit standpoint. Overall, we expect to increase total recurring adjusted segment profit by nearly 50% from '09 to '11. A quick overviews of the drivers in E&P. We expect to see better than 80% growth in our E&P segment profit, based largely on higher commodity prices and by 2011, increased production volumes. In midstream, we're expecting about a 60% increase in our midstream segment profit. Key drivers are the higher NGL margins and the effect of new fee business projects like Willow Creek in the Piceance; like Blind Faith in the Gulf that have now come online. And we expect our gas pipeline business to continue to deliver strong, steady results as we meet market demand, primarily through expansion projects on our strategically located systems. Slide seven. This slide shows maintenance capital and growth capital by business unit from 2009 through 2011. The key takeaway here is, we continue to be opportunity rich. We're investing in excess of $4 billion in growth projects during the period 2009 to 2011. So, we're adding fuel to our earnings engine, we're investing in the rich opportunities that are created by our unique business strategies and our best-of-class assets. We're making these investments with a continuing commitment to live within our means. Slide eight, please. We always want to take advantage of any opportunity to talk about the Piceance Basin. And for shareholders of Williams, it's worthwhile to remember the value creating strength that our Piceance Basin strategy delivers. Looking at the left hand side there, this is a world class resource. The drilling economics are shale play strong. Let me offer a few more comments on that point. We're in the Marcellus, we're in the Barnett, to a lesser extent in the Woodford Shale. We've evaluated numerous deals in all of the other shales, Fayetteville, Hainesville, Eagleford. However in our view, none of them has exceeded the quality of our core Piceance position. Most people agree with us now that the Rockies basis differential has been tamed by following production, coupled with expanding capacity on Rex, Bison and Ruby. This is clearly represented in the forward markets more favorably than when we presented our typical well comparisons at our May call. So with the threat of basis removed, Piceance moves to the very top of the list of US gas plays. And we have thousands of low risk locations left to develop. So continuing down the left side. Our costs are low; we have a track record of high returns; we enjoyed the benefits of scale. This map shows the breadth and depth of our Piceance operations in each of our businesses. We continue to be opportunistic. Willow Creek, full operations announced in late September; the Colorado Hub Connection that will be in service very soon; and the Piceance lateral extension, which is an NGL line to Overland Pass, which should go into operation before the end of the year. I'm going to pause here now in terms of my slideshow and do something new today. We talked with investors often and we thought that it might be good to run through some of the most often asked questions and give you a little flavor as to our point of view on some of these key issues. We've had a lot of questions about updates on our JVs with Rex Energy and Atlas and Marcellus, so let me give you an update. In June, we announced that we had signed the participation and exploration agreement to develop natural gas wells in the Marcellus shale with Rex Energy. I'm not going to go through the essence of the deal. I refer you to our press release on that deal. But since the initial announcement in June, we've established an office in a suburb of Pittsburgh. We've commenced assembling an asset team. We're preparing to assume drilling production and commercial operations on January the 1st. We're on track to drill seven wells this year as planned, and more specific information on well performance and plans for 2010 will be announced as we complete more wells, and have the time to analyze the data from our initial production. As you'll recall that on June the 1st, we entered into a midstream joint venture with Atlas Pipeline Partners, refer you to the press release on the essence of that deal. But since we've formed the midstream joint venture in June, we've continued to make progress. We're nearing the end of the planning phase of the new Marcellus gathering system, which would be made up of over 60 miles of pipe designed to have in excess of 300 million a day of capacity. The system would be located near Uniontown, Pennsylvania, with an expectation that portions of the new system would be in service by the end of the second quarter of 2010. The new midstream joint venture called Laurel Mountain Midstream is planning on connecting over 150 Marcellus wells to the new system and the legacy system in 2010. Atlas has drilled over 170 vertical wells with two staged fracs, averaging about 2 million a day. In addition, they've drilled 12 horizontal wells, seven of which that have been completed and for 2010, they're planning to drill 30 horizontal wells. Another question that we get often, what is we seeing in terms of volume trends for our midstream business? The good news is currently, gathering volume; processing plant inlet natural gas volumes; NGL equity sales and total NGL production for the third quarter of 2009 are all higher than any quarter since at least 2007. Looking ahead for 2010 and 2011, there are a variety of trends, while Wyoming drilling may be down in the short-term, we're based loaded with Pinedale and Jonah production at Opal. We're still bypassing gas there and any cuts in natural gas production will likely hurt our competition in the area, but before it impacts volumes at our Opal plant. At Wamsutter, we expect volumes to increase due to BP drilling behind the plant. Down in the Four Corners area, we expect slight declines over the next few years, as that huge mature basin continues its normal basin decline. In the Gulf, we expect increases driven by Perdido Norte, Bass Lite, and Blind Faith as producers of oil and associated gas continue to grow production in the Gulf. These new connections will offset other declines from production we are servicing in the area. Finally, new capacity at Markham, which serves the Gulf; TXP4 at Echo Springs in Wyoming; and our new Willow Creek plant in Colorado will all increase overall volumes for midstream. Taken as a whole, these translate us to believe that our gathering and NGL production for all of midstream will continue to increase slightly over the guidance period. Another question is around the Rockies basis. What do we see? What do we feel? And I'll start here with a few data points. For 2008, the Rockies basis differential averaged (inaudible). In the first quarter of '09, that dropped to $1.51. In the second quarter, it dropped to $1.15. And for the third quarter, it averaged only $0.36. In the last month or so, the basis differential has essentially evaporated. The sum daily price is even showing Opal prices greater than Henry Hub prices. Why are we seeing this? What are some of the reasons? Rockies production is down by about 0.5 Bcf since the beginning of the year. Storage levels in the Rockies are at historic norms, not highs, norms. Rockies rig count remains down over 60% from peak 2008 levels. Rex has added 400 million a day of capacity since the first of the year. Bison and Ruby will be adding almost 2 Bcf of capacity over the next two years. So we believe and many others believe, that there will be no pipeline constraints out of the Rockies for quite some time. We think that we are clearly in an over piped situation. We've also received questions on cost improvements that we're seeing in our E&P business; drilling efficiencies; lower CapEx per well; reduced number of wells in drilling and completing a well. There have been a number of efficiencies and cost reductions from vendors associated with the recent downturn of drilling activity. A few examples, in the Piceance Valley, from third quarter '08 to third quarter '09, we have reduced costs for workovers by 75%, through a combination of doing fewer workovers and accomplishing efficiencies, and realizing cost reductions on those that we do. Efficiencies and vendor cost reductions have reduced lifting costs by about 25% to 30% for chemicals, water handling, plungers and well equipment. We've reduced a typical valley well drilling and completion cost by about 25%, from $1.9 million in the third quarter of '08 to about $1.4 million in the third quarter of '09, which includes improvements to these spud to spud time. On average, we've improved by one day, which represents in itself about a 7% to 12% improvement. These reductions were accomplished by a combination of negotiated vendor cost reductions, led by lower casing and fuel costs, lower negotiated fracing costs, and lower costs for completion rigs. Let me now continue with the slides, and if we could go to slide 10. We've talked about these priorities throughout the year. And I believe that we have executed crisply around all of these priorities. And so you see checkmarks on all of these. We certainly have maintained our strong balance sheet throughout the year, and liquidity. We've been successful in driving down costs through execution and expense discipline. We have brought, and are bringing, key infrastructure projects online in '09 and '10. You see with the checkmarks where we have brought new projects online, and you see Perdido Norte and Echo Springs expected to come on in '10; Sentinel and Colorado Hub, two gas pipeline projects expected to come online in the fourth quarter of '09. We definitely did right-size capital spending and continue to be disciplined. With the opportunities that we have seized in the Marcellus, we haven't just played defense. My last slide, slide 11. We do believe that Williams is a winning, long-term investment. We're seeing improving fundamentals with respect to gas and NGLs. We have best-of-class assets, which favorably position us to generate strongly higher earnings. There's substantial upside to our current valuation. We are opportunity rich, which leads to sustained growth ahead, as reflected in our 2010 and 2011 guidance. And we offer a unique and attractive risk reward balance to investors. So with that, we will take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). We’ll take our first question from Jonathan Lefebvre, Wells Fargo. 
Jonathan Lefebvre - Wells Fargo: Just a couple of quick questions on the Marcellus. It looks like you increased some of your acreage. I believe you had 22,000 and at your slide you said 25. Should we expect that the strategy will be kind of grassroots leasing? Also maybe can you comment on where you're seeing lease prices? We've been hearing that the prices have not dropped with commodity prices. 
Ralph Hill:  You'll see a combination. We clearly are doing grassroots leasing, but we're also looking at a number of other opportunities, such as the joint venture we're in right now. So it's kind of a combination going forward. In our lease prices, we have not seen necessary decrease in the price of Marcellus leasing. But I don't really want to get into what the cost of the leases are going for right now.
Jonathan Lefebvre - Wells Fargo: It looks like you increased the hedges in Appalachia. Is that 100% hedged at this point? What you expect your production to be and then also on terms of the most reason two wells that Rex has drilled, any indication on those two wells?
Ralph Hill: We initially hedged what we thought our production would be, so we've tried to pretty full hedging on the initial amount of volume, but as we add volumes, obviously, there will be a portion that will be unhedged. We'll let Rex comment on the wells, but what I would say is the first handful of wells we looked at, we thought of them as science wells. And one of the wells that we've just completed, is much better than any science well we thought would be. So, we're doing a lot of work on the wells. We're doing a lot of testing; trying different techniques; trying different methods of where we're going to land the horizontal laterals and those things. And the third well that we've done is actually much better than what I would call a science well. But Rex is going to comment on those wells, since they clearly are still the operator until January 1, I'll let them make the comments.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jessica Chipman with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Jessica Chipman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt: Looking at slide seven on your quarterly data book and production volumes by region, you can see in the third quarter that most volumes are down. I just wanted to see if you could give us some sort of clarity on where you're expecting volume growth, so that next year looks flat to slightly up.
Steve Malcolm: The majority of the growth next year, it will be a combination of a couple of things. Several things happened as we've decreased our drilling. We actually had some shutting in the Powder River in September, which took off about a Bcf a day or so. But from that, a lot of our growth next year will be in the Valley, and in the Highlands and in the Barnett. There will be a slight growth in the Powder, but most of the remaining part of our growth will be in the Valley, Highlands and Barnett.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citi. 
Faisel Khan - Citi: I just wanted to make sure I understood, reconciled your cash position that you had at the end of the third quarter, which I believe is $1.65 billion to your guidance for end-of-the-year liquidity. It looks like your guidance at the end of the year calls for a cash [drop]. It looks like you built cash in the third quarter. Maybe if you could just clarify that for me, that'd be great. 
Steve Malcolm: Faisel, our guidance for ending cash is on slide number 20, I believe. And year-end cash balance, unrestricted in the U.S. 675 to 875, that balance you see also includes international cash and some MLP cash. But we do expect a modest cash drawdown in the fourth quarter as a result of some capital project spending; but no material change. 
Faisel Khan - Citi: What was the total cash outlay for acquisitions this year?
Don Chappel: Steve, the Eastern Piceance deal was 258. 
Faisel Khan - Citi: And that was the only acquisition you did this year?
Steve Malcolm: Right, the others and the Marcellus, both E&P and Midstream. 
Operator: We will move now to Holly Stewart with Howard Weil. 
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil: Just quickly, I guess a couple for Ralph. It looks like your CapEx range for next year is still pretty wide. We're hearing a lot of our companies now increasing rig count. Can you just kind of give us your big picture thoughts on next year? What your plans are for rig count and then eventually production? 
Ralph Hill: Well, we're still flat in the Piceance with about seven rigs running in the Valley, and then we have one in the Highlands and that will increase to four during the course of the year. The Barnett is back to four rigs just recently and it should stay at four at this point. So everywhere else is basically flat and as you know, we're just waiting to understand our cash flows for next year and commodity prices before we can commit to any more. 
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil: And what are you going to run in the Marcellus? 
Ralph Hill: Just one at this point, which will be about 12 or so wells next year. 
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil: Okay. And then what's your expectation on timing for, I guess, updating the Street on that? 
Ralph Hill: On the Marcellus? 
Holly Stewart - Howard Weil: No, just in general, rig count across the basins. 
Steve Malcolm: We'll update you at our next call. 
Operator: Moving on to Harry Mateer from Barclays. 
Harry Mateer - Barclays: Conoco mentioned on their call yesterday that they may consider selling their stake in Rockies Express as part of their divestiture program. I was just wondering if that's something that either Williams or one of the MLPs could have interest in. 
Steve Malcolm: They could have interest. I wouldn't express for you today a positive or a negative view of that. 
Harry Mateer - Barclays: But it's something you could potentially consider? You would be willing to consider a pipeline acquisition? 
Steve Malcolm: Well, from the standpoint of more likely an MLP opportunity, I think. 
Don Chappel: I'd just say it comes down to capital allocation question as to where we can drive the highest value. 
Operator: We have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Steve Malcolm for any additional or closing remarks. 
Steve Malcolm: I have nothing in addition. Thank you for your participation today and we're delighted with our results. We're very optimistic about the future and we look forward to the next opportunity that we have to talk with you. Thank you. 
Operator: Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

===== 2009 Q2  (2009-08-06 09:30:00) =====
Executives: Steve Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Don Chappel - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Alan Armstrong - President, Midstream Gathering & Processing Ralph Hill - President, Exploration and Production Travis Campbell - Head of Investor Relations 
Analysts: Xin Liu - JPMorgan Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Faisel Khan with Citigroup Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering & Co Mark Huberfeld - TomCo
Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Williams Companies second quarter 2009 earnings conference call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Travis Campbell, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.
Travis Campbell: Thank you Karen, good morning everybody and welcome to our second quarter call. As always, we thank you for your interest in our company. We just have a few slides to go over in the presentation this morning. Steve Malcolm will be going through those in just a minute. Be aware though, that all of our business unit heads are here and available for questions.  Also as with the previous quarters, we have put together a data book that includes data that we always provide each quarter. This quarter you will probably notice that some of the slides we used in our analyst day in May are also included in that data book. So available this morning on our website, www.williams.com are four things, first the slides for this call, second the data book, third the press release and the company’s schedules detailing our results for the quarter and fourth the second quarter 10-Q which was filed this morning.  Also this morning we issued a press release announcing the completion of the binding open season on Transco northeast supplied project. At the beginning of the slide deck this morning are the forward-looking statements, and the disclaimer on oil and gas reserves. Those are important, and integral to the remarks, so please review those. Also included are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to general accepted accounting principles, those sketches are available and follow the presentations. With that, I will turn it over to Steve Malcolm, the CEO. 
Steve Malcolm:  Thank you, Travis. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call and as always we appreciate your interest in our company. This morning we are offering another stream line to earnings call that seem to go over well last time and I know there are quite a few energy company call this morning. I will be the only presenter, but our entire senior management team is present to answer any of your questions.  Starting with slide four please. Lower energy commodity prices certainly impacted our second quarter profitability, the $0.20 adjusted earnings per share is 70% below the year ago level. The average net realized price for US production drop to $3.95 in Mcf, that’s 51% lower than second quarter of 2008.  Per unit NGO margins improved versus the first quarter, up 75% from the first quarter, but still 31% from a year ago. The good news, we continue to record stable steady earnings and cash flows from gas pipeline, and we are very optimistic about the future and we are convinced that the market recovery will drive value accretion across all of our assets. Looking more closely at the numbers on slide five; for the second quarter and the first of the year, the big story in our recurring adjusted results continues to be the significant disparity between the record high energy commodity prices we saw in 2008 and relatively low prices we’ve seen this year.  For the quarter we have recurring adjusted income of $0.20 a share compared with $0.67 in the second quarter of 2008 and for the first six months we had $0.42 of share compared with $1.23 in the first half of 2008. In our reported results, the story is again low energy prices and significant nonrecurring items. For the quarter we reported net income of $142 million, compared with $437 million last year and again the key difference in the year-over-year performance for the quarter was dramatically lower energy commodity prices.  For the first half of 2009 we reported a loss of $30 million compared with a profit of $937 million year ago. The primary drivers include again, dramatically lower commodity prices, losses associated with our Venezuelan operations and investments, and thirdly I recall that our results in the first of 2008 benefited from a $148 million pretax gain on the sale of our international assets. Slide six please. We reported recurring segment profit second quarter ‘08 versus second quarter ’09, just a few highlights under E&P and recurring. The key factors in the second quarter ‘09 much lower net realized prices for U.S. E&P production, again 51% below second quarter ‘08, as well as second quarter ‘09 we had higher DD&A expense based on higher level of production volumes. The average daily US production in the second quarter ‘09 was 6% greater than second quarter ‘08, 4% lower than first quarter ‘09. Under Midstream, reported a recurring the decline in results primarily because of lower NGL and all are from prices, and lower NGL equity sales volumes partially offset by a decreased production costs reflecting lower natural gas prices and significantly lower NGL margins. In the gas pipeline space again stable, steady predictable reported results reflect second quarter ‘08 included a benefit of $9 million gain on the sale of excess natural gas inventory. Recurring results down due to higher operating costs primarily from higher depreciation O&M and pension expenses partially offset by increased revenues from the Sentinel expansion which was placed in service in December of 2008. Gas marketing, we see improvement because in the second quarter ‘09 includes $7 million improvement in margins from buying and selling gas around transportation contracts as well as margins realized on physical, natural gas purchases. Also second quarter ‘08 included an $8 million inventory valuation adjustment related to natural gas owned in storage. Slide seven; reported and recurring segment profit of 2008 year-to-date, versus 2009 year-to-date. I’ve already covered much of this already, but again a few highlights that I haven’t covered in E&P reported results reflect year-to-date ‘09 includes approximately $34 million in expenses associated with early termination of rig contracts as well another point in Midstream, the reported results include a $75 million loss related to the impairment of Midstream’s equity investments in the actual assets in Venezuelan. Slide eight; this chart updates our outlook for full year 2009 commodity price assumptions, as well as for earnings and capital expenditures. First column shows actual year-to-date results, second column our expectation for ranges in the second half of the year, third column provide revised full-year guidance.  You’ll note that the top end of our capital spending range for the year is down. I’ll cover a few reasons for that here in a minute. I think the salient point though is that we’ve narrow the range for recurring earnings per share from the earlier range of $0.55 to $0.95 narrow that to $0.70 to $0.90, or another way of looking at it we’ve raised the midpoint of full-year earnings per share guidance by a nickel. Slide nine please; the slide recaps our 2009 priorities in the progress we are making, we’ve talked about these priorities with investors since the first part of the year. Again few highlights around the second bullet driving down costs, we are seeing savings on capital projects. A few examples, in the midstream area $25 million reduction in the total estimated cost on our Wamsutter TXP IV project, net savings flow through to our guidance.  In the EMP space we are seeing significant drilling cost decreases averaging close to 20% lower year-over-year in the Piceance Basin which comprises about two thirds of our total drilling this year.  Under the third bullet, having to do with bringing key infrastructure projects online, you’ll see that we are making progress, we’ve got a checkmark next to Blind Faith which is now online and there is a checkmark next to Willow Creek, our processing plant in the Piceance basin where as we speak we’re in the process of bringing net plant into service. 
. : Finally on slide10, we believe that we are well positioned to whether the economic storm because of our strong financial position because of stable foundation of cash flows because of our ability to adjust spending and our believe that the integrated model today is best suited for success.  In terms of substantial upside to our current valuation I would want to make a couple points we continue to see tightening at the Rockies basis remember that Williams is perhaps uniquely positioned to capture value in the NGL markets. Our Gas pipeline business continues to have great success with Base hit expansion projects that are driven by demand from the markets we serve. I always want to make the point around our core position the Piceance. It continues to create advantage.  We talked about that at our Investor Day in New York City. We enjoy the benefits of low costs of scale, the ability to be opportunistic. I think we’ve demonstrated conclusively how and why the Piceance Basin and the Rockies in general are good place to be, perhaps not for everyone, but absolutely for Williams. Certainly the fact that Ruby pipeline, it appears is now more likely to be built with El Paso now having a partner. That’s clearly a good thing for Williams. All of the above I think translates into an attractive risk reward balance for Williams and again we are very excited about the future.  With that we’ll be happy to take your questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Xin Liu – JPMorgan.
Xin Liu – JPMorgan:  Good morning guys. Questions on your Midstream NGL margins for your guidance, it seems like year-to-date your average realized margin is $0.27 and it seems like you took down the lower end of the NGL margin. Can you give us your outlook on the NGL market?
Alan Armstrong: First of all of course we saw a large improvement from first quarter to second quarter. We saw very nice increase in margins, mostly on the backs of ethylene margins which has improved dramatically. Recalling the first quarter we were in rejection in many locations. Here in the second quarter and into the current period we were into very improved margins on ethane.  That is largely driven by the large spread between crude oil and gas prices, and ethane right now is the only component that is in the money for ethylene crackers right now for in a cash margin basis. So we are seeing a lot of pull on ethane right now which is driving those ethane margins up and giving us some confidence about where they stand for the balance of the year at this point.
Xin Liu – JPMorgan: Another question for Ruby, how much do you have spent so far and factoring the equity contribution from your partner, how much you need to put out for financing the project during construction and what capital structure are to take after the completion?
Alan Armstrong: I am sorry let me clarify, we are not a financial partner in the Ruby project. My comment about Ruby earlier was simply the fact that El Paso now has a financial partner. There seems to be greater likelihood that the pipeline will be build creating more take away capacity out of the Rockies which is a good thing for Williams, since we have a lot of our production in the Rockies.
Xin Liu – JPMorgan: I’m sorry. I messed up with you said El Paso. Can you comment on your outlook on the Rockies basis?
Ralph Hill: This is Ralph Hill, the basis is done what we have thought would happens since May, we think with the severe decline in drilling in the Rockies and also the extra transportation capacity that has been built already, and we will be build with Bison, the Bison project and with the Ruby project.  What we see is the basis has gone down to about $0.85 from where it was over $1 at that time. The next three years or so all in that $0.80 to $0.85 rate, so what we thought would happen is happening, there is excess capacity coming out, the basis is shirking and our ability to move our gas or the Rockies is coming true just like we thought it would be.
Xin Liu – JPMorgan: Did you expect the basis to widen, if gas prices go up?
Ralph Hill: Well we don’t think it was, not likely to have sometime historically. We think that the Rockies is a preferred place to be for transportation opportunities because the infrastructure is mature and since its build out already, it’s been added to extra capacity.  There has been a dramatic drop in the production levels that will be happening in the Rockies due to the number of rigs laid down. So, I do not see that growing out and if you look at the futures market out there it is pretty consistent around $0.80 to $0.85 in the next several years. So it doesn’t look like the market thing is going to go blow out either.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carl Kirst - BMO Capital
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital:  Couple of questions, Ralph just to clarify, we’ve kind of long been expecting obviously the sequential decline in production. Are you guys deferring any completions or otherwise have shut in. Are your managing production at all or should we take the number basically purely at the service?
Ralph Hill:  We have deferred some completions and by the end of the year, we’ll be deferring probably in the Piceance 75 or 80 completions. We also are not doing anything heroic to bring volumes on in various series that we traditionally would have done. So we are managing production a little in that aspect, yes.
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital:  Okay, that’s helpful. Then just following up on the E&P side in the Marcellus and I guess the question is, with sort of the dipping or the turn of the water with the Rex deal in June, do you see more opportunities to do that? Do you feel like you have to wait perhaps to get some Rex Wells down before you’d want to reassess perhaps other bootstrapping opportunities or indeed or even potentially assessing larger moves into the Marcellus?
Ralph Hill: Well we can’t predict the future obviously, but we’ve studied the base and for a couple of years. Our technical team was very, very confident in the areas we’d like to be in and we have seen, even before the Rex deal and at the time of the utmost deal with our Midstream group.  We’ve seen a lot of deal flow. I think that’s pretty obvious, it’s going out here for a lot people. So we think there is a quite a bit opportunity out there, I can’t predict where it will end up, but those areas we like a lot and we continue to see a lot of deal for, a lot of opportunities as always there is something we could put together that makes sense for Williams and for our partners.
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital:  With respect to the bootstrapping versus potentially larger acquisitions, I mean is that something you can answer us with respect to bias, I mean obviously you will opportunistic if something great come along, but do you have bias towards one approach to the other?
Alan Armstrong: Carl, well just continue to be opportunistic and continue to evaluate the opportunities out there. As Ralph mentioned a lot of deal flow, lot of opportunities for us to look at things, but I think key point to remember is that we’re going to be disciplined and we’re going to live within our means.
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital: Fair enough and then last question if I could maybe for Alan, just turning to the Gulf of Mexico, one of the other natural gas gatherers in the deep water is perhaps hit upon more of a traditional cost of service model. Is that something that you guys think would be replicable as well?
Alan Armstrong:  Well for pieces of the business I think that is the case and it kind of depends on how much of the excess capacity you are willing to grant to the counter party. So in other way in a lot of those deals, the counterparties controlling any excess capacity or have the call on it and takes away quite a bit of the upside.  So we have seen some deals like that out there, but it certainly takes with it a lot of the upside that we’ve seen for instance on Devils Tower business where we have the excess capacity, we are able to price that at market.  So those deals are available, but as you know there is a lot of risk out there and we think we need a pretty high return to balance any risk on the construction support that we take out there. Yes, I think some of those are available and we probably have better places for that kind of lower return. We probably have better places to put on money than that.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citigroup.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup : On the E&P segment, looks like you guys were free cash flow positive in the quarter. I just want to understand the trends kind of going forward, I guess should we expert production in kind of trend down at the same rate we saw the sequential decline in first quarter of this year to the second quarter of this year and how should we expect that CapEx and E&P for the rest of this year? Thanks.
Ralph Hill:  We’ve got guidance out there between 950 and 1.5 billion so we’ll stay in that range for our CapEx for the balance of the year. The way we’ve looked out is fourth quarter ‘08 or fourth quarter ‘09 we think will be down approximately 4% to 5% in production, which means that would be some decline that would give us an overall decline for the year of 45%, we are staying with that.  I would say that so far we have surprise to the upside of that, so may not be quite that much decline and we’ve also mentioned that in 2010 although we haven’t given our guidance here we have said that we don’t think that the decline continues. We think we pretty much stay flat based on this kind of level of capital expenditures if we keep the same level of capital expenditures in 2010.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup : Just looking at the production tax number, any reason why the production tax rate was so low.
Ralph Hill: Well, yes there is two reasons, one obviously lower gas prices is a big part of that, but it was offset by the lower effective tax rates and the way that was lower effective tax rate was because we had some ad valorem tax credits that were provided to us in particular by the State of Texas that we recognized in that quarter.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup : Just shifting to the Midstream side equations for a second, the decision in the beginning of the year to shift, I guess some of your key contracts are fee based, was that a decision by your customers or was that decision by you, or was that more of a negotiation?
Alan Armstrong: No that was built into an original contract that the customer had the option on and was a large package of Jonah gas that dated back to the original construction of Opel of the third train at Opel. So they had the option of changing the fee based and elected to do so.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup : Alan, can you comment a little bit about any tightness in the fractionation capacity in the market today? It seems like we’ve been hearing on some of the Midstream calls at fractionation capacity seems to be a bit tight?
Alan Armstrong:  Yes, it certainly has tightened up considerably and we’re very fortunate to have for a lot of our business range to do with One Oak where the Overland Pass transaction for most of our product and have got the capacity we need, but certainly that is tightened, we’re certainly seeing that with our Conway fractionators. We are seeing a lot of demand for that space in running full out.  So I think there is no secret that in the Mont Belvieu and Mid Continent area, the Fractionates capacities are very tight right now.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup : On the pipelines sequentially, it looks like operating cost went up pretty substantially, I know you talked about pension costs in your prepared remarks, but is that all with the increases or is there something else there?
PhillipWright:  This is Phil Wright. We had the pension increase which is substantial chunk of that. We also had a depreciation increase as well and then we did have some year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter rather operating expense increases, but the detail on that I think is in your book.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup : Last question on your cash balance of about, I think you said $1.8 billion. How should we expect that balance to kind of trend over the course of the year, I think that’s a bit higher than we had expected going to the second quarter?
Don Chappel:  Faisel, this is Don Chappel. If you look at one of the slides in our data book, we have cash flow analysis forecast for the balance of the year. I think it’s on page number 43 of the data book. We continue to expect that the US portion of that balance excluding the MLP’s will be in a range of $700 million to $900 million by the end of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering & Co.
Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering & Co: Couple of questions on the E&P side, again I’m still going to numbers I apologize there’s lots of earnings out this morning, so if I missed something I’m sorry. It took like production guidance is up by just a hair. It was 1125 to 1225 and now its 1175 to 1225 is that correct?
Alan Armstrong: That is true. Yes.
Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering & Co: Did it include previously the deferral at Piceance completions?
Ralph Hill:  Yes. We have not changed that, we’ve always had about 65 or 70 wells are going to be deferred, yes.
Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering & Co: Okay and the reason for the increases?
Ralph Hill: Well we’ve actually done better year-to-date and we thought we would based on our original plan and because of that, the flow that we thing will keep going during the year is that we’re just doing little better and we thought.
Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering & Co: Then when I am looking at the volumes by segment, it looks like the biggest decline sequentially is in part of our basin. Is that the area where we should expect to see the biggest decline just to the rest of this year?
Ralph Hill: Potentially what we are seeing is it’s obviously it’s just a function of and there is a number of wells that are dewatering both Horizon are primarily our partners. So, that is again it depends on when they crosses over to the gas flow side, but that is where we potentially can have a decline.
Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering & Co: Great and then last thing on the Midstream on the JV and Marcellus any updates there, any changes on where you guys want to spend CapEx or any other thoughts, now that you had it for a while?
Alan Armstrong:  Well, I guess I would just categorize back that we’ve seen a lot of investment opportunity both on relatively small assets in the area that need to be aggregated and to be able to access better markets. So we’ve seen a lot of some relatively small assets the producers were interested in selling and we’ve also seen tremendous amount of new investment opportunity for some of the major step out opportunities amongst producers there that are looking for infrastructure.  So, the opportunities probably bigger, its certainly a lot more opportunity than we thought going in and there is just a lot of unknown just you can imagine right now making waiting on various issues around a water disposal and so forth that are leaving people from making big commitments, but they are kind of still hanging in the wings there, but certainly much more opportunity than we expected going in there in terms of both acquisition and grass-roots investment opportunities.
Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering & Co: When do you think that you will have a feel that you will be able to get to us on what kind of capital will you ultimately put in to that business, with that area?
Alan Armstrong: I think that is going to be evolving for a long period of time. I think that will better be changing for quite sometime.
Operator: Your next question comes from Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: There is a lot of discussion around about high storage levels causing pipeline pressures to build, which obviously could lead to full shutting down gas well. So I know you had mentioned that the Rockies capacity, take away capacity is increasing so that probably not going to happen to your Rockies basin, but I just want to double check if you are seeing any of that phenomenon happening in any of your other regions, number one.  Number two; what consequences that has for your Midstream businesses, obviously if E&P shuts in, gathering and processing revenues and if that is the case, if there are minimum threshold that E&P companies have to pay you to maintain or keep those contracts open. I know that’s a lot, but as you could start with that it would be great.
Ralph Hill: This is Ralph. Let me take the first part. I do think what we’ve seen in the Rockies in the last two months, we monitor is that the storage is not filling up as fast as it was and that is primarily because of the Rex East capacity coming on.  So obviously we think storage will get full in the Rockies at some point, but we don’t see where it’s going to be full at such a fast rate as it was going earlier in the year. So we haven’t seen it in any of our areas pressuring of for any of that at this point and we don’t think the Rockies really will do that particularly with our transport capacity out there, and I’ll let Alan take the second part of that question.
Alan Armstrong:  Yes, I think on the Midstream side particularly out west, we certainly haven’t seen any of that yet. We deliver into pipes and they have a norm based on certain design pressure. We are capable delivering into that design pressure on all of our locations.  Generally, most of our larger customers and the bulk of our revenues do come from large customers have downstream capacity on the pipelines to server their production needs and so we’re not seeing reduction and production right now and are not forecasting any on our systems due to storage constraint. So not saying that won’t happen, but we’re certainly we are not seeing any rim at so that are any signs of that right now.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: Next question is the $0.70, $0.90 guidance range outside of price moment what could help Williams achieve the upper end or above, and what would cause Williams to miss the lower end or below?
Don Chappel: This is Don Chappel. I would say that the primary driver of that range is pricing, price and margins. Certainly costs are a factor, but a fairly modest portion of the variable there.  So I think we’re confident about our production, I think we are confident about our cost management so I’ve to say the primary driver other than just surprises would be pricing and margins.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. So it’s really all in your control?
Don Chappel: Pricing and margins are not within our control?
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: Outside of pricing.
Alan Armstrong: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Huberfeld – TomCo 
Mark Huberfeld – TomCo: Just a quick question from the analyst day earlier in the year, you had said indicated may be that would be some insight into cost cuts or OpEx reductions may be around this time of the year. Could you maybe just update us on that?
Alan Armstrong: Looking for the AMP side we have achieved what we thought we could do in lot of our areas. Capital side of world down we’re down about 26% so far may be lower in our capital costs, like well basis this year versus last year.  I think if you look at our lease operating expense in the second quarter ‘09 is like 13% below what we saw in 2008 and we could see all of that continue to turn down quite a bit. So we are feeling very positive about what we thought could happen and what we’ve seen actually happens so far.
Mark Huberfeld – TomCo: I was thinking maybe more or so on G&A and corporate and other areas of the business where that you’ve grown OpEx in the last several years in the better environment?
Alan Armstrong: We continue to look for opportunities to cut costs, we have not yet made any wholesale cuts in our work force because coming into this downturn we were short and so we continue to look for ways to cut cost and taken some steps. I think those are reflected in our guidance and we’ll continue to operator our business in a very disciplined manner.
Operator:  With no further questions, I’ll now turn the conference back over to Mr. Campbell for any additional or closing remarks.
Steve Malcolm:  This is Steve. I appreciate your time. I know there are a lot of calls today. A solid quarter and we are very excited about the future. So thank you for calling-in today.
Operator:  Once again that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you again for your participation and have a wonderful day.

===== 2009 Q1  (2009-04-30 09:30:00) =====
Executives: Travis Campbell - Head of IR Don Chappel - Senior Vice President, CFO Steve Malcolm - Chairman, President and CEO Alan Armstrong - President, Midstream Gathering & Processing Ralph Hill - President, Exploration and Production
Analysts: Carl Kirst - Bmo Capital Faisel Khan - Citigroup Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering Holt Xin Liu - JPMorgan
Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to The Williams Companies first quarter 2009 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Travis Campbell, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.
Travis Campbell: Thank you and good morning everybody. Welcome to our first quarter call. As always, thank you for your interest and support of the Company. As you have no doubt noticed there are significantly fewer slides in the presentation this morning. Steve Malcolm will be going through those slides in just a minute. Be aware though that all of our business Heads are here and available for questions. Also beginning this quarter, we have put together a data book that includes most of the data using included in our slides and in the appendix.  So available this morning on our website, www.williams.com are four things, first the slides for the call, second the data book, third the press release and all the accompanying schedules detailing the results of the quarter, and fourth the first quarter 10-Q which was also filed this morning.  Also there are couple of other press releases you should be aware of and are available; one is the announcement that went out yesterday, talking about the impairment of our Venezuelan operations and the other which went out this morning, announces our plans to build an NGL pipeline in Canada. Steve will talk a bit about that last one this morning.  I also want to remind you that we have planned our analyst day for May 12 in New York. On that day each of the business leaders and their teams will spend some time reviewing their businesses strategies and drivers. At the beginning of the slide deck this morning are the forward looking statements and the disclaimer on oil and gas reserves. Those are important and it will go through our remarks, so please review those. Also included are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those schedules are available and the presentation.  So, with that, I will turn it over to Steve, our CEO. 
Steve Malcolm: Thank you, Travis. Welcome to our first quarter 2009 earnings call. We always appreciate your participation in our calls and interest in our company. As Travis mentioned, given the fact that we are conducting an investor day in New York on May 12, we are offering this morning a somewhat streamlined earnings call. I will be the only presenter for the slides but our entire team is present to answer any questions.  Starting with slide four please, certainly the recession and related lower commodity prices impacted our first quarter profitability. The $0.22 adjusted earnings per share is 61% below year-ago level. The average net realized price per US production was 36% lower and per unit NGL margins dropped 69% from a year-ago. The good news is that we continue to record stable, steady earnings in cash flows from gas pipelines.  Looking a little more closely at the numbers on side five, first quarter financial results, for our reported results the story is obviously lower energy prices and significant non-recurring items. Those non-recurring items include first non-cash impairments of 241 million related to our Venezuelan operations and details were in a press release that we issued yesterday. Also we didn’t enjoy the benefit in this year's first quarter of a $118 million gain on the sale of our Peruvian interests which we recorded first quarter '08.  The other significant non-recurring item was $34 million in penalties related to early termination of rig contracts and this is clearly in line with our reduced CapEx program in our E&P segment. So our adjusted first quarter earnings per share of $0.22 is off 33% from fourth quarter '08 and down 61% from first quarter '08 when we enjoyed a very robust energy commodity price environment.  Turning to slide six, shown is reported and recurring segment profit, first quarter '08 versus first quarter '09. I have already talked about the major nonrecurring items. But in E&P, the decline in segment profit was due to much lower net realized average prices for natural gas and higher expenses; I'm referring here to depletion, depreciation and amortization; somewhat offset by higher production volumes. The average daily US production in first quarter '09 was 21% greater than first quarter '08 and 6% higher than fourth quarter '08.  In midstream, the decline on a recurring basis was primarily due to significantly lower NGL margins as well as Venezuela profits not recognized; in the gas pipe area, again steady, stable and predictable.  Slide seven, although the economic environment created quite a challenge and you can see at the bottom of this slide the energy commodity price comparison versus last year, we are pleased that we are making significant progress with respect to executing on our strategy and some of the highlights are shown. The fact that we entered into the Marcellus Shale, announced plans to expand our Canadian operations with the new NGL pipeline demonstrated increased liquidity with our $600 million debt issue. Additional support for Williams Partners produced 4% more gas in the US versus the last quarter; received approval to expand our Northwest pipeline system to transport additional Piceance gas and continued progress toward bringing strategic infrastructure projects into service.  On slide eight, we are delighted with our entry into the Marcellus Shale. Please note the key bullet points on the left side of this slide. But generally speaking, this transaction provides Williams with the gathering systems and a very large acreage dedication in the heart of the Marcellus that gives us a couple of year head start in the development of a large scale, highly-reliable system which provides needed midstream services to both Atlas Energy and other producers in the region.  Both our partner and our anchor customer are aligned with our growth expectations and the gathering service inquiries and expressed demand by other area producers is meeting our expectations.  As shown on slide nine, we are excited about our plans to construct a new NGL pipeline in Canada. Again, please review some of the key points on the left side of the slide, but this new investment in critical infrastructure will help enable sustainable development of the Canadian oil sands. Our investment is low risk as it is anchored by the existing tariffs being paid to Suncor currently, yet positions us to increase our volumes by almost 10 fold and provides existing upgraders the opportunity to dramatically reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Clearly the transaction supports our strategy of providing highly reliable, large-scale services in key growth basins.  Importantly, note the third bullet there, the $283 million of capital will be funded from our international cash reserves. Slide 10 reflects summarized guidance information. The first column shows revised guidance based on our current assumptions. The second column shows guidance on February 19, the date of our fourth quarter call, and the third column shows 2008 actuals and is a reminder of our strong earnings power in a better price environment.  So as shown, for the full year we're expecting slight improvement in crude prices, continued downward pressure on nat gas prices and looking for some improvement in NGL margins.  CapEx is up about $100 million because of the Marcellus deal. The dip in segment profit is largely within E&P. So our current earnings per share guidance range is $0.55 to $0.95, the drivers of change being lower nat gas prices, Venezuela, additional support for WPZ and higher debt costs associated with the $600 million debt offering.  Slide 11 discusses progress on our top 2009 priorities. I'm not going to spend much time here because we have already highlighted some of these points earlier. But just a reminder that maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity, exercising cost discipline, bringing key infrastructure projects online, and I'm talking about projects like Willow Creek, Paradox, Perdido Norte, Sentinel, Colorado Hub, right-sizing capital spending and seizing opportunities as we have done with the Marcellus transaction. These priorities are critical to our success in 2009.  Slide 12 describes the key points that we have been making to investors as we have been on the road over the past 60 days. We think that Williams offers strength and stability with our strong financial position, the $3 billion of liquidity, the investment-grade credit rating, the fact that we have no significant debt maturities until 2011 and that primary credit facilities don't expire until 12' and 13'. We've demonstrated great flexibility to adjust capital spending in response to market conditions and I think we offer a stable foundation of cash flows. I think the key bullet point, being the fourth one, which shows that we are expecting $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion of cash flows in 2009 from price risk insulated businesses, and I'm speaking here obviously about gas pipes and our fee-based midstream revenues and as well the fact that 62% of E&P production revenue is hedged in 2009.  So concluding with the key takeaways on slide 13, we believe we are well positioned to weather the economic storm because of our strong financial position, because of our stable foundation of cash flows, our ability to adjust spending and our belief that the integrated model is best suited for success in the current environment. We offer substantial upside to our current valuation. Significant expansion projects are coming online, substantial probable and potential low-risk reserves. We expect expansion of valuation multiples as the markets improve and all of the above I think translate into a very attractive risk reward balance. So with that, we have gone through the slides, the team is assembled here to take your questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.
Carl Kirst - Bmo Capital: If I could start with the Marcellus and not necessarily to steal any thunder in front of May 12, but Steve can you give us any sense of what you are thinking? We know you're only going to go into an area if you can get big. You mentioned being large scale. Do you have a sense of the capital investment dollars you are thinking in this region over the next three years? Two, with respect to looking at it as far as how should we think of returns in the current environment, only noting that I saw in the midstream section that you guys had converted some of the keep-whole volumes to fee-based. I don't know how material that was but I didn't know as you were looking into the Marcellus if you're thinking about this more in kind of a fee structure or if it's just kind of the same model in the Rockies sort of placed on top of the Marcellus.
Steve Malcolm: I will offer a few comments and then turn it over to Alan, but you're right. You have been listening to me that we have talked about the fact that an important part of our midstream strategy is creating these large-scale positions where we can exercise some market power and that has certainly been the case with all of the basins that we have moved into. That is our game plan with Marcellus. Many producers have said that the midstream challenges are daunting. We have had several calls already from producers asking for help. So we are very excited and expect to be able to create the same kind of system that we've created in other growth basins. Alan, any other thoughts?
Alan Armstrong: Carl, I would just add that the majority of the business there, there's really not very much that we are counting on anyway in terms of processing revenues there, I think the majority of our business will be fee-based business there and somewhat exposed to gas price there which is a nice upset to our midstream business obviously.  So I think there will be a mix of that kind of business. I would just add to Steve's comment about the infrastructure and the need for it up there. As we see it, there's a lot of pipelines crisscrossing the Marcellus area today. But the degree of volumes that we think are going to build very rapidly out of that area are going to cause need for a system that can get producers the very best price rather than being dedicated to one particular pipe in an area that may be overloaded. So, we think there is a good opportunity for some large-scale infrastructure up that set some supply hubs in the Marcellus and we are excited to be talking to a lot of interested producers. As soon as we made that announcement, we saw a lot of interest in that kind of project.
Carl Kirst - Bmo Capital: Sure, but no sense or at least that you can kind of indicate at this point as far as potential investment dollars we're talking about over the next few years?
Alan Armstrong: I would say this. We have a pretty good idea of what it will take to keep up with the Atlas production but I would just say that that is certainly not the limit of our desire and appetite up there. We didn't go up there just to do that. It's a very important customer and we want to make sure we get that business right. But our desires are beyond that. So I would hate to quote a number because the rest of that investment is fairly speculative at this point.
Carl Kirst - Bmo Capital: Okay, fair enough. And just shifting really quickly to the Canadian NGL pipeline and just to make sure I understand this correctly, certainly understand the volumes that are going to be coming over the next 10 years. Sort of as we sit here today should we be thinking about as far as what is contracted, if you will, basically just the Suncor volumes? That looks to be about 15,000 a day over a 43 initial capacity. So that's only about 35% contracted and that you're going to kind of ramp that up as we move to in-service date or how should we think about that?
Alan Armstrong: Well, very interesting project because we were shipping on OSPL which is the oilsands pipeline with Suncor and we were shipping those NGLs and as a result of that, we were taking up space in that crude oil pipeline. They needed us out of that space to make room for their expanded upgraders up there. So part of the negotiation was them basically buying us out of that position to move barrels and we were paying a very high tariff on that pipeline. So the minimum volume, if you will, as Steve mentioned, the project is very low risk because we get to a low but reasonable return with just that base volume of business that we have up there today. So anything above that is upside to us.
Operator: The next question comes from Faisal Khan with Citigroup.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Just a quick question. I just want to clarify this. What is your production growth target for this year? And I guess how do you foresee that kind of (inaudible)
Ralph Hill: This is Ralph. What we said before and continue to say, we think overall our production guidance range has been a growth of about 2% to 4% for the year. So you can see that our rapid growth quarter-over-quarter, first quarter '09 versus first quarter '08 will taper off as the year progresses.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Then given your guys' focus on EVA metrics, you obviously chose to make an acquisition in the Appalachian Basin, but how are you looking at the allocation of capital as we get into the summer here in this low gas price environment. I guess your assumptions have changed for gas and commodity prices in this quarter versus last quarter. So how is your allocation of capital changing within the different segments?
Don Chappel: Again, we look at our costs and our expectations of future profit. We certainly have a point of view on commodity prices in the future. We also have financial markets as an indicator and we take all of that into consideration as well as risks and make decisions. I think in the case of the Atlas investment, we saw a very substantial opportunity relative to the risk profile and expect very attractive returns in that basin over time. So I would say a typical way that we always look at things is just that the variables perhaps are more variable than they have been in the past.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: If I'm looking at your overall kind of cost structure in the midstream business, also in the E&P business, what sort of efforts are you guys making to reduce that cost structure over time? Because over the last three years, the midstream cost structure has kind of moved up along with your expansion opportunities. So, I was trying to figure out if there's room for that cost structure to move down over time.
Alan Armstrong: I will speak to the midstream piece there. In this quarter actually we did see our unit cost move down a little bit on the O&M side. So we are seeing some backing off of cost on both the O&M side and the capital side as a matter of fact. So we are being able to put some pressure on those costs. Albeit minor in the first quarter, but we certainly have seen that inflection point.
Ralph Hill: This is Ralph. Our cost structure, as you know, is usually in the top three or four in the country. So we continue to drive those efficiencies. On May 12, you'll see some slides from some independent analysis that shows we remain in the top two or three. So we don't have any major cost efforts underway except what we always do everyday and every year.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Last question; on Venezuela, is this an issue where their credit is constrained and they can't pay you or is this an issue where you have to walk away from the assets because you don't think there's going to be any recovery there?
Alan Armstrong: I would just say that evidently it's hard for us to have an internal read obviously into Petrowayu's finances. But it certainly makes sense for them to be paying us and continuing to service there. And for whatever reasons, they haven't been able to make those payments and so we have rights under our contracts and we intend to exercise those rights.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) The next question comes from Rebecca Followill with Tudor Pickering Holt.
Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering Holt: On the E&P side, commodity prices particularly natural gas prices continue to decline, low three handle on them right now. Do you at some point say prices are just too low or just going to shut it down? How do you think about commodities right now?
Don Chappel: We continue to look at that. We have a very low cash breakeven price, as you know. It's $1 or less in some areas and less than $2 in other areas. So we just monitor that and the question will be if the prices get very low this summer, some of that will shut in, but obviously if that cash flows [somewhat]. So we will just have to look at that and continue to balance it.
Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering Holt: But is there a strip or a price level where you say, we just don't want to do it or is it sub $2, sub $3, any kind of feel? 
Don Chappel: You'll see May 12 what you think our returns are based on current strip and I think you'll be impressed with those.
Operator: The next question comes from Xin Liu from JPMorgan.
Xin Liu - JPMorgan: My question is regarding the IDRs you gave up and the [G&E] credit that you gave for the WPZ. Do you get anything in return?
Don Chappel: This is Don Chappel. I think what we get in return is the value of our LP units goes up. We think in time, the value of our GP will go up as well. We also have currency, an MLP currency that's more useful at very high yields that WPZ was at as a result of investor concerns about distribution maintenance. The currency was not very useful to us. So as that yield comes down, we have again an alternate source of equity capital that we can tap for some of these very attractive projects. So, that is what we get in return. So I view it as strategic. 
Xin Liu - JPMorgan: Okay and another question regarding the drilling program at the Piceance. How many rigs do you have over there and what have you seen in terms of production in the Rockies in general?
Alan Armstrong: We have seven rigs in the valley and one in the highlands. So that's a total of eight, down from 28 fourth quarter of last year. We have seen prices continue to come down for all services. We also believe that Rockies production has probably peaked in the region, not peaked permanently but peaked for this year. If it hasn't already, it will very quickly. And thus we feel that as we move on down the road that with the infrastructure in place, it is already in place, an infrastructure that will be built in the next couple of years; the Rockies could possibly turn into an advantage transportation outlet versus some of the other areas of the country.
Operator: (technical difficulty) 
Unidentified Analyst: Just a couple of quick follow-ups. On Venezuela, is there any way to get upside down there? If you guys are continuing to operate but Petrowayu is not paying its bills, is there a risk that we are not just putting the profit in kind of the nonrecurring box that we could actually go negative?
Don Chappel: No, we have a set date for the way the agreements work that we would discontinue operations and that's in the very near future.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay and then just lastly, Ralph, you had mentioned of the production growth of 2% to 4% this year. Are we still kind of targeting an exit rate for the year of roughly a 5% decline or has that been pushed up? 
Ralph Hill: We still think a 5% decline although first quarter production as you saw was higher than we what we thought it would be. We still see a decline for the year and then flattening out next year.
Operator: We have no further questions. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Steve Malcolm for closing remarks.
Steve Malcolm: Great. Here we are. It looks like we're getting through this call in less than 30 minutes. We look forward to seeing you on May 12 and see you then. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We thank you all for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Williams Companies' Fourth Quarter 2008 Earning Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Travis Campbell, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Travis Campbell: Thank you and good morning everybody. Welcome to the Williams fourth quarter earnings call. As always, thanks for your interest in the company. After my remarks I'll turn it over to Steve Malcolm, our CEO, who will go through some thoughts, and then to our CFO, Don Chappel, who will talk about the fourth quarter results. Then Ralph Hill, Alan Armstrong and Phil Wright will speak to the E&P midstream gas pipeline businesses. After Phil's remarks, Don Chappel will review the consolidated guidelines and Steve will make a few brief remarks before we turn over and take your questions. Please note that on the website, williams.com, you can find the slides that we'll talk from this morning. Also the fourth quarter press release and all the company's schedules are also on the website as well our press release regarding our proved reserves at year-end. Slide number two, titled Forward-Looking Statements discloses various risk factors and uncertainties related to future operations and expectations. Actual results of course vary from our current expectations due to factors disclosed. Please review that information. Slide four, Oil and Gas Reserve Disclaimer is very important and so please read that slide as well. Also included in the material are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those schedules are available and are integral to this presentation. So with that, I will turn it over to Steve Malcolm.
Steven J. Malcolm: Okay, thank you, Travis. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2008 earnings call and as always we always appreciate your participation in the call and interest in our company. Turning to slide five please, Williams delivered very strong financial performance in 2008 largely on the strength of the first three quarters. Our full year performance drove a 24% increase in adjusted earnings per share. Other key and impressive operating highlights are shown on the slide. Our development activities in the Piceance, Powder and Ft. Worth basins drove domestic production up 20% year-over-year. We grew reserves to 4.5 Tcf. We continue to be an industry leader in terms of F&D costs. We continue to proactively manage our Rockies position and by that I'm referring to the fact that 81% of E&P's production captured higher than Rockies prices by using the pipeline capacity that we've contracted for to move the gas to higher price points. And our midstream business took advantage of the basis anomaly in terms of capturing higher margins. Clearly however, fourth quarter financial results suffered from the effect of the global economic conditions as the rapid decline in commodity prices certainly had a significant effect on results. But, we did benefit from the cash generating gas pipe and sea-based midstream businesses that are insulated from commodity prices. Next slide, slide six please. The business landscape has changed significantly, since our third quarter conference call on November 6th. In particular, we've seen much lower commodity prices. We've seen crude oil prices drop 50%. I'm speaking now about spot prices. 50% from early November's $70 to a current price of around $35. Forward strip has fallen as well. In early November it was around $75 for '09. It's dropped 43% to $43 as well. Natural gas spot prices dropped 36% from early November's $6.79 due currently about $4.34, and we have seen the forward strip fall as well. And certainly credit markets remain very difficult and are unreliable. And so turning to the slide seven, what does this challenging business environment mean for Williams. We're taking appropriate steps to reduce our capital spending and are limiting expenditures to $1.3 billion below our '08 level, which is about 36% below '08 levels. The good news is the current cash and credit facilities are adequate to fund planned '09 CapEx and by 2010 we expect to fund CapEx from cash from operations. Obviously, we're recalibrating expectations for earnings. We are expecting the weak commodity prices to push '09 sharply lower and you've seen that in our new guidance. We do however, expect things to improve somewhat, as we see forward strip prices indicating some improvement in 2010. I guess the third key point is that we are maintaining our current structure. We believe that it is best, it is the best structure to manage the risk and create value long-term. That value creating structural change is not actionable in this economy. And I'm referring to the effects of the very low commodity prices, the more severe recession that we're seeing, the fact that credit markets present extreme challenges and so bottom-line, the extraordinary costs, risks, and loss synergies outweigh the potential rewards. We do expect our mix of businesses, our investment grade credit rating and our strong liquidity to serve us well in this challenging environment and very weak commodity price environment. Turning to slide eight. And so we're positioning Williams to prosper when the economy recovers. Again, I think the business mix, the investment grade credit rating; the strong liquidity positions us favorably. We characterize our capital spending as somewhat of a maintenance plus level of spending. We're bringing ongoing infrastructure projects into service, but by dialing down drilling activity, while deferring other investments until the economy recovers and returns improve. Meanwhile, we're retaining our work force skills and capabilities. We're focusing on cost and not losing sight of the fact that our track record and I point you back to our '08 results. Our track record demonstrates a very strong value foundation. Finally, on slide nine, we expect '09 to be a very challenging year in the industry, but WMB's liquidity is very strong. We have no significant debt payments until 2011. We're making significant reductions in our capital spending and all of these steps are designed to best position Williams to prosper as the economy recovers. Our growth engine that has created significant shareholder value over the last four years is still in place, and I think you are well aware that, that growth engine is driven by the attractive organic investment opportunities that we have and we believe that will still be in place when commodity prices recover. So we believe that we are well positioned when the economy recovers. And with that I'll turn it over to Don.
Don R. Chappel: Thank you, Steven and good morning. I'm going to walk through a couple of slides here and discuss the results very briefly. They're well described in our press releases package and our business unit leaders will each spend a few minutes on their results. So turning to slide number 11, financial results just focusing on the bottom-line for the quarter recurring income adjusted for mark-to-market effects of $0.33 down 44% from the prior year, as well as down from prior quarters in 2008. So it started to feel the effects of sharply declining commodity prices in the fourth quarter. For the full year very strong results of $2.15. I think again that demonstrates the earning power of the company in the strong economy and we are eager to get back to that environment. Just turning the page, slide number 12, fourth quarter segment profits and again the business unit leaders will talk about their results. I'll just touch on the bottom-line. Segment profit after mark-to-market adjustment our important measure here $402 million on a recurring basis for fourth quarter '08 versus $718 million in 2007. So again you can see the sharp decline in the fourth quarter. And you can also see as commodity prices roll back, the contributions from each of our primary businesses start to even out after a very, very strong performance by E&P and Midstream in prior periods. Just turning the page to year-to-date results. Slide number 13, please again focusing on the bottom-line, recurring segment profit after mark-to-market adjustments of 2.819 up 16% from 2007, again very strong year despite the weaker fourth quarter. At this, I'll turn it over to Ralph.
Ralph A. Hill: Thank you, Don. Today I'd like to cover our 2008 financial results, our production highlights, reserve update, caps on guidance. First, I want to thank our E&P employees and support staff for a superb job in 2008. It was a record year for production, profit, and reserves. I also want to thank them for their ability to shift gears in a significant manner and responded this current recessionary environment while preserving our long-term value. And also I would like to thank our service providers and vendors. Let's turn to slide 15. Fourth quarter '08 to fourth quarter '07 financial highlights, we had an 18% volume growth overall to total company. We did have a 30% decline in recurring segment profit, which I'll discuss in just a minute the reasons why and we had a net domestic average price realize of 12% lower. In the fourth quarter, you will see two things there, first is the negative impact of our results on non-recurring items. First, legal contingencies, that relates to the unfavorable opinion we received from the Wyoming Supreme Court on our appeal of the State Regulatory decision on the allowance of certain tax deductions. The court ruling was for the period 2002... 2000 through 2002 and the accrual was made for that period plus remaining periods through 2008 and that was $34 million. Second thing is a property impairment and this is in the Arkoma Basin, which is one of our non-core producing assets in South East Oklahoma. The fourth quarter impairment of $129 million resulted primarily from lower year-end reserves. The decline in reserves primarily resulted from using lower year-end prices as required by SEC guidelines. This caused the reserves to become economical and cause the non-cash write-down of $129 million or impairments. On a year-to-date for the total year, you do see that we have a 19% volume growth overall 71% recurring segment proper growth, which shows the true earnings power of this unit in a normal commodity environment, and a net realized domestic average price did increase 28%. Let's turn to slide 16. Accomplishments 71%, recurring segment profit as I mentioned. On the domestic side, our production growth was up 20%, I have a slide we'll go into that in just a few minutes. Domestic reserve replacement of 176% and three year F&D of $2.32 if you exclude the 2008 acquisitions and keep in mind our acquisitions, which were about $570 million last year. Our strategy is weighted very heavily towards unproved properties. We think on a 3P basis, we brought all these acquisitions in about a $0.16 per Mcf basis on a 3P basis. We very rarely buy proved reserves and hence the $2.32 excluding 2008 acquisitions. And our team continues to be good citizens in various areas we are operate. First, we would name the business of the year in Grand Junction, Colorado, that's where our Piceance operates, and we are also named the business of the year in Denton County, Texas for our Barnett operations and in the San Juan basin we won the BLM Good Steward award. Slide 17, this portfolio, which increased profitability in 2008 by 71% also increased our production by 20%. It set up for a very strong future. Our growth won't be as much this year obviously with our capital budget, but you can see Piceance value was up 14%. The Highlands were up 24%, the Powder River was up 34%, Ft. Worth is up 66%, and San Juan basin almost mature asset continue to grind up at 3%. Slide 18, looking at our reserves, we believe we had a strong reserve performance in 2008. Total reserves were about 4.5 trillion cubic feet. On a domestic side, we were up 5%. 148% domestic reserve replacement for a 602 Bcf net additions, greater than 99% growing success rate, and we added 714 Bcf to proved before the price related revisions. Price related revision was a 112 Bcf essentially as 2008 year-end prices compared to 2007's were down in our various basins between $1.19 to $1.55 or 20% to 25% which impacted our reserves by this 112 Bcf. That's only about 2% of our total crude reserve portfolio. From prior years, we've been asked, what if prices would decline, what would happen to our portfolio, and we say really very little would happen, and as you can see, with only 112 Bcf written down with a much lower prices, our portfolio is not really impacted, which shows the strength of our reserves. Finally, in additions to this all, we moved about 1.9 Tcf of probables to proved again over the last three years, and our PDP Proved Valve Producing Percentage is now up to 57% up from 53% just a couple of years ago. I think that shows that we continue to increase our productive capacity while also increasing our proved reserve base. Slide 19, is a reconciliation of reserves basically you can see where we start two years ago at 3.70 Ts and we're now up to 4.3 Ts on a domestic basis. Our reserve additions came in on a total basis at 791 Bcf, which is just a little less than 2007's additions. Revisions are down well over 220 Bcf which makes that net 571 Bcf that you see on the graph here. Out of that 51% or 112 Bcf is due to the low end price which I just previously discussed, the other 49% or about 100 Bcf is due to reservoir performance related issues. Really all of that is in the slide tweaking at the models and primarily most of that was in the Piceance and what we do is as we look at it every year, we had a slight adjustment to the tail-end of our reserves primarily. And we look at and you multiply that slight adjustment times 3,100 wells, it turned out to be 100 Bcf, but really very slight adjustment in our reserves. We deduct our production of 406 Bcf which is up 21% as I mentioned from last year or 20% and we end up with our year-end reserves of 4.3 Tcf on a domestic basis. Slide 20, just to show what we've done in the last several years and the strength that we believe we have in our portfolio they are the ones increasing deliverability over the last four years we're up at compound average growth rate of 21% in production. We think that growth rate is truly remarkable given that one it's really organic. It's not done through acquisitions and also given the initial high decline rate of most of all our wells where we're operate in tight sands, coal-bed methane and shale. And then also, this base get you the organic growth rate. Panel two shows our growth in proved reserves. The compound average growth rate of over 9% and also shows a relative ratio of proved reserves between the PDs and puds and the proved developed in the puds and that proportion continues to increase and again as our reserve base is increasing, our productive capacity increases. And the last line shows our reserve replacement ratio over the last four years and this year without the price adjustment, that 148% would have been 176%. Turning now on slide 21, and our strategy continues to be aggressively in moving our gas away from the Rockies. And in the fourth quarter we had about 19% priced at the Rockies and 81% not priced to the Rockies. But let's break that down a little bit. The fourth quarter production is 1.156 Bcf a day. 37% of that is at Rockies prices before hedging and 63% of that is taken away. So we have about 425 million a day at Rockies prices. Then we take away the 200 million a day, they were hedged and we have only about 19% that's priced in the Rockies. Then Midstream consumed about 174 million cubic feet a day as fuel and shrink in that further reduces our Rockies exposure totaling about 51 million a day only about 4% of our entire portfolio. 2009 Rockies exposure is expected to be less than that at about 12% on an E&P only basis and obviously Midstream continues to consume fuel and shrink so our exposure will be very minimal in 2009. Looking at capital budget on slide 22, please recall last time I walked you through a decrease in our expected budget from 2.3 billion to 1.7 billion. That was a cut of about 607 million and we now cut another 700 million by dropping 13 more rigs. Since the ten rigs that we had dropped in the Piceance, three in the Ft. Worth basin we are doing quite a fewer wells in the Powder River associated facilities primarily the Piceance were down from $65 million and our cost savings on land we've have cut by $95 million. On the last call I mentioned in those $75 million of cost savings that we had, so we had significant cost savings. That brings us into our current guide point middle of $1 billion. We are seeing declines in all of our costs across the border, tubulars are down 10 to 21%, directional services down 12%, bids are down 35%, frac service is down 30%, work over rigs down 25% and many other things are down. And we think we'll continue to see additional cost savings. Our growth is predicted at 2% to 4% growth in volumes now most of that growth is in the first quarter as you would expect. So we summarize all this, our joined economic still remain very favorable at forward prices. But our capital program has been cut back significantly due to this global economic crisis. We're still opportunity rich for the future and if you look at our expected rig count, in the Piceance we expect to be at nine to ten, down from about 28 rigs and Ft. Worth we've about two down from about seven rigs. Slide 23, is our guidance you can see, we continue to ratchet it down our capital as you can see on the slide and also our price deck that you've seen in the appendix basically returns on recurring segment profit this year estimated to be between $325 million and $575 million depending on the price that you apply to that. Finally slide 24, I want to say a couple of things here, first of all I can't lose sight of our teams efforts for 2008 record year for reserves production and segment profit in a normal economic climate that would continue for many, many years. Second our premiere joint inventory as we've always said provides flexibility, we can ratchet it up or ratchet it down, we are now ratcheting it down almost all of those portfolios held by production, we can decrease our activity and we've done that and we'll preserve in a long-term value for the future growth. And the last point on the slide, there's no time to talk about today but we believe our new opportunities are very promising in other areas. Thank you. I'll turn it over to Alan now.
Alan Armstrong: Great, thanks Ralph. I'm going to start here on slide 26. I'm pleased to report that Midstream had another successful year earning $926 million in segment profit on a recurring basis. Our well positioned assets and a very dedicated teams, once again allow us to take full advantage of a robust Midstream environment for most of 2008. Of course in the fourth quarter results were certainly affected by the dramatic downward movement in NGL prices which impacted not only our domestic natural gas processing margins but also hurt co-developments and Canadian margins and imposed lower valuations of our inventories in many areas. While falling commodity prices negatively impacted some of our business, our fee-based revenues increased to over $215 million for the quarter reflecting the addition of Bass Lite volumes to our Devils Tower infrastructure. This fee-based number represented a 15% increase over the same period last year. The temperate momentum in the fourth quarter provided us a recurring segment profit for fourth quarter '08 which was $250 million lower than our fourth quarter of '07. The domestic NGL margins from our fully owned plants were $125 million lower. But we also incurred $78 million marketing loss in the fourth quarter compared to $6 million gain in that same area in the same quarter of '07. This $84 million variance is driven by dropping prices on products and transit, and I'll show them in more detail on this later in the presentation. Also our olefins business was hit hard by lowering commodity prices and took some significant lower cost to market adjustments on inventory evaluations. Moving on to slide 27, sure quickly here you can see that our margins there on the green line shows that we actually saw a $0.59 of margin in the fourth quarter, that's probably higher than a lot of people are expecting and still well above the $0.37 for our domestic plant. So then I'll explain on the next slide on 28 I'll show the drivers that show that NGL margin being higher. On 28 here, here is what we did in the third quarter, we showed the impact of ethane rejection, inventory shifts and collars on our fourth quarter NGL margin and our equity sales gallons. If you refer to this illustration, starting on the left side we depict our estimated equity NGL gallons that we normally would have sold during the quarter. And then next we subtract the estimated volumes that were lost due to ethane rejection. This adjustment is followed by adding the equity gallons from the prior to 930, so prior to the beginning of our fourth quarter inventory that we sold actually in the fourth quarter. So the result is our reported equity NGL sales volume of 285 million gallons. On the right side of the graph here, we talk about price and we depict the estimated normalized margin per gallon for the fourth quarter which is significantly lower than our reported margin. The normalized margin would have fallen below our five-year average margin of $0.37 as seen in the previous slide. There were three main drivers benefiting the per unit margin that we actually reported. First, in the blue stripe segment, we add the margin impact from the heavier product mix this quarter that increased our per unit margin. Because of the ethane rejection that we experienced, the NGL product mix that we sold was approximately 46% ethane and 54% propane. Our reported margin reflects the heavier mix of NGL sold and would have been reduced had we sold that usual 50 - 50 ethane to propane mix, so basically this richer mix with higher price products in it drove the price up. In the next bar, we had the impact on NGL margins from the collars that were put on in the beginning of 2008 and you can see, we got a nice lift there from our collars about $0.16 across all of our barrels. And then we had the margins recognizing the fourth quarter on the 930 inventory and so these are products that we sold out of inventory that had been produced in the third quarter. And we end up with our reported NGL margin of $0.59 per gallon. The difference between the normalized and reported equity volumes and reported margin are much smaller for the entire year as you can see on the total year slide that we have put into the appendix for you. Moving on to slide 29, I spoke earlier the $78 million marketing loss in the fourth quarter and this was driven by price movements during the quarter and inventory levels. And you can see on this graph here in the line above is the pricing levels and in the dark blue bar on the top graph there is the levels of inventory. You could see how that inventory rose dramatically. And now in the bottom you can see how that the marketing margin that we've reported since first quarter of '06 and you can see it's been fairly limited up until this quarter. Our NGL marketing group buys products from the plants at opus prices and then wears the risk of valued of that product in transit. Our normal transit times are three weeks but of course this is continuous over the whole quarterly period. The inventory that NGL marketing hold built throughout the year for several reasons, first of all during most of 2007 we've sold almost all of our NGLs in the Wyoming plants to a third-party, this arrangement expired in February of 2008 and therefore we had to build line pack inventory for our own account on the main American pipeline system. Secondly, we got product held up behind enterprise fractionator in Bellevue due to their frac being out of service due to the hurricanes late in the third quarter. And then finally, we had to build line pack inventory on the Overland Pass pipeline to begin shipping on this pipeline as we filled that previously unfilled pipe. So about the same time, our inventories were at their peak, NGL at their peak our NGL prices tumbled rapidly throughout the quarter. And then you can see from our graphic that normally this impact is very small and in fact it was positive to the tune of $17 million in 2007 so it provided a $95 million variance from year-to-year. Moving on to slide 30, our fourth quarter benefited from an increase in our fee-based business compared to our 2007 as we've seen consistently in 2008. Our fee-based revenues were up same quarter year-over-year and in each quarter of 2008. For the year, fee-based revenues increased 10% or $75 million over our 2007 fee base. Our return on average assets for the year was 21.4%. We calculated that return by using our segment profit, less general corporate expenses and other income expenses below the line and then we take that over our net assets which is net PP in a year long-term investments and our working capital. As we touched on in the third quarter, we'll continue to benefit from the start of the Overland Pass. Although the start-up was painful due to delays we incurred, our Wyoming and eventually Piceance plants will be in a unique position of being able to pick the better of either Conway or Mount Bellevue NGL prices. And we also enjoy dramatically reduced transportation of fractionation expenses and we've significantly improved our take away reliability. So far during the first quarter, we believe we've improved our propane net bag prices by almost $0.15 per gallon due to Overland Pass from our Wyoming plants. We also made significant accomplishment in the of fourth quarter on major projects. Bass Lite began flowing at full volumes in the fourth quarter and contributed about $19.7 million of operating profit in 2008 when coupled with some of the earlier production from there. We also help Bill Barrett Corporation deliver the first Paradox basin production in the Northwest pipeline in December. And as a result we received a significant acreage dedication in the heart of this basin that looks to be very prolific. And we continue to solidify our position in this new shale play. Our E&P group helped us gain this first mover advantage through their knowledge and ownership interest in the basin and our Willow Creek plant construction in the Piceance is progressing in line and with its schedule and we continue to project substantial completion during the third quarter of 2009. Our large deepwater projects Perdido Norte is expected to start-up in the fourth quarter. And the final connection for the Tahiti lateral is expected to be completed in March, and Chevron is still showing that as a third quarter start-up. Moving on to guidance very quickly here, with reduction in our commodity price outlook 2009 segment profit guidance has been lower to range of 400 million to 700 million, while we're expecting lower earnings in 2009 due to the pricing environment, new expansion projects are expected to contribute approximately $50 million of incremental profit compared to 2008. In looking at 2009 capital spending, we also note that we have $50 million reduction on our capital spending and that actually is $100 million lower spending because we actually transferred out $50 million of spending that didn't get completed in '08. So our '08 spending was actually lower and so our net is actually $100 million. Moving on to our key points here on slide 32. As we touched on briefly in the accomplishment slide, 2008 continues to show a high return on average assets at 21.4%. In fact, this measure has averaged 22% over the last three years. We believe that we remain at the top of our sector of the industry on this important measure due to our capital discipline, and are very focused and effective group of employees that remain very committed to driving both our strategy and our return for our shareholders. We haven't grown the most, but we have grown in a very profitable manner, and in a way that should benefit both our near-term and long-term shareholders. Our fee-based revenues grew $75 million from 2007 to 2008, and we anticipate our fee-based revenues will grow in 2009 as the new major projects that I listed begin to contribute and certainly grow into 2010 as Perdido Norte starts up at the end of this year. One key growth area in our entry is Paradox basin and we continue looking into similar large scale basins for other opportunities. And with that I will turn it over to Phil Wright.
Phillip D. Wright: Thanks Alan. We're very pleased to report another strong year in 2008 from our gas pipeline segment. Can I have slide 34 please. In spite of a $24 million head-win pun not intended from reduced IT fee revenue on Transco due to Hurricane Ike, our revenues were up $50 million from 2007 on a strength of a full year of our new rate structure on Transco versus only three quarters in 2007. Incremental contributions from our major expansion projects including our Leidy to Long Island, Potomac, and Gulfstream projects, and higher short-term firm sales on Northwest Pipeline. Slide 35 please. In addition to solid financial performance, 2008 was also a year of significant operating accomplishments. Among some of the highlights, we placed Phase I of our Sentinel expansion in service on December 22nd. We expect to have Phase II in service in November of this year. And when complete this project will add 142,000 decatherms a day of capacity on Transco to the Northeast. It's noteworthy, I believe that this project Leidy to Long Island expansion and our Potomac project all demonstrate that our team has the skill sets, the footprint, and the resources to grow and protect the coveted Transco franchise. In another market driven expansion, our Jackson Prairie deliverability enhancement and Northwest Pipeline was brought online in November. As well and in an another indication of the value of Northwest as the backbone of the gas delivery infrastructure of the Pacific Northwest, we set a new record for peak day deliveries and annual throughput. I'd also note that we were successful in extending contract terms for capacity on Northwest totaling approximately 360,000 decatherms a day during 2008 for an average extension of 13 years. Since 2006 we worked with our customers on Northwest to extend 1.5 billion a day, 1.5 billion cubic feet a day of firm transportation capacity and over 800,000 decatherms a day of storage and peaking services. And lastly our Gulfstream Phase IV expansion began flowing in November to serve the strong and growing power generation markets in Florida. Slide 36, turning now to our guidance. We're slightly lowering our segment profit range due largely to higher property insurance and pension expenses. There are some non-recurring maintenance expenditures we have to do including repairs to damaged caused by Hurricane Ike for which we don't expect to get some of the recoveries until 2010 and major replacements of two compressor stations. On our expansions, we provided detailed descriptions in the appendix, I won't cover them here, but I would observe that the expansions included are high quality, market driven projects with high credit quality customers. They aren't exposed to the year six and 11 turn back risk, producer driven projects have to contend with. So summing up on slide 37, gas pipes once again delivered solid predictable cash flow to our portfolio in 2008 greater than $1 billion in segment profit plus DD&A. We've affirmed our gas pipeline teams' ability to execute quality expansion projects in the highest growth regions in the country. All underpinned with long-term market driven contracts with high credit quality customers. And we have more on the way with $470 million to $575 million in expansions in our guidance for construction during the 2009 - 2010 timeframe. The outlook is great for gas pipes to continue to generate strong predictable free cash flow for Williams. I will turn it back to Don.
Don R. Chappel: Thank you, Phil. Let's turn to slide number 39 and will take a look at some summarized guidance information. This slide walks through the changing commodity price landscape as well as our changing CapEx earnings guidance. Column in the left was our assumptions as of November 6th and I think most of you agree that the price environment at that time was down sharply from what we saw earlier in the year was likely something viewed as fairly normal as $60 to $90 crude oil range, a $6 to $8 gas range something in line with what most consultants and EIA might call a more normal long-term environment, at that time we had a CapEx budget around $3 billion and expect to deliver about a $1.25 to $2.05 in EPS with a midpoint of about a $1.65. As we move forward as Steve mentioned earlier prices are down sharply, you can see them there but oil is down about 43%, gas was down about 40% from the time of our November call until this date. And as a result we throttled back our capital spending by about $650 million at the midpoint and also down $1.3 billion from 2008 levels and that resulted in a range of $0.60 to a $1.10. Certainly, a sharply lower level and one that we don't think is normal but one that will prepare to endure during 2009. I think if you look to the right, our 2008 actuals reflect our earnings power during a strong economy and a strong price environment so as we think about the future, I think we can look for a much better times ahead and much higher levels of earnings, I would note in our 2009 of price assumptions or excuse me earnings assumptions today while we're seeing many, many cost decline pretty sharply, there is a couple I'd just like to note, we are seeing sharp increases in our pension cost as a result of the sharp decline in the value of investments. We are also seeing a sharp increase in insurance costs as a result of hurricane effects and large claims in the Gulf Coast area. So just things to think about as you model the future and those are built into our numbers. Our 2009 forecast guidance on slide 40, again just details the components of that guidance role in the comparison to November 6th. Slide 41, again, summarizes what you saw from the business units before but E&P at Midstream down sharply and sharply lower commodity volume and prices and gas pipeline very steady given its long-term contracts with high quality credits. Overall, recurring earnings after mark-to-market adjustments again down sharply. And then finally, gas marketing at the bottom of the page after eliminating mark-to-market effects moving to about a expected breakeven level as the legacy issues diminish. Turning to page to slide 42, this just graphically depicts our natural gas position and I will just walk through how the slide works, the one on the left is our consolidated natural gas position, as you know E&P produces over Bcf a day, netting out fuel and shrink production taxes, we get down to a number of, I believe it's around 940. The green area is hedged principally with collars and you can see this the hedges for 2009 on slide number 62. I think we have about $600 million a day hedged and then the yellow would be the unhedged E&P volume. Below the line is the Midstream short position to produce NGLs and the dot, the diamond in the center would be our net natural gas position. So although we produce over a Bcf a day you can see that net long position is closer to a 100 million a day, about 10% of our total production. And again there is some variability because of the fact that many of the hedges were collars. As we take a look at the Rockies for the same period, again the lion's share of our E&P production is in the Rockies. Again we back off the production taxes, fuel and shrink. And into the purple burgundy colored area is the gas it's transported out of the Rockies to other price points. So what remains in the Rockies, sold in the Rockies would be the green which is hedged and the yellow which is unhedged. Again the blue represents the Midstream short position and the diamond would represent our enterprise position which is short Rockies gas very slightly. I'll just also note that we have about $300 million a day of hedges on it in 2010, natural gas hedges and that's detailed again on slide number 62. The Midstream area we have no hedges in 2009 or beyond on NGLs. Just turning the page please to capital spending, and you can see our capital spending detail here again down sharply from 2008 and down sharply from our November 6th guidance with the E&P off of about $700 million and the others being some fairly minor adjustments. Turning the page, think about cash flow and liquidity. I'll just hit a couple of highlights here. Cash flow from operations at a $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion, less dividend, minority interest payments to our MLP, investors. Other represents cash that would come out of the pocket of the MLP or international operations to fund. Some of the items included on the schedule, whether it be CapEx or minority interest payments and the like. The capital expenditure midpoint, $2.3 billion leaves us with a change in cash of about call it $500 million to $700 million negative beginning on restricted cash solely unrestricted not MLP cash, not international cash of $800 million. Plus the change from above, plus assumed borrowings of about $500 million yields an ending cash balance somewhere in the range of $600 million to $900 million. Capacity, remaining capacity under our credit agreements at the end of 2009 would be a $1.350 billion yield. So total at year-end 2009 ending liquidity estimated at $2 billion to $2.2 billion. Turning to slide 45, just a few other thoughts. Again we think a lot about capital allocations. In this environment, the capital is scarce and expensive. We'll allocate capital to our highest risk adjusted returns, but we also think about strategic issues and those are many both from a defensive standpoint as well as from an offensive standpoint and we think we have some opportunity to play offense in this environment. 2009 again our plant CapEx exceeds our cash flow, some where in the range of $500 million to $800 million. Again available cash and credit facilities will fund the excess investment. We have many mid-streaming gas pipeline projects that both Phil and Alan detailed in their remarks as well as are listed in the appendix to our presentation. We will finish those projects. E&P has reduced sharply to a $1 billion level, yet expects a slight increase in production during 2009. And we'll continue to preserve the many investment opportunities that we have for periods when prices are higher and capital is more available. In 2010, we would expect that the CapEx will have match assumed cash flows. The bulk of the change there is many of the projects in midstream and gas pipelines will be completed and while we have some new projects we would expect that overall we would match our CapEx with our expected cash flows and we'll remain flexible so that we can live within our means even with low prices. The forward strip shows an expectation by the market of somewhat improved prices, oil in the range of about $10 at this moment and gas in a range of about a $1.25. So that would certainly be helpful if that were to come true. And we'll retain the flexibility to adjust our spending. As I mentioned earlier, we would expect to play some strategic offence and we are very attuned to value creating opportunities that are created by this economic and financial market crisis as well as low prices. We'll be very focused, opportunistic, prudent, aware and disciplined. With that I'll turn it to Steve.
Steven J. Malcolm: I have no further comments, why don't we just move right into Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. Today's question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Please go ahead, sir.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Good morning, guys. Just a couple of questions, how extreme were the issues presented in the credit markets that they caused you to look at the risk associated with the potential structural change in the company. Can you give some more color around that?
Steven Malcolm: Well, probably not as much color as you would like, but there is no question that the changes that we've seen over the last few months certainly had an impact on our decision. And I mean, because of the unprecedented financial and commodity market uncertainty and we don't know where commodity prices are headed. We're heartened by the fact that strip prices are a little better in 2010.But on the other hand there are forecasts out that we are going to see Henry Hub prices at 250. So unprecedented uncertainty and so I think it's fairly clear that the market values more highly companies that are larger, that are more financially diverse, that have stronger balance sheets, that have stronger credit ratings. And then so those are some of the reasons that we've decided, what we've decided.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay, fair enough. And in your whole presentation today, put me to '09 guidance and you guys talked about some of the headwinds from higher cost from pension and insurance. But is there any way to cut cost out of the system too. There's been fair amount of cost inflation kind of across the board at all three of your segments over the last couple of years, is there any way to kind of reduce the cost structure of the company over the next 12 to 18 months?
Steven Malcolm: Well, there is a great tension between simply taking or steer cost saving steps versus staying positioned for the future. And we do anticipate that at some point there will be a recovery and there will be stronger commodity prices that will translate into good things for our company. And we spend a lot of time building the appropriate organization so that we can best take advantage of those opportunities. Having said that, we're looking at, obviously looking at taking steps to reduce cost and we're right now I would call at more of the low hanging fruit. We gave up our apartment in New York City for example. Not that big a deal but I think inappropriate step. We're cutting back travel, where it make sense for us to do so. We've negotiated hard and will continue to negotiate hard with third-party vendors. So I can assure you that we're looking very closely at our cost structure.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: One last question. In your, I think Don in your last comments you talked about playing offence. I guess does that mean also looking at opportunities for small acquisitions or is there some other or is it just talking about keeping the capital budget kind of a little bit above operating cash flow is that considered playing offensive?
Steven Malcolm: I think from a strategic standpoint, we're talking about the fact that... I mean we viewed the Paradox basin for example, as an offensive opportunity for us. The fact that we have an E&P presence there and a growing midstream footprint. That's good to stop and I think will create wonderful opportunities for us in the future. As well we will continue to look at strategic opportunities but they would have to be compelling in today's market. Don do you have any follow on comment?
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Steve, thanks for the time, I appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital. Please go ahead, sir.
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Hi, good morning, everybody, Steve just perhaps asking a restructuring question differently, just to make sure I am understanding kind of the results of the review. Is this something that is really just reflective of the reality today, the current market or was this more of a longer term managing risk in both good cycles and bad cycles, I guess what we are all trying to come to is this sort of a review that gets reignited; if and when commodity prices get back up to where they were in the third quarter?
Steven Malcolm: An excellent question Carl and a fair question. But again I'll probably disappoint here. We are going to continue to assess all of the options to enhance shareholder value but I am not going to speculate today on any future actions we might take in that regard. I think I have been pretty clear on the environmental changes, the economic landscape changes, the commodity price changes that impacted our decision and while we think it's very prudent to go forward and to continue with the current mix of businesses. But Carl I'm not going to speculate on well what does that mean for the future.
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Fair enough. Two other quick questions if I could Ralph, just on the, the proved reserves, if and this may be a difficult question to answer but if we were undertaking the review again today at current gas prices, I guess we are trying to figure out where the line sort of all of a sudden stops being linear and you have a sensitivity or some education of what perhaps negative price related revisions would be under the current price deck?
Ralph Hill: I don't, we'll add sense to that if you look at our cash cost in a number of basins are below $1, other basins are well below $2. And then if you look at the new rules this year we are... you are probably going to be allowed to do more with your probable and possible in areas of Titans that we have. It's just too early to speculate on that, and we probably feel the new rules are going to be favorable for us and there could be some areas that have offsets in the prices, if prices stay low for the year. But, we've actually met with our auditors and talked about that a little bit, but -- I think it's way too early to talk about either side about how much more will add because of new rules and then what could happen in a price environment. But I can tell you that we're competitive in all various, and we have very low cost in our areas and that will help us quite a bit.
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Okay, and I appreciate that. And then just lastly Phil just a clarification; the 24 million of headwinds that you said with respect to hurricane Ike, that was a fourth quarter revenue impact, i.e., excluding hurricane Ike, EBIT in pipes would have been essentially 24 million higher?
Phillip Wright: It was a reduced IT feeder revenues incurred during that period of time and so you -- we just dropped that out of the revenue line. And so as we go forward, we would expect ITP to revenue to pick back up.
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Okay, helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mr. Sam Brothwell from Wachovia. Please go ahead sir.
Sam Brothwell - Wachovia: Hi, good morning guys. Question on the E&P side on midstream. Can you just clarify -- did you cut by 10 rigs or did you cut two 10 rigs in the Piceance, Ralph?
Ralph Hill: Well actually it works out both ways. We cut by 10 and that ends up being for the average for the year, we should be around between 9 and 10.
Sam Brothwell - Wachovia: Okay.
Phillip Wright: We originally were at 28, 27 or 28 in the fall of last year. We cut down to approximately 20 in the last call and that we cut another 10 down to between 9 and 10.
Sam Brothwell - Wachovia: Got you. Okay. And can you give us some sense of this kind of a backlog of wells that you still got awaiting completion up there?
Unidentified Analyst: We haven't done that yet but we expect in this budget we have this year, we'll have about 75 or so wells that we won't complete to manage around this budget. So it would sort of huge number but we do -- we will have 65 to 75 wells, that we're at this point would not complete to manage within that budget.
Sam Brothwell - Wachovia: Okay. And can you give us some sense of kind of the price you need in the various basins particularly the Piceance to earn cost of capital?
Unidentified Analyst: We never given the cost of capital, for say, I can tell you that our cost -- and cost capital appears by this market to be a moving target. But -- we believe that even at the prices you would see today, we would clear our cost of capital in these basins.
Sam Brothwell - Wachovia: Right. And Alan, just kind of high level question, clearly got a lot of pressure on the U.S. petrochemical industry demand. Do you see -- looking forward do you think we'll return to -- ever return to normalized conditions or are we really seeing a secular change particularly with some of the petrochemical capabilities coming on in the Middle East?
Alan Armstrong: I think that mostly what we've seen today is just driven by worldwide recession. Actually I think the U.S. could be pretty well positioned long-term particularly with the gas supplies that we have. I think we could wind up being a fairly low cost supplier again as we were fairly optimistic about the petchem market just, because I think we've proven that we've got amble feedstock here and I think that'll keep people here. I think certainly what we have right now is just recession and I don't think its so driven by lack of exports at this point.
Sam Brothwell - Wachovia: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). We'll take our next question from Lasan Johong. Please go ahead.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: Thank you. Ralph any chance you can give us exit rates for the first quarter and the fourth quarter of this year?
Ralph Hill: I don't have the first quarter with me. I think if you look at it, we expect our exit rate at the end of the year would be down about 4% to 5%, say around 5% from the beginning of the year. So most of our growth in the first quarter -- is in the first quarter is probably 10% to 12%, maybe slightly more and then it tapers off during the year. I can't say that every year if you look at 2010, and we're not giving that 2010 guidance yet, but if you look at the efficiencies we grind out every year for example we've drilled some wells in the Piceance in five days or less. We've taken Ryan Gulch wells and average wells in 2008 were better than the best while we drill in 2007. In fact all the efficiencies in, we believe 2010 even with the lower rate of capital we're using and I assume flat level capital in 2010. We do expect the decline would be rest and we'd be flat to what we see in 2009. So its not an ongoing decline, but there will be a decline this year.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: If you stop drilling entirely and just kept your production on line, could we assume a 15 maybe 20% decline rate overall of your E&P business?
Ralph Hill: I haven't done that for a while. For now, we'll just need to get back to you on that. I do not know that answer, but that's probably a decent assumptions, I have to play -- I have to look at the numbers.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, Steve considering the potential for the economic crisis to kind of remain sluggish and the fore curve measured against that economic scenario seems to be bullish. Any chance you're going to put on lot more hedges going forward to, but kind of take advantage of that for planning fore curve?
Steven Malcolm: Yes, we always look at what the market is offering. We'd had as you know a corporate strategy to have 40% to 60% of our production hedged. That obviously was influenced by the enterprise position particularly that position in the Rockies, but we look at hedging opportunities always weekly and I can assure you that we will take advantage of opportunities as we see them.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: My final question, do you anticipate big impacts from potential LNG flows into the U.S.?
Steven Malcolm: That's a -- I still think. The answer to that is somewhat uncertain. Certainly demand in Asia and Europe for LNG is somewhat diminished, it would appear, whether that finds its way to the U.S. is somewhat questionable and I guess I don't have a crisp answer for you today.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks Steve.
Operator: We'll take our next call from Joe Allman. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is open.
Joseph Allman - JP Morgan: Yes, thank you. A follow up on the rig question. So the rig drops that you plan are already done for this year or there is more rigs that are getting dropped?
Steven Malcolm: They're almost all done. There are a few rigs that are finishing up on various pads and its more efficient to let them finish those pads, but we have significantly dropped rigs, since the beginning of the year, almost all of them have been dropped.
Joseph Allman - JP Morgan: Got you. And then another question on the restructuring. In the review process what were some of the benefits that you saw for separating of the different businesses.
Steven Malcolm: Well, as we described during our last call it was all driven toward finding a way to enhance shareholder value and that was the part of goal that we were looking for. So, that we'll continue to asses as I mentioned earlier, we'll continue to assess all of the options that are available to enhance shareholder value in the future.
Joseph Allman - JP Morgan: When you look at the value of your -- say your different businesses I know it's hard to separate it out, but do you think that your E&P business is undervalued relative to other more peer E&P companies?
Unidentified Analyst: That's again. It would be depended on the various assumptions that you might make for how you would value what multiples do apply in today's very uncertain market. So again, I don't have a crisp answer for you there, it's something that we continue to evaluate and look at.
Joseph Allman - JP Morgan: Great. And then for your guidance for NGL margins $0.22 to $0.35, does that bake in an improvement in the second half of '09 for frac spreads?
Alan Armstrong: There is not much movement during the year from what we are seeing right now actually on that the percent of NGL crude particularly on the ethane does improve during the year. But the base commodity prices are held pretty flat but we do see it improving percent of ethane crude for instance.
Joseph Allman - JP Morgan: Got you. And then the tax benefit for this quarter, is that a true up for yearly taxes or?
Don Chappel: The tax adjustment is just an annual detail review of the effective state tax rates. Our earnings have been growing in areas with either lower or no state income tax since result. Our view of our state tax rate has declined somewhat so we have reduced that and we made that calculation in the fourth quarter that get supplied to bulk earnings for the period in deferred tax balances. And that's what you saw roll through the fourth quarter in a less.
Joseph Allman - JP Morgan: I'm sorry we are going to say the last.
Don Chappel: That was all.
Joseph Allman - JP Morgan: Okay. Thank you. And then lastly on pensions, what's the unfunded status and what will be additional cash contribution to the pensions?
Don Chappel: Ted Timmermans is our controller, Chief Accounting Officer will take that question.
Ted Timmermans: Thank you, Don. As to the unfunded status we'll be publishing that in the 8-K. And as you could imagine given the returns on plant assets over the course of 2008, you will some decline and we'll also be posting what our funding expectations would be for 2009 as well, so stay tuned.
Joseph Allman - JP Morgan: Okay, I appreciate that, thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Mr. Shaun Grant (ph) from Zimmer Lucas. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. Just a quick question on your CapEx, does the budget assumes that you exercise the option on Overland?
Don Chappel: No, it does not.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. That's it, thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Becca Followill with Tudor Pickering & Co.
Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering & Co.: Good morning, just to clarify, you'd said that 2010 production would be flat is that assuming continued $1 billion CapEx?
Don Chappel: I was just saying, if we ran about that level billion and with the efficiencies we have, we would not expect this decline it we'll see to continue on.
Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering & Co.: Okay. And then on E&P at what point... at what price do you say I'm going to reassess and off my CapEx budget?
Steven Malcolm: Well I ask for that everyday, no sorry Becca. Well, I think this it's really just going to be a function of it, as Don mentioned to the extend we have additional cash flow and the prices would come up. I think we would be allowed to be the first mover to come in and spend additional dollars. So really this is our cash flow would come up. I think it be the time you see us do that. Don do you want talk?
Don Chappel: The range of prices we provided, I think were fairly good within their range. Certainly if prices were to decline below the bottom and to the range that we laid out which was 450 Henry Hub, we'd certainly take another look at where we are, but we certainly already looked at the kind of the $4.50 to $6 range within that spending plan. But clearly, if things move sharply lower, there is a difference again but we're hopeful that we won't have to see that. But obviously we, none of us know.
Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering & Co.: And then just to once again, ask a question that's been asked a couple of times, you said on a conference call a couple of times the word strategic offense and its got people wondering. Really what that means is that I've got something in mind I think that prices for assets are going to fall or what, I don't understand what you mean.
Don Chappel: Sorry to not be clear, but I think all we're saying here is that in the case of the Paradox for example, we are seeking to expand our footprint both from an E&P and midstream perspective. So what we were trying to convey is this isn't only about playing defense. We are able to make investments that expand our footprints. And we'll continue to look at strategic opportunities that make sense. But don't in anyway conclude that we have something in mind or we're about to ready to announce something.
Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering & Co.: Okay, thank you.
Ralph Hill: We drilled four verticals and one is in way on its completion and five horizontals and two wait on completion. We had planned to drill seven horizontals this year and now it looks like we'll drill more like 14. So we're just, those are some areas we are playing offense and there is some other land opportunities that we have out there that we kept in the budget to continue to expand positions in various areas.
Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering & Co.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sunil Jagwani with Catapult. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Sunil Jagwani - Catapult Capital: Hi, good morning. I'm just trying to reconcile a couple of different statements. I guess firstly you have talked about being able to make good return even at current prices on the E&P side. The DD&A rate on the E&P income statement that flows through is $1.80 or $1.90 somewhere around there. And then the reported at least the way I calculated the finding and development costs are over $3 given that you spend 2.5 billion in the E&P last year. So I'm just trying to reconcile those three statements and if you can help me that would be great? Thanks.
Unidentified Analyst: Well first of all, we don't look at a one year finding cost ever, but we could, we give that out, and I think the way our portfolio is set up, there are some years where you're going to see us work very low, and some years a little higher. In that $3 calculation, you have about $528 million that was spent on acquisitions, which were almost with exception maybe 20 Bcf or maybe 30 Bcf that was entirely for 3P reserves. So we just look at on a three year basis. Our three year basis is now up to about 232. It was about $1.80. Cost were up some. Areas we drilled this year were up some, those kind of things, but then if you look at it, well I think its going to happen this year, I think you'll see that drop significantly, because where we're drilling, how we're dealing, and the CapEx that we have, and the costs that are coming down. And then just on the cash side of the world, our cash breakeven is well below $1 and you take that and you take what isn't a normal environment and I believe that we see our returns were all 15%, 16% or higher in our -- on our drilling program.
Sunil Jagwani - Catapult Capital: Wonderful, thank you. That's all I needed. Thanks.
Operator: This concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Steve Malcolm.
Steven Malcolm: Well, thank you. I would just conclude by saying what I said earlier. We expect our mix of businesses, our investment grade rating, our strong liquidity to service well in this very, very challenging economy and very weak energy market. So thank you very much for tuning in this morning.
Operator: This concludes today's Williams Companies conference call. Thank you for joining us and have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Brandy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Williams Third Quarter 2008 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on-mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Mr. Campbell, you may begin your conference.
Travis Campbell - Investor Relations: Thank you, Brandy, and good morning every body and welcome to the Williams third quarter 2008 earnings call. As always, we thank you for your interest in the company. After my brief comments, Steve Malcolm, the CEO will go through some thoughts, and then we'll have our CFO, Don Chappel briefly talk about our solid third quarter results. Ralph Hill will speak to E&P results and guidance and then Alan Armstrong will review Midstream business. Phil Wright is here with us today to take any questions about the pipeline business. After Alan's remarks, Don will review our thoughts on commodity prices and how they affect our guidance. Steve will then make a few brief closing remarks before we take your questions. I realize there is a lot of calls this morning and that you all have to monitor so we'll try to be brief. Please note that on our website, williams.com, you'll find the slides from this morning. Additionally, there is the appendix that contains all the data we typically provide. The third quarter earnings press release and all the coming schedules and the third quarter 10-Q are also available on the website. This morning we also announced that we're evaluating a variety of structural changes to enhance shareholder value. That press release is also available on the website. Slide two and three, titled forward-looking statements disclose various risk factors and uncertainties related to the future operations and expectations. Actual results of course will vary from current expectorations due to the factors disclosed. Please review that information. Slide four, Oil and Gas Reserves Disclaimer is also important and we urge you to read that slide as well. Also included in the material are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to generally accepted accounting principles. Those schedules are available and are integral to the presentation. So, with that, I will turn it over to Steve.
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Travis. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call and thank you for your participation in the call and interest in our company. Let's start by looking at slide six and some of the highlights. Williams achieved another quarter of strong earnings growth. Net income is up from a $198 million in third quarter of '07 to $366 million in third quarter '08. Year-to-date net income is up from $765 million in '07 to $1.3 billion in '08. As well, recurring adjusted income per share climbs 46% for the quarter from $0.39 to $0.57 and 60% year-to-date from $1.14 to $1.82. Natural gas production increases 18% third quarter '07 versus third quarter '08 from 974 a day to 1146 a day and that production growth was really led by spectacular 37% growth that we saw on the Powder River. Encouraging initial results in the Paradox basin and Ralph Hill will describe that in more detail in a few minutes. And then the last point, the effect of two Hurricanes and other one-time unusual items certainly impacted our third quarter results. Looking at slide seven, obviously a strong balance sheet and strong liquidity is critically important in today's market and I think this slide summarizes our position. Total liquidity of more than $3.5 billion as of October 31st, we have over $1 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, we currently have in placed credit facilities of over $2.6 billion of which two-four is available. Our primary facility doesn't expire until 2012. The total liquidity number does not include the marginal facility that we can use for E&P hedges. And we also have excess capacity in the form of synthetic letters of credit that will expire in 2009 and 2010. Now please recall that these were put in place when we have the power business and are not needed in a current structure. We will not have significant debt retirements until 2011. And so unquestionably we have a very strong liquidity position from which to fund our growth and in addition to liquidity. I have just described in some detail, we continued generate robust cash flow from operations. We have as well substantial flexibility in our E&P program which allows us to reduce near term capital spending by about $1 business in '09 and '10. So, I think we are very well placed to react appropriately depending on where commodity prices head. We can ramp up quickly take advantage if the prices move up and we think they are going to stay there or we can cut another significant amount of capital if commodity prices fall lower than our forecast. Nevertheless, on slide eight, in recognition of the market, we are scaling back our capital spending forecast that may not be obvious. Since, our mid-point remains at $2.9 billion. But, we have in fact sidelined about $350 million of projects that we had previously talked about as potential growth opportunities. You'll see the E&P is projected '09 spending is about $700 million below '08 levels. And yet we're maintaining prior guidance on production growth of somewhere in the 8% to 10% range. Those numbers are driven on assumptions around lower rig utilization partially offset by higher costs and we expect the sharp cost increases that we experienced in '08 to diminish somewhat in '09. In Midstream and Gas pipes, we're maintaining spending on committed progress and differing some others. Then, so the outlook, now looking at slide nine, the outlook for the remainder of '08 and full year '09 obviously reflects the environment that we're faced with. The financial crisis, the recession have driven energy prices lower and the obvious effect is reduced projections for cash flow and earnings. The commodity prices, you look at '08 versus '09 the midpoint for crude '08 is about $105 a barrel and '09 midpoint is $30 lower at about $75 a barrel. And as well we're essentially bringing down Henry Hub natural gas by $2 an Mcf. And, so you can see how those commodity prices change our expected recurring adjusted earnings per share in the mid-points are shown on this slide and Don will go through that in more detail. Looking at the next slide, we have announced today that our management Board are valuating a variety structural changes in the company, as a means to further enhance shareholder value and among those potential changes is separation of one or more of our business units. I think you've seen Williams on many occasions during our long history successfully reshape and reinvent the company, in ways that create the most value. And in the last few years, we pulled a variety of levers to accelerate value creation and I'm speaking here about the formation of two publicly traded MLP's expanding one of those WPZ, through the contribution of additional high quality assets. We divested our power business and completed $1 billion stock repurchase program. We've also taken actions to strengthen the company's credit profile and as a result we've earned an investment grade credit rating. Our capital position is sound and our growth opportunities are abundant. As you well know, we have embraced the integrated model and I think that we performed very well in three years ending 2007. We delivered a 128% total shareholder return. We've talked to you about the merits of that integrated model. We've talked about the fact that stable and steady cash flows from gas pipes formed the foundation of our credit. Gas pipes close of cash for investment in higher returned projects. We've talked about midstream and as being a wonderful internal hedge to our E&P operations. And we've talked how the integrated model creates real and significant growth opportunities. And you'll hear about another of host today. And so, we entered 2008 with great optimism, we had just sold Power, and moved into a very strong commodity price environment and began to under perform many of pure plays. A lot of people who kept saying, what's the catalyst around Williams and of course I was thought that our continued strong performance... strong financial performance should be enough, then we moved into a down commodity market as we've seen here most recently, I thought that there would perhaps be some gravitation towards safety and safety that Williams offer by virtue of its integrated model, we have seen that occur. And so, we believe that we can do more to deliver value to our shareholders in the future and the evaluation that we are announcing today is the next step in on our ongoing strategic process. With any changes in company's structure, we intend to maintain our strong credit profile. I can't stress that enough, while we worked hard to earn this profile, because it has the advantage of reducing risks, increasing our flexibility to successfully compete and seize value creating opportunities and I think it's critical given today's challenging market conditions. As part of this evaluation, we will consider macro economic environment, the credit markets, energy prices among other things. But we believe that it is prudent to begin the evaluation now because these factors can be much different by next year. And so we want to be ready to act when markets improve. So, as we are in the evaluation stage, it would be premature to get into further details at this point. But we do expect to announce a specific direction in the first quarter of next year and look forward to updating you then. And I know that you're going to have questions and we will try to be as responsive as we can. But I hope you understand that we probably can't be more specific than what it is in the release. And so most of our answers to your questions will likely be, I don't know or I don't want to speculate or it's too early to say. So with that, I will turn it over to Don.
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Steve. Let's turn to slide number 12 please. Financial results, I think Steve had the highlights here. Again, recurring income from continuing ops after mark-to-market adjustments of $0.57, up from $0.39 or a 46% increase and on a year-to-date basis, $1.82, up 60%. Now let's turn to slide 13, there's a 50,000 for view and Ralph here will talk about E&P. Alan Armstrong will talk about Midstream results. And Gas Pipelines are steady, so we won't have Phil speak to those resolves, but as you can see focusing on the recurring column, E&P's results are up sharply at $379 million versus $169 million in the prior year, that's an increase of 124%. Midstream is off somewhat, on lower NGO volumes and sales volumes and Alan will speak to that. And as I mentioned Gas Pipelines is steady. If we go down to the last line in the schedule, you see our gas marketing services, which provides services to E&P and Midstream as well as manage our legacy positions in our transportation and storage. We have a $45 million after mark-to-market loss there. And factors in that are lower cost of market adjustment, and our gas storage inventory totaling $24 million and you can see that in the foot note, as well as our legacy loss related to some legacy positions totaling $10 million. So, again, that was largely related to lower cost of market adjustments on our natural gas inventory. And most of the inventory has been sold forward at a profit. And we'll see that profit on that in the first quarter of 2009. Again, at the bottom of the schedule in the bold type, the total segment profit after mark-to-market effects $743 million, up 23% from the prior year. Turning to page number 14, same schedule on a year-to-date basis, I won't spend much time on that other than to focus on the segment profit after mark-to-market total at $2.417 billion, up 40% from the prior year. And with that, I'm going to turn it to Ralph.
Ralph A. Hill - President, Exploration and Production: Thank you, Don. I am pleased to be here today and share a great quarter with you for our third quarter, and also demonstrate E&P's ability to participate with Williams in helping our flex our capital spending, maintaining capital discipline. And I think the key to that is, while we do this, we will be able to maintain our long... portfolio's long-term value. Looking at slight 16, quarter-to-quarter highlights, third quarter '08, third quarter '07, we had 18% volume growth, our recurring segment profit was up 124%, that was obviously a function of that volume and the third bullet net domestic realized average pricing increase of 52%. Year-to-date, we're at 20% volume growth, 105% increase in recurring segment profit growth and our domestic price is at 42% 42% year-to-date versus last year this time. On slide 17, again looking at third quarter '08 by itself or segment properties up 124% as shown graphically here by the bars, productions up 18% and stress once to again then in our portfolio, transportation portfolio and hedging program as this inflated EMP from the revenue, revenues from the Rockies basis blow out. Slide 18; look in each of areas Piceance Valley was up 14%, the Highlands was up 44%. As Steve mentioned the Powder continues have an incredible year at 37% production growth Forth Worth as we continue to ramp up at 41% and San Juan continues to actually improve in a very mature basin. The volumes reported on this slide show basically about 1% sequential quarter decrease, and that's also in our management discussion analysis. Slightly down from 1159 second quarter to 1146. We estimate, we had at least 49 million a day as to picked by the hatch part of this slide there was shut down due to pipeline curtailments, Hurricane Ike, scheduled non-schedule gathering, maintenance facilities, imbalances, etcetera. So, if you had that back in we actually had a sequential quarter increase of about 3% from what looks like a 1% decline. So none of those... what we have term one time advance happen we really would be up about 3% sequentially. So, I just want to point that out on slide 18. On slide 19, as Steve mentioned and as Bill Berry have reported yesterday we've had a encouraging results in the Paradox Basin where we currently hold about 220,000 gross acres and 110,000 net acres. In 2007, we drilled three vertical wells as you all know we did a lot of extensive testing and coring and we had encouraging results there. We have now so for in 2008 drilled two horizontal wells in our initial full rates are really encouraging. The first on four is our test well which we call the Koski, which we have a 45% interest in, obviously, Bill Berry has a 55% interest in. As the natural gas discovery in the Gothic Shale, which I talked about a little bit before, it pulled an average of 4.5 million a day for approximately 17 days and yielded a 20 barrels of condensate are during the final 10 days of the 17 day test, sorry about that. The final well, actually produced as high as 5.7 million a day. We are currently shut down with sales line. Second one is well is on a where we call the Neely. We could successfully completed in eight stage fracture stimulation line in a matter of about 3,655 feet out. Early in the flow back process it flowed over 3 million a day over the final 3 days of the 7 day test. So, we are very encouraged with each of those. We've also drilled another vertical well nine miles north of the Neely, and we're testing that for quarrying to make sure we understand this Shale. And there we have spread our third horizontal is not a well which is offset to the Koski well. So, going forward, we're planning was therefore obviously the delay at it is still to begin working with our midstream partner here Williams have with their Armstrong's group to set that up to gather this gas and able ultimately this gas down to San Juan basin. As you see in 2009 we're drilling up to a seven horizontal wells. We obviously continue to plan the conduct extensive production testing and also constructed for small processing plant to begin to get this gas which is pretty rich gas about 1200 Btu content. So, very encouraging results from the Paradox. On slide 20, our guidance. We in 2008 briefly, the 2008 profit guidance change is primarily is actually price driven and as we look at the capital spending, it is up from where we were last time, as you mentioned last time and also when I talked to you at our New York conference. We did say we were seeing cost increases as the year began and those cost increases added about a $100 million. So the difference there, our drilling activity as we continue to have additional efficiencies and new acquisitions in the Piceance Island and we'll also say new acquisitions in the Barnett. We added about another $150 million of capital spending there and about $75 million for land and exploration activity that we're in some of the new areas ultimately, we came about to our current range of 2350 to 2450. Looking to 2009, again the segment profit and DD&A the change there is oil price driven primarily 90% of that amount is price driven and looking the capital expenditures lets turn to slide 21. Capital analysis where we are not previously '09 guide point on the far left side of this and let me walk you through this slide. Our production mid-points was11% growth, we had intended to as we moved into 2009 add a rig in the highlands as you can see at two rigs in the Fort Worth. We have land and other opportunities we are doing well efficiencies just meaning we continue better, our team does on a are spread-to-spread ties between wells, when a number of new explorations opportunities we're looking into and obviously that cost increase that we have seen so far this year we've seen so far this year, we've had into our budget to it more like $2.3 billion. Production growth was going to be in about 14% to 17%. As we work through the current financial environment that we are all in, we are in the process of and it doesn't happen immediately, but over the course of the next several months and next year. We will be dropping six rigs in the Piceance as you can see that brings us down by $240 million. Our exploration activity will not be as robust as we planned, Piceance facilities go along with some of the rigs we're dropping, you'll see that drops down. So, always to showing our capital discipline, I think I'd like also to stress is that we do preserve all of our value here, even though we are going to have less activity. We believe we will continue to see some cost savings. We've seen some start to head us, and that's in there for $75 million land, Powder River, we'll drill 100 less wells and in the Powder River, we'll drill less wells in the San Juan Basin. And we'll drop two rigs in the Fort Worth. So that drops is really to occur in '09 guidance midpoint about $1.7 billion. Our production still should be 8% to 10% range. It could be as high as 10% range, but we are putting a... at the 10% level, we were putting the range up there right now as we continue to work through the overall final impact as we drop some of the rigs and show the capital discipline that we are able to employ. Next slide please; which I believe is slide 22. This slide you've seen before, answers the time, I'll just basically stress the third... the second bullet there. All right, 16% of our gas is priced in the Rockies. We also have Midstream consumption that offset the number of that, so you see we do have the natural hedge in there. So obviously, showing 16% is really what we do E&P only, when you add Midstream side, it really puts us very balanced. If not actually, slightly short. And our 2009 Rockies exposure is expected to be very similar to 2008 than that prior, what we've seen so far is 2008 has been 14% to 16%. Final slide, I will just take the top bullet at the final slide. Basically most of our portfolio is held by production. So, we can't and we have decreased our activity which provides capital discipline. We also while doing this, we'll preserve the long-term value growth for this portfolio for our future... for our future growth. And we also are very encouraged as our partner was yesterday for some of the new results in the Paradox Basin. So, now over to Alan.
Alan Armstrong - President, Midstream Gathering & Processing: Great. Thanks, Ralph. Midstream's recurring profit for third quarter of '08 was $52 million lower than our third quarter of '07. Unique circumstances contributed this result and I'll go through the cause of this. First, as a result of delayed start of Overland Pass Pipeline capacity allocations targeted at Williams barrels on the similar NGL pipeline, forced our western plants in the Overland interjection. This caused about 41% lower Overland's gallons that we had in third quarter of '07. Of course the higher average per unit margins that you see in the quarter were also driven by this lower Overland content in our mix barrel, but of course the Overland is the lower priced portion of that barrel. And even largely impact came from hurricanes on the Gulf Coast, which reduced not only Gulf NGL production, but also our NGL sales in the West. With hurricane disruptions at the month value fractionators resulted in a build up of extra inventory from our western plants. This production couldn't be sold in the third quarter of '08 and will show up as incremental revenues in the following quarters as the inventory build up is fractionated and sold. If Overland Pass Pipeline, had been operational when expected, we would not face this allocation and the related Overland interjection. So, we certainly saw a tightness in capacities coming on the NGL pipelines out there. And that was certainly what prompted us to initiate the Overland Pass Pipeline project, and unfortunately, that coming in a little bit late certainty impacted our volumes for the quarter. Also contributing to our lower third quarter segment profit as compared to a third quarter last year was about $29 million lower margins in our olefins business unit. Our guidance mid-points sustained damaged from Hurricane Gustav which was the first hurricane in early September and this resulted in about there weeks of downtime. And additionally, we built up ethane inventory during the hurricane period that we had to right down at the end of the quarter. As ethane prices declined and we weren't able to consume that and convert it into ethylene. Higher operating cost in midstream were a smaller impact and that was driven by $8 million of hurricane related repair cost and $7 million of higher depreciation expenses. It is worth noting in spite of the hurricane disruption our Gulf Coast course fee revenues and primarily our deepwater business were slightly higher in third quarter of 2008 then in third quarter 2007 and I'll remind you the third quarter of 2007 was not impacted by hurricane. The stronger fee-base volumes were driven by additional production being tightened to the East breaks deepwater system with some new wells coming on there and earlier in the year and also the new backs light volumes that are flowing into our Devil's Tower infrastructure is not contributing in large ways to our fee-based revenues. Overall, our fee-based revenues grew by $16 million from third quarter of '07 to third quarter of '08 and even more impressive $39 million year-to-date in '08 verses '07. So, our goal of continuing to grow more fee-based business continues to produce both even in light of some of the setbacks we saw in this third quarter. Moving on to slide 26 here, here we are answer the question, what would the quarter have produced without the delay in Overland Pass and the hurricanes. And, this slide on 26 shows the impact of allocations, hurricanes and hedges. Now, this slide only speaks to the impact associated with our domestic NGL business. So, this is not captured anything we saw in the olefins business here. But, first is a depiction of the gallons impacted by these events, so starting on the left side of this graph. You can see that the estimated normal equity NGL gallons that we likely would have sold during the quarter as being the bar on the far left there. And, that would have been roughly 360 million gallons. And, next we subtract the estimated volumes that were lost to the allocations on the similar system and that was about 60 million gallons. And then this adjustment is followed by subtracting the hurricane related gallons and first is the inventory build there and of course again this is product that we would have sold in the quarter except for the month though the fractionators is being out of service post the hurricane and so that is sitting as raw make inventory in Mount Bellevue and hopefully we will be getting that fraction sold in the following quarters here. And then finally the damage from our Gulf Coast facility, so these are direct Gulf coast related NGL reductions that they you see there so and that's about 60 million gallons for inventory build and is about 50 million gallons from the damages there directly. Next moving over to the impact on the NGL margins; two things effectively netting each other out here, first of all as I mentioned earlier a heavier product mix this was because of the lack of Ethane that is in our mix actually we had of course heavier products and those heavier products and more valuable which would have driven our number up. And then that was offset though by the hedges that we put in place at the first of 2008 and that drove the number down by about $0.07 and so that collar impact for the quarter was $0.07 against all of our barrels produced but if you took that against just the ones that we had hedged it's about $19 million of impact or flattening that we saw in the quarter and most of that was in July and August, our hedge was pretty close to neutral in September as prices lower. So, overall the impact was estimated about $40million in NGL margin and $90million equity gallons for the third quarter of which approximately 16 million gallons should pull back to us. Moving on to slide 27, we are pleased that our third quarter segment profit benefited from an increase in fee-based business compared to year-to-date 2007. Our fee-based revenues were up over prior year for the third consecutive quarter despite hurricane impact for our fee-based business. And other than the significant negative impact from the two events we've discussed, we had a terrific quarter, and are continuing to build to another great year for Midstream. Overall, we estimate the two hurricanes alone damaged our quarter by just over $50 million and the curtailed that production at West Coast us about $25 million. You can see our estimated impact depicted in the hatch bar there which is roughly 70 low of the $70 million there in that hatch bar, just try to get to something more normal borrowing of the incidents. We are pleased to report that our new Western projects, the Willow Creek plant in the Piceance, and the one setter [ph] plant expansion both to continue on schedule, and very excited about the way those projects are coming together and the growth that that will provided us in '09 and '10. Now that Overland Pass section from one setter [ph] to bush is up and running. Our western plants will be in the position to avail to move product out of the West, and in the market areas for sale. So, there's allocation problem, and we have... and even the hurricane impact those, issues are mitigated heavily going forward. Overland Pass will resolve in significant lower transportation and fractionation expenses for us, and ample capacity for our new production coming out on the Piceance and one warm setter area in 2010. In addition, we should not see the same hurricane effects that we saw as we'll have the capability of fractionating product at Conway and Bush ton in the future. This increased reliability for E&P customers as well makes our plants even more attractive in the future. So in short, Overland Pass is a great... is a great addition to our offering of services to our customers. And we're looking forward to the new and fruitful relationship with one and Overland Pass in years to come. There are also good things happen in the deepwater three new tiebacks to floating production systems that fee discovery were recently announced. And these should boost our discovery volumes in the future. In addition, our new deepwater gas and oil pipelines serving Chevron's Blind Faith platform we're commissioned amid some very difficult sea conditions in the third quarter. We are now excited to watch the Chevron's team brings the new Blind Faith filled into production and we are obviously, anxiously waiting for that. Moving on to the next slide here talking about our '08, '09 guidance, we are lowering our '08 and '09 recurring some of the profit guidance. This reflects the impact of the allocation issues and the hurricanes we saw in the third quarter and till much lesser degree softening margins in '08. But certainly in '09, we are predicting much lower margins and that is the major impact for our '09 business. In response to this, reduced profitability we're cutting back our capital spending by about $100 million over this guidance period we've lowered our 2008 capital spending by $200 million and we've raised our '09 by $100 million this change is in response to timing and spending on some projects that got moved from '08 and to '09 and the cancellation the deferral of some projects in '09. A small portion of the lower 2009 guidance in profit is attributable to these lower CapEx. Also in response to lower core marketing prices, we've reduced our forecast to domestic NGL margin guidance by $100 million in 2008 and $200 million in 2009. Our 2008 NGL margin guidance is also affected by the Ethane rejection that incurred in the third quarter due to Overland Pass starting up approximately three weeks later than we had planned. And these reductions in '08 and '09 translate into lower NGL margin guidance mandate on a per gallon basis as well. It's important to note that although we're lowering our segment profit guidance to an average $1 billion per year through this period it still represents a tremendous return and free cash flows from this business and that's an approximately $4 billion of net assets. Additionally, we remain very excited about the number of large scale projects that will be placed at the service during 2009 and 2010 of course that includes Willow Creek-1, TXP 4 at warm setter [ph] and are very large Preditto North A project in the Western deepwater Gulf in Mexico. And with that, I'll turn over to Phil Wright. Sorry, Don. Sorry about that.
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Alan. Just turn to slide 30, just this is a summary of our new price assumptions embedded in our forecasts and certainly 2008 is down somewhat as a result of the economic conditions and lower prices. And we've seen big moves in 2009, I would point out that the 2009 assumptions that we're using the midpoints or are somewhat below the current strip prices that were we saw as it close yesterday, yesterday we saw Rockies close at $543 near the top end of our range we saw San Juan in Mid-Continent at 649 again closer to the top end of our range Henry Hub Gas for 2009 its 769 again closer to the top end of our range and crude oil prices WTI crude at 75,47 just above the mid point. So, big moves in prices and we provided this comparison to the prior guidance and the ranges for your reference. But again I think the ranges would appear to be inline with 2009 strip prices and the midpoints generally slightly lower than strip. Turnings to slide number 31, update on our 2008 forecast guidance November 6th forecast $2.10 to $2.30 down from our August 7th guidance reflecting these lower prices and if you turn the turn the page slide number 32 to 2009 forecast guidance of $1.25 to $2.05 again lowered to reflect sharply lower prices. Again, $60 to $90 of crude environment versus $80 to $120 previously and the $6 to $8 Henry Hub natural gas environment versus $8 to $10.50 previously, I would also note that we continue to include in our package here as well as on our website, our profit volatility relative to sensitivities in oil, NGL and gas prices and you'll see that on slide number 69, its there for your reference. Turning the page to slide 33, recurring segment profit guidance; and this is a high level of view of each of our business units and I think Ralph and Alan already have updated you. But again, you can see the change there and again that's largely driven by prices. Turning to page number 34, graphically depicts our Rockies basis exposure and I think the redline what indicate that we have little to know Rockies basic exposure in 2008 or 2009. Certainly, E&P has some basis exposure that's been mitigated by firm transport financial hedges, Midstream has the opposite exposure, and when you net the two together, we end up flat, or in 2009 slightly short Rockies basis. Turning to slide... page please to slide number 35, capital spending guidance, again Ralph and Alan went through there, guidance, Gas Pipeline is relatively steady. And the total potential capital, that you see in the bottom line there, which I would call now more total planned capital is down in 2009 about $350 million at the midpoint, and about $100 million down in 2008, reflecting tightening things up in light of these difficult economic conditions in very tight financial markets. We've deferred many of the additional growth investment opportunities at this time. And we'll move ahead again when conditions improve. Please turn to page to slide number 36. This is a look at how we think about cash flow and liquidity. You can see their, 2008; I'll just walk through this. We started the year with $1.234 billion cash. On October 31st, we have $1.1 billion of unrestricted cash and $1.750 billion in total cash and the difference is largely cash, it's international. CFFO of 31 to 33 backing of CapEx in the range of 34 to 36, and then a number of other factors including dividends, minority interest payments, our previous share repurchase would leave us with $600 million to $700 million of unrestricted cash at the end of 2008. Add to that, our credit facilities that are available to us, and we get to about a $3 billion number at the end of the year. Moving ahead to 2009, again, starting with $600 million to $700 million, CFFO in the range of 24 to 31 and the range is largely dependent on commodity prices. Back off 28 to 31 in capital spending, and then minus our dividends minority interest payments, and then we have a change in debt somewhere between zero and perhaps as much as $200 million of borrowings, brings us down to a cash balance at the end of 2009, somewhere in the range of zero to $300 million add to that credit facilities that are un-drawn of about $2 billion, excuse me... for total liquidity of about $2 billion. I would also like to note that in our appendix, we've included a number of slides relative to derivatives and related counterparty exposure. And those are included on slide 70 through 75, we're very comfortable with our derivative counterparty exposure. We think it's well managed and very small. In that all other counterparties are A rated or better with the exception of about less than 10 million of those counterparties. And the total aggregate exposure for those counter parties is $384 million on a net basis after collateral postings. And with that, I'll turn it back to Steve.
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Don. I have nothing to add at this point. So, let's take your questions. Question And Answer
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Brandy, are you there?
Operator: [Technical Difficulty].
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: It sounds like we are having some technical difficulties. Let's give it a few minutes and see if we can get them solved.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni.
Shneur Gershuni - UBS: I knew that you're restricted on what you can say with respect to strategic review that you're that's currently underway. I was wondering if it's fair to say that investors tend to assume that something will actually occur that there will actually be a transaction of some sort of where you will be separating something you are selling something. And I was wondering also, if you can frame it, you had mentioned in your press release about how you are looking at a scenario where you like to maintain the strong credit profile, how that would occur if you were to separate the business out, how the credit profile would actually be able to maintain a strong credit profile, given that you'll be separating a strong cash flow assets from some of the assets that are, for example like E&P where, sorry excuse me, where you are potentially running beyond the cash flow and so forth? So I was wondering if you could, if you can answer those questions.
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks for the question. And the short answer is, no. We can't go into too much detail, I think look at our press release, we said that we were going to embark this evaluation and that, we would hope to be able to make an announcement in the first quarter as to what direction that we're headed. We've indicated that obviously the macro economic environment, credit market's energy prices and all kinds of other variables are going to be considered as part of the evaluation. And really have not commented at all as to what the timing of a possible transaction might be. Regarding the credit question again, that's I think its premature for us to try to speculate, I think we made very clear that an investment grade rating a strong credit profile was important to us today. And it's going to continue to be important to us in the future.
Shneur Gershuni - UBS: Okay. My follow-up question is just with respect to the Midstream business. There has been a lot of announcements by many of the E&P companies about scaling back CapEx and so forth given the current environment. Based on.... I'm sure you guys follow all the announcements and so forth. And I was wondering if you can comment and how you expect that to impact volumes at the Midstream segment and whether you are more or less sensitive to some of the areas that people thought, but looking to pullback some of that CapEx?
Alan Armstrong - President, Midstream Gathering & Processing: Yes, great question. First of all starting with the deepwater, deepwater is probably the least sensitive to price just because it takes such a long-term perspective has somebody has to go into that business with because it takes four to five year even in the best case to develop a project out there. So, that's probably the least sensitive and we certainly continuously very robust drilling out there. The at West, if you look at our mix of customers, they are mostly the very a large well hill customers like BP, Conoco Phillips or larger customers out there and they have secured capacity out of that area and as far as we know continue on with a very robust drilling plans in those area. So, we're fortunate to have the position we have in the deepwater and our exposure out west is largely in those basins where we have got very large customers and we're fortunate to have that customer mix we have out there. And having said that we certainly from some of those smaller producer and so forth I would certainly wouldn't be surprised to see some of backing off out west but there not just very big make up of our overall customer mix out west.
Shneur Gershuni - UBS: Okay. And just one follow-up question to get some great clarity with respect to the margins, with the recent decline in oil prices have you seen a return to the traditional correlations between the NGL's how they would typically reacting the given the price where oil isn't given where the price of where natural gas is right now?
Alan Armstrong - President, Midstream Gathering & Processing: Particularly on allied end [ph] products, we have not seen that return as seen in particular has been particularly weak. As there was quite a few plants that were knocked off by the hurricane particularly in the Burma and Orange area they've not returned to service. And so, we continued to see fairly weak demand on the afiame [ph] size as a result of those plants are being down. And so, we've continued to see that percentage to be a little bit low there. So, that's our current perspective on this.
Shneur Gershuni - UBS: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Hi everybody. Steve, recognizing the sensitivity again what you can say, just too sort of clarify with respect to this review process. Is this something where its kind of the full review where all options on the table i.e. seller what have you or it is just really more sort of looking at kind of restructuring tax free spin only I just want to make sure what the scope with the view is?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Carl that's a great question but this one that I'm not going answer. We are very open minded.
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Fair enough.
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: And are going to look at structural changes that may make sense going forward and again very open minded regarding the options that we consider.
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Okay. Now, I understand there is only one for now you can say. Ralph can I just ask a question, can you help us, I'm looking at Piceance the rigs coming out I assume that's coming out of the highland. I think typically, we have tended to think of valley, 4 to 4.15 in that bank making your 10% after-tax cost of capital returns. If commodity prices were to fall further, could you help us rank order where you're seeing the best returns if you will.
Ralph A. Hill - President, Exploration and Production: The actual rig... first of all we are dropping some in the valley also. So we're dropping valley and highlands. We have some great momentum in Trail ridge area and the Rangoch [ph] area that we want to keep. So, we'll keep some in the valley... in the highlands. And so, obviously then that would drop in some of the valley. In general, all of our projects still at... even at lower October point of view that we are using the lowest return project we are seeing out there currently more in the 18% range and the highest is in the upper 30% range. So, we actually really kind of... obviously the Highlands is a little lower than Valley, just about the definition of the additional drilling we have to do. So, any additional initially that would be from the Highlands. And we have a lot of flexibility in what we pull out of the Valley. We don't have as much flexibility of the Barnett; we have very good returns from the Barnett because a lot of the Barnett leases is one of the few places we have, where we have three year terms and those kind of things. So, I would guess additional dropping would, if that's the question would be from the Valley and the Highlands, but, probably Highland's first, but we really like the level of activity we have in the Highlands, which is only in this based on plan we have here, it's basically 4.5 rigs, we have one rig, it's going to work at one point, finish up a few of our obligations there and then that rig will be absorbed into the portfolio overall. So, we only have four in the Highlands working. In general, our portfolio's returns are very strong, still in where some Willow running numbers as low as the $4 and $5 case type return.
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: $4 or $5 of netback or $4 of $5 buybacks?
Alan Armstrong - President, Midstream Gathering & Processing: $4 to $5 Rockies.
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Rockies, okay. Okay. And then Alan, just with respect to your comments on certainly where Ethane is, and I guess especially where Ethane is in convoy, looking at Rockies NGL margins is a little bit more challenging task with the data streams we have but, what are you seeing right now here in early October as far as spot NGL margins in the Rockies?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, again, we clear, and in either case, in the case of Overland Pass or in our historical Pass Out of the Rockies on the map of Seminole System, we clear our Ethane barrels at Belleview. Our heavy barrels looking forward, our heavy barrels will have the option of clearing at either Convey or Belleview. So, but to get to your question in terms of spot, it's no different, our pricing is no different than what you see as the Belleview posted prices for Ethane. We do clear some propane and heavies out of the Rockies, at our local fractionators and that typically works out to be anywhere from $0.05 to $0.10 higher than Belleview pricing.
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Okay, great. And then just last question. More E&P again, Ralph, with respect to I know that the pie chart you have for the third quarter production roughly 22% was being sold into the Mid-Continent market. Can you refresh our memory where specifically in the Mid-Continent were you guys subject to any of the very low extreme spot prices we've been seeing over the last couple of weeks around center point?
Ralph A. Hill - President, Exploration and Production: Most of ours is ultimately it's priced into the Pan Handle market, so not as bad.
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Lasan Johong with RBC Capital Markets.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: Thank you. Steve, I know you again you restricted that. Let me see if I can attack question from a couple of different angles. My understanding would be that each of your three businesses have very low tax basis so a sale to anyone of those three businesses would produce a fairly large tax date, correct?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Johong,I don't think we are going to comment on that today again in terms of the specific form of the transaction, tax basis and any other details. I appreciate the question.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. I will also assume that E&P on a standalone basis and Midstream on a standalone basis would have more volatility and if you combine the two, correct?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well I think that's clearly the case you can the portfolio affect within our portfolio today.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: And I would guess at the pipeline business is much more stable and so therefore on a relative basis can sustain more debt on the balance sheet than either one of those two other businesses?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: That's a logical assumption.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, great. Couple of questions, does the hurricane impact add up to about $77million?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Hurricane affects 50 to 65.
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The 50 to 65 was just Midstream impact.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: I think there was 25 from one and 52 from the other.
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: The comment I was making on the again those numbers I was quoting that was just impacting our NGL volumes as I said that 50 number that I quoted that was leaving out the olefins impact.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: Oh I see.
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: So that's the difference in the way that was broken out.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: And net overall CapEx reduction for next year is how much?
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: CapEx reduction from our prior guidance about $350 million at the mid-point.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. And what is your new sensitivity commodity price changes for '09?
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Lasan, that's detailed on slide number 69.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: I'm sorry, I'm out of the office, now.
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It is fairly complicated, so I don't think it's something we can go through, if you want to take a look at that and call Investor Relations.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Faisel Khan with Citigroup.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Don, on the slide there as you detailed the cash flow liquidity $1.2 billion. I take at the difference between that and what you have reported in your press release and $1.8 billion in cash is the difference that you've been overseas or un-patriated or un-repatriated is that correct?
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It's the internet, principally international cash and then it's also some MLP cash and then call it cash itself. We're holding that belongs to our counterparties.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay, understood.
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That's detailed on slide number 83.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay, fair I think that far. On the... going to the pipeline business or I should say, thinking about getting access of pipeline capacity out of the Rockies, as the rest being delayed a little bit, my first is, how does that effect your guys planning process at E&P Ralph. And I guess the second question related to pipeline capacities is what needs to get done to get free up some of these issues in the Rockies. This will be a necessity or just some other pipe out there that makes more sense?
Ralph A. Hill - President, Exploration and Production: This is Ralph. Let me take first part of that. It's factored into our Rockies exposure that we say for 2009, which is going to be similar to what we saw in 2008, which is about 14% to 16%. We have factored the delay of Ruby into that. So, if Ruby, obviously we'd come on and we're assuming Ruby is very late... I am sorry, late not Ruby, pardon me. We've factored Rex coming on to fourth quarter versus earlier I think it must be like more mid-year. So, to the extent it comes a lot of earlier than that, then that number obviously would decrease. So, our exposure is factored into a decline or a delay in the Rex, I am trying to get R is correct.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Sure.
Ralph A. Hill - President, Exploration and Production: In the Rex pipeline. We also have added on to our portfolio opportunity on basin but for part two, let me let Phil take part two, of that right.
Phillip D. Wright - President, Gas Pipeline: Faisel, this is Phil Wright. Clearly there is enough gas out in the Rockies to justify construction of a large dam or our pipe to the west. The market is indicative to us they prefer route to stand field and in particular, due to market growth our market area customers who have signed PAs to support that convection if you will. We and our partners are continuing to work to fully subscribe Sunstone. We believe there is enough producer support will be to see a project get build in the originally forecast timeframe, but it's also possible that a smaller scale project built later can be attractive to customers as well. So, our strategy is to work with customers to right size and route a project that we think best meets their needs.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay. So what you are saying is that there is the... the first necessity is to move gas western to an east, is that kind of how you are thinking about it?
Phillip D. Wright - President, Gas Pipeline: Well, that would be our assessment.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay, got you. And then sticking with the E&P, I guess, what's the plan now with the results that you have in the Barnett shale, where do we go from here?
Ralph A. Hill - President, Exploration and Production: Well, we obviously need to hook the wells up, and build a smaller processing faculty up there initially over the plant which we will do next year, get the wells on extending productions testing. We're drilling our third horizontal well, which is an offset to the Koski [ph] and we intend to... with our partners drilling at probably seven additional horizontal wells next year. So, really just continue to test it, see what we have for the wells that we have on, and that we're drilling now one extended production testing begin some preliminary facilities. That gas would flow to Seminole Basin, which we think is a good area to do that too. Can probably be a North West pipe down there. So, the plan is just to continue to confirm what we have and move from there.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay, got you. On the Midstream side equation, I guess the NGLs that are coming out of storage in the fourth quarter, how are those being priced, are those being priced related to your hedges you have in place or maybe in priced up market?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: No, there is, since there is incremental barrels, over and above our hedge in effect that you could say it's one of the other, but at the end of the day, the net impact will be at market on those barrels.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay.
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: So, they went in, they would have gone in order to cost of good sold is what they would have gone in into inventory pricing at. So, basically that fuel and shrinking transport price.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay.
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: And it will come out at and whatever the market is that time.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Got it. And then you did... I think you addressed the question on the deepwater projects that you guys are looking at. You're saying that those projects are fairly inelastic to the price, or because there was a long-term, the long-term project people contemplated for a while?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Right. And also the combination of the fact that, you have to take out very long-term contracts generally around those drilling rigs, those big deepwater drilling rigs and so people walk themselves in a quite a bit of that capital out there. So, there's still plenty of competition for both pipeline capacity and drilling rigs as we speak. I'd say the risks long-term to that, the risk long-term would be the re-up of that business if cash flows from the E&P company started to wane and they didn't have the capitalization to go forward with that. But, we're not seeing any reaction to the current spot pricing that's happening right now.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: The projects that you guys talked about in I guess in June, July where and the potential projects that the potential TLPs you guys have talked about, there is opportunity still remain out there?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Absolutely.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay. What about in Canada? I mean, you see a number of announcements that some of these up graders are kind of delayed the push back, how does that affected your business out there?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. In Canada, much of the business that we were pursuing up there is already existing up graders. There was a large project we were pursuing that has been delayed, there was an up grader project, it has been delayed up there. And so, it will impact to some, but quite frankly there is probably more opportunity up there than we have the resources to pursue. So, we're not to terribly disappointed by that at this point in time so, but we certainly have.... certainly it will take some of the up side, but again, we have been pretty conservative in assuming what proportion of business we could capture up there.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay, great. Thanks, guys for the time. I appreciate it.
Operator: There are no further questions. Mr. Campbell, do you have any closing remarks?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. I'll, just Steve, I would just say that... and I think that Williams has a very good reputation in terms of doing what we say we're going to do and coming forward with a plan executing on that plan. And so, regarding the announcement that we've made about exploring changes, structural changes, I think that you can expect that we will announce a specific direction in the first quarter. And so, with that, I appreciate your interest and your participation. And we look forward to talking with you again. .

===== 2008 Q2  (2008-08-07 09:30:00) =====
Executives: Travis Campbell - IR Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and CEO Don R. Chappel - Sr. VP and CFO Ralph A. Hill - Sr. VP, Exploration and Production
Analysts: Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers Sam Brothwell - Wachovia Securities Faisel Khan - Citigroup Shneur Gershuni - UBS
Operator: Good morning. My name is Stacy and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Williams Second Quarter 2008 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. And I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Travis Campbell, Head of IR. You may begin your conference, sir.
Travis Campbell - Investor Relations: Thank you very much and thanks to everybody and good morning. Welcome to Williams second quarter 2008 earnings call. As always, thanks for your interest in the company. As you probably already figured out, we will not be reviewing a ton of slides this morning, even though it feels like just last week we had a chance to do a much deeper dive into our businesses on June 25th in New York. So today, our plan is to have a pretty crisp call. After my comments, Steve Malcolm, our CEO will go through some thoughts, and then have our CFO, Don Chappel briefly talk about the great second quarter results, and then he updates the guidance since the New York meetings in June. Even though they don't have any prepared remarks this morning, all of business unit heads; Phil Wright, Ralph Hill and Alan Armstrong are here and available to respond to your questions. Before I turn it over to Steve, please note that on our website, williams.com, you'll find the few slides we'll talk from this morning. Additionally, there is another deck labeled Supplemental Material that contains all the data we typically provide each quarter. The second quarter press release and all the coming schedules and the second quarter 10-Q are also available. Slide number two and three titled forward-looking statements disclose various risk factors and uncertainties related to the future operations and expectations. Actual results of course will vary from those expectations due to the factors disclosed. Please review that information as well as the information on slide number four, Oil and Gas Reserves Disclaimer. Also included in the materials are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to generally accepted accounting principles. Those schedules are available and are integral to this presentation. So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Travis. And as always, thanks to those of you on the call for your interest in our company. We're very pleased to have the opportunity to discuss Williams' very strong performance in the second quarter and year-to-date and as well our bright outlook for continuing value creation. Obviously, our businesses are hitting on all cylinders, and a great evidence of that is the fact that consolidated second quarter segment profit is up 60%. Our E&P business generated record recurring EBITDA of about $650 million in the quarter. We added 1.5 trillion cubic feet to our 3P reserves through two bolt-on acquisitions; one in the Piceance and the other in the Barnett Shale. Our finding costs continue to be well below the industry average, and we successfully complete nearly a 100% of the wells that we drilled. In our Midstream business, we benefited again from margins that were very strong, but as well from higher fee-based revenues as well. Our Midstream business is generating robust cash flows. We have a high degree of optimism around the many opportunities that we're pursuing, particularly those in Canada where we see opportunities that fit very well with our current operations and fit with the expertise that we have there around the oil sands. In our Gas Pipeline business, we continue to see opportunities for customer-supported and demand-driven expansions, and of course this business plays an important role as a consistent generator of cash that helps fund our higher return projects. So again, we couldn't feel any better about our performance in our businesses. Having spent an entire day telling our story in New York on June 25th, I only have one slide that I would quickly like to review this, this morning and the essence of that slide is I believe that we have the right strategy. We certainly created a prime position for ourselves from which to execute that strategy and we have a strong track record of crisply executing around our strategy. Our operations span the natural gas value chain. I think it's a good time to be focused on natural gas. The outlook for natural gas is continuing to get better and better, it's a obvious growing role for this clean burning domestically fuelled produced fuel, so it's a good time to be in natural gas. Scales is a key element of our strategy, so you see Williams in basins and markets where we can be at or near the top of the market participants. I think our strategy has legs, has longevity when it comes to value creation. Williams is and has been turning in performance at a level that drives value. And clearly our strategy is designed to deliver sustained value creation in the future. We have created that prime strategic position from which to successfully execute our strategy. We have an abundant expanding slate of opportunities within our reach. And that slate of opportunities continues to grow almost each day. Our portfolio creates value and opportunities and I believe it mitigates risks. And our businesses fit very well together. Over the past six years, we've been all about crisp executions. And so, you see us continuing to deliver earnings growth with a very strong outlook for the future. We're performing well in a variety of commodity markets. We're growing production; we have low finding costs and near 100% drilling success. And it's not just a Piceance story, as well with Powder River production up 41% in the second quarter and as well with the contributions from the Barnett Shale, a very diverse story there in terms of our productions. We're completing our projects on time and on budget, as we make disciplined investments in production and processing and in key infrastructure. I believe that we're successfully managing the basis differentials, as we've said many times we're a Rockies producer, but we're not a Rockies price taker. An 83% of our domestic production gets better than Rockies prices. And as we have done in the past, we're willing to pull other value creation levers. A great example of that is the fact that we just recently completed our $1 billion share repurchase program. So with that quick review, I'll turn it over to Don.
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Steve. Before I dive into the detailed slides here, I'll just note that net income was $437 million for the quarter, or $0.37 a share. More importantly, our adjusted earnings after eliminating non-recurring items and mark-to-market effects were $406 million or $0.68 a share, up 58% on a per share basis. And for year-to-date purpose... period, $747 million or $1.25 a share, up 69%, very strong quarter, very strong first half and we are very enthusiastic about the balance of 2008, 2009 and beyond. Let's dive into the next slide here, and this is slide number six. This is second quarter segment profit. First, I'd just point at the total near the bottom, the segment profit after mark-to-market adjustments that's highlighted in blue. You can see $902 million on a recurring basis, $624 million a year ago, an improvement of $278 million or 45%. The reconciliation between reported and recurring as well as mark-to-market is included in the supplemental deck. Just to go up to top there, E&P posted $471 million of recurring segment profit. That was even higher with the gain on the Peru asset sale, but on the recurring basis that's up 262 million or 125%. We are quite delighted by that. We saw 24% increase in domestic production and related sales, which delivered about $105 million of additional segment profit. We had higher average realized gas prices, about 806 versus 539 a year ago. That totaled about $273 million of contribution. Along with these higher volumes and prices were higher costs, which partially offset these benefits. DD&A was up $51 million, operating taxes $33 million and LOE up $12 million. But again very strong earnings posted by E&P and perhaps even more importantly, a very, very strong production increase at 24%. The hedges that affected E&P's results are included in page 14 of the appendix, both for the quarter as forward periods. Taking a look next at Midstream results, Midstream results were also very, very strong. Higher olefin margins contributed $26 million, higher NGL margins $18 million for the quarter, higher fee-based revenues $23 million and these were offset somewhat by higher O&M costs. Again, Midstream's results of $233 million were up $42 million or 17% from the same quarter a year ago, which was also a very strong period. Midstream is very well positioned to continue to outperform its peers and deliver very strong earnings and value. Gas pipeline results were also up, up $13 million or 8% for the quarter, a very steady and improving results. Gas Marketing results were off somewhat and let me remind you we've been working through exiting positions that we considered legacy after the sale of our Power business and the shrinking of the scope of the gas marketing business. And we've largely exited those legacy positions. As well during the quarter we had... gas was injected in the storage, sold forward to lock in prices and a profit. However, interim decline in gas prices caused that to be written down to lower cost to market, that's a timing issue that will come back next year. As well, we had some inventory gains that were eliminated. Again E&P sells gas to gas marketing, but the profit on that gas is eliminated in the Gas Marketing segment. So, those were couple of the items that contributed to the loss for the current quarter. I think most importantly, we now expect Gas Marketing to be about breakeven for the balance of 2008, as well as 2009. Turning next to slide number seven, year-to-date results. Again, focus on the total for segment profit after mark-to-market adjustment, $1.674 billion, up $558 million or 50% from the prior year. And then looking at each of our business units, E&P is up 97%, Midstream up 40% and Pipes up 14%, so again very strong earnings and then finally, Gas marketing on the year-to-date basis posting a loss of $13 million relatively and significant. Let's now turn to slide number eight. I'd like to just touch on our updated guidance. We've made a modest adjustment to raise the lower end of our guidance for 2008 from a range of 230 to 280, up to 235 to 280. Let me remind you that we've not changed our price assumptions for the year, so this is centered around a range of $100 to $120 WTI crude and $9 to $10.50 NYMEX gas and the details including the basin level details are on slide 41 as well as included in the press release. But again at $100 oil for the year, which again, we're well through the year, and $9 NYMEX gas we're comfortable with the bottom end of the range and certainly if we average $120 and 10.50 on the gas then the higher end of the range is within our reach. Just turning the page to 2009 and again, we've not any changes in our price assumptions since June 25th. However, some increase in E&P production as it relates to those acquisitions boosted our segment profit and our EPS range somewhat, so we're now at a range of 210 to 295 versus the range we had just six weeks ago. And again, the price stack that we are using in 2009 is a range of 80 to 120 on WTI crude and NYMEX on $8 to 10.50. So again with $80 oil and $8 NYMEX gas, we think that $2.10 is within reach. And certainly, if we see $120 crude and 10.50 gas again, then we're closer to $3. Let's just turn the page to slide number 10 and some of detail. Again, some very minor adjustments from June 25th in terms of our segment profit guidance. But, I think importantly you can see here, despite the fact that we have assumed lower prices in 2009, we improved somewhat our profitability despite those lower prices and lower margins. So, if we enjoy higher prices or constant prices between the two years, I think you'd see very strong gains in 2009. Just turning the page to slide number 11, again some modest adjustments there, really changed only to reflect the acquisition of the assets in the Barnett Shale of our E&P business. The next slide; number 12, cash flow. We've updated that again to reflect the changes in both our segment profit guidance and our CapEx. And again, this lays it out as we're thinking about it today and certainly we have a number of options and levers that we can pull. I would just note that we completed our share repurchase that the Board authorized a year ago. In July2007, the Board authorized $1 billion share repurchase. We've now completed that. We bought back nearly 29 million shares at an average price of 34.74, which up until a few weeks ago looked to be very attractive. Today, it doesn't look as attractive and I'm sure that we'll look back upon this in the future and be quite delighted with the share buyback program. Let's turn the page to slide number 13. Certainly, we've had some questions and ongoing concern about Rockies prices and I just like to layout for you, kind of where we're at graphically. So, on the left is our consolidated position. Our long position in E&P, our short position in Midstream as well as the effect of our hedges, and then to the right will be Rockies. So just to walk you through it again, the green, the about 1 billion cubic feet a day is our gross position net of fuel and shrink and production taxes on E&P. That green areas is financially hedged, principally with collars so there is some variation within that. But, you'll see those collars in our materials and most of the prices are still quite attractive, at the bottom into the collar with very attractive ceilings on those collars. I'd also note that we do have some what we consider to be legacy hedges, about 70 million day at a price of about $4. That's included in 2008. The yellow would be the un-hedged E&P volume. The bluish color below line is the short Midstream position, so you see although we produce over a Bcf a day, our length is more in a 100 billion cubic feet a day range, and that's for 2008 and 2009. If you move over to Rockies, you can see that after we transport our gas out of the Rockies and so with another basin, the amount that's actually sold in the Rockies is substantial reduced. So we are selling in the Rockies, the top of that green bar, so somewhere in the 300 million a range. We financially hedge the piece of that. The yellow again is the open position; the blue is the Midstream short position, so you can see we're basically flat in 2008 in terms of Rockies basis. By 2009, we are slightly long, but not very long at all in terms of Rockies basis. So again, Rockies basis when it widens is detrimental to our E&P business but helpful to our Midstream business and it's pretty much a wash at the Williams level. So I thought that was an important point to point out to you. With that, I'll turn it back to Steve for some comments and questions.
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Don. So, all three of our businesses generated excellent second quarter results, we continue to be confident in our ability to continue to post strong numbers. Our business unit leaders are here and we are looking forward to your questions. Question And Answer
Operator: [Operator Instruction's]. Your next question comes from the line of Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets: Good morning, everybody and nice execution on the quarter. Two questions, if I could. The first, an operational question, just meant to ask from the June meeting. But Ralph, with respect to all of the clamor that's going on around the Roan Plateau, the environmental issues. Do you see that moving from a disruptive standpoint from the lease sale to potentially activity? I mean is that anything that you guys are worried about?
Ralph A. Hill - Senior Vice President, Exploration and Production: Well, I believe the sale, the lease sales is scheduled to go off August 14th. Obviously, we have a position all around the Roan. We are evaluating that closely. There are... I think if the record decision has some very owners' term in it, so I am not sure how fast the pace of play development would be on the Roan and that's one of the considerations we're taking into as we look at the upcoming lease sale. Does that help what you asked?
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets: Yeah no, it does. I guess, it's the upshot I think it's still probably too preliminary to know what type of impact we might have. But certainly that you're seeing that could immediately be detrimental to your guys production views, say for perhaps in 2009.
Ralph A. Hill - Senior Vice President, Exploration and Production: No, we don't see that detrimental or anything we have in the existing valley or in existing what we call the highlands areas, we don't see that. That's a separate EIS, separate record decisions, separates rules nothing that goes on in the Roan will affect anything else we have in our other areas. So, and as you know, since the Roan is an open outcry bidding thing, who know who will win what and when that happens, but all the numbers you see for us going forward are based on the highlands and the valley only. And we don't think it's going to effect us.
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets: Okay, fair enough. The second question and sort of an open one to Steve. Obviously, one of the things that has changed over the past five weeks has been sort of the valuations in the E&P world you guys included, and not under the guise of what have you done for you lately, but here we've just now closed a share buyback program at $35 stock. Is it 31 and may be I can ask it in a kind of a generic sense that with some of the shifts in valuation, does it increase appetite for acquisitions, sort of including your own stock, maybe I'll just ask it that way?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Carl for the question. We are in the midst here of a strange and challenging market. And it certainly had an impact on valuations. I don't think that we want to change our strategy and our focus, just because of the last five weeks as you mentioned. We're going to continue to be investing in these wonderful projects and I can't emphasize enough how the slate and the visibility around those projects continues to grow. However, we have pulled the levers periodically to create incremental value. And we'll continue to look at that and evaluate it as we consider additional investment in projects that will create long-term value for our shareholders.
Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets: Okay fair enough. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rick Gross with Lehman brothers.
Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers: Good morning. I'll ask a question on the Powder River. The volumes there have been very, very strong and I am just curious what the driver is there? Obviously, the well current was up in '07 and you probably got some dewatering and debottlenecking of the pipeline grid, but what's going on there in either any new answers about wells that you brought on that are dewatering the bottleneck that you alleviated, are you getting close to filling up and creating more of a bottleneck that you're going to need more outlet capacity? How do we interpret 41% increase in the Powder River?
Ralph A. Hill - Senior Vice President, Exploration and Production: I'd interpret... this is Ralph. I would interpret it very good. We feel very positive about the Powder as I mentioned for a couple of years, we are waiting on several things to happen and with the Big George as you know, is a much more prolific coal, thicker, more charged, greater gas content and it is coming on much better than the Wyodak coal. That combined with the Fort Union gas gathering debottlenecking, which we did, we think allowed for the Big George to really kick in, and in the slide we showed on June 25th, the Big George compared to the Wyodak at this stage of its growth is immensely better than the Wyodak's growth and Wyodak was obviously a good coal. So, we don't... and we've been very proactive in signing up for transportation capacity away from the Powder. We're working on new capacity away, so we don't see that as a bottleneck for us at least going forward. And we do hope that we can keep this pace of drilling up. We believe our partner wants to do the same thing. Again, there is always a little dewatering time, but the areas we're in look to be very prolific, so we're very happy with it. It probably won't be 41% every quarter, but we do expect the Big George to continue to be a great coal for us and see our volumes grow very strongly.
Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers: Are the wells coming in better than what you had modeled?
Ralph A. Hill - Senior Vice President, Exploration and Production: They're really coming in at about that 0.5 Bcf we talked about. So, no, they're not really coming in much better, just that... it's just they are making the impact of debottleneck in that gathering system what that did to help us on pressures and also just the dewatering of a lot of the coals at the same time.
Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Do we think we'll get more rigs into the field either in the Piceance where you're a little bit higher than your 25 and whether you'll get more into the Barnett now that you've got a little bit more acreage?
Ralph A. Hill - Senior Vice President, Exploration and Production: Yeah, we're working on that right now. We, as we mentioned when we did the Samrich [ph] acquisition, we believe we would add at least two into the Highlands and we mentioned two more rigs in the Barnett at least and we're working on an additional rig. So, I could see this more like maybe up to even seven rigs in the Barnett and 28 or so in the total Piceance. So we're looking to add that and that's part of our analysis as we're go through as working through on 2009 plus plans.
Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers: Okay, thank you. And just one last and I will follow up and maybe ask it directly. You finished the share buyback, are you going to authorize a new one? You still got about 2 billion in cash. By our estimation, you still generates some pretty good cash flows and the stock is lower than your average purchase price. What's the... are you going to go to Board for another authorization?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: We will continue to evaluate that, Rick as we look and consider and evaluate some of these wonderful capital projects that we've talked about in the past.
Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sam Brothwell with Wachovia.
Sam Brothwell - Wachovia Securities: Question for Alan. I know that you kept your outlook for the rest of the year in Midstream where it was. Just wondering if you could speak a little bit to how you see the near term outlook there and particularly what you see going on in ethane?
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Ethane as you know, has been very, very volatile. In fact in the last two days, it's come off about almost $0.18 per gallon in the last two days. And that has been caused by some of the heavy crackers that in the second quarter were out buying ethylene because the heavy feedstocks were too, were upside down in terms of margins. So, they were actually buying ethylene. Today they're back buying butanes and propanes and who knows, up pretty quickly and now are selling ethylene into that market. And so, don't know how long that will last before the butanes' and propanes' price pressure on those turns around. But, overall the answer to your question on ethane, we did... we certainly are continuing to enjoy continued exports in the ethylene derivatives. And don't see that necessarily turning around. And so, I expect things to stabilize, basically ethane's correction in last two days has just put it back in the money relative to butanes and propanes. So, I would expect the demand to remain there.
Sam Brothwell - Wachovia Securities: But...
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That is the soft spot and probably the only reason that we wouldn't be raising guidance any further right now, it's just concern over the NGLs as it relates to crude oil.
Sam Brothwell - Wachovia Securities: Okay and looking a little bit longer term, I know you're adding quite a bit of processing capacity including ethane cut in the Rockies. Has your longer term view changed at all relative to that?
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We continue to study that very closely, as you know. But we haven't changed our perspective on that.
Sam Brothwell - Wachovia Securities: Okay, thanks very much
Operator: The next question comes from the lines of Faisel Khan with Citigroup
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: On the Piceance, I just want to get a clarification. In terms of how many wells do you guys expect this year in the Highlands in '08 and then '09?
Ralph A. Hill - Senior Vice President, Exploration and Production: Is the Highlands?
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Yeah.
Ralph A. Hill - Senior Vice President, Exploration and Production: We were currently scheduled to be in the 120 range or so in '08, 100 to 120 in next year, we're still working on that we but hope to have that more in the 175, 150 to175 range.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay.
Ralph A. Hill - Senior Vice President, Exploration and Production: Possibly more, we are just not quite done with all of our rig contract in and we are still in some of areas delineating the fields and we are moving much more to pad drilling up there, but there is still some areas that we need to understand first before we can fully commit how many we will have there. But as I mentioned we are working to that. We should have that... definitely have that by the next call and we hope to at least be in that range.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay. And just on the Midstream side, the equation, the large ramp back up in NGL equity sales to I think 266 million gallon, seems to be churning a little bit higher than what you guys were doing last year? Can you just comment on what's going on there? I know you had some planned outages in the first quarter, but I just want to figure out what's causing the larger than expected ramp back up in production in the second quarter?
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Just second quarter to second quarter comparison?
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Yeah.
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Mostly its just that all the plants have been up and running full bore, we did have some maintenance outages in the second quarter of last year. So we are really... did pretty well full stride this year probably though the one major difference beyond that is we instigated the new takeaway at our Wamsutter facility, we've got a takeaway over to a CIG lowlands plant there. So we're taking about 80 million a day over in processing at that plant. And so, that's incremental capacity in effect that we're leasing out in effect from the lowlands plant.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay. Is there any update on your negotiations on the kind of Canadian... on the Canadian project side? I mean are you still looking at keep whole sort of contract or fee-based contract. Any sort of update there?
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, the business that we've been pursuing up there at the model that we have up there would be fee-based to balance out the current keep whole business that we have up there. And things are progressing very well in those negotiations and hope to report something in the not too distant future on that.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni with UBS.
Shneur Gershuni - UBS: Good morning. Most of my questions actually just got asked. Just a couple of clarifications. Don, you mentioned about the Gas marketing business. So effectively this quarter, you injected gas in and the value of inventory declined, but you basically have that margin locked in and that should obviously be realized in the first quarter of '09?
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes that's a factor in the current quarter as well as I mentioned gas sold and still in the inventory, gas sold from E&P to Gas Marketing for future sale including that which is in storage gets reduced back to cost, so its gives mark down the cost and then that profit is recognized by Gas Marketing when it's sold.
Shneur Gershuni - UBS: Okay. And then second question just with respect to NGL, sorry everybody keeps asking this one here. But I mean are you guys experiencing a delinking with respect to oil and is there any specific reason why your operations would have a different margin than some of the major indexes like mount LVO [ph] and so forth with respect to margin?
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, sure. I'll take that. First of all, I mentioned the lowering that we had on ethane here recently. But what I failed to mention was the run up we had just prior to that. We saw ethane go up to almost 45% of crude oil, which was above historical norms in the June timeframe and then we've seen it come back down. It's probably around 40 to 41% now, which is slightly below that to about the same degree. And as I said I think we'll see that normalize, now that it's back at the lower cost feedstock for the crackers. So I don't... even though it's been volatile, I expect that to level out somewhat. In terms of why our margins are different sometimes than a lot of our peers, first of all, most of our businesses keep whole, we don't... in terms of the commodity-based contracts that we have most of the people and so for those commodity-based contracts you'll see competitor's margins being percent of liquids where they're just taking the actual margin on the liquid they sold versus ours are the spread between the gas and the liquids. And so that's a major difference. As to difference between ours and other keep whole competitors, the main difference that we enjoy is the base of spread in the Rockies is a much better component of our production than most parties. And so, we see our margins generally be pretty high on the keep whole side relative to other keep whole margins because of the Rockies basis differential. And you'll see that actually improve even more that spread even widen as the Overland Pass line comes off, which will kick up our NGL margins by about $0.085 per gallon from those Rockies base production.
Shneur Gershuni - UBS: And so I guess that is why you're performance could differ from same mount LVM [ph] and so forth, when if you'd just use those index prices?
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That's exactly right. So, you'd have to take a Rockies gas price into a pretty big chuck of our volumes there.
Shneur Gershuni - UBS: Okay. And then just one final question with respect to cash flow. I am not sure if I understood the Steve's response before. But the buyback is done, you've shown that you had cash flow and you said that you're potentially evaluating other projects. But it appears to be that there is cash flow beyond the projects that you're evaluating based on the slides that you put out today. I mean, would that be something that the Board would consider very encouraging with respect to extending the share buyback program?
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Shneur, this is Don Chappel, I will just comment again of our cash balance is about $500 million, it's international, some of which is required to support the international operations. Some is excess and that's been earmarked for those Canadian opportunities then we bring it back to the really domestic cash balance, it's closer to $1 billion not $2 billion, and I think most of that is been earmarked for projects, so as attractive as the buy back is, we've had some tough choices. So we'll continue to consider all the options that we have and we'll try to pull those that we believe will create the greatest long-term value.
Shneur Gershuni - UBS: So just to clarify, basically your consolidated balance sheet cash flow is not necessarily completely available as it would appear.
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I think if you'll look at one of our slides in the back you'll see that we do back out some customer deposits as well as the international cash, which is again earmarked for either supporting and this is on slide number 38 in the supplement.
Shneur Gershuni - UBS: Okay.
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: There is 557. That's either MLP cash or international cash, it's largely international cash and then there is $119 million of customer margin deposits, so that's almost $700 million reduction in the cash balance you see in the balance sheet. And then our capital spending exceeds our cash flows, so that continues to work that balance down.
Shneur Gershuni - UBS: Okay. That makes perfect sense. Thank you very much.
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You welcome
Operator: There are no further questions at this time.
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay thank you. We are very pleased with the second quarter results, we are excited about the future, committed to continued crisp execution around our strategy and we will continue to evaluate the various levers that we might pull to create incremental value for our shareholders. So thank you for your interest.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2008 Q1  (2008-05-01 09:30:00) =====
Executives: Travis Campbell - Head of IR Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and CEO Don R. Chappel - Sr. VP and CFO Ralph A. Hill - President, Exploration and Production Alan Armstrong - President, Midstream Gathering and Processing Phillip D. Wright - President, Gas Pipeline
Analysts: Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering Faisel Khan - Citigroup Sunil Jagwani - Catapult Rick Gross - Lehman Brothers
Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Williams Companies first quarter 2008 earnings results conference call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to, Mr. Travis Campbell, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Travis Campbell - Head of Investor Relations: Thank you very much, and good morning everybody. Welcome to Williams first quarter 2008 call. Thank you all for your interest in our Company. This morning Steve Malcolm, our CEO, will lead off, followed by Don Chappel, our CFO, also Ralph Hill, Alan Armstrong, and Phil Wright, will make some brief remarks. But before, I turn it over to Steve Malcolm, please note that all of the slides, both those that are in the presentation today, and those in your appendix are available on our website Williams.com, in a PDF format. The first quarter press release and all the company’s schedules are also available on the website. Slide number 2 and 3 titled, Forward-Looking Statements, disclose various risk factors and uncertainties related to the future operations and expectations. Actual results, of course, may vary significantly from our current expectations due to the factors disclosed in those slides. Please review those. Slide 4, Oil and Gas Reserve Disclaimers, is also very important, and we urge you to read that slide as well. Also included in the presentation today, are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those schedules follow the presentation and are integral to this presentation. So with that, I’ll turn it over to, Steve.
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Travis. Good morning. Welcome to Williams first quarter call, and thank you for your continuing interest in our Company. By almost any measure or metric, we recorded another outstanding quarter. Recurring adjusted earnings per share was up 84%, and consolidated segment profit was up 93%. Our integrated business model is hitting on all of its cylinders with E&P’s domestic production higher by 20%, over a year ago. Production now exceeds a Bcf a day. Production in our two largest basins, Piceance and Powder, were up 27% versus first quarter last year, and our resource potential continues to grow. As well, Midstream continued to capture strong margins and recorded segment profit, which was 69% higher than first quarter in 2007. And Gas Pipes with higher rates on Transco and Northwest pipeline, and revenues from two expansion projects, was able to improve segment profit by 20%. Our operating performance continues to drive impressive financial results, and the future looks bright, as we’ve continued our disciplined investment around our best of class assets, and have increased our financial outlook for 2008 and 2009. And finally, we continue to pull incremental value levers, with the creation of Williams Pipeline Partners in January, and the continued repurchase of our shares. So with that, I’ll turn it over to, Don Chappel.
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Steve, good morning. Turn to slide number 8 please. Just a summary of our top level financial results. Net income of $500 million compared quite favorably to net income a year ago, up almost fourfold. Perhaps more importantly, our key earnings measure, recurring income from continuing operations after mark-to-market adjustments, was at $0.57 compared to $0.31 a year ago, an increase of 84%. Let’s turn the page please, to slide number 9. Just to show some of the detail, I will focus my comments on recurring. The only significant item between recurring and reported this quarter is the gain recorded in E&P on the Peru asset sale. But, in terms of continuing operations, E&P reported $312 million of recurring segment profit, up 66% on the strength of 20% production increase, higher average realized prices, offset somewhat, by higher costs related to higher volumes, as well as higher costs and higher prices. Midstream also had a terrific quarter, reporting $261 million in segment profit, up 79% from a year ago. Midstream’s results are up sharply, as a result of much higher NGL prices and margins. Solid production was offset somewhat, by $25 million of production that went into line pack inventory versus sales in this quarter, some lingering effects of the Ignacio fire, and some difficult weather in the West during the quarter. Gas pipeline at $180 million was up 20% year-over-year as result of the full quarter effect of the Transco rate cases. Just looking down to the bottom line segment profit, after mark-to-market adjustment in total up $280 million or up 57%. With that, I’ll turn it to Ralph.
Ralph A. Hill - President, Exploration and Production: Thank you, Don. I’m pleased to share our very positive first quarter results with you today, and I want to thank all of our dedicated employees for their excellent work to make these results happen. Let’s turn to slide 11. Our first quarter ‘08 production was up 19% compared to first quarter 2007. Our operating profit this quarter was a record at $312 million, it was up 66% from the first quarter ‘07, and that does not include the $118 million non-recurring gain that we had on sales from international assets. Looking at slide 12, as our major basins. Our Piceance Valley was up 25% over a year ago, we currently have 22 rigs operating in the valley. The Highlands team, volumes were up 72% over a year ago at 43 million a day and we have four rigs operating in the Highlands. Powder River volumes continued to explode. They are up 27% from over a year ago at 209 million cubic feet a day. And the Fort Worth volumes were up over 2 times from a year ago at 38 million a day and we have four rigs operating. Very solid results in each of our core basins. Looking at some of our cost metrics, turning to slide 13. Production costs, which is defined basically on our investor relations sheet as lease and other operating expenses and operating taxes. As you can see, we continue to be one of the leaders in the industry. We were $1.08 per Mcf in our production costs. The industry average listed on this, which is the top 20 producers that we see, was approximately $1.59. So, we continue to have a significant cost advantage in our production cost. Looking at slide 14, finding and development costs. Our three-year F&D ending the year in 2007 was $1.77 per Mcf. The group average, as you can see on this chart, was $2.89. On the one-year basis our F&D was approximately $1.93, and the industry’s average was about $3.09. We prefer to look at it on a three-year basis, and again we have a significant cost advantage in our F&D costs. Slide 15, production growth. We are now the 12 largest producer overall and number four in production growth, as you can see on this chart. The left side of the chart shows the overall position and the right side of the chart shows that, we were up little over 21%, and this is based on the year end 2007 data for the year 2007. And recall a number of the producers listed in this top 20 with us, do have a number of acquisitions in their portfolio, and almost all of our growth is what we call organic growth through the drillbit. Slide 16, growth in reserves. Again, we had a 232% reserve replacement for last year. You can see the top reserve replacements. The far right side of this column shows what it is without any acquisitions percentage. So we would move up several spots on this without acquisitions, which we virtually had no acquisitions for reserves. So again, very impressive work by the team in growing our reserves. Slide 17, to update you on our, as we always do in this call, our 3P reserves and resource potential. We’ve increased our 3P reserves from last year by over 600 Bcf, and this is after producing 334 Bcf last year, as you’ll recall. Overall, our total 3P reserves now are approximately 11.4 Tcf. And if you look at our resource potential, we continue to be in that range about 22 Tcf. So impressive year for our 3P growth, and the 3P reserves exclude the majority of our new areas, such as the majority of Barcus Creek, and all of the paradox you went to in areas like that, that we are currently doing some exploratory drilling in, those are excluded from our 3P reserves. Slide 18, is a new slide for us to show the geographically where our reserves are both on a proved and probable basis in the current production. I won’t go into this slide in detail, but it does show that, obviously as we continue to be, a majority of our reserves are in the Piceance, followed up by, on a potential basis, and our probable basis, in the Powder River with our San Juan and Mid-Continent group, bringing up the rest of our proved reserves. And finally, slide 19. We continue to have significant value creation for Williams. Record set quarter for segment profit and production, 3P reserves 11.4 Tcf. Our strategy continues to be rapid development in a very safe manner for the premier drilling inventory. The rest of leader in production costs, successes, cost efficiencies, those all continue. So, I again thank our experienced and talented workforce for that. And we also look forward to continue to pursue and evaluate our new resource opportunities as this year continues on. With that, I will now turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong - President, Midstream Gathering and Processing: Thanks, Ralph. Well, we did have another great quarter in Midstream as well, and our record first quarter segment profit of $261 million, beat the first quarter of 2007 recurring segment profit by 78%, and again, that’s on a recurring basis. We accomplished this in spite of a $25 million NGL inventory build as about 59 million gallons of NGLs went to build linepack during March. Roughly half of this will come back to us when Overland Pass Pipeline comes online as the required linepack and that NGL pipeline is about half of the MAPL system that we’re currently producing into. Our first quarter ‘08 equity NGL production increased approximately 10% over first quarter ‘07, when you normalize for these changes in inventory. Our expansion into the Piceance Basin of Colorado is progressing as well. We’re moving ahead rapidly with the construction of our Willow Creek processing plant, the transfer of the Parachute pipeline from Gas Pipes to Midstream, and the conversion and completion of the PGX NGL pipeline that carries NGL production out of E&P’s Parachute processing complex today. The benefits of William’s integrated strategy with E&P and Gas Pipes in the Piceance are abundantly clear, as we work to optimize this valuable resource play with all segments of our Company. In 2008, we continue to succeed at growing our deepwater volumes in the Gulf of Mexico, as evidenced by our executing new contracts which dedicated five new blocks to our discovery system. And we received the first deliveries of Bass Lite gas in first quarter ‘08, and are awaiting the startup of the Blind Faith spar in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. As we discussed last quarter, we have executed an NGL forward sales strategy that mitigates a portion of the risk related to our NGL sales price in 2008. Moving to the next side, this graph shows the tracking of margins over the last five years. It also shows growth in our total domestic NGL production. And in the light blue bar, the amount of liquids we sold for our account, excluding discovery and oxable investments. To reiterate, our equity NGL production only shows the volumes we sold as opposed to that produced for our own account, and therefore excluded a swing of about 71 million gallons, which was sales from inventory of about 12 during the first quarter of ‘07 and, again, a delivery in the inventory of about 59. So that total swing was a total of 71 million gallons. Volumes were also affected by about 20 days of downtime in January, at the Ignacio fire that happened in 2007 as our system of Four Corners recovered from that. Volumes are returning back up to normal as we enter into the second quarter now. The environment that drove record margins during the fourth quarter was certainly alive and well in January of ‘08. However, since then with increasing gas prices, NGL margins have come down somewhat. Several factors worked together to create the extraordinary environment we saw in 2008. As we mentioned before, the low gas prices in the Rockies was a major contributor. As you can see there, that peak in the third and fourth quarter of ‘08, a big chunk of that was driven by very low gas prices there at the end of ‘07. The new gas transportation capacity out of the Rockies to relieve these constraints and current margins are being driven solely by high crude oil prices in a weak dollar, which has allowed for exports from North American polyethylene producers. If you would, please take note of the appendix slide, it details how we have forward sold the portion of our NGLs for 2008, and as you can see the forward sales represent about 28% of our 2007 equity volumes. Moving to the next side, this slide provides insight in the investment opportunities on the horizon for Midstream. Large deepwater projects such as Perdido Norte, Blind Faith, Bass Lite and our Rockies expansions, especially the Willow Creek project, dominate the expansion capital in the in guidance portion of this slide for both 2008 and 2009. You’ll notice that this was lowered slightly by $50 million, and that is just because we remove the ‘07 assets that have already gone into service. We have several opportunities going to our Board for approval in the next couple of months, and therefore we expect this in guidance capital pie to grow dramatically this year. The under negotiation pie has remained steady. The main change from last quarter is addition of a propylene distribution project that we’re working on in Louisiana. The pie labeled, In Development and Proposal, reflects a tremendous amount of opportunities available to us in the next five years. The capital range remained steady as these projects are in very early stages of their development. In an addition, you can see how the mix of spending by area is unchanged as well, but shows that we have a nice portfolio across a variety of our regions. Some of the more significant growth projects that are in guidance, of course, you can see they’re listed below and you can see the first full year of OP from those assets. And then in addition, some of the projects that are not included in our guidance right now, but in the under negotiations pie, of about a little over $400 million worth of projects, including an expansion at Echo Springs and Canadian oil sands projects that we’ve spoken to previously that we hope to be moving into the in guidance, as I mentioned earlier. Moving on to the next slide, summarize. To recap, in the first quarter of ‘08 we enjoyed strong operating profit growth driven by favorable commodity prices across most Midstream assets. Margin growth occurred in both NGLs and our olefin segment, and in both Canada, and the U.S. First quarter ‘08 put us off to a great start for 2008, as it set the record for our highest first quarter segment profit ever in this business. Our recurring segment profit increased by 78%, continuing a trend that has been driven by higher than forecasted NGL margins, we are raising segment profit guidance again. The incredible year that was 2007 resulted in an industry leading pretax return on average assets for Midstream of over 27%. In fact, we posted the highest segment profit of any of our peers that we track, and these results were driven by record margins, especially in the Rockies and by our teams’ execution of several projects that needed to come on time with the Opal expansion being a good example of that. We are very excited about our growth opportunities in several key areas, including Canadian oil sands, the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the Rockies. These projects will lay a strong foundation for the future beyond our guidance period. With new deepwater volumes coming on in 2008, we hope to hold this lead position as we stay very focused on investing our capital in a very disciplined manner, and being the most reliable service provider in the midstream space for our customers. And with that, I will turn it over to, Phil Wright.
Phillip D. Wright - President, Gas Pipeline: Thank you, Alan. I am pleased to report that if we could go to the next slide please, 26, that Gas Pipes is off to a very strong start in 2008. Following the successful IPO of Williams Pipeline Partners LP, we and our partners at TransCanada announced that we’ve joined forces on a major project to bring Rockies gas to the West and Northwest. The Sunstone pipeline from the Opal, Wyoming hub to Stanfield is designed to offer Western markets access to abundant new Rockies supply, combined with the excellent optionality of the Northwest and GTN pipeline networks. Also at West, we had a successful open season on our Sundance Trails pipeline project, which we’ve now included in our guidance. And importantly, we received FERC approval for the Transco rate case, adding fuel to our profit improvement and strong return to free cash flow generation. This is also a testament to the excellent customer relations and skills of our commercial teams and our teams throughout the pipeline. We are well underway on our construction of Phases 3 and 4 of our Gulfstream expansions, which will enable us to serve the rapidly growing markets near Tampa Bay and the West County Energy Center on the east coast of Florida. And, as you know, we delivered a 21.3% improvement in segment profit. Slide 27, please. Looking ahead to 2008 and 2009, we expect our maintenance capital levels to be lower than required in 2007. And as always, we’ve shown detail on the major growth projects included in our guidance, illustrating when we expect the project to be in service, a capital expenditure forecast, and the expected addition to segment profit in the first full year of each project. And I’m not going to go through each and every one of these. You can catch that as you please. Next slide please 28. As you can see in this slide, there are many promising growth projects across our pipeline networks. In all my 32 years in the energy business, I have not seen the level of activity we’re experiencing now in the interstate gas transmission space. With the massive shifts we’re seeing in supply sources, the industry is in a manner of speaking, repiping America, and I can assure you, we at Williams are capturing our share. One quick note about this slide, the projects shaded in blue are not included in guidance. Now there are a few projects that I want to highlight in a little greater detail. And if you compare this slide, this map, to the map I showed in our last quarter, you will note that we’ve included four new projects in our guidance. Our Mobile Bay South project will expand the Transco line from Station 85 in Choctaw County, Alabama to interconnect with Gulfstream near Transco Station 82 in Mobile County, Alabama. We plan to place this expansion into service by May of 2010. The 85 North project will expand Transco’s main line from station 85 to markets in the Carolinas, with the in-service date of May 2011. We are still finalizing the capital range for the project, but it will be one of the largest expansions in the history of Transco. The Sundance Trail project is an expansion project on Northwest Pipeline connecting the Piceance Basin to the Opal Hub in Wyoming. The project will add 150,000 decatherms a day of capacity and the in-service date is planned for November of 2010. Lastly, the Pascagoula expansion is 15-mile, 26-inch lateral, connecting the Gulf LNG Clean Energy Import Terminal to the Mobile Bay Lateral with a total capacity of 810,000 decatherms a day. Transco and the Florida Gas Transmission Pipeline will share undivided interests of 57.7% and 42.3%, respectively. Cost of this project is estimated at about $31 million with an in-service date of October 2011. Last slide, please for me number 29. Summarizing the key takeaways, the establishment of our pipeline MLP positions us nicely to bring a low cost source of capital to capturing the many growth opportunities in front of us. We have general rate cases on both of our major business units, Northwest and Transco behind us. Organic growth opportunities abound and are bearing fruit for us, and all of this enhances our ability to deliver strong earnings and stable cash flow. With that, I will turn it over.
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Phil. Let’s turn to slide number 31, please. 2008 forecast guidance. Segment profit is up as a result of some improvements in results in the business units, which I will touch on in just a moment. Jumping to the bottom line, diluted EPS on a recurring basis after eliminating mark-to-market effects is up about $0.10 to $1.70 to $2.10 from our prior guidance. Note that we’ve raised our assumption regarding energy prices somewhat from our prior guidance. However, I think you’ll find that our guidance still reflects very conservative assumptions as compared to current markets and really reflects more of a long-term point of view as to energy prices. Turning the page to slide number 32 please, again focusing on the bottom line. We’re up about $0.10 to $1.80 to $2.30, again with similar price forecasts. Note also that, our results include the effects of certain legacy hedges, which are detailed on slide number 57. Some of those legacy hedges are at very low prices and are tending to hold back some of E&P’s earnings. Next slide, please, number 33. This slide graphically depicts our enterprise position on natural gas. The red line is our enterprise net position, which is comprised of our net E&P production, less the financial hedges which are depicted in gold. The blue would represent the unhedged E&P volume, and the purplish color at the bottom would be the unhedged Midstream short position. The net of all that is, where the red line is at about $300 million unchanged per day in both 2008 and 2009. Turning the page now to slide number 34 please some modest changes in our forecasted results by business segment. In 2008, Midstream is up about $75 million principally on strong margins. Gas Pipeline is reducing their guidance just slightly as a result of some investments we are making in a number of these capital projects that Phil spoke to, where we are expensing the development costs until the point that those projects are determined to be probable. The net of that raises our segment profit guidance about $100 million in 2008. In 2009, E&P is raising its guidance somewhat as a result of again, good strong production and somewhat higher price. And again, bottom line in 2009, up about $100 million. Turning to slide number 35 please, capital spending, very little change from a quarter ago. However, I would note that Williams continues to be opportunity-rich, as each of our business unit leaders described. And we will continue to pursue value-adding opportunities and as such CapEx will continue to rise throughout the future quarters. Turning next to slide number 36, please. This is cash forecast I like to walk through this together with you to give you some sense of how we’re thinking about this once again. We have unrestricted cash in the U.S. of $1.234 billion, add to that our forecast CFFO of $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion; back off the CapEx at $2.6 billion to $2.950 billion, and again, we expect that number to grow. We add in our asset sales, the net proceeds from the WMZ IPO, subtract the dividend, minority interest payments, and the balance of the share repurchase program, assuming that we execute on that, and some other items, and we bring down a cash balance of $600 million to $700 million, with a number of things that are yet to be determined. I will just focus a couple of comments there. Again, we’re opportunity rich. We are out pursuing additional investment opportunities that will in fact add value, those will likely cause CapEx to grow and cash to deplete. Additionally, we will consider to the extent that we have additional cash that’s available and not earmarked for additional investment. We will look at share repurchase or debt repurchase, but again, no commitment on that at this point. And then additional dropdowns, we are committed to the growth of our two MLPs. We do expect to continue to grow those MLPs, but we’re not providing any guidance in that respect here today. I won’t walk through the same detail for 2009, but the thinking is much the same. With that, I’ll turn it back to, Steve.
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Don, and looking at my last slide. Slide 38, I believe it is. Let me conclude with a few key takeaways from our meeting this morning. Obviously, our first quarter results represent a wonderful start to 2008. Secondly, the attractive commodity price environment is expected to continue, and will certainly benefit our results going forward. Thirdly, we have increased our earnings outlook for the next two years. And lastly, we continue to be very, very opportunity rich with respect to the organic opportunities to grow our businesses, and create long-term shareholder value. So with that, we would be happy to take your questions. Question and Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Rebecca Followill with Tudor Pickering.
Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering: Good morning, couple of questions for you, Ralph. This year, this winter, you went through your first drilling in the Highlands. Can you talk about how that went and implications for going forward?
Ralph A. Hill - President, Exploration and Production: Yes. It was actually a very severe winter, and we made it through just fine, very safely, operated a rig both in Trail Ridge through the severe winter, and also at Allen Point. It was the second year for Trail Ridge and the first time ever at Allen Point. And we’re pleased with our results, we’ve learned quite a bit. But it does confirm to us that, we believe we can operate in those two areas year round. So hopefully, as we digest what we learn this year, we will look to begin to add to the more than one rig in those areas for the winters coming up. But it went really well. And I guess if you wanted to get tested, this was a great year to get tested. It was a very severe winter up there, but it went well.
Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering: Thanks. And then also on your 3P reserve report, can you remind us again what is not in there? And how long of a lateral did you assume in the Highlands, I think in your last 3P report you were assuming a 2000-foot lateral?
Ralph A. Hill - President, Exploration and Production: Right.
Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering: What did you assume in this report?
Ralph A. Hill - President, Exploration and Production: And that lateral was more in the valley. But it was 2000 last time, the lateral this time is 3000-foot. But what’s not in there is the majority of the acreage, we just earned at the end of the year in the Barcus Creek area, which is just north of Ryan Gulch. And then none of our exploratory areas are in there, such as the Uinta or the Paradox or the Caney or any of those areas are in the 3P number.
Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering: Okay. And then last question for you on Paradox; any updates for us on where you stand on exploration there?
Ralph A. Hill - President, Exploration and Production: With our partner, we’re beginning to drill our first horizontal well there. We’ve done several vertical wells there. We do believe there is a gas presence, which is good, its shale. The key is being able to produce that. So we’re doing our first horizontal well to test the difference between the horizontal drilling and the vertical drilling there.
Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering: And what are you targeting, what formation?
Ralph A. Hill - President, Exploration and Production: It’s called a Gothic Shale.
Rebecca Followill - Tudor Pickering: Okay, perfect. Thank you.
Ralph A. Hill - President, Exploration and Production: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we’ll go to our next caller, Faisel Khan from Citigroup.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Good morning. I am wondering if you could just walk me through in a little bit more detail in terms of how the NGL equity volumes ramped down from the fourth quarter of ‘07 to the first quarter of this year. I know you said some of the linepack issues on the Overland Pass Pipeline in the Ignacio plant fire. But can you just quantify it a little bit in terms of what went on?
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. If you are looking at that slide, you would see that the equity sales on that went from first quarter of ‘07 of 345 to 308. And in the first quarter of ‘07, we were actually reducing our linepack on MAPL because we were selling some of our product to BP at the outlet of those plants, because they had a lower tariff on MAPL than we did. So that net production, if you will, actual equity production was 333, if you included what was actually produced for our account. And then, we put 59 million gallons, looking at that 308 number for first quarter of ‘08 we actually put 59 million gallons in the inventory as we built linepack on MAPL because that sell went to BP ended at the end of February of ‘08. And so that net swing is 71 million gallons from period-to-period, which gives you about a 33 million gallon build net-net. And so it’s about a 10% improvement in equity production for liquids that were produced for our own account.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay. And so going forward though, we should see those volumes come back?
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The volumes, when Overland Pass starts up about half of that linepack will come back to us because the Overland Pass system doesn’t currently requires about half the linepack of Enterprise requires on their MAPL and seminal systems.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay. Then just on the NGL margin, if you could also just walk me through a little bit in terms of how the margins actually contracted from the fourth quarter of ‘07 to the first quarter of ‘08? Was it that the rapid price in natural gas relative to oil in the first quarter? Or was it that ethane and propane prices weren’t keeping up with the historical correlation?
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, well, certainly, at the end of the quarter, we saw correlations between ethane and crude begin to slip some. So even though the crude to gas ratio has been pretty high, we’ve been noticing the ethane correlation to crude slipping somewhat. But probably the main driver, if you were looking to Williams NGL margins, the main driver has been the increasing gas prices in the Rockies, particularly at Opal. And we had very, very low prices in the third and fourth quarter of last year relative to -- and crude was coming up, crude has stayed up and increased a little bit. Actually NGL prices have stayed relatively flat if you look at it in aggregate between ethane and the heavies. But our feedstock cost gas has gone up almost threefold.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay. And any change in the demand from your customers on the liquids side? Do you still see demand as fairly stable compared to the fourth quarter of last year?
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. We’ve seen pools pretty hard. And the thing that I think has helped us a lot that hasn’t been real apparent is that, the U.S. dollar has been so weak that it’s allowed for a lot of polyethylene export from the U.S. into Europe. And so that’s actually kept demand on the light end producers here in the U.S. pretty heavy; because the producers in Europe are usually heavy in oil-based product, is what they crack to produce ethylene over there. So our ethylene here in the U.S. right now is lower cost than some of those European-based crackers.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay, great. Thanks. And on the E&P side of the equation, in the Sand one Basin, looks like you had about 134 million cubic feet a day in the first quarter I think last year you were doing closer to 150. Was the processing plant fire one of the reasons why the production volumes little bit down?
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, you’re right on there. Several things, the fire clearly affected our volumes beginning in late last year, in January and February. We also had some imbalance makeup that we did at that time with another producer. And then the weather was poor in the sense of very muddy. So it’s something to wait. We’ll shut there with the water -- when you deepwater, you do with water trucks and some other trucks couldn’t get to the well side. Thus we had to shut the wells in, so a combination of all three things hitting in the first quarter.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: And how much do you think that impacted production volumes?
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We should have been just about flat to slightly up. So we were down by to the first quarter of last year, so.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay.
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It was about the entire effect you said between the 134 million and 150 million.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: I got you. And on the Powder River, the large production increase over last year is that just, Big George Coal’s overtaken the Wyodak Coal’s or is it because there is lumpiness in terms of how the drilling occurs in the Powder River Basin?
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It’s just that Big George Coal’s are kicking in more and more. There has been a number of wells that we drilled and our partner drilled over the last couple of years, and they take anywhere from 12 months to slightly longer to deepwater. And the Coal’s are doing better than we thought, and the deep watering happening. And our partner also paid a lot of attention to hooking their wells up, and getting the water fall into, they could get the production on. So all those things together made the volumes just really pick up, but the Big George Coal’s are performing very well.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay. And then on the, is your share repurchase program did you purchased any share in the first quarter?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, we did, Faisel. The total share repurchase program is worth $652 million program today, with $126 million in the first quarter.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay, great. And what did you say are you price sensitive at all to your share repurchase program or would you say that, you have the cash available, that’s something that you think about using on a regular basis?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: We are price sensitive. So we continue to look at alternate use as a capital. And again, we have substantial reinvestment opportunity which, we believe will drive very attractive long-term value. And then we also have the share repurchase as an option.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Great. Thanks for the time, guys.
Operator: And your next question comes from Sunil Jagwani with Catapult.
Sunil Jagwani - Catapult: Yeah, hi. Good morning and congratulations. I wanted to ask about the E&P business in particular. I mean your growth rate in volumes grows at 30% is significantly higher than plenty of other companies in the market standalone E&P, and on the hybrids and your resource potential is again not any less. Yet, I think it’s pretty obviously that the implied value of the E&P business a fraction of what some of the other companies seem to get. Can you refresh our memory as to what you might consider in terms of potential split of the E&P business?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. We’ve continued to like our integrated model created great long-term shareholder value over the last few years. I have done quite a bit of an analysis on the potential impact of some kind of split or spin. I’ve talked about that with you in the past. So we have evaluated that option with our Board with our advisors. And to date still prefer the integrated model is the way to create long-term shareholder value. We’re growing the business fairly dramatically. And the opportunity is for us to continue do so persist. We will continue to evaluate the pros and cons, of a split of a spin, and I believe that we will always do the right thing for the shareholders.
Sunil Jagwani - Catapult: I mean it almost seems frankly insane to me that, being quite the I get an implied value of five or six times that is just a cash from the E&P business. And your peers are getting sixteen to seventeen times, which is three times as much and their GAAP is wider than it’s ever been and that’s why I asked the question. But I appreciate your answer, thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And to the final question currently in queue Rick Gross with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.
Rick Gross - Lehman Brothers: My question was actually answered earlier. Thank you.
Operator: As there are no further questions currently in queue, I will conclude today’s question and answer session. For any additional or concluding remarks, I’d like to turn the conference back over to, Travis Campbell.
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, this is Steve Malcolm. Delighted with our first quarter, we are very excited about the future, very much opportunity rich, and look forward to continuing to grow shareholder value. So we look forward to talking with you again. Thanks.
Operator: That concludes today’s conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect

Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to The Williams Companies Fourth Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Travis Campbell, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Travis Campbell - Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications: Thank you, and good morning everybody. Welcome to the Williams fourth quarter 2007 earnings call. As you're probably aware, 2008 is the Centennial year of our Company, and you can see that noted on our slide format this year. Thanks for our interest in our Company. This morning, Steve Malcolm, our CEO, will lead off followed by Don Chappel; also Ralph Hill, Alan Armstrong, and Phil Wright will make some brief remarks. Before I turn it over to Steve Malcolm, please note that all of the slides, both those that are presented today and those in the appendix are available on our website, williams.com in a PDF format. The fourth quarter press release and all the accompanying schedules as well as the release announcing increases to approved reserves which was also released this morning are also available on the website. Slide two and three titled Forward-Looking Statements discloses various risk factors and uncertainties related to future operations and expectations. Actual results, of course, may vary significantly from our current expectations due to the factors disclosed. Please review the information on those slides. Slide four, oil and gas reserves disclaimer is also very important and we urge you to read that slide as well. Also included in the presentation today are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to generally accepted accounting principles. Those schedules follow the presentation and are integral to this presentation. So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Travis. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2007 earnings call. As always, we very much appreciate your interest in our Company. By almost any measure, we had an outstanding fourth quarter, an exceptional full year 2007, and our core natural gas businesses clearly delivered very strong performances across the board. In fact, while we have been very pleased with our performance over the past five years, 2007 may have been our best year since our restructuring. Looking at slide number six, which describes some of our key achievements during the year, we delivered $1.73 adjusted earnings per share, a 62% increase for the year and this is the fifth year of double-digit percentage improvement to earnings per share. And we produced $2.2 billion of consolidated segment profit, a 46% increase. All of our businesses finished 2007 with strong performance. We benefited from strategic management of the Rockies basis price opportunity. We boosted natural gas production. We captured record NGL margins. We collected new higher rates on Transco and Northwest pipeline. We also pulled important value creating levers. We sold our power business. We continued to execute around our MLP strategy, and a couple of specifics on that. In December, we completed our Wamsutter drop-down WPZ, a $750 million transaction. And I want to emphasize that WPZ continues to be an important tool for our midstream strategy. We've dropped down $2.4 billion in assets to WPZ in its short two and half year history, providing a source of growth and scale and scope and distributable cash for our limited partners of WPZ, while providing fair value for WMB through the monetization of assets. This is a winning strategy for both Williams and WPZ. And on January 17, WNZ priced its IPO of 16.25 million units at $20. Moody's and Fitch returned us to investment-grade in November. And in 2007, we bought approximately 16 million shares for $526 million at an average price just north of $33. And all of that culminates in Williams's shareholders being rewarded with a 39% total return during the year. Slide seven offers a few of the business unit highlights for '07. And again, I'd call your attention to our year-end reserves report, which we issued this morning in a separate news release. But we did produce 21% more domestic natural gas; our fourth quarter average surpassed one billion cubic feet per day. We improved our one year F&D to below $2; added 12% to proved reserves. Domestic reserves are now 4.14 tcf; total proved, including Apco, 4.3 trillion cubic feet. And for the fifth consecutive year, Williams has replaced more than 200% of its production with a 232% reserve replacement rate in 2007. The business mix and our management of the Rockies basis was done well. As we've said many times, we are a Rockies producer, not a Rockies price taker. We were able to capture 15% higher average net realized prices compared to '06 despite a 31% decrease in Rockies prices. How we're able to do that? Because just 8% of our production was exposed to Rockies prices; more than 70% was produced and shipped to other price points; about 20% hedged in the Rockies. Midstream captured the benefit of the basis opportunities, with capturing an $0.83 per gallon margin in the fourth quarter of '07, compare that to $0.36 per gallon in fourth quarter of '06, Midstream topped a billion dollars in segment profit for the year. And as I stated earlier, Northwest and Transco benefited from nearly a full year of new rates. Slide eight shows our steady growth, both looking back and looking forward into the future. The graph shows recurring adjusted segment profit, the blue bars, and recurring adjusted earnings per share shown in the purple bars. It shows the actual for '05, '06, and '07 and shows our forecast for '08 and '09. For '07, you can see the effect of the very attractive price environment... and I'm specifically talking here about the Midstream margin uplift year-over-year, which amounted to $305 million, and Alan will talk more about that. But you can see that in the diagonally hashed portion at the top of the bars for '07; a significant benefit. But if we normalize pricing for '07, we'd still end up with segment profit growth for the year of approximately 15%. As we look toward '08 and '09, our growth expectation is built on a fairly conservative commodity price forecast, particularly compared to today's market prices. So for this year... and when I say this year, I'm talking about 2008, we're expecting stronger natural gas prices than '07 in the Rockies and elsewhere; slightly lower crude oil prices; and a lower crude to natural gas ratio. And of course, that drives our processing margins. And so our guidance on this slide runs through '09. And while we're not prepared to publish ranges for 2010 and beyond, I do want to highlight the high level of optimism we have about those out years. This slide nine, we're layering our thoughts about 2010 and beyond on top of the five year horizon of actuals and expected performance. We expect continued double digit percentage growth in our production. Our strategy of rapid development of our significant and growing inventory of reserves is obviously working. Our guidance for '08 and '09 includes the unfavorable effect of certain legacy hedges for natural gas. We'll see much of that roll off after 2009. As a result, we would expect to see about a $40 million positive effect in 2010 compared with '09 and the 2011 picture will improve by another $80 million because of legacy hedges that will expire in 2010. We'll also see the benefit of projects that we're investing in today as they come into service and they're contributing to our profitability. I'm speaking here specifically about projects in Midstream like Perdido Norte and Willow Creek and in the gas pipeline business, we'll have the benefit of expansions like Sentinel Phase 2, Eminence, Gulfstream 3 and 4. So as we continue our disciplined investment strategy, we expect to continue to grow our recurring adjusted earnings per share at a rate somewhere between 10% and 20% in 2010. Williams's future is very bright. We continue to have abundant growth opportunities. So with that, I'll turn it over to Don.
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Steve. Good morning. Let's turn to slide number 11, please, financial results. Just to note a couple of highlights here. Obviously, we are delighted with the earnings that we are reporting this morning. I would just point you to the income from discontinued operations for just a second. You can see for the full year we had a gain of $143 million; relates to the sale of the power business. I would also note that we had related losses that were included in continuing operations related to gas marketing contracts that were legacy Power segment contracts that we're seeking to exit. But most importantly is the key measure at the bottom of the page, recurring income from continuing operations after eliminating mark-to-market effects. And again, you can see $0.59 as compared to $0.28 a year ago. Again, more than double and on a full year basis, $1.73 up 62%. Let's turn the page to slide number 12 please, fourth quarter segment profit. Again, I'll note that a reconciliation from reported to recurring results is included in the appendix on slide 82 and a calculation of the mark-to-market adjustment is included on slide number 83. I'm going to focus my comments on the recurring column. E&P results at $194 million up $54 million or 39%, quite an extraordinary year. The fourth quarter production increase of 18% coupled with a 14% higher net which realized prices offset somewhat by higher DD&A, lease operating expense, and G&A contributed to those results. Midstream's exceptional performance, $374 million, up $205 million from the prior year quarter or 121% were primarily driven by record NGL margins, which resulted from very favorable NGL prices and low Rockies natural gas feedstock prices. Additionally, higher NGL production volumes and margins were driven by the fifth processing train at Opal, which was placed into service during February of 2007. And gas pipeline results at $160 million, up $59 million or about 59% were driven by the effects of the rate cases which took hold in the first quarter of 2007. These three principal businesses, the results totaled $728 million, up $318 million or 78% from the prior year's quarter. Let's turn to gas marketing. Again, gas marketing includes results related to certain legacy contracts that were formally a part of the Power segment, including a loss on termination of one such contract. And we will continue to seek to exit some other contracts of a similar nature, but I think we have the lion's share of such losses behind us. But we will continue to have some mark-to-market volatility and potentially some potential gains and losses as we continue to exit the legacy contracts. At the bottom of this slide, you can see the gas marketing results excluding mark-to-market effects. And at that level, the loss is very small. And again, gas marketing principally is providing services to our E&P and Midstream business as well as to certain third party producers. Again, focusing on the bottom line there segment profit after mark-to-market adjustment, $718 million, up $325 million or 83%. Let's turn the page, slide number 13 please. Full year segment profit, as you can see, all of our businesses were up, both on a reported and a recurring basis. And again, if I focus your attention to gas marketing at the bottom of the page, you'll see the result without the effect of mark-to-market. Again, a modest loss and one that relates principally to these legacy contracts that we continue to exit. With that, I'm going to turn it to Ralph.
Ralph A. Hill - President of Exploration and Production: Thank you, Don. I'm very proud to share with you today the excellent results that our dedicated E&P employees achieved in 2007. Bottom line was a record year for organic reserve additions, production, and for profit. Looking at slide 15, our recurring segment profit was up 38%, as Don mentioned, and as Steve talked about, we have been very proactive in optimizing our transportation strategy and our color hedging strategy. And as mentioned, we were able to realize prices 15% higher in the Rockies... or 15% higher net realized prices, even though the Rockies prices were 30% lower, or the market prices were. So great job by our team on managing our transportation and color strategy. Looking at our accomplishments, a growth of 20%, overall 21% domestically, we did average over 1 Bcf a day in the fourth quarter. Reserve replacement, which I have another slide on, is 232%, our three-year finding and development costs of $1.77. Looking at one-year finding and development costs, it is approximately $1.93. Early surveys that we've seen, one has come out from JP Morgan analysts, showed that most... analysis of 35 North American producers showed a cost of $3.22 approximately for their one year finding costs. So one year finding year cost looks to be about $1.30 or more, better than market. What we concentrate more on is the three year F&D which was $1.77. Also very proud of our team for some of the awards that they earned, I'd like to mention. We did get a best management practices from the BLM for our new drilling technology. We got outstanding operations awards from the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, where we are the largest producer now in Colorado, for hydraulic fracturing process for our water quality, and for the Wheeler Gulch Road and Tunnel. Turning to slide 16, looking at our asset teams, the Piceance Valley was up 21% over a year ago. We have 22 rigs operating in the Valley. Piceance Highlands production was up 92% over a year ago at 45 million cubic feet a day. We have four rigs operating there. Powder River was up 18% over one year ago. Sequential quarters, fourth quarter our volumes are starting to explode in the Powder; they were up 34%. Fort Worth production was up 78% and is now at 35 million cubic feet a day with four rigs drilling. We do have quite a bit of deal flow coming in the door and tighter well density also offers upside. San Juan, our very mature basin, continues to grow at a 3% rate. In our step-out areas, we did earn the additional 11,000 acres that we've talked about at Barcus Creek Farm and in the Piceance Highlands, which will be added to the Piceance Highlands team. Slide 17, reserve performance. Our total reserves are now 4.3 trillion cubic feet. Our U.S. proved reserves are 4.14 trillion cubic feet, which is up 12%. As mentioned, we had a 232% domestic reserve replacement. Our drilling success rate was 99.4%. That's our fourth or fifth consecutive year of over 99% drilling success and greater than 200% reserve replacement. And we added 776 Bcf to our proved reserves. In addition to moving the 1.9 trillion cubic feet that's on the bottom of this slide the last three years from our probables to our approved categories, our proved developed producing percentage has now gone up from 49% to 54%, meaning we have much more productive assets also. Turning to slide 18. The left panel shows the... panel one shows the continued organic growth we've achieved the last several years of 21% approximately. It's a Verde production from 2004 to 2007. On the right hand side, you can see our proved reserves have gone up on a compound average growth rate of approximately 12%. It again shows that we have been able to increase our production capacity as you look at the percentage of PDP's of 54% versus 45% just four years ago. In addition, we have been able to be much more productive even though we drill in tight sands areas where the initial decline rates are quite rapid. And then they fall off into a much more steady. So we believe that our ability to continue to increase this is quite impressive based on the reservoir characteristics of where we operate in. The bottom of that slide shows our RP ratio, which does reflect that we are becoming much more productive in our asset base, and our reserve replacement ratio, which has averaged over 200% as mentioned. Slide 19, this is our standard domestic proved reserves reconciliation from 2005 to 2007. I won't go through all the aspects of it, but basically you can see each year we show you our acquisitions, which are very small in our Company, our production, and then our addition or revisions, and come up with our year-end 2006 and year-end 2007 on a domestic reconciliation. Very proud of our results for the 2007 year. Slide 20, once again, our value creation continues. We did have a record year for reserve additions, production, and segment profit. Our strategy remains where rapid development is... our premiere drilling inventory. We believe and we will be able to share more of this in our next call with you, but our organic production growth rate of 20% should be an industry leader. Our domestic reserve replacement through the drill-bit only of 232% is again, should be an industry leader. And our three-year finding cost is $1.77, we expect to be as a leader in the industry also. We have a very long-term inventory ahead of us, and we will continue to develop it as we have. Our history is very high drilling success and very cost efficient and we are looking for our long term organic growth outlook for continuing drilling in our existing areas and we continue to evaluate the new opportunities that we have talked about previously which are in the Paradox, Uinta and Deeper Piceance and we'll be providing more information as appropriate during this 2008 year. With that, I'm very pleased to turn it over to Alan Armstrong, our $1 billion man.
Alan Armstrong - President of Midstream Gathering and Processing: Thank you very much, Ralph. I'm going to start off here on slide 22. Certainly at the top of the list for Midstream's 2007 accomplishments is the financial performance. We were able to capture extraordinary margins by continuing to execute on our strategy in a timely manner. This allowed us to generate over $1 billion in recurring segment profit and approximately $1.3 billion in segment profit plus DD&A. This was done with less than $4 billion of average assets. A key contributor to our year-over-year increase was the timely addition of our fifth processing train to our Opal complex. This on-schedule project allowed us to capture about $105 million in margin in just ten months, yielding us a very nice return on our $70 million investment there. We also are continuing to contract for additional volumes from the exciting deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Notably, we just signed up the Bass Lite fill to come across our Devils Tower platform. And in fact, this production began flowing last week at a rate of over 40 million a day. Additional volumes will begin flowing once we have completed the expansion of the Devils Tower gas handling capacity on our platform, which is currently operating at maximum capacity. We also have three other major deepwater projects currently underway that will add significant fee-based revenues later this year, all the way through 2009 and 2010 as those projects start up over that period. First, the Blind Faith, which is scheduled later this year; Tahiti; Perdido Norte projects come online through that period. Finally, we signed another significant commitment in Canada that will add about 15% to our liquids volumes at our Redwater fractionator, serving the off-gas liquids from the Alberta oil sands upgraders. Moving to slide 23. Clearly the most pleasant surprise in 2007 was the NGL margin environment. This was driven by crude oil prices rising from $55 a barrel in January to $95 a barrel in December, and by lower natural gas prices, particularly in the Rockies. As you can see from this graph, we saw NGL production volumes continue to rise throughout all of 2007, even in spite of a fire that we had at our Ignacio, Colorado plant that eliminated approximately 28 million gallons of production and 11 million gallons of equity sales from this large complex for about 33 days in the fourth quarter. As a result of this very positive environment, we began laying off some of our NGL price risk spread across the year. We sold four at about 24% of our projected domestic NGL sales through 2008, using collars that will yield us weighted average sales prices that are 9% higher at the floor and 22% higher at the ceiling than the prices we realized in 2007. Additionally, we executed fixed-price swaps on another 4% of our sales volumes and bought the corresponding natural gas volumes to capture margin higher than 2007 for a significant portion of our Four Corners area production. Moving on to slide 24, this chart takes a look at our growth projects and there are several key things to note here. First, on the in-development front, we continue to see growth in our Canadian oil sands opportunities and we have added a new project that we are very excited about and hope to be moving that into the under negotiations pie very soon. We were able to move, we are also able to move the plant expansion at Markham from the under-negotiations into our in-guidance slide. And this project will double the size of our Markham plant. We also expect to see significant movement to the In Guidance slide during the second quarter of the year when a number of project will be coming forward for approval. The key takeaway is that we continue to move investment opportunities to the right on this slide and amount of profit we expect from these investments continues to grow. Moving to slide 25, the key points, we are celebrating the first time this business unit has broken through the $1 billion segment profit level in a succession of back to back to back record quarters. All of our operating areas contributed to this success within Midstream. Even more important is the return we are generating on our investments. We keep tabs on how we are performing against our Midstream peers in the area of capital efficiency and we appear to be leading when it comes to return on average assets employed. We calculate our return on average assets to be approximately 28% for 2007. Our guidance for 2007 assumes that we will see lower margins in 2008 as actual NGL prices hold steady but natural gas prices increase substantially, particularly in the Rockies. As a result, we moved at the first of the year to capture some of the NGL prices on about 28% of our projected domestic sales, as we mentioned earlier. And there is a slide in the appendix that further describes our transactions in more detail. The demand for our services remains strong and we are excited about the growth opportunities in Canada, the Western region, and the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In closing, we remind you that we are raising guidance again for 2008 based on the pricing we receive on the forward sales of our NGL barrels and the growth in deepwater revenues we expect from Bass Lite and Blind Faith as those projects come online. Our current guidance moves away from our past practice of using five-year average margin because the current pricing is such a large variance to historical. And with that, I will turn it over to Phil Wright.
Phillip D. Wright - President of Gas Pipeline: Thank you, Alan. If you'll turn to slide 27 please, among our many accomplishments in a strong year we settled general rate cases, as Steve mentioned, at Northwest pipeline and Transco without litigation, fueling our profit improvement and significantly enhanced free cash flow generation. We were pleased to launch the successful IPO of Williams Pipeline Partners LP at the midpoint of our price range in a dramatically down market. Reflecting the quality of our pipeline franchises, we placed several large expansion projects in service. We received FERC approval to proceed on several organic growth projects and we finished binding open seasons on a combination of organic and Greenfield projects. Slide 28, please. Looking ahead to 2008 and 2009, we expect our maintenance capital levels to be lower than required in 2007. In 2007, our maintenance capital provided... approximated $300 million, which was at the top end of the guidance provided, while total capital spending was slightly under guidance. As always, we've shown detail on the major growth projects included in our guidance, illustrating when we expect the project to be in service, a capital expenditure forecast, and the expected addition to segment profit in the first full year of each project. Slide 29, please. Finally, and don't worry, I'm not going to take you through each one of these, this slide clearly illustrates the excellent growth we are enjoying across our pipeline enterprises. You will note the expansions not included in the guidance are shown in blue. The scope of each one of these projects is detailed in the appendix on slide number 76. And with that, I'll turn it back to Don.
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Phil. Let's turn now to slide number 31. Just a summary of our 2008 forecast guidance, I'll focus on the bottom line, $1.60 to $2.00, up from $1.50 to $1.90 that we forecast back in November. Let's now turn the page to slide number 32 and for the first time we're detailing 2009 guidance. And the bottom line there, diluted EPS reoccurring on an after mark-to-market adjustment totaling $1.70 to $2.20. Again, up from the 2008 levels, and I would note that our commodity price assumptions for both 2008 and 2009 are included on slide number 85 as well as our hedges are detailed in the appendix as well. Let's now turn to the next slide, please, number 33. Give you a sense of where we are from a natural gas exposure standpoint. And this is company-wide. The chart on the left, 2008, again, our E&P business is producing more than 1 Bcf of gas a day after fuel and taxes and the like. Our net exposure is just under 1 Bcf a day. The orange coloration represents financial hedges that are in place. The blue is the unhedged E&P long natural gas position. And below the zero line there is the unhedged Midstream short natural gas position related to their fuel and shrink needs. The red line is the net position for the Company and you can see that more than 1 Bcf a day of natural gas production netted down by financial hedges and Midstream needs turns out to be boring about 300 million a day for both 2008 and just a bit below that in 2009. So, our economics exposure to natural gas prices is considerably less than it would absent both financial hedges as well as the Midstream short position. The next slide is a subset of the prior slide and focuses on Rockies exposure and here you can see the net company exposure is more in the 125 million a day in 2008 and less than 100 million a day in 2009. So again, very modest exposure to Rockies prices, despite the fact that we are a Rockies producer. The next slide please, number 35, 2008 and 2009 reoccurring segment profit. And again, I will note the commodity price assumptions are on slide number 85 and the hedges are on slide number 66. E&P at about $1 billion to $1.3 billion, and I would note again, as Steve did, that 2008 is burdened with a forecast of $59 million hedged loss related to legacy hedges that were dated 2002 and 2003 transactions. And 2009 is burdened with $119 million hedge loss or a $60 million change between those two years. But what we do see positively is good strong production growth and reserve increases throughout the period. The Midstream results continue to be very strong, based on strong margin forecast, somewhat lower than 2007 but still very strong margins, as well as new projects and volumes. Gas pipeline, steady returns and very low-risk. Focusing on the last line on the page now, the gas marketing after eliminating mark-to-market effects, you can see there is just a bit below breakeven and again, with some of the legacy contract issues continuing to drag that below zero. This is really a service business to our E&P and Midstream business, principally and the business should be operating breakeven or better, again, as we continue to exit these legacy positions or the legacy positions expire. We'll continue to move up on that basis. Let's turn to the next page, to slide number 36, please, capital expenditures. You can see once again we're spending about $1.5 billion more or less in our E&P business, driving that very strong growth in production as well as continuing to prove up new reserves and new areas. Midstream business, investing in many new growth projects with many more, having some visibility. And we will continue to update you and update our guidance as we continue to pursue those projects and capture those projects. And then gas pipeline, a combination of maintenance capital and growth capital there. As Phil pointed out, we have many more projects that are not yet in guidance that we're pursuing and we would expect to be able to update guidance for all of our businesses as we continue to capture additional value adding growth opportunities that create both earnings and EVA. At the bottom line there, a range of 2.575 to 2.925 in 2008 and 2.250 to 2.650 in 2009. Again, we are opportunity-rich and we would expect to increase our capital spending guidance substantially in future periods. The next slide number 37, is a new slide designed to provide more transparency and better understanding of key elements of our plans and this is cash flow, I will walk through this quickly. Starting with an unrestricted cash balance of $1.234 billion as we enter 2008. We add to that our CFFO, back out the capital spending, and again I note that capital spending will in fact rise gives us operating free cash flow of a negative $200 million to $250 million. What else do we know? We have proceeds from our Peru asset sale of $120 million; net proceeds from our WMZ IPO of $305 million. Dividends at their current level are $230 million. Minority interest payments now at their current level, $110 million to $130 million; and share repurchase, this represents the balance of the $1 billion program that was authorized last July of $474 million. That brings us to a change in cash of about $600 million negative; coming off that $1.2 billion balance that we started off leaves us with about $600 million at the end of the year, if nothing else happened. However, we know that a number of other things will in fact, happen. We will make additional investments, additional capital expenditures. We will consider additional share repurchases or debt repurchases based on our cash position and our cash needs. And we will likely, very likely, drop down assets to both WPZ and WMZ. Again, we're not prepared to offer any guidance on any one of these three factors, but these are the other considerations that are part of our plan to create even more value in future periods. With that, I'll turn it back to Steve.
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Let me summarize quickly slide 39. As we spoke about earlier, 2007 was an extraordinary year. 2008 and '09 we expect to continue to grow earnings per share as a result of disciplined investment in our numerous organic growth opportunities. Slide 40 describes the growth beyond 2009 and that growth is clearly tied to continued production growth, the reduced impact of legacy hedges and the benefit of new projects, which will begin generating incremental revenues. Slide 41 simply shows the market. This is a very positive reaction to our earnings growth since 2004. Our stock price during that time has grown from just under $10 to, as you can see here, $35. My final slide, slide 42, the key takeaways, exceptional results on strong business performance in '07. We are forecasting continued growth. We expect to continue to pull value creation levers around WMZ and WPZ and our ongoing share repurchase program. We see a very bright future ahead for natural gas. We believe we are well positioned with the right assets and the right capabilities. We offer to shareholders, strong organic E&P production growth. We offer Midstream exposure to high NGL margins and stable, steady cash flow from our pipeline assets. We will be delighted to take your questions. Question And Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Lasan Johong from RBC Capital.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: Yes good morning. Nice quarter and year, congratulations. A couple of questions on the E&P segment, can you give us any guidance on production target levels that you expect in '08 and '09? Or is that still off the table?
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Which slide is that on, there is a... it's in appendix or is the guidance given for '09 for our production range on slide number 61.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. I will take a look at that then. In terms of F&D costs, there is a lot of discussion and talk about where costs are going in the E&P segment. There's a lot of price pressure. And I'm not quite sure that I understand the relationship between escalating prices of production growth profile at Williams and the fact that the CapEx are being held steady between '08 and '09. In other words, if you are going to increase production, I am assuming you have to drill continuously more wells. And that should in fact increase your cost, not keep it flat, if you want to continue the same growth profile. So I am not quite sure how all of those three connect for Williams?
Ralph A. Hill - President of Exploration and Production: I think a couple of things. First of all, there are some expenditures we had in '07 and carrying into 2008 that have some facilities that we are putting in place now for future production growth. And those expenditures basically go away to a much smaller number. They were probably over $150 million in '07 and probably still over $100 million or so in '08 and dropping to probably $50 million or so in '09. So that allows us about $100 million to be applied to drilling that was applied to the facilities to get ready for the drilling. Second, it's really a function for our finding costs of the continued reserve additions that we're able to do. We've had a great success of adding significant reserves. We have a very large probable inventory and we look forward to hopefully continuing that success. So that should help us to continue to have that kind of growth.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: On a CapEx base of almost $1.5 billion, I am not quite sure that $100 million makes that much of a difference if you're drilling, if your costs are going up at a rate of 15% to 20% a year minimum, from what I can tell?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we don't project that our costs are going to go up. This year we built into our costs about 4% on the drilling side and about the same, maybe 5% on the completion side. And we hope, and we've been able to demonstrate so far that we continue to be more efficient in the way we drill in the sense of we bring down the number of days it takes to drill. So thus we're able to... we're more efficient on both the cost basis and a number of days that allows us to drill more wells ultimately for about the same amount. So we are not seeing a 20% or 30% type cost increase.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: I see. How much of your 757 Bcf add was due to price revisions?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Virtually none. We are not... we have never been in that since the prices of where we are, we have had very high return assets, so essentially none of it was...
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: Because your cost base is so low and your F&D cost is so low?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Correct. Correct.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. And then just quickly rounding out... I understand you're expecting some large production growth. Question, first question related to that is, how long can you sustain a double digit production growth profile? And related to that is what's kind of like, give a sense of your inventory of drilling opportunities relative to what you've been doing over the last, say, two or three years?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: We have a significant inventory remaining ahead of us. Literally, thousands of locations, both in the Piceance Valley and the Piceance Highland and in the Powder River. And we're adding quite a bit of locations to our Barnett Shale area. So we have the... for the foreseeable future, we have similar opportunities in front of us that we've been able to experience the last three or four years. And so far, all we've really given guidance on is through '09 with thoughts also that we don't... our goal is to continue double digit type production in the years beyond like 2010.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: But no kind of peak estimates or anything like that?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: No, not at this time. We expect to be able to continue our production growth.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: And next we will hear from Rick Gross from Lehman Brothers.
Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers: Good morning. I've got a couple of questions for Ralph and then one for Alan. On page 16, you provided some regional production numbers. Are those annual or are those for the quarter?
Ralph A. Hill - President of Exploration and Production: They are quarter-to-quarter comparisons. The fourth quarter '07.
Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers: So those numbers were for the fourth quarter
Ralph A. Hill - President of Exploration and Production: Yes.
Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers: Okay. The Valley seemed to roll over from the third quarter. Is there anything going on there?
Ralph A. Hill - President of Exploration and Production: I'm not sure if I know what rollover means.
Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers: Slightly lower than what you had in the third quarter. The third quarter you were --
Ralph A. Hill - President of Exploration and Production: A number of rigs in the third quarter move up to the Highlands 9 or 10. And what happens there, whereas the Valley was essentially flat in the fourth quarter, the Highlands almost doubled.
Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers: Yes, the Highlands picked up materially. Okay.
Ralph A. Hill - President of Exploration and Production: Now we're back to 22 rigs in the Valley and you will see the Valley go the other way and the Highlands will flatten out for a while and then the Highlands will grow again in the summer months.
Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers: Okay, that's fine. From a standpoint of moving two P's into the PUD category, you had a very good year. Was this principally Highlands/Barnett?
Ralph A. Hill - President of Exploration and Production: It was actually quite a bit... about 75% of it was the Valley and the Highlands. And then Barnett was about probably 10% of that. And the Valley and the Highlands were about split between the two of them. So we had a very impressive year in the Valley. As you know, we are starting to drill more and more south of the river, as we call it, South of 70. And we had a very good year in the Valley also.
Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers: Okay, great. From a standpoint of the other thing that dictates kind of year-to-year finding costs, what kind of PUDs did you move to PDs?
Ralph A. Hill - President of Exploration and Production: What kind of PUD --?
Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers: Yes, every year you've generally provided a number of just drilling that's moving, in effect, changing proved categories.
Ralph A. Hill - President of Exploration and Production: Oh, how much of the PUD became PDs? Rick, I'll have to get that for you. I know the probables. I need to get that off... I don't have that on the top of my head.
Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers: Okay. And this one is kind of an obscure question for Alan. But the olefins, the ethylene plant all of a sudden came to life with low ethane prices. And I'm curious as to what you're forecasting for 2008, because if you just kind of take the 4Q run rate, it adds maybe about $100 million to EBIT with big volumes and nice margins?
Alan Armstrong - President of Midstream Gathering and Processing: Yes. Two things really drove that, Rick. And I'm not sure exactly what you're looking at, but certainly we're really pleased with the way our olefins segment operated. Remember, we made an acquisition of the BAS 5/12th of the interest in July of the Geismar plant. And so that increased that substantially. Also included in the $100 million of EBIT for olefins is our Canadian business, producing propylene up there that has been really performing very well. And in terms of what we have in '08, fairly you will see AMI pricing in our forecast? And it's not too different than the margins we saw on average through '07 for olefin margins.
Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers: Okay. And then once again dealing in obscurity, are you signed off on the ethane glut by the time we get to '09, so you end up with a much different orientation around that plant as far as profitability?
Alan Armstrong - President of Midstream Gathering and Processing: We have quite a bit of fee-based contracts at our ethylene facility through '09. So we wouldn't be as exposed to that. At the end of '09 we do get exposed to that in the market and own about half of it. So again, I think the thing we think about there is the fact we're also a large ethane producer. And so we're on both sides of that curve.
Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers: Okay.
Ralph A. Hill - President of Exploration and Production: The Powder also contributed to that and to our moves from probs to proved about 13%. So I just wanted to also mention that.
Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Next we will move to Faisel Khan from Citi Investment Research.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Investment Research: Wondering if you could discuss the demand you're seeing for your liquids products from your customers? I know that's been asked in the past before but I just want to do a channel check and make sure that you're still seeing the same sort of robust demand from both your chemical and refinery customers?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Good question. There are a number of ethylene crackers that are down right now. There's three I think that were planned to be down and two that were unplanned that are down right now. But... and so we have seen a little bit of backing off of the relationship between ethane and crude oil here recently. And in fact, the hedge that we did is very weighted towards ethane partially for the concern you, I suspect, getting to in terms of concerns about a recession and backing off in the pet-chem market. Ethane would certainly be the product that would be exposed to that. And about 65% of our barrel that we hedged was ethane. So we went heavy on the ethane hedge there. And got, again, a lot nicer prices than we saw in '07 for that ethane.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Investment Research: So you are seeing a little bit of softness right now?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think, anyway, we don't see anything fundamental other than the fact that there's five plants down right now.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Investment Research: Okay. Got you. And on the E&P side, can you update us on any of your exploration activities? I know you were talking about a deep well in the Piceance, I think, and I just wanted to see where you guys were with that?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: We had two drilled in the Deep and the Piceance. They're both... one is in completion and cleanup as we speak and the other one is waiting on some stipulations before we can complete that, which will be later in the spring. And we're going to wait until we finish that well also and start giving some results on that. But we do have quite a few opportunities out there if those work. We're just waiting on the stipulations to get through them and we can complete the second well.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Investment Research: Okay. And then the Paradox, is that project still ongoing?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, it is. It is ongoing and we've been working on our drilling schedule for this year. And we expect to continue to drill some more wells to continue to delineate what's available out in the field during 2008.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Investment Research: What kind of results have you had so far?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: We hadn't really given them out so far but we have found that there is gas presence, and that just means... and those are vertical wells we're drilling right now. So we will continue to analyze. Does that mean it... can we make it productive? And that's we'll be using various completion techniques on that to understand what is the best way to make it productive. And then we will also be looking at should we look at some horizontal opportunities in that kind of a shale.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Investment Research: Okay, got you. And then on the Powder River Basin, how should we look at the growth of that particular segment in terms of permeating, dewatering and all that other stuff? I mean can we continue to see sustained growth out of that part of the production side?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, we're feeling very good about the Powder. With our new partner over the last year and a half, they've done a great job of really working on their water management plan. And we feel that a number of their pilots are now producing. And our pilots have been producing for quite a while. So with the addition of their pilots coming on and doing very well, we're feeling very good about the Powder's future.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Investment Research: Okay. And then switching to the pipeline side of the equation for a second, in the fourth quarter it looked like there were some increases in O&M and SG&A. I'm just wondering is that related to kind of ongoing operations or is that related to maybe new development expenses for projects you guys are working on?
Phillip D. Wright - President of Gas Pipeline: Actually, I think at year end we were attempting to get a lot of maintenance work completed, and associated with that are some expenses going along with it. As you will recall, we had quite a hill to climb in order to comply with Pipeline Safety Improvement Act. We had to have 50% of our high consequence areas fully inspected by the end of 2007. And so we got on that work and got it done.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Investment Research: What percentage of your O&M would you say for '07 came from kind of this safety work that you guys have been doing?
Phillip D. Wright - President of Gas Pipeline: I don't have that number off the top of my head Faisel, so I'll have to get back with you on that.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Investment Research: Fair enough. Thank you for the time.
Operator: And next we will go to Jeff Coviello from Duquesne Capital.
Jeff Coviello - Duquesne Capital: Good morning guys, how are you? I just wanted to check and see what the share count was at the end of '07. I took... I think you bought back 8.4 million or something in the fourth quarter and I took that off the third quarter balance and I just wanted to make sure I did it the right way. How many shares did you have out at the end of the year?
Ralph A. Hill - President of Exploration and Production: Jeff, just give us a second. We're looking that up here.
Phillip D. Wright - President of Gas Pipeline: I think it's about 584.
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: 584 at the end of the year. 584 million.
Jeff Coviello - Duquesne Capital: Great. And then I was wondering on the E&P side and the Rockies, I know you guys are able to get a lot of your production out of the Rockies, but with Rex coming online, I was wondering what you were seeing as far as the basis goes. And in '07 the average basis was about a $1.40, I was wondering what your outlook was on the average basis for '08 and then looking further down, if you saw that getting wider or tighter does any kind of subjective information you could give us on that would be helpful?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: I think, actually some of the basis in '07 in the Rockies was a lot higher than that, that you mentioned. But with Rex coming on, the basis has narrowed significantly. And as we've been going through really Rex is about $1 to get to its marketplace from the Rockies. So in general you could expect the basis to get more into that range as there continues to be opportunities to... as Rex continues to expand the rest of the way and move the gas to Mid-continent and ultimately to the Northeast. So we expect and have seen the basis narrow quite a bit since Rex coming on, and also winter has obviously helped in some of the areas too.
Jeff Coviello - Duquesne Capital: And the basis that's embedded in the E&P guidance right now, what was the range for that roughly? I know the NYMEX price is like $7.05 to $8.35. And I think the basis or average around $1.40 in '08... am I right about that?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, it's about $1.40. I mean, some of the areas... San Juan might be a little higher, I mean lower than that, maybe more like $1.10 or so. But in the Rockies pure probably be $1.40 or so, I think it is.
Jeff Coviello - Duquesne Capital: Okay, great. Guys, thank you very much.
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Jeff, slide number 85 does indicate the range for the Rockies, San Juan, Mid-continent.
Jeff Coviello - Duquesne Capital: Oh, I see. Okay. So I guess what you're saying is right now if we took a snapshot, the spread looks a little tighter than this but is that right?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, the spread is tighter. And I think the thing we have is we have... we've set up our transportation strategy in such a way that we can move the majority of our gas away from the Rockies. However, if for some reason the prices were better, we had the optionality to keep it there. So we really have... of our gas exposed in 2008 for example, as little as 15% of it can be exposed to Rockies prices and that could increase depending on if we would choose to not transport and keep it in the Rockies. So we kind of have the best of both worlds.
Jeff Coviello - Duquesne Capital: Right. That's great. Thank you very much.
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Jeff, just kind if related to that, there are many projects seeking to move Rockies gas to other markets that certainly will benefit from over the longer term.
Operator: And next we will go to Lasan Johong from RBC Capital.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: Well, great. I just wanted to ask a question about the basis as well and Rockies in particular in view of the fact that the Rockies expressed should have some significant impact in longer-term, there's maybe another pipe going probably to mainland Oregon that will help reduce the basis even more. So I am curious as to how the '08 and '09 numbers of a basis to the Rockies in particular would change in view of this fact or why it hasn't changed in your guidance?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: What we actually saw depending on which particular point you're looking at in the Rockies in '07, the number would range from about $2.72 to about $3 basis differential depending... for the annual average, depending on which point you're actually looking at. And so we have changed that to $1.40 currently. Generally what we've seen over the years, we've certainly been in the Rockies and being both the buyer and seller for many years, is that in the shoulder months we will see the basis widen out as there's not enough demand, local demand. In the winter we will see prices sometimes and even see the basis go upside down as we've seen a little bit this winter. So,... but longer-term, there is a lot of productive capacity in the Rockies. And it is seldom that the pipeline capacity keeps in perfect step with that. And so we will see the basis build up. We will see new capacity come on, we'll see it soften. We'll see the basis close and then we'll see it widen back out. And I think the key thing to note is that the shoulder months are typically when we really see the basis widen out.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: But $1.40 is not exactly what you would call astoundingly narrow basis differential if you look at it on a historical basis. $2.70 was obviously a blowout. And it was very similar to that, somewhat of an anomaly, right?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: That is correct.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: So, I mean the $1.40 doesn't seem like you're being too aggressive in your basis assumption, in fact, you're being very conservative, from what I can tell. Is that not the correct view?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think that seems like it right now. Certainly last year that wouldn't have seemed aggressive. And we certainly haven't seen any shoulder months. And we do know there's a lot of new production capacity in the Rockies that we need to be wary of.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: And what do you think about going west? Something is probably going to get built into the California/Oregon border. How much more upside do you see in the basis subject to that pipe coming online?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: I think there's a lot of things yet to be determined by the time that pipe comes on and see what production does in the Rockies. It's pretty far out, I think.
Ralph A. Hill - President of Exploration and Production: I think it's a good idea to have another outlet. So it is good to see some projects being announced or studied. I think... and the Pacific Northwest seems to be a good place to go based on the ability we have to go elsewhere also. So it's good to see those in the works.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: Great. Thank you.
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: A reminder... in '08 and '09 we are highly hedged economically in the Rockies due to natural gas price changes as indicated on that slide that we reviewed earlier.
Lasan Johong - RBC Capital Markets: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: We hear again from Rick Gross, Lehman Brothers.
Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers: Yes, I've got a couple of Rockies basis kind of questions as well. One is, you guys were prescient enough to buy FT at very, very cheap rates like on Trans-Colorado with some of the other outlets very early on. When does this stuff begin to expire? And do we have to worry about either much higher costs for renewing some of this stuff or maybe even inability to renew some of the FT out of the Rockies?
Ralph A. Hill - President of Exploration and Production: Rick, this is Ralph. Most of our stuff doesn't expire for quite a while. And we also have the right of first refusal or whatever the right words would be on almost all of that also. So, first of all, it's not very quick when it expires and we do have a right to keep it.
Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers: Okay, great. And this one's for the pipe folks. I've seen a couple of presentations, Bronco, Ruby and others where to move that gas from Opal over to Mallen [ph], they're going to want to charge at least $1. If I look at the postage stamp rates on Northwest, why can't Northwest provide some extremely competitive alternative to these big bullet lines?
Phillip D. Wright - President of Gas Pipeline: Rick, this is Phil. I would start by saying we have a project that we've announced and are working with customers to develop to expand along the Northwest pipeline right away but indeed, it will require an expansion. And so we need for the market to be able to sustain a rate that will pay for that incremental capacity.
Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers: But I would assume that given that you've already got the right of way in place, et cetera, et cetera, that you could move gas over there for well under $1.
Phillip D. Wright - President of Gas Pipeline: Well, we're studying it, is about all I can tell you at this point. And we want to see what the market wants, first of all, and size of project that will appropriately accommodate that. And of course that will have an impact on what the ultimate scope of the project is and the ultimate rate. I hate to be evasive, but there are a lot of big variables turning in there. As you look to the Bronco versus Ruby project, one thinks that project along the same essential route will cost $2 billion. The other thinks it will cost $3 billion. I guess the only thing that's clear from that is one or the other of them is wrong.
Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers: Well, like I say, the tariffs there pretty spectacular relative to what I thought you'd be able to do it. The other thing is, if that is a pipeline that goes out of the Rockies, is it going to be... at least one of the new bullet lines... are they going to have to be a B a day and are they going to have to get producers who seem to be focused to the East? Is getting a producer contingent really the key to underpinning a pipe in the other direction?
Phillip D. Wright - President of Gas Pipeline: The other direction being --?
Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers: West.
Phillip D. Wright - President of Gas Pipeline: Westward.
Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers: They seem to be all pointed East. All of the producers I talked to still want to go East.
Phillip D. Wright - President of Gas Pipeline: I don't know that I would necessarily say that's a given, but certainly you've seen in the press that the Ruby project that you mentioned has a large utility that has stepped up to subscribe for a substantial part of that capacity. They announced last week that they've gotten a couple of more shippers on there. I don't know whether those are producers or LDCs.
Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers: I think they're marketers. But, okay. What does this do to your Pacific Connector? Has PG&E done any... given you any body English around... if they go the Ruby route, what that means to Pacific Connector?
Phillip D. Wright - President of Gas Pipeline: Well, I wouldn't want to speak for PG&E in this call, but I would say that first of all, the key to success on Pacific Connector is now and has always been when will adequate liquefaction capacity make LNG supply available for that project? The good news for us is that we have filed our FERC application. And to the extent that LNG wants to find its way to the West Coast as a supply option, we believe that the Jordan Cove terminal will be where it arrives. And we believe therefore that the Pacific Connector project will be the best access corridor for that gas. Now having said that, substantial things would need to probably move, if you have a pipeline into Mallen, in order for there to be adequate room in the market to accommodate that incremental supply, some of those developments could include, for example, additional gas staying north of the border from out of Canada.
Richard Gross - Lehman Brothers: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And next we will go to Christopher Taylor with Evergreen Investment.
Christopher Taylor - Evergreen Investment: Thanks. Wanted to ask just a couple of questions, leaving aside the hedges in the Midstream area, if the gas/propane differential reverts back to the historical average, how would that impact your segment profit for the Midstream area, leaving aside the hedges?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, that's a fairly complicated question. I'll give you some numbers you can draw to. The historical average is about $0.265 per gallon across all of the business. And we currently, at the lower end of our NGL margin range is about $0.38. So --
Christopher Taylor - Evergreen Investment: That's in your guidance.
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. The lower end of NGL margin guidance that we have in there. And so that is... and we have about 1.45 billion gallons to multiply that by. So it is about $0.10 on about 1.45 billion gallons; $0.12 on that 1.45 billion gallons.
Christopher Taylor - Evergreen Investment: Now, this $0.38, is that including hedges or is that before the benefit of the hedges?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Before the benefit of hedges.
Christopher Taylor - Evergreen Investment: Okay. So that's the real price.
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: That's at our guidance gas price and assumed crude oil... $75 crude oil price.
Christopher Taylor - Evergreen Investment: And with A, just gas prices in general and B, specifically Rockies gas prices, they're having very good rally this month. Just assuming it goes back to the historical $0.26, what would the impact be going from $0.38 to $0.26? Do I just multiply that by the volume? Or is there --?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, you can just take that against the 1.45 billion gallons times that $0.115 differential.
Christopher Taylor - Evergreen Investment: Okay. So that's fairly straightforward.
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: But I think one thing to note, as Don pointed out a while ago, is that be careful about assuming gas prices or the increase, because as that gas price increase comes, we're going to pick that up on the E&P side.
Christopher Taylor - Evergreen Investment: Yes, I know, that makes sense. On the MLP side, I mean, obviously the market is a bit tight right now for further issuance, but what would your use of proceeds be for any further issuance? I mean, you've said you intend to maintain a 50/50 or an absolute debt level. But does that imply you intend to take the money and buyback debt or do you intend to... how do you plan to use your MLP?
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Christopher, this is Don. One, to the extent that our MLPs raised debt capital to fund the acquisition, we have stated that it would be our general intention to pay down a like amount of corporate debt, so consolidated indebtedness remains unchanged. So it won't stress the credit. To the extent that it is funded with equity proceeds or cash from the MLPs, that cash would be available for us for a variety of purposes. And again, come back to our comments regarding the fact that we're opportunity-rich, and we have good visibility to a number of upside investment opportunities in each of our businesses. So, first and foremost, we would pursue those reinvestment opportunities that we believe will add the highest value. And then two, to the extent that we have excess cash after considering those investment opportunities, we would look at additional share repurchase or debt reduction.
Christopher Taylor - Evergreen Investment: So is it fair to assume what you're saying is that your absolute debt amount on a consolidated basis will remain unchanged?
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Probably not forever.
Christopher Taylor - Evergreen Investment: Or just in the interim?
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: But I think during this two year forecast period, I would expect that the consolidated debt level will remain about where it is.
Christopher Taylor - Evergreen Investment: And then right now, I mean you don't have any debts at the parent level to take out, except for the bonds, which you'd have to buy back at a premium. Wouldn't that be rather expensive?
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, it is.
Christopher Taylor - Evergreen Investment: So what's the logic of taking out that? Wouldn't you get a better return from your CapEx projects or share buybacks?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Well, again, to the extent that we're adding debt at the MLPs, we would be buying back debt to hold our credit metrics constant at our ratings. To the extent that we have additional fire power to your point, it's not all that attractive to take out additional debt. But I'm just saying that's a possibility but not all that likely.
Christopher Taylor - Evergreen Investment: I guess... if you don't mind me just asking a follow-up... if your debt remains unchanged at an absolute amount, your EBITDA is increasing very steadily, your debt metrics continue to improve, why do you have the need to buy back expensive debt?
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: I think we're just on the cusp of investment grade. We'd like to be solid investment grade. So we have... we don't have all the agencies; they've not taken... all taken us to investment grade levels yet. So we have just a bit more work to do, I think, to return to solid investment grade metrics that provide us with better access to the capital markets during difficult periods, lower cost of debt capital, and more flexibility to pursue value adding opportunities, and particularly when times are tough.
Christopher Taylor - Evergreen Investment: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. And next we will go to Mark Caruso [ph] with Millennium Partners.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. Don, I had a question for you circling back on the cash flow slide. I wanted to make sure I had the numbers right for share buybacks. So you did 7.5 million in third quarter as far as share buybacks and 8 million this quarter, do I have that right?
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: One second, let me look at the slide. It's slide number 89, for anyone that has not yet seen it. I think that's about right... through the end of 2007, I think its 15.9 million shares, $526 million expended, average price of $33.08.
Unidentified Analyst: And then based on the numbers you gave, that's about 13 million left to do this year. Is there any way to think about sort of the rate, because it seems like if you keep up that rate, you'll finish that up in the first half of '08.
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We're not going to provide guidance in terms of our timing. I think it will be a function of what's happening in the market. And obviously, we'd like to buy the shares at the lowest possible cost.
Unidentified Analyst: Got you. And then as far as drop downs for the MLPs, should we think about sort of the same rate that you guys have already started out as far as what you've done with WPZ in terms of in general for both?
Don R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, we've chosen not to give guidance for either WPZ or WNZ, so I really can't comment on it. But certainly we're intent on ensuring that both MLPs remain healthy. We see both as growth MLPs. As such, we think that we will have a very attractive cost of capital from those MLP issuances. In terms of specific guidance, I really can't provide any other than to say it's our intention to continue to support the two MLPs and continue to achieve statuses of a growth MLP with attractive cost of capital.
Unidentified Analyst: Got you. Okay, great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: There's no further questions at this time. For closing remarks, I'd like to turn it back over to Mr. Steve Malcolm.
Steven J. Malcolm - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer: Again, we're delighted with our 2007. We're equally excited about our future and appreciate your interest today. Thank you.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.

Travis Campbell: Good morning, everybody. Welcome to our third quarterearnings call. As always, thank you for the interest in the company. I knowmany of you have a lot of calls to monitor this morning, so we’ll get right toit. Steve Malcolm, our CEO, will lead it off, followed by Don Chappel, the CFO.Ralph Hill, Alan Armstrong and Phil Wright will also make some brief remarks. Before I turn it over to Steve, please note that all theslides are available on our website, williams.com in a PDF format. The pressrelease and the company's schedules are also available on the website, and thismorning we also filed our third quarter 10-Q. Slides 2 and 3 entitled, "Forward-LookingStatements," detail risk factors and uncertainties associated with futureoutcomes. Please review the information on that slide, and also slide 4,"Oil and Gas Reserves Disclaimer" is also important, and we urge youto read that slide as well. Included in the presentation today, as usual, there arevarious non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to Generally AcceptedAccounting Principles. Those schedules follow the presentation and are integralto the presentation. With that, I will turn it over to Steve.
Steve Malcolm:  Thanks, Travis. Good morning and welcome to our thirdquarter earnings call. We certainly appreciate your interest in our company. Wehad another outstanding quarter, and our core natural gas businesses deliveredvery strong performances across the board. Starting with slide 6. I am sure you saw the numbers for thethird quarter. Our adjusted earnings per share increased 44% to $0.39 from ayear ago. Our 2007 picture is getting even brighter as we are bumping up thefull year earnings per share guidance by 18%. We expect 2008 earnings to show strength even in a lessextraordinary pricing environment. Clearly, we are and have been in a robustcommodity pricing environment for much of this year. The fact is that for '07we have been short gas in the Rockies, and have takenadvantage of the very low prices in that region. However, we would expect thatthe situation to change somewhat when the RockiesExpress Project goes into service.  We look for approximately 15% natural gas production growthin 2008, and Ralph Hill will provide more detail on our outlook here in a fewminutes. And we expect to commit more capital to develop our opportunity richportfolio. A key theme for Williams, and one that I have stressed often,is that our businesses provide an abundance of organic growth opportunities.That’s important to this business, where you see many companies looking toacquisitions to find the growth that will fuel their futures. For Williams,much of that growth is well within our reach. We are continuing to make progress with respect to othersteps being taken to deliver value to our shareholders. I am sure that younoticed that Williams Pipeline Partners filed an amended S1 on Monday thisweek, and among other things, the latest filing includes the expected IPO priceof $19 to $21 per unit. As you recall, the pipeline MLP consists of a 25% interestin our Northwest Pipeline, and at this stage in the process, there is reallyvery little more that we can share about our MLP beyond what you can obtain foryourself in our public filings with the SEC. And we continue to execute on our strategy to drop-downassets into our Midstream MLP. We announced this morning that we had signed anonbinding letter of intent for Williams Partners to acquire an ownershipinterest in the limited liability company that owns the Wamsutter system fromWilliams for $750 million. Alan Armstrong will have more to say about thattransaction here in a few minutes.  We are delighted with the progress that has been made on thesale of Power. We have received substantially all consents, and we now expectto close the Power sale to Bear during November, and possibly as early as nextweek. And finally, with respect to the share repurchase, we areoff to a strong start, more than 7 million shares during the third quarter atan average purchase price of $31.40, which certainly feels even better todaythan it did at the time. We are committed to continue execution of the $1billion program the Board authorized. Turning to slide 7 which addresses our third quarterstrength; I think, the quarter was driven obviously by strong NGL margins. Weobviously took advantage of the Rockies basis anomaly, which createdextraordinary processing profits for Midstream, and our transportation andhedging strategy insulated E&P from the challenges that many Rockiesproducers suffered and continue to suffer as a result of the basis blowout. This highlights the fact that we have stressed many timesthat we are a Rockies producer, not a Rockies price-taker with just 7% ofproduction exposed to Rockies prices. Our E&P production outpaced year agothird quarter by 17%, and our new rates on Northwest and Transco continue todrive an increase in Gas Pipeline results. A couple of points on slide 8, which shows actual segmentprofit in 2005 and 2006, and forecasted full year segment profit for ‘07 and‘08. The expected uplift from the extraordinary pricing environment that we areexperiencing this year is the orange striped block at the top of the 2007 baron this chart. But even if you would normalize prices for 2007, we would stillend up with very impressive 15% growth compared to 2006 levels. Then we show the guidance range that we are forecasting in2008, and I would encourage you to please take a look in the appendix at asummary of our commodity price expectations that are reflected in this 2008guidance. Compared to our 2007 assumptions, we are expecting 2008 to havestronger natural gas prices in the Rockies andelsewhere, higher crude oil prices, but a lower crude to natural gas ratio,which of course drives our processing margins. With that, I will turn it over to Don.
Don Chappel:  Thanks, Steve. Good morning. Let's turn to slide number 10,Financial Results, and I will run through all of these very quickly. Focusingon the bottom line. Our key earnings measure, the recurring income from continuingops after mark-to-market adjustments on a per share basis, you can see theincrease there of $0.12 over the prior year, or 44%, and the same rate ofincrease, 44% on a year-to-year basis. Next slide please, number 11. This is on both a reported andrecurring basis. The non-recurring items are detailed on a slide in theappendix, as is the mark-to-market adjustment. Overall, segment profit aftermark-to-market adjustment is up $129 million, or 27%. E&P is up about 17%,consistent with our production increase. Midstream is up 29% on the expandedNGL margins, and Gas Pipeline is up 57% on the strength of that rate case.  Gas Marketing Services, which was formally a part of thePower segment, provides Gas Marketing transportation storage services to E&Pat Midstream, and manages certain contracts related to the former Powersegment. These former Power sales contracts will result in some earnings andmark-to-market volatility until such positions expire or are sold. Next slide please, number 13. On a year-to-date basis, againfocusing on the recurring results, segment profit after mark-to-marketadjustment of 1.721 billion; up nearly $400 million, or about 28%. I will turn it over to Ralph.
Ralph Hill:  Okay, Don, thank you. Let's turn to slide 14. Ouraccomplishments: production and profit are both up 17% compared to thirdquarter ‘06. Also reflected in these numbers were some pipeline maintenance andcurtailments that happened in the Rockies, whichdecreased our production by about 25 million a day. Without those maintenance and curtailments, production wouldhave been up about 20% year-over-year and about 5% sequentially, and that justsimply reflects the very tight Rockies pipeline network that's out there, whichis expected to improve in ‘08. Steve has already talked about that insulatingour transportation portfolio insulates our E&P volumes from the basisblowout. Turning to slide 15. This slide reflects our strongportfolio, and our ability to grow organically. As you can see on this slide,each of our larger investment areas have had very robust production growth. Inparticular looking at the Highlands growth, it does haveseasonal swings. So, although we're very pleased with the 25 million a day andup 98%, the growth is actually greater than that. And as we get into moreyear-round drilling, we will have more steady growth. But our currentproduction in the Highlands is up close to 40 million aday from this 25 million just reported for the third quarter. Slide 16, this again reflects our dual strength of prolificRockies reserves and production growth, which we can combine with our abilityto sell our gas away from the Rockies. The key on this slide is 7% is priced inthe Rockies, as Steve mentioned, which is in the middle of this slide. Our average net realized price after fuel use,transportation and hedge gain was $4.59. And that compares to the RockiesIndexes, as you see there on the bottom of the slide, of 2.90 and 2.90 forNorthwest and CIG. And those do not include fuel and shrink, so actually youcan see how much better we are doing because we are able to transport our gasaway from the Rockies to other areas. Slide 17, a guidance update. The difference in 2007 on theprofit side is purely prices. They are down from our last call, as you haveseen nationwide. Note our continued strong production growth offsets some ofthis pricing decrease. Our speed of development strategy is allowing us todrill more than planned, which is reflected in our capital increase in 2007,and also reflects a greater production growth.  For 2008, we are raising guidance in each of our categories.Our profit is up by 5%, capital is up by 17%, and production is up by 6%. Thisagain reflects our ability to turn capital investments rapidly into productionand profit. With that, I will thank our employees -- slide 18. I wouldlike to thank our employees for a great quarter and everything they do for us.And I will now turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong:  Thanks, Ralph. Starting here on slide 20. Our recurringsegment profit of $300 million for the second quarter of 2007 beat the previousquarterly record of 248 million reported in second quarter of '07. And thethird quarter 2007 margins were also a record of $0.62 per gallon, and this wasdriven by our Rockies margin, which actually reached$0.83 per gallon in September.  Additional profit [assessing] investments we have madecertainly paid off and have allowed us to maximize profitability. The key toour success in this area has been solid project management execution. Our teamstarted up our 350 million a day train at Opal on schedule, and within 10% ofbudget in February of '07. Having this project start up smoothly and on-timehas allowed us to realize these great margins. And it provided our customerswith the reliable service they bargained for to keep their Jonah and Pinedalevolumes flowing as promised.  We also have successfully integrated BASF's interest in theGeismar plant, which contributed nicely to our segment profit in this quarteras well, and progress has been made in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. ThePerdido Norte agreements were executed in the third quarter finally with theproducer. A lot of very complex issues to deal with there, and we are happy tohave that behind us.  Also in addition as of October 10th, agreements were signedto dedicate the Bass Lite gas reserves to our system. The Bass Lite is anothertie back to Devils Tower,and will restore some significant Deepwater revenues that we lost this year asother Deepwater volumes declined as expected. Moving on to slide 21. This graph shows the tracking ofmargins over the last five years. It also shows growth in our domestic NGLproduction. And in the light blue bar the amount of liquids we are producingfor our own account, excluding our Discovery and [Oxable] investments. An interesting data-point here is also the five-year averagemargin of $0.22. As you can see, we saw margins of almost three times theprevious 20 quarters in the third quarter. The environment that drove recordmargins during the third quarter is certainly alive and well in the fourthquarter; however, we are not planning on these in 2008 and beyond. Several factors have worked together to create thisextraordinary environment. First, the low gas prices in the Rockiescaused by infrastructure constraints and very successful drilling programs inthe Piceance, Uinta and Jonah, Pinedale basins. With the addition of new gastransportation capacity out of the Rockies in the near future, we do expect gasprices in Wyoming and Coloradoto return to historical norms.  Crude to gas ratio plays an important role as well. Sinceolefins producers have consistently chosen ethane over heavier feedstock, suchas naphtha, it is putting tremendous upward price pressure on ethane, propaneand some butanes. We anticipate some of this intense demand to be met by newprocessing plants in the Rockies and Barnett Shale thatare announced to come on in service in 2008.  Moving on to slide 22. Given the year-to-date results, coupledwith the strong margin environment outlook for the fourth quarter, we are proudto announce we have increased our 2007 segment profit from 700 to 850 million,to 950 to 1.125 -- I think, I like saying billions better there. So, we arereally excited about seeing this kind of increase. Similarly, we increased oursegment profit guidance for 2008, but moderately by 25 million at the midpoint. Capital spending for '07 remains unchanged at 650 to 700million; however, our 2008 capital guidance has been raised from 525 to 575 nowto 650 to 700 million. The increase is due primarily to an expansion of ourPerdido Norte project, new developments in our Canadian Oil Sandsopportunities, and several new expansion opportunities that are emerging in thedynamic Western region. The big driver in our 2007 to 2008 decline from ourprevious guidance forecast is a planned 350 million drop in NGL margins, drivenby higher natural gas prices. Also near 2007 in propane heavier prices are contemplatedhere, but we expect ethane prices to lower by approximately 20% during thisperiod. However, if we saw a repeat of 2007 in terms of NGL margins, we wouldexpect an approximate 5% increase in profits next year, due to growth projectlike Bass Lite and our investment in BASF's interest in Geismar. And these willbe partially offset by higher depreciation and O&M costs. Moving on to slide 23. Here we are providing areconciliation of the current guidance versus earlier guidance for 2007 and2008. First, I will explain the segment profit guidance changes. Of course, amajor factor increasing our segment profit guidance in both periods is NGLmargins. Our outlook for NGL margins increased from approximately $0.40 pergallon to $0.54 per gallon for full year 2007. In 2008, we have increased our margins by roughly $0.06 pergallon, reflecting the higher assumed commodity prices. Total year margin in2008 is forecast to be approximately $460 million or $0.32 per gallon. This isabout a dime per gallon above five-year average of $0.22 shown on the previousslide.  Also increasing segment profit guidance is higher margins inour olefins segment for both '07 and '08. This increase is driven primarily byhigher margins forecast at our Canadian facilities, driven by higher propaneand butylene mix margins. Propylene and ethylene are fairly flat in our olefinsbusiness. And the price forecast that we have in our olefins business is basedon the August 30th CMAI price forecast, if you track that. Increased costs in 2008 reflect higher operating expenseattributable primarily to additional overhauls being planned next year. Wecertainly have tried to limit any downtime on equipment this year with the highmargins that we have had, but we will be having to take equipment down in '08for overhauls. As well, we expect higher G&A costs required to handle thetremendous amount of new growth in the Canadian Oil Sands and Western regionthat is new to us now.  Lower volumes assumptions reflect the lower volume in theFour Corners where volumes were reduced by about 40 million per day, due to aless aggressive assumption about well connects. Now we are not saying that ourvolumes are actually lower year-to-year by 40 million, we are simply sayingthat from our previous guidance forecast it is lower. Some of the difficultiesout there that have caused us to back off a more aggressive forecast is someland issues on the Hickory Apache Nation, and an inability to get on some ofour producers to get on to some of the Forest Service lands. We also are projectingsome lower volumes in the Gulf Coast.Permian/Anadarko's, Boomvang and Nansen projects, which flow into our EastBreak system. On the capital guidance side, we also increased our GAAPcapital guidance a bit from our second quarter, primarily this was driven bythe Perdido Norte project. There we have got most of the increase, 40 million,the vast majority of that is covered, by rate adjusters that we have with ourcustomers out there, and we are set in place to cover things like increase inship construction costs and steel costs. We also have some new opportunities out in the Westernregion, and there are quite a few small projects that I won't list here. Moving on to the pie chart here, slide 24, this kind ofshows the backlog, if you will, the investment opportunities we have. LargeDeepwater projects and Rockies opportunities, especiallythe Willow Creek project, dominate the expansion capital and guidance for 2007and 2008. These new opportunities, along with an expanded time horizon, havecontributed to a $200 million increase in the in guidance pie. Specifically,the expenditures represented are for all projects started in 2007 through 2012,and include all projected expenditures for projects started during that timeline. So we have expanded the time horizon quite a bit here. The under negotiation pie range has remained steady. Themain differences involve the area in which the expenditures occur. Basically wehave got volumes -- sorry, some of the projects moving from the Deepwater andinto the TXP-IV expansion at Echo Springs, and our Canadian Oil Sands. The pie labeled in development and proposal reflects thetremendous amount of opportunities that we recently identified during ourfive-year long range planning process. Examples include adding a couple ofpotential Deepwater projects to this category, and adding several new CanadianOil Sands off-gas recovery projects. Capital range has changed from 700 million to 1.1 billion inthe second quarter call to now a range of 3 to 4 billion in this call. Andagain, one of the major impacts in this is the change, or the expanded timehorizon that we are looking at. You can see listed below there some of the significantprojects that are in guidance, and that we are currently working on. And youalso can see there a listing of the operating profit that we would expect toadd in the first full year of operations for those assets. To recap, we have increased our segment profit guidance for2007 and 2008, reflecting higher NGL and olefin margins and the addition of newopportunities. We, of course, are excited about reaching the $1 billion markfor segment profit this year. And I would remind you, we have not raised ourguidance in response to the most recent spike in crude oil prices. Third quarter 2007 has been another record quarter inseveral ways, including overall margins and Rockiesmargins in September and also recurring segment profit. Our team's execution ongetting Opal expanded and quickly started up this year has produced tremendousshareholder value. Our disciplined approach to capital investments has usproducing tremendous returns on capital invested that are unmatched by any ofour competitors. Again, it is important to note that market forces have cometogether in an unprecedented way to create the opportunity that we have seenhere in the third quarter, and we expect here in the fourth quarter as well. Inour numbers, we are not planning on a repeat of these conditions in 2008. We are very excited about our growth opportunities in severalof our key areas, as we have mentioned, and these projects will lay a strongfoundation for the future. Finally, we will win our share of these projectsbecause our customers do value the intense focus that our organizationcontinues to put on being the most reliable service provider in this sector. With that, I will turn it over to Phil.
Phil Wright:  As expected, with the affect of rate cases on NorthwestPipeline and Transco Pipeline, we have resumed flowing substantial free cashflow. Additionally, we are seeing the benefit of having arguably the bestpipeline franchises in North America, with an almostunprecedented level of both organic bolt-on type expansions and majorextensions of our existing footprint, and our people are doing a great job of workingwith our customers to position us in those projects. While I would enjoy doing so very much, I am not going todetail all of them. But you can see on the map on slide number 67 in yourappendix, they are many. I will hit a few highlights. Our Rockies Connector Pipeline open season closed October29th of this year. This new pipeline will connect the Rockies Express Pipeline,which terminates in Clarington, Ohio to Transco station 195 in Pennsylvania.The design capacity will be 688,000 dekatherms a day, with a target in-servicedate of November 2010. The open season resulted in bids in excess of theproject capacity. Negotiations of binding precedent agreements with shippersare underway.  Our Northeast Connector expansion open season will end November5th of this year. This project expands Transco's main line from station 195,the proposed interconnection with the Williams Rockies Connector Project toZone 6 markets, providing access to Rocky Mountainssupply. The earliest in-service date for that expansion would be November 2010,with a design capacity to be determined by market interest. Also for Transco this quarter, we concluded a successfulopen season for our Pascagoulaexpansion. This expansion is a 15 mile 26 inch lateral connecting the Gulf LNGClean Energy Import Terminal to the Mobile Bay lateral. This is a particularlysignificant project because it includes and fills up all of the unsubscribedcapacity from station 82 to 85. Florida Gas Transmission and Transco will eachhave an undivided interest in the jointly developed 15 mile pipeline. Transco'sshare of the capacity is 467,000 dekatherms a day with an anticipatedin-service date of October 2011. We received FERC approval for our Phase IV expansion onGulfstream. This expansion will provide 155,000 dekatherms a day of firmservice to Progress Energy's Bartow Power Plant in Pinellas County, Florida,and consists of a 17.5 mile 20 inch diameter pipeline connecting Gulfstream toBartow, along with 45,000 horsepower compression. Construction will beginJanuary of 2008 with all facilities ready for service January of 2009. Turning to the West, during the third quarter, the ColoradoHub Connection completed a successful open season. This project is a 28 milelateral from the Meeker Hub area to Northwest mainline near Sand Springs, Colorado. The projectis still subject to certain conditions, including obtaining the necessaryregulatory approvals for construction of the lateral. And the anticipatedin-service date is as early as November of 2009. And finally, Jordan Cove Energy Project LP and PacificConnector Gas Pipeline each filed applications with FERC to construct an LNGterminal and an interstate gas transmission system, respectively. This projectwill provide new LNG supplies to the Pacific Northwest, Northern California,and Northern Nevada. FERC approval is anticipated for fall of 2008 withoperations beginning fall of 2011. With that, I will turn it over to Don.
Don Chappel:  Thanks, Phil. Let's turn to slide number 29. This is our2007 and 2008 forecast EPS guidance, again focusing on the bottom line. We haveonce again increased our 2007 guidance at this point to $1.60 to $1.70 range,as well as for the first time provided guidance for 2008 at an EPS detaillevel, and that is $1.50 to $1.90. The key drivers of the change or increase would be theapproximate 15% production increase in E&P, lower NGL margins, withsubstantially higher Rockies natural gas prices,somewhat higher costs, the full year effect of the pipeline rate case, and thecontribution of some growth projects. Turning to the next slide please. This is segment profit.We've refreshed our guidance for 2007 as well as 2008. You can see the strongincrease in 2008 over 2007 for E&P, again on the strength of that productionincrease. Midstream, as Alan described, down somewhat as a result of aless extraordinary pricing environment with Rockies gas prices coming back to amore normal level, steady contribution from Gas Pipeline. And when we look atGas Marketing, I would like you to look at the last line in the page, andthat’s Gas Marketing after eliminating mark-to-market effects. And I thinkyou'll find that in 2008, excluding mark-to-market effects and anynon-recurring items associated with gains or loss on legacy positions that wemay choose to exit, should be above breakeven. Turn to the next slide, please. This graphic describessomewhat the natural gas price situation. This one is across our entireportfolio. And you can see the red line as the net position, so we are longnatural gas in the fourth quarter, and somewhat longer natural gas in 2008, asour E&P production grows somewhat and the hedges are lessened. And againthis is a point in time snapshot, and certainly those factors will changethroughout the year. The next slide depicts our Rockiesnatural gas exposure. And you can see in the fourth quarter, the red line wouldindicate that we're short natural gas in the fourth quarter. And by 2008, weare about even natural gas, about flat natural gas. And again what's changingis E&P production continues to increase and the amount hedged is decreasingsomewhat. Let me also note that some of the hedges that we have are collars, sothere is some movement within the price band. The next slide please, number 33, capital spending. Again,we've refreshed that guidance, as business unit leaders have described, as wemake additional investments in our core businesses. We continue to beopportunity rich and we intend to continue to seize value-adding organic growthopportunities that will continue to add value. The next slide please, number 34. I will focus my commentson a couple of lines here. Cash flow from operations relatively unchanged at2.050 billion to 2.3 this year, and 2.325 to 2.725 next year. Again as we havementioned, capital spending has increased as we capture additional projects.Therefore the operating cash flows, as we have defined it here, which is thedifference between cash flow from ops and capital expenditures, has changedsomewhat. And we would intend to fund the shortfall with equity proceedsassociated with drop-down transactions. And the debt proceeds raised in thosedrop-down transactions would be used principally for debt reduction, in orderto maintain our credit metrics at a level that will allow us to continue toimprove toward an ultimate goal of achieving investment grade ratings. Let me turn it to Steve.
Steve Malcolm:  Okay. Only two more slides. Slide number 36 shows ourearnings per share and share price performance over the last four years. And asshown here, our best-of-class suite of assets, our disciplined investment innumerous high return organic opportunities, and a favorable commodity priceenvironment have allowed Williams to grow earnings per share from $0.38 in 2004to more than $1.60 in 2007, while our share price has moved from below $10 tonear $37 this year. While I don't believe it would be prudent to expect theextraordinary processing margins to continue in 2008, we are neverthelesslooking forward to a strong year fueled by impressive natural gas productiongrowth, full year's rate impact on Northwest and Transco, and above historicalaverage processing margins. Slide 37, to summarize, again strong third quarterperformance. All of our businesses delivered in a major way leading to anincrease in full year earnings per share guidance of 18%. A prior version ofthis slide showed that growth of 14%. I apologize for that. We expect 2008 to be even better. In a pricing environmentthat is less robust than we have seen in 2007, we expect our E&Pdevelopment program to increase production by 15%. And you should expect us tocommit more capital to develop in an opportunity rich portfolio. We arepursuing additional value levers, executing on two MLP strategies. We expect the absence of our Power business to createadditional financial flexibility. And we're off to a strong start with respectto our share repurchase program. We believe the future of natural gas as apreferred fuel is bright, and believe Williams is well situated with its assetsand capabilities. With that, we will take questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) And our first question for todaycomes from Shneur Gershuni from UBS.
Shneur Gershuni - UBS: Hi. Good morning, guys. Just a couple of quick questions.Just I guess, if I could start with Ralph, you have mentioned in the past thatyou've got about 3,800 drilling locations in the Valley, and another 37potentials up top in the Highlands. I was wondering if there has been any development in thatrespect? Can we see a large step up in the number of drilling locations overthe next couple of months? Has there been significant progress and so forth?
Ralph Hill:  The question is, more locations, you mean? Is that what youwere asking?
Shneur Gershuni - UBS: Yes, exactly.
Ralph Hill:  No, not necessarily. What we have said before is that thoselocations, particularly in the Valley, were cut off on a lateral reach, if youwill, of about 2,000 feet.We have proven that we can go out near 3,000 feet on our reach, as ourdirectional reach is now, so ultimately, as we continue to do that and get morecomfortable at that, we would add locations to our portfolio. And then as for the Highlands, atthis point that's the same kind of technology going on up there, and we havenot been able to expand out as much. But again we have only drilled in -- Ithink we have 100 wells we have drilled in the Highlandsso far. We are drilling about another 80 or 90 this year. Expect to be over 100or so next year. So we continue to delineate, so it would be too early to sayif we could add additional locations to that.
Shneur Gershuni - UBS: Okay. And can you talk with respect to performance of therigs? Are you able to improve on your days of drill and so forth, in terms ofdrilling costs offsetting inflation and so forth? If you can just give somecomments on that.
Ralph Hill:  We feel that, like for example, the efficiency rigs, whichare the H&P rigs that we've brought in, are bringing us around on averageabout 20% improvement. Some rigs are much higher improvement versus the otherrigs in the same fleet, and we are working to make sure all of them get up tothe same level. But we would hope to be able to continue to do that. So a 20%increase in drilling efficiencies through the H&P rigs. We do have the four Nabors Sundowner rigs on now. And theyare just in the early stages of their life with us, and we expect the same kindor better improvements with that. So, our goal would be to continue to do that,but so far at least a 20% or so improvement over the field average, and wewould hope to do better than that as we continue.
Shneur Gershuni - UBS: Great. And if I could ask one last question, just withrespect to gas management. What is the duration of these contracts? I guess,what I am hitting at is when are we going to start to see an elimination of themark-to-market adjustments? Is it a couple of years away or is it much longerthan that?
Don Chappel:  We are very much focused on continuing to reduce that asquickly as possible. I think, we will be able to manage that down either in thefirst quarter or early next year to a level that is less troublesome.
Shneur Gershuni - UBS: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Lasan Johong from RBC CapitalMarkets.
Lasan Johong - RBCCapital Markets: Good morning. A couple of very quick questions. The 25million per day constraint in maintenance was that due to voluntary closures orinvoluntary closures?
Ralph Hill:  That was unplanned maintenance and some planned maintenance.Is that what you mean? 
Lasan Johong - RBCCapital Markets: Yes.
Ralph Hill: We did not in fact, if you will, shut in, but we were shutin due to either planned maintenance. And anytime the Rockies are so tightright now even a planned maintenance will backup gas in the Rockies,and certainly an unplanned maintenance would do the same thing.
Lasan Johong - RBCCapital Markets: So, part of it was planned and part of it was unplanned?
Ralph Hill:  It wasn't by us. Obviously, it was by the pipelinetransporters out of the region. We are just the shipper on a number of thosepipes. But some of it is scheduled on normal maintenance or tie-ins or whateverby pipes, and some of it is just they will have a disruption.
Lasan Johong - RBCCapital Markets: I see. Next year you are projecting both an increase inproduction and drilling activity for the E&P segment. What's driving that?Is that just looking at pricing and saying, wow, prices are at 850 or 860 now.It looks good, so let's go out and drill more, or is this driven by just biggerand better and a more powerful pool of opportunities, and you are just tryingto cull your best out of them, and you just happen to land with these numbers?
Ralph Hill:  It’s really driven by our ability to continue to do thingsbetter in our efficiencies. We expect to have the same number of rigs running,for example, in the Piceance Valleyand the Piceance Highlands,but we expect that we can continue to be more efficient, and thus drive downour time of drilling and thus drill more wells.
Lasan Johong - RBCCapital Markets: Can we read more into this than what you are just tellingus, i.e., is this saying that your basket of potential inventory has increased?
Ralph Hill:  No, not at this time. I think, the inventory is still veryprolific and large. It's just that we have a number of locations to get to, asyou all know, and what we have been trying to do all along is to continue to dothat faster, and in an efficient manner and a safe manner. And each year ourteam does a little bit better, it saves a little bit of time on various aspectsof the drilling and completion program. And thus as we get better, especiallywith the number of rigs we have and operate now that allows us to drill morewells.
Lasan Johong - RBCCapital Markets: Okay. What’s your exit rate for the fourth quarter, or whatdo you expect the exit rate for the fourth quarter?
Ralph Hill:  I don't think I can give that at this time, because it's aforward-looking rate. But we had strong growth all three quarters, and weexpect to continue to grow.
Lasan Johong - RBCCapital Markets: Okay. So we can make some inference from that, I suppose?
Ralph Hill:  Well, we have been very successful, so I would guess that weare still drilling very rapidly in the basins.
Lasan Johong - RBCCapital Markets: Okay. Kinder Morgan and Sempra Energy announced that theyare going to do an open season to extend the Rockies Express Pipeline all theway to Princeton, New Jersey. Do you feel that that might conflict with whatyou guys are trying to do with the Rockies Connector?
Phil Wright:  Well, clearly that's in the same quarter, and it wouldenvision -- by the way, this is Phil Wright responding to you -- it wouldenvision serving the producers out of the Rockies andthe markets to the East. We continue to believe that we have a very cost effectiveproject and very cost effective things that we can do downstream of station 195for expansions and present the market with quality alternatives there toconsider. And so, yes, it's a competing project in that sense, but westill believe we have a strong project. And as I said earlier, the bid responseto our open season exceeded the capacity, so we are feeling pretty good.
Lasan Johong - RBCCapital Markets: Thank you very much.
Operator:  And our next question comes from Carl Kirst from CreditSuisse.
Carl Kirst - CreditSuisse: Good morning, everybody, and congratulations on anotherstrong quarter here. Just a few one-off questions, the first going back to theshut-ins on the E&P. Ralph, are we seeing the same type of shut-ins here inthe fourth quarter, i.e., is this coming from Cheyenne or is this from otherissues that should be expected again?
Ralph Hill:  Well, we have seen some, and obviously the disruption at Cheyennewas one thing, but at this point it's too early to tell if it's going to be thesame level. But clearly the capacity out is tied until REX is done. And anykind of maintenance or even small disruption will back gas up into the Rockies. So it's kind of an ongoing thing. It has been going reallymost of the year, second and third and fourth quarter. We just thought we wouldtalk about it a little bit in the third quarter because even though ourproduction growth was great at 17% production growth, it would have beenslightly higher, but we were curtailed. So obviously, we are anxiously waitingfor the Rockies Express to kick in.
Carl Kirst - CreditSuisse: Was it a similar amount in the second quarter then?
Ralph Hill:  No, not as much, I don't recall what it was, but there wassome in the second quarter also.
Carl Kirst - CreditSuisse: Okay. Fair enough. Don, Alan, looking at the Midstream, andspecifically with respect to risk management, I know you have got the oil pricerange out there for your 2008 guidance, but at the same time we are looking at[Calloway stripped] at around $88. And there are some concern maybe the firsthalf of '08 we might see some weaker oil prices. Is there any attraction, I guess, towards actually doingsome dirty hedges with respect to oil or if liquid enough going out moreaggressively locking in liquids prices?
Alan Armstrong:  I will speak to the liquids price issue. I will let Don takeon the dirty hedge question there. How is that? On the NGL prices there aresome very attractive prices offered, as you probably know if you follow that. There are very steep discounts, particularly if you get intothe long dated. Get beyond about six months, and you really start to see thespread or the relationships between crude and those NGLs to fall offdramatically. I will tell you that we did a small hedge last year; we havea small hedge on now, and we have continued to lose somewhere about 10% belowmarket on those hedges, even though we thought those were really great priceswhen we put them on. So the good news is on the gas side we have got thatcovered. I think, it's a great question for us on crude oil, especially giventhe recent spike. And I will tell you that we are following the NGL priceofferings very closely and have been looking at a lot of bids coming in onthat, particularly in the first six months of next year. I will turn the crudequestion over to Don.
Don Chappel:  Carl, a good question. It is one that we look at regularly.Some of the consideration, well, one is if we had hedged we would have missed alot of the upside. Two, it is a dirty hedge, and certainly there is somepotential of lack of economic alignment there that could cause a loss, as wellas potentially lock in a profit. There are liquidity issues. Certainly hedginga substantial amount of oil would require a lot of liquidity to support that,and then you get to the accounting issues. So to date, we have chosen not to. It's something wecontinue to look at. But I can't give you any guidance as to whether or not wewill find it to be attractive in the future. To date, we have chosen not to doit.
Carl Kirst - CreditSuisse: Fair enough. And then, lastly and I will get back into queueafter this. Don, with respect to Gas Marketing, I guess, I'm looking for alittle more color on, absent the mark-to-market or excluding the mark-to-marketlosses, what predominately was causing that cash marketing loss? I mean is thatstill part of the legacy position? And kind of as a corollary, are the reasonwhy you are going to kind of a neutral position in '08 going back to a priorcomment you said because hopefully we are going to manage this exposure down inthe first quarter, I mean is that what gives us confidence to getting to a neutralor positive in '08?
Don Chappel:  First I will answer. I just mentioned that the accountingrules didn't allow us to put all of the positions that were associated with theformer Power segment into discontinued operations, despite the fact that theyreally weren't positions that we would expect to continue. So, we have something that feels like discontinuedoperations up in the Gas Marketing segment. So some of the positions, we wouldexpect to exit at a gain or loss and that we're taking steps to exit some ofthose positions, which would take out some of the -- both the drag on earningsas well as the cash impact. Beyond that, I think, if we really think about the businessgoing forward, again it's principally in support of E&P and Midstream,providing a service, marketing, transportation and storage and over the longhaul we would expect that to be breakeven or better. We do take storage positions from time to time where we willput gas in storage, and in many cases sell it forward, lock in a profit. Buteven in that case, the lower of cost or market accounting rules, if there is adecline in the market value, it requires to mark it down. And if the pricescome back, we can't mark it back up. So we are dealing with that. But again Ithink longer-term we expect this to be a business that's breakeven or better.
Carl Kirst - CreditSuisse: And the other aspect of the question, as you guys look tomanage or sell down some of these legacy positions, as you are looking at ittoday or post the most recent mark-to-market. On a net-net basis are thosepositions meaningful, material or is it something that's below $50 million thatjust needs to be gone?
Don Chappel:  I would say it could be above $50 million, but certainly Iwouldn't expect it to be all that significant. And again, I think, when wetalked about the overall gain or loss associated with exiting the Power segmentbusiness, we indicated that the overall gain and loss was not expected to besignificant. We still view these positions that -- our legacy positionsto be part of that overall exiting of the Power segment. So we are required toaccount for it in separate buckets, but we view it much, much the same.
Carl Kirst - CreditSuisse: Great, Very helpful. Thanks, guys.
Operator:  Our next question comes from [Ken Snyder] from Citigroup.
Faisel Khan -Citigroup: It's actually Faisel Khan from Citi. Good morning. On theMidstream volumes, can you just remind us again what the breakdown is ofkeep-whole POP and POL grouped together in fee-based volumes?
Don Chappel:  Faisel, are you wanting to know that on a volumetric basis?
Faisel Khan -Citigroup: On a volumetric basis.
Don Chappel:  Volumetric basis. I don't have that detail right here infront of me. I can give you a rough breakdown of it. The majority of ourkeep-whole exposure is in the Rockies. In fact, probably looking at our gasvolumes, our shrink volume is the best way to look at that.
Faisel Khan -Citigroup: Okay.
Don Chappel:  And we have about total MMbtu consumption on the Midstreamside is about 400 million a day roughly. That includes Discovery and ourolefins business as well.
Faisel Khan -Citigroup: Okay.
Don Chappel:  And about 65% of that fuel and shrink is in the Rockies…
Faisel Khan -Citigroup: Got it.
Don Chappel:  -- with the vast majority of that being at our Opalfacility. Opal is very heavily weighted to keep-whole, Wamsutter is morebalanced to fee-based. And in the San Juan Basin about 15% of our fuel andshrink is consumed in that area. And in the San Juan Basin that mix is about 71% of ourcontract mix is either processing fee or gathering fee, and the balance iskeep-whole, and split about 50-50 between keep-whole and percent-of-liquids.
Faisel Khan -Citigroup: Okay.
Don Chappel:  And then the balance of our fuel and shrink is in the GulfCoast region, and about 40% of our business in the Gulf Coast is fee-based, andthe balance being split between percent-of-liquids and keep-whole.
Faisel Khan -Citigroup: Okay. And then in terms of your new facilities coming onlineand new contracts you are signing with customers, what is the breakdown of thetype of contracts you are signing in terms of fee-based versus commodityexposed contracts?
Don Chappel:  We continue to shift contracts to fee-based. For instance,our Cameron Meadows facility is now 100% fee-based. And we continue to do that,as producers see the value in the upgrade, and are willing to pay us a lothigher fee-based contract. So, in this kind of environment, we are generally shiftingto fee-based contracts, just because they are perceived as valuable by ourcustomers.
Faisel Khan -Citigroup: Okay. And in terms of your NGL customers, are you seeing anyslowdown in consumption of your liquids volumes to those customers that arechemical or refining customers?
Don Chappel:  No, and in fact, if you look at what data is available as toNGL storage, [light in] storage, that has been getting drawn on pretty hard.Ethylene cracking capacity is way up. Of course, we have a good bird's eye viewof that from running our ethylene cracker there in the olefins business atGeismar, so we understand the demands on that side. And there are very strong pulls in the ethylene andpropylene markets right now. And of course with crude oil being where it is,the heavier products like naphtha that might be cracked are just way tooexpensive, and so ethane and propane are the desired feedstocks, and there isreally a strong pull on that.
Faisel Khan -Citigroup: Got you. On your E&P activities, is there any update onany of your exploration activities in the Paradox or anywhere else?
Ralph Hill:  Several updates I could give you. First in the Barcus Creekarea, which is the northern part of the Highlands, we are drilling our fifthwell. And as soon as that well reaches TD, we will have earned the 11,000additional net acres. In the Paradox, three vertical wells have been drilled todate, with our fourth well is currently going to spud by the end of the year.And we are still evaluating the wells and the results, and so we are workingthrough that new area, but also drilling ahead. In the Piceance, we also have added a second well to what weare calling a deep well test. And this is to test what’s called the Cozzette,Corcoran and Mancos test. And we are in our second well there. We believe thatthat could have a deeper pool of reserves below the Williams Fork, so we aredrilling our second well there. And In Uinta, we are drilling our first well there, and weare drilling ahead -- just started about a week or so ago. So quite a bitactivity there, and that’s part of the reason why you saw the update in capitalexpenditures for exploration. We are moving ahead on all of our projects that Ihave been talking about for the last couple of calls.
Faisel Khan -Citigroup: The Uinta Basin, is that a new acreage position that youguys picked up or is that a legacy position?
Ralph Hill:  It is a new acreage position we have been picking up overthe last year and a half, a couple of years, and we have established a prettysolid block of acreage there. And it’s still way too early to tell, but it wastime to start testing it, and we are drilling our first well there.
Faisel Khan -Citigroup: How many acres do you guys have there?
Ralph Hill:  About 74,000, 75,000 net acres.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay.
Ralph Hill:  It's similar to our position in the Piceance Valley…
Faisel Khan -Citigroup: Right.
Ralph Hill:  -- in total net acreage.
Faisel Khan -Citigroup: Okay. And on the Barnett, I think you guys, probably saidyou tripled production year-over-year, is that correct?
Ralph Hill:  That is correct.
Faisel Khan -Citigroup: What is the potential of the position you guys have there, Imean, what -- is it fair to say we could continue to see a sort of growth givenyour inventory or…?
Ralph Hill:  Well, obviously, the base volume will continue to go up. Butour inventory is well over a 100 locations as we speak now, and that couldincrease substantially with some, if you will, down spacing that’s going on inthe basin. We have actually five rigs operating now. We intend to beoperating in the four to five -- probably more like the four rig level. And wehave more locations that we are trying to secure as we speak on. There's a lotof deal flow from the -- smaller deal flow in that area. So I think, we couldcontinue to see good growth in the Barnett.
Faisel Khan -Citigroup: Okay. And then on your -- in terms of picking up morepipeline capacity out of the Rockies, I think, I saw that you picked up maybe-- is it 100 million cubic feet a day to SoCal, is that new or is that old?
Ralph Hill:  Well, that is a current position that it's been usedsomewhat in the Power side of the business, so we have picked up. And that isnew in the sense that we are now moving gas to Southern Californiaon Kern, and that will be part of our portfolio. And obviously, it’s a verygood pricing point for us.
Faisel Khan -Citigroup: So you were able to bring over the Kern Rivercapacity that was at the marketing business into your lease capacity?
Ralph Hill:  Yes, we were.
Faisel Khan -Citigroup: Was there anything else that came out of that portfolio thatyou guys are deciding to keep?
Ralph Hill:  On the transportation side, we had already workedproactively with Bill's Power Group, so the rest of that was already in our, ifyou will, in the Williams family, and we were already utilizing it.
Faisel Khan -Citigroup: Okay. Thanks. And on the pipeline side, the higher thanexpected earnings for the year in pipelines versus what you had in lastquarter, is that a result of the stipulation agreement you guys entered into onthe pipeline side, or is there something else that I am missing?
Steve Malcolm:  I'm sorry, stipulation agreement?
Faisel Khan -Citigroup: I think you guys talked about a stipulation with yourcustomers that you entered into on Transco.
Steve Malcolm:  Rate case. Largely up on the rate case and also someeffective cost control measures.
Faisel Khan -Citigroup: Okay. Do you have any sort of CapEx or potential projectcost for these open seasons that you have outstanding?
Don Chappel:  We have detailed the ones that we can detail in theexhibits, Faisel.
Faisel Khan -Citigroup: Okay. And then on the accounting and finance side. Your cashtax rate, I think, next year goes up to 35%. Is that a function of your NOL,you have kind of used up all your NOLs?
Don Chappel:  In terms of the cash tax rate, I think, it was more afunction of some of the nondeductible items that went through income in thepast. So again, the permanent differences that we have are relatively few. So, it’s really more about the statutory rate adjusted forany nondeductible in terms of the provision, in terms of the actual cash taxes,yes, the absence of the NOL, or the fact that the NOL has been used up wouldcause that to rise sharply.
Faisel Khan -Citigroup: Do you guys have a number in terms of how many shares yourepurchased in October, I saw the September and August numbers, but…?
Don Chappel:  They were no additional shares repurchased during the monthof October.
Faisel Khan -Citigroup: Okay. Thank you for the time, gentlemen, I appreciate it.
Operator:  And we will hear next from Sam Brothwell from Wachovia.
Sam Brothwell -Wachovia: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Can you hear me?
Don Chappel:  Yes.
Sam Brothwell -Wachovia: I’m sorry. Ralph, you mentioned something about you pickedup some acreage in the Uinta, is that in Colorado or Utah?
Ralph Hill:  That’s actually in Utah.
Sam Brothwell -Wachovia: It’s in Utah. And you are targeting Mancos?
Ralph Hill:  Well, actually we are targeting -- no, in that area we arebasically targeting what would be equivalent of what we drill for in thePiceance, which is the Williams Fork Formation.
Sam Brothwell -Wachovia: Okay. But I heard you say something about Mancos in there, Imust have gotten?
Ralph Hill:  That was in the Piceance. We are drilling deeper in the Piceance Valley…
Sam Brothwell -Wachovia: Got you.
Ralph Hill:  -- targeting a couple -- we are on our second well, which isevaluating the potential that we may or may not have, and it goes from theWilliams Fork Formation, also known as the Mesaverde formation, down into theCozzette, Corcoran and then Mancos.
Sam Brothwell -Wachovia: Got it. Okay. And then as you look at going forward, I havebeen hearing a lot about there is a need for additional clearly takeaway, takecapacity from the Rockies. Do you see the greater opportunity going westbound,or still eastbound, or both, can you comment on that? And Phil, to the extent that there is a need for another bigpipe East out of the Rockies, would you guys look atdoing something major in that regard?
Ralph Hill:  This is Ralph. I think there is need for additionalcapacity, as you have probably seen from all the other producers talking aboutthat and others. So, I think that possibly an opportunity to go to the West isa good idea. And then to continue to expand, as we have all seen theability to go to the East, whichever way that actually -- Northeast or and theSoutheast is also a good opportunity. So, I think the good idea is or neat ideais that several pipelines are talking about those kind of things. And we lookforward to hopefully a couple of those actually happening.
Phil Wright:  Sam, this is Phil. Clearly to the extent that some of thosemake economic sense for us, we are going to be out there aggressively pursuingthem.
Sam Brothwell -Wachovia: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator:  And next we’ll hear from Robert Lane from SMH Capital.
Robert Lane - SMH Capital: Good morning, guys. I know you have already touched on this,but I just want to dig a little deeper into the Rockies Connector Pipelineversus Kinder Morgan's proposed pipeline. I know you all said you had beenvastly oversubscribed on the deal. But their announcement had come pretty muchwhen your open season was over. Is this the type of deal, if you take a look at your'scapacity and their's capacity, when you add them together it's pretty much wellover capacity for what is going to be coming through on that pipeline. Is thisthe kind of deal where you all might downsize a bit, or is it also the kind ofdeal where you would partner with Kinder Morgan and try to bring that gas East?
Phil Wright:  This is Phil again. I don't know that I would use the wordvastly oversubscribed, but we were oversubscribed. I think, we have the rightsize pipe. I think, we have, for the timeframe in which the market wants to seethat capacity there. We think that the shippers have sort of spoken as a marketas to when they would like to see the capacity and in what quantity. Andthere’s your observation that with both pipes there might be an overcapacitysituation in that quarter if both of them got built, is an accurate one. And whether or not we would do something with Kinder Morganis just a question out there. I personally would think we are going to proceedwith our project -- as we go to precedent agreements we would probably justproceed.
Robert Lane - SMH Capital: Okay. Do you also have a time -- and I think you all mighthave mentioned this, and I apologize because I had to jump off the call at onepoint. Do you have sort of a timing at when you are looking to lock down abinding open season?
Phil Wright:  Well as I said, we are working on it as we speak, and wehope to have those concluded by the end of the year.
Robert Lane - SMH Capital: Okay. Thanks so much. 
Operator:  And next we’ll go to [Gabriel Bradar from KStreet Capital].And Mr. [Bradar], your line is open.
Gabriel Bradar -KStreet Capital: Hello. Can you hear me?
Don Chappel:  Yes. 
Phil Wright:  Yes. 
Gabriel Bradar -KStreet Capital: Okay. Just a quick question on the '08 guidance, can youjust talk to the jump in corporate and other costs? I think, it's going up bylike 80 or 90 million?
Don Chappel:  That includes minority interest associated with drop-downtransactions. So you saw we announced the Wamsutter drop-down, it will beassociated with that.
Gabriel Bradar -KStreet Capital: Okay. Thank you.
Operator:  Next we’ll go to [Mark Arbarsebi] from PIMCO.
Mark Arbarsebi -PIMCO: Hello. Can you hear me?
Don Chappel:  Yes.
Mark Arbarsebi -PIMCO: Hey, there. Thanks. Just a quick question here on yourguidance. It looks like CapEx obviously up. Free cash flow is going to be downa bit from prior guidance. And it looks like negative free cash flow for theyear for '08 guidance. Is that right?
Don Chappel:  That's correct and that’s by design. I think in our priorguidance, we included only the capital projects that we had a high level ofconfidence on. And always we had disclosed that it was our goal to drill evenfaster, as well as to capture the many projects that both Midstream and GasPipelines have in front of them. So, you should have and should continue toexpect capital spending to increase somewhat as we capture those additional value-addingopportunities. So, yes.
Mark Arbarsebi -PIMCO: Just a quick question here then on the credit profile.Obviously, you guys have done a great job and everything. I am just wonderingwhen the Power book is sold, when you close the Power deal this month, are yougoing to be making a stronger push to get to investment grade with theagencies, maybe going back and meeting with them, talking about Power bookbeing gone, or is there something maybe you are going to push out, given what Iam looking at here on free cash flow and so on?
Don Chappel:  We meet with the agencies every quarter. We will meet withthem again following this call. And we are constantly keeping them posted onour activities and our plans. And, yes, we would be hopeful of ratings action,but it's up to the agencies.
Mark Arbarsebi -PIMCO: Are you thinking it's a definite goal of the company and theBoard to at some point be investment grade, or is it not really an explicitgoal you guys have in mind, I guess, given that you have opportunities outthere?
Don Chappel:  Well, the number one goal is to drive equity value up on asustainable basis faster than our peers. So that's the overarching goal. Wethink that having stronger credit would help us achieve that goal, in thatavailability of capital is more reliable, the cost of that capital is somewhatlower. And we can be more opportunistic to seize the opportunitiesahead. So we think a stronger credit rating, investment-grade rating isworthwhile, but the overarching goal is to drive sustainable and superiorequity value.
Mark Arbarsebi -PIMCO: Okay. And that would be great. That's helpful. Hey, thanksagain. Thanks for your time. 
Don Chappel:  Thanks you.
Operator:  We will now take a follow-up question from Carl Kirst from CreditSuisse.
Carl Kirst - CreditSuisse: Sorry, guys, just two quick follow-ups, and I appreciate thetime. The first is on the other Wamsutter transaction, the WPZ, it was notedthat we were looking around $41 million of EBITDA for the first half of theyear. Can that be broken out between how much is fee-based versus how much iscommodity sensitive?
Don Chappel:  Well first, I will remind you that first and second quarterswere not all that -- that's not where we saw the anomaly, if you will, inmargins.
Carl Kirst - CreditSuisse: Correct.
Don Chappel:  But we will be providing some detail on that as we gothrough the process. I hate to get ahead of ourselves in providing some detailthat somebody might rely on or take out of context. I think, we will wait untilwe have put that detail in writing. 
Carl Kirst - CreditSuisse: Okay. But it is fair to say that given that it has aprocessing facility, it's not 100% fee-based? 
Don Chappel:  That is correct. It is not 100% fee-based.
Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse: Okay. Fair enough. And then just last question, Ralph. Inthe appendix, you guys have sort of annotated your cash costs around roughlythe 2.05 million mark LOE, etcetera, etcetera. Can you actually break that outon a component basis, if possible?
Ralph Hill:  Yes, I can.
Carl Kirst - CreditSuisse: And if you don't have it, we can follow up offline.
Ralph Hill:  I've got it, I think. Real quick, let me just check onething. Roughly LOE was in the approximately $0.69 range; gathering, 57;operating taxes about 44, 45; and then G&A in the $0.36 range or so. Thatmight not quite add to 2.05, but it would be close.
Carl Kirst - CreditSuisse: That’s very helpful. Thanks, guys.
Ralph Hill:  Okay.
Operator:  We’ll take our last question today from Rick Gross fromLehman Brothers.
Rick Gross - LehmanBrothers: Hi. Good morning. A couple of quick questions on theE&P; one of the areas that plateaued or has plateaued for a while is the Powder River. I know, we have had the Medicine Bow lateral, and it's goingto create some more outlets. Obviously, it gets you to a restricted point until RockiesExpress takes off. You've had some water handling problems. But is it basicallythat kind of mechanical issue, not so much drilling inventory that hasflattened that production profile out there?
Ralph Hill:  Well, our production profile -- we were up 11%, but I thinkI see what you are saying.
Rick Gross - LehmanBrothers: I am looking at the last three quarter at plus or minus 165million a day.
Ralph Hill:  Right, I think what you see in there is our production hasthe capability, and currently it is much higher than that. And what is going onis there was an expansion by Fort Union Gas Gathering that needed to occur thatis finally in place here in the first part of October or was in place in thefirst part of October. And that has allowed the -- really the constraint was inthe gathering system for our volumes to take off, and improve quite a bit overthat. 
Rick Gross - LehmanBrothers: Okay.
Ralph Hill:  So it has not been a – it's clearly not the wellperformance, nor the number of locations, it has been the ability to get it outof the gathering and FUGG as they call it, Fort Union Gas Gathering, has takenoff, and completed their expansion.
Rick Gross - LehmanBrothers: Okay. And you mentioned -- you didn't give a quantity in theSan Juan. That also has been an area where you have come off the peak. And Iwas just curious as to what the volume was there, because you said it had comeoff because of some maintenance and some other things going on once again inthe gathering systems there.
Ralph Hill:  We had volumes that are still in the 150 million a dayrange, so they have remained relatively flat. They have gone as high a fewtimes in the 155, 160 range, but still in the 150 or so range as we speak inthe fourth quarter.
Rick Gross - LehmanBrothers: Okay. A different subject. Don indicated that you arerunning through the NOLs and your cash tax rates are going up. How are you guyshandling your IDCs for tax purposes? I am curious as the budget goes up why youwouldn't be sheltering more of your cash taxes?
Don Chappel:  I would say we are sheltering all that is available to us.Rick, and we can provide some additional comments offline on that.
Rick Gross - LehmanBrothers: Okay.
Don Chappel:  That’s it. Thank you.
Operator:  That does conclude the question-and-answer session fortoday. At this time, I will turn it back over to our speakers for anyadditional or closing remarks.
Steve Malcolm:  Yeah. I appreciate your questions today. And we aredelighted with our third quarter results and looking forward to a very brightfuture. Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference. We thank you forjoining, and have a great day.

Slide number two and three, titled Forward Looking Statements, detailed various risk factors and uncertainties related to future outcomes, please review the information on those slides.  Also, slide number four, Oil and Gas Reserves Disclaimer is also very important and we urge you to read that slide as well. Also, included in the presentation today are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to generally accepted accounting principles.  Those schedules follow the presentation and are an integral part of the presentation. So with that, I'll turn it over to Steve Malcolm. 
Steve Malcolm: Thanks Travis. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. We certainly appreciate your interest in our company and as Travis mentioned in keeping with our last few earnings calls we have a relatively short slide deck and so we should be able to mow this through our presentation pretty quickly this morning.  By almost any measure we had an outstanding second quarter and our core natural gas businesses delivered very strong performances all across the board. The highlights of the quarter are shown on slide 6. At $0.43 our key performance measure that being adjusted recurring earnings per share is nearly 50% better than a year ago.  We have updated our earnings outlook for 2007 to reflect the strong results to date and our confidence that our businesses will continue to deliver.  Our results demonstrate the value of our integrated natural gas businesses. Higher NGL margins fuel record midstream segment profit and margins are at historic highs again and we are very well position to benefit.  We enjoyed higher production volumes and higher prices in EMP which translated into a 75% increase in segment profit. Production is up 20%, and we are nearing the one BCF a day milestone. For those of you who thought we might suffer from basis differential in the Rockies and certainly many of you ask questions as I was out the early part of this year that seem to be a consistent concern and worry. It should be very good news to hear that our average net realized price in the U.S. last quarter was $5.39, net up 29% over a year ago.  And as Ralph Hill will describe later in the presentation, although most of our production is from Rocky Mountain basins, specifically Piceance and Powder River only about 7% of our production is priced in the Rockies.  And lastly, new rates showing affect on both Northwest and Transco pipelines and we have some wonderful news to talk about today Transco and its customers have reached an agreement in principle on all substantive issues on that rate case. And so the next step in that rate case will be to file a formal agreement and receive approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. As you recall Northwest filed its rate case agreeing with the FERC in January this year.  Turning to slide 7 please, and while we are delivering robust earnings performance, we are also focused on executing on a number of other measures design to deliver value to our shareholders. On May 21st, we announced an agreement to sale our power assets to Bare Energy. We continue to expect that transaction to close before at the end of the year.  Just two weeks ago, we announced plans to create a new publicly traded master limited partnership to own interstate natural gas pipeline assets and I have a couple of points about the plant MLP.  First, you should note that the guidance numbers we are providing today don't assume an MLP is formed and so we would expect to update our guidance once we complete such transaction. The second point, I need to make about the plant MLP is that we are not allowed under SEC rules to say anything more than what we have already announced. We are in a quiet period. That being the case, we won't be taking any questions about the MLP, about the new MLP or respond any request for additional information at this time. We appreciate your understanding and patience on this matter. The planned gas pipeline MLP would be complimentary to our existing very successful midstream MLP.  We have built a very strong track record with Williams partners drop down $1.6 billion worth of assets, last year. And we remained focused on our commitment to drive growth in Williams partners through a combination of drop downs, third party acquisitions and organic growth.  Just two weeks ago, we also announced that our board authorized a program to buyback up to $1 billion of our stock. We are excited that, with our earnings news out to the public today will soon be in a position to begin executing on our repurchase program.  However, this is another topic where our public announcement provided all the information we can share at this time. Clearly, we are excited about the stock repurchase program but we aren't in a position today to provide additional information or respond questions about our plans.  Finally, I want to highlight the abundance of value creating growth opportunities within our businesses. In each of the next two year,s we plan to invest at least $1.3 billion to develop our low-risk high-return natural gas reserves. Couple that with the growth projects in midstream like Perdido Norte, Blind Faith, Willow Creek emerging Canadian opportunities and expansions on all of our interstate natural gas pipeline systems and you can appreciate just how bright our future is, we are truly opportunity rich. And so with that introduction I will turn it over to Don. 
Don Chappel: Thanks Steve and good morning. We are delighted to report these strong results and we are delighted with the performance of our business. I will be focusing my attention on recurring results from continuing operations, but before I dive into that I would like to note something regarding discontinued operations, if we could turn to the next slide page number 9.  Again the results from discontinued operations largely are from our power segment. We have recorded a substantial gain this quarter as we reclassified previously deferred mark-to-market a fact under hedge accounting from OCI to income as we noted in our prior press release when we announced the transaction we indicated that we expected the gain and loss to be in significant that still our view. So, we would expect offsetting losses as the deal is closed. So, I'd just like to note that for you before we dive into the rest of this presentation.  Let's now focus on our key earnings measure on that strips out non-recurring items as well as mark-to-market effects, and that's at the bottom of this schedule and that's the $0.43 versus $0.29 a year ago again up nearly 50% so around a year-to-date basis $0.74 versus $0.52 a year ago or up 42%.  The next slide page number 10. This slide just details the non-recurring items which are fairly modest in size, I would note that there is also a tax effect, there was a tax provision was adjusted this quarter deemed to be non-recurring that's so for information.  The next slide page number 11. This walks us through the mark-to-market adjustment again reversing forward unrealized mark-to-market losses totaling $61 million in the quarter. Adding back realized gains from mark-to-market previously recognized totaling 8 gets us to $69 million add back pre-tax. $26 million tax effect for $43 million second quarter adjustment and again we would expect that the mark-to-market effects would diminish sharply, as we close the power sale and we become relatively small by 2008.  The next slide please, number 12, second quarter segment profit. I will focus my comments on the recurring to details of the non-recurring items were just reviewed as well as they are available in our appendix. First let me focus on the first subtotal, you can see the $617 million recurring segment profit as compared to the $442 for our three core businesses is improved by about 40% year-over-year. And the second major total segment profit after mark-to-market adjustments is $625 million is up a $167 million or 36% year-over-year. We'll dive into some of the details right now.  E&P at $209 million is up75% from a year ago having increased its daily U.S. and international production to $945 million cubic feet per day an increase of 20% versus a second quarter of '06. Note that U.S. average daily production totaled $898 MCF a day an increased by nearly 22% over the same period last year.  Net realized price average $5.39 up 29% from '06, and up slightly from the first quarter. Our transportation contracts to move gas out of Rockies and our financial hedges enabled us to once again achieve superior pricing for our gas and Ralph will talk about this and some detail during his presentation.  On year-to-date basis, overall daily average production was up 22% and net realized price increased 21%. Our Midstream business have an extraordinary quarter with $250 million in segment profit up from $199 million last year. Midstream once again delivered these very, very strong results and results to our higher than our prior forecast. The principle driver was higher net liquid margins in the West or combination of high NGL prices and lower natural gas cost produced these extraordinary margins.  Note that while low natural gas prices in the West had a minor effect on E& P results, as result of the transportation and financial hedges that were implies below natural gas prices in the West, who are very beneficial to Midstream.  Other factors in our second quarter results included $9 million higher olefins margins and $12 million lower deepwater gathering and production handling, as production declined somewhat, until the next better suppliers attached and that is as expectant. Overall operating expenses were steady, on year-to-date basis Midstream was $396 million up 15%.  Let's focus now on gas pipelines. Gas pipeline reported profits of $158 million, up 28% from the prior year. The higher level of profitability is a result of new rate cases, the one in effect earlier in the year, January 1st for Northwest pipeline and March 1st for Transco. Again, the Transco rates were subject to refund, and obviously we are delighted by the agreement in principle to settle this rate case as announced in our press release. These higher revenues were offset somewhat by somewhat higher expenses.  Back to Gas Marketing Services, Gas Marketing Services includes certain contracts related to the former Power segment, as well as the activities related to marketing E&P gas and buying fuel and shrink for the Midstream business. We are reporting a GAAP loss, as well as a recurring loss. However, when the mark-to-market adjustments is noted lower on this schedule, are taken into account, you can see the bottom-line for this activity and at the bottom of the schedule it shows Gas Marketing Services after mark-to-market adjustments with profitability of $6 million this year, as compared to $21 million a year ago.  Again, this business is principally focused on providing services to our E&P business and our Midstream business, as well as liquating or managing down some of the former power positions. Again, the total $625 million, up 36% from a year ago.  I want to add, let's turn to the next slide, please, number 13. I won't comment in detail, but I will just focus on some totals. Again, the three core businesses reporting $1.1 billion of segment profit year-to-date, up 27%, and segment profit after mark-to-market adjustments at a $1.116 billion, up 29% from year ago.  With that I will turn it over to Ralph Hill. 
Ralph Hill: Thank you, Don. Slide 14, I am very pleased to share another very strong quarter of production and profit growth with the audience today. Our three main segments to my short view to slide today, first talking about few highlights of overall E&P, as well as our basins highlights. And I am going to discuss how we proactively manage our transport and basin level colors, which Steve and Don had mentioned briefly.  Our attempt was to our minimize our E&P exposure to this year's basis widening, which I'll be able to show you on a slide, while simultaneously I believe you'll see that midstream has benefited very well from the basis widening at the same time, so its been a very good team effort to do that.  Looking at to the slide 15, second quarter accomplishments. Our total production is 945 million a day, which is up 20%, compared to the second quarter '06. That's up 6% sequentially also, a very strong production growth for the year.  Our segment profit up $209 million, which is a record quarter for E&P, was up 75% compared to the second quarter '06. And our year-to-year profit of $397 million is 49% above last year's this time.  We have been able to continue to upgrade and high-grade our rig fleet and primarily in the Piceance Highlands and we are very pleased with that in addition to our activities in the Fort Worth basin. And during the quarter we have accomplished three, two larger and one smaller undeveloped acreage acquisitions, including drilling capital about $95 million for the quarter, which is why our capital guidance has gone up. One was in the Piceance Highlands in the Ryan Gulch area, and two in the Fort area near our Fort Worth activity in the Barnett.  Combined these will total, again as I mentioned about $95 million of additional expenditures this year, which includes approximately $19 million for additional drilling and then the acquisition prices in the $77 million range and they are roughly spit between. We are very pleased with both of these, the Fort Worth acquisitions were in the core area of the Barnett and the Piceance Highlands is a direct bolt-on to the best acreage we have in our Ryan Gulch area, and we are very pleased to have gotten both these. Both bring substantial amount of undeveloped locations with and which we focus our efforts on.  Slide 16, this is a repeat of what we had for the last call, except now we've updated for the first quarter '07. If you look at the slide, particularly on the right hand side, we remained the second largest, fastest growing and the 13th largest US producer in the first quarter. The only producer that grew faster than us had significant acquisitions last year that obviously impacted their production growth. So, including our growth, once again through organic growth we've been able to achieve substantial growth in our production.  We believe that our 22% growth in the second quarter, which we don't have all the statistics in for all the companies listed here, will again be industry leading, we will share that statistic with you next quarter.  Slide 17, some basin highlights. Piceance Valley is nearing $500 million at the time in the second quarter was up 25% over year ago. We have 18 rigs operating in the valley, but as you know, we have 25 total in the Piceance area when you include the Highlands, and our simultaneous operations, which we call SIMOPS, continues to improve our cycle times.  In the Highlands, our production is up 56% over a year ago with 25 million a day of net production. We have done our seasonal drilling ramp up, which we do and we are up to 7 rigs already this year in the Highlands and our well performance continues to meet our expectations.  In the Powder River, continued strong growth, up 21% over a year ago, a $166 million cubic feet a day. Our seasonal drilling window is just now underway August 1st is when really most of the stipulations and in the Powder and then we have about 90 day to 100 day significant drilling window and we're rapidly in that as we speak.  And gathering expansions have continue to progress with the four union which will be done this fall late this year will significantly impact our ability to move gas from this area and help us quite a bit and also some other small gathering expansions have been accomplished.  Slide 18, San Juan Basin. Steady production of $147 million and is a very matured basin was down slightly from the first quarter. That's primarily due to plant maintenance which affected volumes that should rise again in the third quarter. We continue to do many things to this mature field of optimization efforts and they continue to pay dividends as our production normally and continues to go up in the San Juan basin, where many have their production actually is declining.  Fort Worth, which is our newest basin we're up to $32 million a day which is a 146% increase over a year ago. We have four rigs drilling. Deal flow is significant out there for the size, the type of deals that I mentioned we did earlier in the slides, so we have quite a bit to do for coming our way.  Tighter well density also offer significant growth force and we are gaining efficiencies through size and scale on our operating cost and our ability to drill more efficiently.  Slide 19, as the key question Steve, Don and I receive quite often and this in regard to the Rockies basis and this year base is widening which many of you are seeing. As I mentioned for several years now we've proactively managing for this problem and we believe we -- during the last couple of years by taking firm transportation out and there is a slide in the appendix that discusses there.  And by putting on basin level collars and hedges to minimize our current Rockies basis, this current Rockies basis problem from our portfolio. And thus when I was for almost over the Rockies producers to the wide basis as this slide will detail. So, looking at the slide our total domestic production was $898 million a day in the second quarter on average. 29% was at Rockies prices which you look at the slide you had the 22% Rockies hedges and the 7% Rockies so that's makes to 29%  So that is what we have, which would be at Rockies prices and 71% of our gas through our proactive ability to move our gas away is either produced or transported and lot of these transported as you know were primarily Rockies producers.  Two other price points, so if you take the $260 million of the Rockies prices are exposed Rockies prices and you take out our hedges positions that we have in our collars and our fixed prices of $200 million a day, we had approximately $60 million a day or only about 7% of our entire portfolio exposed to the lowest Rockies prices, which you can see an example of Rockies prices is in the next mode, CIG was $3.86 for the second quarter '07 and Northwest pipe was $3.78. So, our entire portfolio a very, very small piece of that was exposed to those types of prices.  And the above is apples to oranges if you look at the -- what our net realized prices versus just a pure index because of net realized price takes out fuel, shrinkage, and transportation but our net realized price for 2000 for the second quarter '07 was $5.39.  So we feel, we have been a very proactive in working with the Power group and with our sister companies and making sure we can get our gas out of the basin as we talked about other Rockies for quite a while, and this slide depicts where the majority of our gas is either pricing and/or transported away from the Rockies.  For 2008, we expect Rockies Express as many of you see the basis is narrowing when Rockies Express is expected to come on. As you know we have a couple hundred million today on that expansion through our marketing arrangements. We expect that will help and we also have an additional ability to move our gas. So, the exposure, if you will, to Rockies, which we don't know if that’s a bad exposure, because the basis has significantly declined, increases from the 7% to approximately about 15% or 17%, so still very, very manageable. And as you can see from our proactive ability to move our gas out of the basin we will be able to move to preferred pricing points.  Finally, slide 20. What we have done is we've avoided Rockies basis boil out this year, while Williams is benefited from our Midstream business, as Alan will talk about that in a few minutes. Our production is increasing rapidly. Our costs are in line with our expectations, exactly where we thought they would be with the expectations. And our profit is up significantly to records levels.  We are currently developing our detailed 2008 plan, and we hope to be able to demonstrate by the next call that we can increase our activity level, if possible, but via our speed development strategy, which is you're seeing we've been continue to execute on.  And our workforce continues to be very dedicated, and I thank them for an outstanding quarter, for everything they did for us this year so far and for the future. Now, I'll turn it over to the Alan Armstrong. 
Alan Armstrong: Thanks, Ralph and good morning, and certainly a pleasure to be reporting on Midstream's record quarter today, but more importantly from my perspective to be able to demonstrate once again the strength of our Williams portfolio, and ability to continue to generate a lot of cash across the units in a multitude of pricing environments.  Our segment profit for Midstream was $250 million this quarter, was a record as it exceeded our previous record of $228 million in the third quarter of '06. This performance, along with the current market fundamentals have allowed us to raise our guidance by $150 million at midpoint, and this marks the seventh time in the last nine quarters that we have been able to raise our segment profit guidance for Midstream.  The NGL margin was certainly driven by the gas basis differential between Henry's and Rockies, as Ralph pointed out a while ago, and the basis in the second quarter exceeded $3 and we are realizing continued gas prices that fundamentals that in the third quarter that supports the guidance raise that I mentioned a moment ago.  Just to kind of give you a feel for what that look like for us in terms of margin. Our Rockies margin, and so that would be Opal and Echo in particular, Rockies margin was $0.54 and then on a consolidated basis we saw $0.47 per gallon. And to put that in a dollar per MMBtu perspective, we basically took the way COG or cost of gas for Rockies was 447 for the quarter, and we basically converted that to a $11 per MMBtu sales on the liquid side, and that's after TNF, so we basically saw margin of about $6.50 per MMBtu on the gas that we processed.  And so I think that helps demonstrate the kind of strength that we've got in the Rockies, certainly as new pipeline capacity comes on out there we would expect that margin, and particularly in the Rockies to fall back to more normal levels next year.  Additionally, in terms of being able to raise our guidance, we did acquire the BASF's interest in Geismar, and we had a right of first refusal on that investment. We operate that facility today. We did own 40% 5/12s and we acquired another 5/12s through this ROFR. Just to give you an idea of the profitability of that, we spent about $62 million, and we expect that to generate on a full year basis about $26 million of EBITDA a year, and or of segment profit cost depreciation, and that business is supported by, or contract is about 300 million pounds a year, through 2009 and that’s so, that’s an off-take agreement with BASF that supports that investment. So, very excited about this addition, really, no distraction to our business, as that is something we already operate today and we found that to be at favorable price.  Additionally, I want to comment on the progress, we are making on our Canadian Oil Sands we did make a press release I believe on Tuesday, talking about some of the letters of intent, that we've signed and we have signed two letters of intent that anchor the construction of a cryogenic plant expanding our Redwater fractionator and adding a de-ethanizer to our Redwater complex, as well.  The first part of that project will be in service by 2010 and a new cryo by 2012 these projects, I think most importantly to mention here is not only do these projects extract additional value out of Canadian Oil Sands off-gas and provide value to our customers. They also are extremely impeccable to the missions reduction in Canada, in fact our current operations at Fort McMurray reduce carbon dioxide about buyback 219,000 tons per year and these other projects of course will expand then even further.  Another important thing to note about this is the scale of this opportunity. We expect that by 2012 we will be successful in pursuing the opportunities we see before is up there, that we could be doubling or matching is another of way of saying matching our current US production of about 200,000 barrels a day with production out of Canada and a lot of this business particularly the business on the front-end and this is all fee-based production. So we will not be exposed to the pricing now in the front-end.  These projects also have the benefit of being, very long-term in nature with the Canadian Oil Sands reserves standing behind them and they are not exposed to the typical field declines that we have in our Midstream business. And so, a lot of free cash flow generation for years to come without much capital reinjection into those businesses. So, exciting opportunity and we are thrilled to see that kind of getting-off the ground for us.  Moving on to the next slide on 23 here. This again, we've talked, we have shown this slide in the past, this is a depiction of our growth opportunities in various stages and there on the left, you see projects and opportunities in their least mature state and then moving to the right, as we become more sure of them and we move them into guidance.  And keynotes to make on this slide this time, is the amount that got moved over to our in guidance area, two things there to note, the additional interesting Geismar and a Deepwater Tieback that would be tied back to Devil's Tower and you can see the strength of those opportunities in terms of the kind of segment profit addition that those will bring to us.  Additionally, you will see there a major expansion in our under negotiation's area as we bring in those Canadian Oil Sands projects that I just talked about. So, this continues to be a lot of growth opportunities for us and really we expect that to continue on in-development and proposal stage to come in from all three areas the Deepwater, the Western G&P and the Canadian Oil Sands  Moving to summary slide here on 24, we certainly were able to post a dramatic increase in our segment profit guidance, primarily on the strength of our NGL margins as those set new record highs. I certainly should comment as well, that we are experiencing high margins in the current environment that we exist and we see fundamentals that support that relate throughout the remainder of 2007.  We are well positioned in for growth in three areas that I mentioned just a while ago and probably most importantly and I think our biggest challenges is Midstream is with all this growth and primary as to continue to focus it has the most reliable operations in the midstream sector and that is certainly what brings the opportunities for us that we continue to be able to discuss with you, that’s all I’ve got and now I'll turn it back to Don. 
Don Chappel: Thanks Alan. Let's turn next to our slide number 26, the focus of my comments on the bottom line our key earnings measure diluted earnings per share on a recurring basis after market-to-market adjustment; we've updated our guidance list at the bottom end of the range to $1.30 to a top-end of the $1.50 from our previous range of $1.15 to $1.50.  The primary driver of the increase is the strong Midstream results and view of continuing strong liquids margins. And that offset somewhat by the absence of powers results, the wide range is principally related to a range of assumptions for energy, commodity prices for the balance of the year and that summarized on slide number 69 in this slide presentation.  Lets turn now to slide number 27, just a quick update on each of our businesses E&P has tightened it's 2007 guidance range somewhat on the strength of its continued production growth, midstream will significantly increase it's 2007 guidance as a result of very strong margins, note that the 2008 guidance range is steady and assumes a less favorable margin environment, perhaps for more conservative forecast. Gas pipelines has tightened it's 2007 guidance range and raised it's 2008 guidance.  Gas marketing both on a reported and forecast results are effective somewhat by mark-to-market effects which we plan to take action to reduce gas marketing forecast inclusive of mark-to-market effects, exclusive of mark-to market effects is shown at the bottom of the schedule and again you can see a forecast of 0 to 25 million in 2007 and basically a break even plus or minus 20 million in 2008. Again, gas marketing is principally providing services to E&P and Midstream.  In terms of the total, again, the increase in the Midstream results drive the total recurring after mark-to-market adjustments offset somewhat by the absence of powers contribution.  Lets turn to the next slide. Capital spending, focus first on E&P. Again the increase in the E&P capital expenditure guidance relates the acquisition of undeveloped properties on the Piceance and Fort Worth Basin as Ralph spoke to the Midstream increase relates to the acquisition of the official interest in Geismar, as well as, additional planned projects and then finally gas pipeline relates to principally to new projects.  I will also note that as Steve has indicated, we continue to be opportunity-rich, we will expect to see continued growth and investment in each of our businesses and will continue to update those forecast, as we walk through at future quarters.  The next slide please number 29. Again, we’ve talked about segment profit, cash flow from operations 2007 is steady, 2008 is slightly lower, as the power contribution is now adolescent, capital spending, we just reviewed and again the caveat here is again we opportunity-rich, we expect to make additional investments, so we believe will create even more value for our investors.  Operating free cash flow is currently forecast to be negative this year and again this is before dividend minority interest and other cash requirements by 2008 in this forecast it's positive, again, I would note that capital spending to grow somewhat as we seize additional opportunities. Also note that there are no MLP capital contributions included in this forecasted cash flow.  With that, I’ll turn it back to Steve. 
Steve Malcolm: Thanks Don. I think we can sum things up by saying that our integrated natural business is clearly delivering value. Our portfolio is turning in very strong performance, even in a pretty volatile challenging commodity market. We achieved tremendous results in the second quarter, we think the rest of the year will be very strong, as well. You can see that confidence in our improved earnings outlook. We continue to increase production, there are few E&P companies that are generating 20 plus percent growth, through organic drilling opportunities. We are delivering record Midstream results on robust NGL margins in the processing margin environment economics continue to be very attractive in the third quarter.  Our pipeline profitability is up on new higher rates. We are investing in high quality growth opportunities in our businesses and we are executing on significant value creating initiatives. The power sale is getting closer we are executing on an MLP strategy. We will be moving forward with our $1 billion stock repurchase program.  And so we clearly have the franchise type assets. A very talented workforce, abundant growth opportunities and we continue to expand our growth platform. All of which will enable us to create significant shareholder value in the future.  And with that we'll be happy to take your questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Carl Kirst with Credit Suisse. 
Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse: Good morning everybody and certainly congratulations on a great quarter here. Three questions if I could, just first Ralph looking at specifically the Piceance Valley. We seem to be getting to a place where the infrastructure is maxed out in that region. Are there any opportunities to invest in infrastructure that will allow you to put more, better rigs to work there rather than just high-grading? 
Ralph Hill: Well, I think, I guess just my version of high-grad is we open planning better rigs to work. We've been able to lay down a number of rigs that we would being very inefficient and continue to, even as we speak today we will be bringing another rig and laying another one down this week, it's a much newer and efficient rig. So, we are getting much better equipment and I think the ability to do more is what we are working on and looking forward to doing in the Highlands. As you know our projections going forward have about four rigs operating in the Highlands on an annual basis, and as you know that's seasonal, it can drop as low as one or two and goes as high as seven or eight. But I hope that we will be able to tell you in the future that instead of four rigs operating around, we'll have more double to that or maybe eight to ten rigs operating Highlands. So that's where we see more opportunity and that's why we've been -- all of our infrastructure build out as we have done so far, the majority of those are done and we are rapidly, as fast as we can, testing all the areas of the fields we have so we know where to go hit, which part of the field hit first. 
Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse: Yeah, certainly I appreciate that but specifically with respect to the Piceance Valley as far as your absolute number of rig, I mean, once you kind of finish high-grading if you will, are we sort of now cap out at the amount of the number of rig you can put to work in the Valley but now all the future growth you are looking out is coming from Highlands, is that still the correct way of looking at it? 
Ralph Hill: No, we should have substantial growth in the Valley still and way we will do that is -- we will have our fleet in place where we want the type of rigs we want both the high efficiency rigs and the conventional rigs. And after that it will be just be a matter of drilling, we have always done, decrease in our cycle times. And that's happening, as we do our simultaneous operations through our drill bit technology just to everything we are doing. So, what I think is the same amount of rigs is you see operating and since we get down with the high-grading and the themes in place which is essentially is, we'll be working to continuously drive down the spread time. And that will -- same amount of equipment can do more rigs or more wells, I am sorry. 
Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse: Great, and I appreciate that. Second question Alan just as we look at the -- obviously there is the blow and keep-whole margins particularly in the Rockies right now, just from maybe sort of a philosophical standpoint, are you looking to keep the amount of keep-whole exposure we have right now or sort of natural hedge enterprise wide, or do you try and take advantage of another record margins to perhaps get better than you might otherwise expect fee-based margins? 
Alan Armstrong: Yeah, it's a great question and generally this is exactly when we see opportunities to contract for fee-based margins and the two factors that you mentioned there, first of all looking at our corporate exposure to gas and then secondly opportunities to price our fee-based business long-term and exactly when we do that. And in fact in the Canadian projects that I mentioned those projects are while the value being generated is mission productions and substantial spread between gas and propane and propylene, both of those projects are fee based projects. 
Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thank you. And then lastly Steve, Don, Alan, I'm trying to ask as the way, do not run a file here the MLP issue but maybe specifically looking on Williams Partners, WPZ, as you look into the future, do you find that we now have a more limited window of when we can access the capital market of WPZ or do you think WPZ's dynamics are really going to work independent of anything else that might be out there? 
Don Chappel: I don't see any change in our intentions and what we've talked about with respect to WPZ as a result of our intention to create a gas pipeline MLP. 
Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse: But as specifically being able to access the equity markets does that -- did you feel now more constrained of when you can put out WPZ equity because of perhaps other equity might be doing? 
Don Chappel: No, that was obviously an important part of our analysis and so the answer is no, we don't believe that we will be constrained in terms of being getting successful lead to the markets. 
Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse: Great, thanks. I will ask my other questions back in the queue. Thank you. 
Operator: We're going to take our next question from Faisel Khan with Citi. 
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Good morning. On the tighter basin volumes up 21% over the last year. Well, there is a lot of growth in that basin a result of a lot of deepwatering you had from last year and some of the number of wells you have drilled year-over-year obviously '06 or '05, or is that real organic growth that continue for the next couple of years? 
Ralph Hill: Faisel, it's really erratic -- the water in some part from wells that we're drilling more in '06 and so that we're coming on now. But clearly, we are drilling this year and those were also deepwater and beyond in '08 and '09. So, we have a strong outlook on the ability for our Powder production to continue grow, as you know we were very proactive in managing in our water. Our previous partner was not, but now with our current partner and a dark one there, they are doing a great job of proactively managing their water. Hooking up well, it was stranded and that helps us also because in all the production growth until recently is been from Williams's side and now it's a pleasure to have our partner also participate in that. 
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay. How much route do you have to run in the Fort Worth area, I mean, you talked about how your volumes are up tremendously over the year? How much more room do you guys have to run there? 
Ralph Hill: We have at least 100 locations to drill and probably more as we look at some of our down space in opportunities there and we have actually done six, Bolt-on in the last year and a half, we have a tremendous amount of deal flow coming in still. We are specializing, as you can tell more in this $25 million to $50 million range, but they bring quite a bit of opportunities. So, we feel we have a lot of growth already in front of us just with the 100 or more locations that we have in our current inventory and probably more as we look at the rest of inventories as our deal flow is coming to us, assuming we can pick up some of that. 
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay, great. And then on the pipelines, the rate that went into effect on March 1st is that similar to what you guys are looking at in terms of settlement with your shippers? 
Alan Armstrong: Actually, we have already made adjustments in our forecast to reflect where we have thought we would be and so we've got those baked in. It will not be the motion rates that were filed, if that responds to your question. 
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay. And then in terms of Pacific Connector with your partners there, there has been some rummaging of some our position to that pipeline. Where do you guys stand with that project? 
Alan Armstrong: Well, as we announced previously, we had a very successful open season on that project and we are moving ahead. We actually have 97% of the right away. We have rights to survey, which is a very positive indication in our view as to how that project is proceeding and it's virtually impossible to have such a project in today’s world where they won't have some folks raising their voice in opposition. Although, I would say in contrast to other projects that, for example, might congest the Columbia River. This project would not, in fact, do that and of all the places you could probably locate along the Western Coast, the local support has been very heartening for the project. 
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay. And then in terms of your continued ability to dropdown assets into the partnership to WPZ. Have you noticed, has there been any constraint do you think at all with the increase in credit spreads in the market that might influence that sort of strategy? 
Don Chappel: Faisel, certainly what's happening in the market I think affects everyone in the market. But, nonetheless, we think that our MLP plans are largely unchanged. 
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: And then lastly, on your sale of their power. Are there any issues of their side given the issues they’ve been having with the sub-prime that might impede the sale of this asset to them? 
Steve Malcolm: We are not aware of any. They continue to be pleased with the progress that we are making in terms of getting assignments completed, and continued to be very optimistic about our availability to close before the end of the year. 
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Great. Thanks for the time, guys. I appreciate it. 
Operator: Moving on, we'll take our next question from [Craig Shere] with [Scott Wood Capital]. 
Craig Shere - Scott Wood Capital: Hi. Don, do you have the sense for how much second quarter earnings might have been a tad lower if mark-to-market adjusted power book results were still in continuing ops along with the new gas marketing segment? 
Don Chappel: Craig, we have not provided any guidance by quarter for power. But, you may recall that our power results for full year forecast were in the range of $50 million to $100 million more or less. So, obviously it somewhat varies by season, but full-year effect somewhere in the range of $50 million to $100 million. 
Craig Shere - Scott Wood Capital: Okay. And couple of questions for Alan. Alan, what are the assumptions for profit per gallon going out away beyond, is it like $0.20 or so? 
Alan Armstrong: You are saying what's embedded to get to the midpoint of our guidance? 
Craig Shere - Scott Wood Capital: Yes. I am sorry. 
Alan Armstrong: What we are using is a current market forecast and with that kind of number, which is in the mid 40s range, that would get us to the top of our range there right now. That answers your question. 
Craig Shere - Scott Wood Capital: Okay. So, you are using some kind of forward numbers even through all of '08? 
Alan Armstrong: Sorry. I thought you were talking about '07, I am sorry. In '07, that -- my answer was response with the '07, which is about $0.47. And on the '08 numbers we are using, I think we've posted our commodity price assumptions in some of the appendix information, and generally what we are using in a long range plan there is around $0.27 for our '08 numbers. 
Craig Shere - Scott Wood Capital: I know for the longer term guidance you all have kind of conservatively used like five year averages or something. Can you speak to the possibility of the margins falling whatever it is 40% or so next year may be with the new Rockies Express pipeline? Or is this just again being conservative and moving towards the five year average? 
Alan Armstrong: We are staying fairly consistent with the five year average. And I think that we will come very close this year as we look back post '07, if '07 completes the way we think it would be at $0.27, will be around the five year average. However, we certainly arrived at that number in a different manner. I would say that just happens to be somewhat coincidental. And most of that impact or negative impact to that number is the Rockies basis differential. 
Craig Shere - Scott Wood Capital: Okay. And last question Alan, do you have a rough estimate for what all the CapEx plans might be for the Olefins gas processing investments? 
Alan Armstrong: Well, the two projects that we have got in there are right at about $240 million. There is exactly two fairly large projects there and there is some smaller projects that enhance our existing facilities and those total about $240 million that are in that middle pie there, if you will, pie chart showing the under negotiation. 
Craig Shere - Scott Wood Capital: Great, good quarter. I appreciate it guys. 
Operator: (Operator Instruction). Next will hear from Sam Brothwell with Wachovia. 
Sam Brothwell - Wachovia Securities: Hi, you guys answered my questions. Thanks. 
Operator: Moving on, we will take follow-up question from Carl Kirst with Credit Suisse. 
Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse: Hey, two quick follow-ups please. First on the $1.7 billion of cash on hand we have at the end of the quarter not withstanding the $1 billion share buyback, but I know you can't talk about. How much cash should we think about you guys maintaining on hand, on sort of a go-forward basis as you kind of come up the credit curve? 
Don Chappel: Good question Carl, maybe just a couple of comments. So, the total cash balance is somewhere between $400 million to $500 million as international cash which is offshore and has not been taxed either from an income statement or from a cash tax standpoint. Our intention is to leave that offshore. At this point we do have some growing opportunities offshore, including the Canadian opportunities that Alan pointed out which will be a terrific use for that cash, so stripping out the international cash we get down to domestic cash balance more in the $2.3 billion range. I would say that post sale of power cash balance of a few $100 million would be logical excluding that international cash that I just outlined. 
Craig Shere - Scott Wood Capital: Excluding, okay. Great, thank you. And then just last question. Ralph, in the interest of time, I don't think much was said about any of the new areas markets turn-off you went to. Was there anything in particular maybe that's out there worth highlighting for the second quarter? Are we still kind of too early on to really get that type of feel? 
Ralph Hill: It's still early, we are on our third well on the Paradox, so we continue to drill ahead on that but it is too early but we obviously intend to drill our fourth well here in the Paradox in the fall and then we'll have four to continue to do all of our technical analysis, but you could cumulate quite a bit of acreage down there and we've not been disappointed with what we are seeing so far. 
Craig Shere - Scott Wood Capital: Perfect. Thank you, good luck guys. 
Operator: And we will go ahead and take our next question Rick Gross with Lehman Brothers. 
Rick Gross - Lehman Brothers: Good morning. Couple of E&P question. On the cost structure, it looked like you had improving unit costs for LOE in SG&A and my assumption was on the SG&A part it was just better volume absorption. On the LOE, you had a bunch of accruals and things running back and I assume that's kind of normalized, is that a reasonable assumption? 
Ralph Hill: Last year particularly, there were a number of things that hit in the second quarter. So, yes, it's really more of a normalized basis now. 
Rick Gross - Lehman Brothers: Okay. And then, the area that did jump, if you continue to see a pretty good jump in D&A rate, is that just because you continue to drop out that we aren't see in the whole lot of migration of 2P-3P, just early in the year? 
Ralph Hill: As, you know, we are continuing to expand, in particular our Piceance Valley drilling, also we do a number of -- in that rate there will be all the facilities we put into, so that is the correct statement. But I will say, it's exactly where we planned on it being at this point, so based on our plan our DD&A rate is hitting right where we thought it would be. 
Rick Gross - Lehman Brothers: Okay. And then, the volumes that we are seeing now to the Piceance Valley year-over-year -- excuse the Highlands jump very nicely but they've been roughly flat for about a year and I am just curious as to whether or not we've got an infrastructure issue or something else that's kind of delayed the nature of seeing production ramp continue to ramp up their? 
Ralph Hill: They jumped from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, significantly and what that is? That's a result of the amount of drilling we are able to do in the window between June and October. And that's what you'll see again this year, is you'll see a jump as we move into the drilling window and we are into it now but obviously it wasn't in time to have a significant impact on the second quarter volumes. And what we are working for obviously is drilling in all the Highlands and you know we did that as our trial in the Trail Ridge area, we expect to continue to do that again this winter and also when the Alan point out so. Really, it’s a seasonal well, we will go from about seven rigs through about 5 months and we will drop down to one or two rigs and we hope to make that on a much more levelized basis. So, it's really just the seasonality of the rig season. 
Rick Gross - Lehman Brothers: Okay. And the results, so when we did the Piceance drill, wasn't there an expansion of the pipe that takes all that out of there going on as well? 
Ralph Hill: The expansion of noticed pipe right off from the valley you mean or? 
Rick Gross - Lehman Brothers: Yeah. 
Ralph Hill: Yes. That is there. The Rockies as you all probably know are very tight, it is very tight so. There is, on any given day, we will have gas that shut in either in the valley of the Highlands, just because a downstream area or may be a compressor of our own will be kicked-off so, it's so tight until Rockies Express gets on their own opportunities for gas unfortunately be can trailed from time-to-time and that does effect some of the volumes you see here. But I think that's all alleviated with all by next year with the infrastructure improvements, we are doing and all also with the new takeaway. But there is some, on any given day, with the amount of volumes we are moving, there can be gases, it's not getting the market just because of an infrastructure upset somewhere. 
Rick Gross - Lehman Brothers: Okay. And then in response to a question earlier on the Powder, you said something about a 100 location, I mean, my impression was you are drilling 900 wells a year and that should last the inventory that you've indicated is 1000's of wells, 10,000 or so and at current pace, you've got like a 10-15 year inventory? 
Ralph Hill: So, 100 locations was for the Barnett? 
Rick Gross - Lehman Brothers: The Barnett, I am sorry 
Ralph Hill: We currently have an inventory of 100 locations and we probably have more as we continue to down space our new tighter density drilling in the Barnett, so there wasn't response to Powder, Powder is still in that, I believe it's last slide, we have 7,500 to 8,000 locations. 
Rick Gross - Lehman Brothers: Yeah. 
Ralph Hill: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: And we'll take a follow up question from Faisal Khan with Citi. 
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Sorry, just a couple more questions. On your new gas marketing segment, is there fair for me take the pipeline capacity and the storage capacity used have a power and that's pretty much in your gas marketing business today? 
Ralph Hill: This is Ralph. I think parts of that, that are for the E&P and mid, we are primarily moving in E&P business, there is also some historical part that was with the power group that will be with us until we, as we said in our press release, work to remove those contracts and then minimize our exposure to mark-to-market. So initially, yes, but I think you'll -- another way to answer is, as we expect to see a lot of that go away. 
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay, got you. And in terms of how we should take a long-term view on the capital structure of the C-Corp over a long period of time. What kind of cash flow ratios or multiples should we be looking at in terms of like debt-to-EBITDA over a longer period of time or debt-to-total cap? 
Don Chappel: Faisal, we are not prepared to offer any specific guidance but I can tell you that again Williams will likely be the developer of projects that are not appropriate either not qualified or just in their development stage and as a result we need to have a solid financial foundation to be the developer of projects that are not yet cash flowing. So, that gives you some sense to where it will be. 
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay. 
Don Chappel: Other considerations are the amount of cash will come up from the MLPs. 
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Sure, understood. Thank you. 
Operator: And with that we will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back to management for closing remarks. 
Steve Malcolm: Thank you. I appreciate your interest, we were delighted with the quarter and very exited about the future and we look forward to speaking with you next time. 
Operator: And that does conclude our conference. Thank you all for your participation, we do hope you enjoy the rest of your day.

Operator: Good day everyone, and welcome to the Williams Companies Fourth Quarter 2006 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded.  At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Travis Campbell, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. 
Travis Campbell: Thank you very much, and good morning everybody. Welcome to the Williams fourth quarter 2006 earnings call, and thank you for your interest in our company.  As usual today, you'll hear from Steve Malcolm, our CEO; Don Chappel, our CFO; and also the heads of each of our business units will share highlights on their segments. That includes Ralph Hill, Alan Armstrong, Phil Wright, and Bill Hobbs.  All of the slides and the details are available in the appendix to this presentation. So, any information that you've found valuable in the past is available for your use.  Before I turn it over to Steve, please note that all the slides, both those in the presentation today and the appendix, are available on our website williams.com in a PDF format.  One correction I do need to mention, you'll notice in the slide presentation today that our segment profit guidance for 2008 is $2.13 billion to $2.98 billion. The press release reflected our prior guidance, which was $2.2 billion to $2.88 billion. We'll be sending out a correction to that press release very quickly.  The various press releases and the accompanying schedules for today are also available on the website. If you look at slide two and three, entitled "Forward-looking Statements" it details various risk factors and uncertainties related to future outcomes. Please review that information on those slides.  On slide number 4, oil and gas reserves disclaimer. It's also very important, and we urge you to read that slide as well. Also included in the presentation today are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to generally accepted accounting principles. Those schedules follow the presentation and are integral to the presentation. They are also available on our website, williams.com.  So with that, I will turn it over to Steve Malcolm, our Chairman.

Steve Malcolm: Thanks, Travis. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. We have our usual lineup today. We have lots of slides, but we will try to motor through them quickly, so that we have plenty of time for your questions.  I'll review key headlines and accomplishments for 2006 and offer my view of some of the catalysts for creating value in 2007. Don Chappel will go through the financial review. You'll hear updates from our business unit leaders, and we'll be providing our earnings guidance.  We're giving earnings guidance today for 2007 and 2008. And, our guidance reflects our expectation of continued significant volatility in commodity prices. You'll see today that even the range for our 2007 guidance is fairly wide. Again, this reflects our expectation for this significant volatility in commodity prices.  We are providing the commodity assumptions embedded in our 2007 and 2008 earnings guidance to help you fine tune your own models. And just for your planning purposes, we should be talking about 3P reserves, when we release first quarter results in May.  I would anticipate some window on 2009 expectations at the time we release second quarter earnings later this summer after we have completed our annual long-range planning exercise with our Board.  If you would please turn to slide 6, this lists some of the major headlines associated with our performance during the fourth quarter and during all of 2006. No doubt, 2006 results were impressive for Williams. We are certainly pleased that recurring adjusted income was up 38% for the full year. Cash flow from operations rose 3%.  Please recall last year at this time, we were providing a guidance range for 2006 between $0.78 and $1.03 per share. And so, the $1.17 recurring EPS that we've achieved represents a very strong year for Williams.  And just going through the rest of these bullet points, we recorded extraordinary earnings in Midstream with margins about double the five-year average, which drove the segment profit up about 40% for the year.  We continued our impressive track record in the E&P sector, as domestic production rose 23%, and production was replaced at a rate of 216%. We completed the dropdown in two phases of a large, significant $1.6 billion asset to WPZ during the year. Importantly, new higher rates are going into effect, subject to refund, on Transco and Northwest Pipeline.  We saw an increased level of activity in power and we are delighted that with the SCE transaction, we were able to place megawatts in the marketplace beyond 2010.  Our businesses were recognized in many ways during the year for their results, but we were particularly proud that our E&P operation received recognition as the Hydrocarbon Producer of the Year by Platts.  And lastly, our discipline around investments in our energy portfolio has allowed shareholders to earn a 65% total return over the past eight quarters.  Turning to slide 7. You have seen this slide before. A lot of information on it, but I think it captures our story very succinctly. We have positioned our company for near and long-term value creation. I won't go through each of these bullets, but we do have prime assets that are delivering growth. We are pursuing that growth with discipline, having adopted the EVA methodology.  We've produced a solid record of delivering results, a 65% return to shareholders in the last six quarters. And a crisp execution around our game plan will drive value creation in the future.  Turning to the next slide, slide 8. As I think about 2007, these appear to be the catalysts that I believe will drive our stock price during the year. Certainly, growth in segment profit, but as well growing our natural gas reserves and production will be important.  Our new higher rates on Northwest and Transco, more megawatts contracted into the market post 2010, our ability to capture additional midstream projects, and we have talked about the significant pipeline of projects that we are pursuing. And, more potential dropdowns to Williams Partners.  I think, importantly, we have already seen, some great progress on these items in 2007, excellent metrics with respect to reserves and production, apparent settlement of the Northwest Pipeline rate case, and more megawatts moving into the market beyond 2010 as a result of the SCE deal.  So, we're delighted with our results in 2006. We're very pleased with our progress already in 2007. And with that I will turn it over to Don Chappel. 
Don Chappel: Thanks Steve, good morning. I will quickly run through the highlights of our fourth quarter and 2006 full year results, which are analyzed in more detail in our press release, and will be analyzed in much more detail in our 10-K, which we will file next week.  Please turn to slide number 10. Just a few comments; we're very pleased with our continued improvement and strong performance for both the fourth quarter and 2006. As you know, our GAAP results include certain non-recurring items and the effects of prior and some current mark-to-market accounting related to our power business and that's principally non-cash.  As such, we eliminate, in our analysis for our own management review as well as for your review, these non-recurring items and the cumulative mark-to-market effects to provide a much more clear picture of our results and true earnings power.  Having said that I'll turn to net income. Obviously, for the fourth quarter, net income per share on a GAAP basis was $0.24. After we adjust for non-recurring items that total was $0.26 and after eliminating mark-to-market effects, it was $0.30. You can see that in the first column of this slide.  And I'll focus on the bottom-line now. The comparison to 2005, the key measure is $0.30 as compared to $0.26 or up $0.04 or about 15% for the quarter. On a full year basis, again net income per share, reported GAAP, was $0.51. After eliminating non-recurring items we have an $0.86 result.  However, again we have mark-to-market effects, which after elimination yield a $1.17 and compare very, very well as compared to the $0.86 in the previous year. That's an increase of $0.31 or about 38%. And I am going to walk through some of the details of our non-recurring items and mark-to-market adjustments in just a second here.  Let's turn to slide number 11. I am just going to hit on some of the highlights here of the non-recurring items. We had again some litigation settlement totaling $7 million for the quarter and $260 million for the year with our security settlement in the Gulf Liquids litigation.  Early debt retirement expenses totaled $31 million for the year, nothing in the current quarter. And then, we had an impairment related to a Venezuelan asset, related to a change in the regulatory environment as well as a change in the form of that investment, which caused an impairment, totaling $16 million.  We also had some tax items that were non-recurring in nature. You can see there on the bottom of the slide. Add all that up, that yields the result that I just had previously indicated.  Turning next to slide number 12. This is the mark-to-market adjustments related to our power business. Again, we reversed the forward unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses. We add back the realized gains from mark-to-market previously recorded, total that up, tax effect it, and that gives us the result. The total there would be a $22 million increase in the fourth quarter earnings as compared to a $14 million decrease in 2005, or a $36 million change quarter-over-quarter.  And for the full year, $188 million after-tax being added back to the earnings, as compared to $85 million in the prior year, a swing of $103 million on a year-over-year basis.  The next slide please, number 13, fourth quarter segment profit. We reflect this on both a reported and a recurring basis by BU and consolidated with mark-to-market effects. I'll focus on the bold total segment profit after mark-to-market adjustments of $407 million as compared to $448 million, down $41 million over a year ago.  And I think the big story there is E&P and Gas Pipelines were down somewhat, and Midstream up sharply. And, I'll talk a little bit more about that in just a second.  E&P increased its domestic production 28% and consolidated production 26%. However, prices were sharply lower than the fourth quarter '05, a period which immediately followed the 2005 hurricanes. Domestic average realized prices were off $1.20 per Mcfe or 21%, and the effects of the price decline offset this 26% production increase. Additionally, operating costs were higher, about $0.12 per Mcfe.  The Midstream incredibly strong results were principally driven by sharply higher NGL unit margins, totaling $78 million due to lower natural gas costs and higher volumes caused by periods of ethane rejection, and fee revenue increases totaling $13 million. Offsetting these increases were operating expense increases totaling $28 million.  Gas Pipeline recurring results were lower due to cost increases. As you know, we filed a rate case to recover cost increases and new higher rates went into effect at Northwest Pipe on January 1st and will go into effect on Transco, effective 03/01/07, subject to refund. And, Phil will have a few more words on that subject in a few minutes.  Power GAAP results include the mark-to-market effects. Excluding mark-to-market effects, Power was about breakeven in both the fourth quarter of '06 and '05.  Turn to the next slide please, number 14. We'll take a look at full year results. Again looking at our key earnings measures, segment profit after mark-to-market, $1.837 billion as compared to $1.578 billion, up $259 million or about 16%.  Again E&P, domestic production volumes increased 23% and consolidated volumes were up 21% over 2005.However, 2006 domestic average net realized prices were lower, $0.29 lower per Mcf, or about 6%, and costs were higher at $0.11 per Mcf higher.  Midstream's record results were principally driven by record NGL margins which were up $242 million, or $0.17 per gallon from 2005 levels. Additionally, fee revenues were $80 million higher, driven by increased volumes from Triton and Goldfinger deepwater projects, higher unit production revenues from Devils Tower, and high fee revenues in the West. Olefins contributed an additional $24 million in higher margins. Operating expenses increased $85 million, due to a variety of factors, and marketing margins were down $25 million.  Gas Pipeline 2006 results were lower, as costs increased. And again, those costs were included in our rate filings. Power results were up sharply as a result of improved markets and deals that were realized. I would also note that Power cash flows, as detailed on slide number 96 in the appendix, totaled $93 million for the Power segment.  With that, let's turn it to Ralph Hill. 
Ralph Hill: Thank you Don. I am on slide 16. I'm pleased to share today with you primarily three main things. First, talk about the strong operating quarter we had. Second, detail you our reserve replacement performance again, which we think was very strong, and our outlook for what we hope is an even better 2007.  Moving to slide 17, some of these Don has touched on. And, I have some slides that will also detail a few of these out in more detail in just a few minutes. But basically, our volumes were up 21% this year. Last year, meaning '05's performance, they were up 17%. So, we were able to grow our volumes at a higher rate, if you will, 21% over even a larger base.  The reserve replacement, I have a slide on that I'll talk about. Our volumes were up $180 million or more since the fourth quarter of 2005. I have a slide that talks about Powder River, but that continues to do very well for us, and we are very pleased with our new partner in Powder River.  I have an update on the Barcus Creek farm-in. We have expanded our Barnett Shale position and are now running three rigs in the Barnett Shale.  And we did win two awards, as Steve talked about, which I am very proud of the team for which, is the Oil and Gas Investor's Best Field Rejuvenation and also the Global Energy Awards. We were named the 2006 Hydrocarbon Producer of the Year.  Turning to slide 18, this just details by quarter as we've done each quarter. Our domestic production growth of 23%, and I'll just leave it at that. You can see, obviously, very strong and we expect to continue very strong performance going forward.  Slide 19, turning more into the Piceance, production is up $126 million or 37% over a year ago. We do now have 25 rigs operating in the Piceance, compared to this time last year. We had about 19. We did get our tenth H&P rig in at the very end of December and it spud at the end of December. So, all 10 rigs are in operation.  We have four Nabors rigs scheduled coming in, one in March, one in April, and two in May. And as I mentioned before, as we get these purpose-built rigs, we will have the ability to continue, and we already have started high-grading our fleet. And one other thing is we were awarded the first ever Piceance year-round drilling pilot by the BLM and Department of Wildlife.  We think that's a win-win for everybody. It allows us to go to federal acreage and get in there with these new purpose-built rigs and basically finish it up in a quicker and more efficient method, less pads built and also less disturbance and ultimately reclaim the land that much quicker. So we are anxious to have that pilot to be successful, and we believe it will. And we appreciate working with the BLM and the DOW on that.  And finally, in the Piceance just to recall, last year at this time we were hoping to be able to do what we called SimOps, which is simultaneous operations. And that did work, it works very well.  So, we think on the land side of the world, we are the first company to be able to successfully frac, perforate, drill and produce and have all those operations going on in the same drill pad at the same time. And that has obviously helped us as we move forward.  Looking at slide 20 the Piceance Highlands, that momentum does continue. We spud 43 wells in 2006. We are looking for about a 50% increase in that in 2007. Our current production is up from $15 million a year ago to $26 million. And we continue to do a major amount of work on roads, pipeline and facilities to make sure we can access this vast resource we believe we have, in a very efficient way.  So a lot of work is going on there and we are actually getting very close to finishing a lot of that work.  We were able to get a winter drilling pilot underway, and this is a little different than the valley. This is not regulatory driven, but this is just physically being capable of drilling in harsh winter conditions and much higher altitude.  We have built our camp for our employees and vendors to stay at. We have our transportation built, our roads built and our roads are almost finalized, but we are in the process of doing winter round drilling at Trail Ridge. And our pilot is to have eight wells drilled during this winter, to make sure it works the way we think it will be and hopefully that allows to do additional work in the future going forward.  Slide 21, Powder River production growth. Again the Big George is the story here. Its increase is vastly overcoming the Wyodak decline. Our production is up 36 million a day on a net basis or 30% over a year ago. And Big George itself is up 88% and our sequential quarter volumes on Big George are up 15%. So the Big George continues to do very well for us, it's what we thought.  Again, we are thankful to have our new partner in there and they are managing their business the way we do. We think that will allow more volumes to come on in the future.  For 2007, lots of time, questions come up about permitting and how we would be looking for this year's permits. And we're about 70% or more done with our permitting for this year's drilling budget, which is where we usually are at this time of the year. So we feel very good about that.  Slide 22, 2006 cost performance. We don't have all the data in from all of our competitors. So in the May call, like I did last year, I'll give more comparisons. But we do believe we continue to be in the top quartile on our performances. Our LOE expense is $0.46 per Mcf.  Just to clarify a couple of things on the Investor Relations schedule, which we call the Analyst Package, it details the E&P operating statistics, which reflects LOE and what we call other operating expenses. In that it shows that this year, meaning 2006, it's $0.58 versus a 2005 rate of $0.47.  But as I mentioned before, there were some 2005 expenses that were recorded in '06. So, if you actually adjust that to the year incurred, our actual 2006 rate is about $0.5509 versus the '05 rate which would be adjusted to $0.4908. So it's really $0.4908 versus $0.5509, which shows about a 12% increase and not a 23% which is on that chart.  Therefore, we think that 12% is very competitive with the industry and it should be a top quartile performance. And it shows that our employees continue to manage their business in a very competitive market.  Our three-year F&D is $1.55 per Mcf, and again we'd like to look at it on a three-year basis and our DD&A is $1.28. So we'll have more comparisons for this as we get a lot of the industry data, but we believe we will remain in the top quartile performance and cost performance.  Slide 23, reserves, which were announced this morning also. Our proved reserves were up approximately 10% or 9.5% to 3.7 Tcfe. Total U.S. and International reserves were 3.9 Tcfe. Again, we had our fourth consecutive year of over 200% domestic reserves replacement. This year it was 216%. And our 99% drilling success rate continues for, I believe the fourth or fifth year in a row.  And in 2006, we had 1,770 successful wells, which were drilled out of a total of 1,783 wells. So, it's a 99.3% success rate. And we were able to add 590 Bcfe to proved.  If you look at just pure probable to proved transfers, over the last three years we've transferred about 1.6 Tcfe through our drilling activity from the probable category to the proved.  In addition to moving this 1.6 Tcfe of probable to proved, our PDP, as a percentage of the total, continues to increase and is now up to 53%. Last year our PDP as a percent of the total was about 49%. So, we continue to convert our probable to proved, and we are also increasing our productive capacity as our PDP percentage continues to increase also.  Slide 24 shows the flying bricks, as we call it, the build-up to get to the 3.7 Tcfe domestic. I won't go into all the numbers there, but you can see we did have a slight bit of acquisitions, primarily in the Barnett of 40 Bcf; additions/revisions, 557 Bcf; and obviously our production is 277. That translates into 3.701 Tcfe, which again gives us the opportunity to have the 216% reserve replacement rate.  Slide 25, cash margin analysis. This is a two-year average, as we are giving guidance now. 2006 has dropped off. First, as you look at this slide, when you look at the realized gas price assumption, the price increase is reflected on that. It's not really an increase in our price assumption, but it's 2006 dropping off. And also, once 2006 drops offs, which has a little bit lower price than what we project for '07 and '08, and had more hedges at much lower prices that increases our realized gas price assumption. Again, it's not an increase in our price assumption. It's just the way the math works out.  You take the $6.04 and from that we would deduct the following items, which are included in the cash costs. LOE, FOE and other, kind of a catch-all expense item is $0.66. That includes all of our expenses gathering about $0.46, operating tax is $0.48 and SG&A about $0.37 on a fully loaded basis. That gives us our cash margin of $4.08.  So, this obviously remains a very profitable business. Another way to look at that is the $4.08, take about $1.50 or so DD&A rate off of that and you can see, obviously that would be your profit line, which is about $2.50 or so on a profit basis.  And looking purely at cash, we are paying about $1.55 on our F&D costs to get this $4.08 type cash margin. We've shown this slide before. So, I won't go in any more detail. But you can see our margins remain very strong.  Looking at slide 26, our guidance updates. Most of these increases we experienced in 2006. So, really what we are doing is carrying forward our increases we had in 2006 into this 2007 and 2008 timeframe.  First of all, if you look at increased costs and facilities in 2007, it's $90 million. About $20 million to $30 million of that is for facilities. And recall, our production continues to increase rapidly more than we even thought in the Piceance, and also there is a very long lead time in facilities. So, what we are doing is accelerating our facilities into this year and also add more production, and there is some cost pressure on the facilities side. And that's for compression gathering and obviously the plants that we've been building.  Then if you look at that on a cost basis, really just the straight-up costs, they were up on a CapEx side about 5% to 7% during the year, and we are basically carrying that forward into 2007. So, that's the difference in the guidance update that makes the $90 million.  Fort Worth, as I mentioned, we had one to two in the plan. We are now running three rigs. We have about 20,000 net acres there, about $33 million a day of gross production. So, we are enjoying some success there. So, we've added some opportunities and some additional drilling there.  And then other opportunities, which I think will ultimately to even a greater future or things such as Barcus Creek, and Paradox and other areas where we have some activity going. And they expose us to multi-Tcfe potential on down the road assuming they would be successful.  The key for us is those two, the Fort Worth and other opportunities they are really not impacting our current profits. So thus our profit guidance is not up. But they will impact, we believe, longer range segment profit. So, they don't impact enough in 2007-2008 at this time to revise our profit range, but they are enough to do up the capital range for that. But obviously, we believe those give us tremendous amount of opportunities going forward. And thus, hopefully longer-term guidance would also maybe able to be influenced by those if we are successful, and I have to stress that if we are successful.  Looking at the bottom part, the segment profit guidance range. What we've done is we've widened our gas price assumptions, which are in the appendix, and also on the next slide, I can talk about that. So, that shows that the range is wider just because the gas prices have a wider range in 2007 at this time. Although, they do appear to be getting a little more bullish than they were in early January. And then increased operating expenses, once again, we are carrying forward what we experienced in 2006 and also the increased capital we spent in 2006 to accelerate production that's part of that.  So basically we are seeing about half of that increases in our DD&A and half is in operating expenses. So that influences the range there as you can see.  So we have seen cost increases, but our team continues to manage it very well on the CapEx side. On the drilling side, it's about 5% to 7%. And on the LOE cost, as you saw from last year, it was about a 12% increase. And we have carried that forward, meaning not really accelerated that too much for '07, but carried that increase going forward.  Slide 27 that just leads to our guidance slide. I won't walk you through this, but this leads to the changes we have. Obviously wider price range, for example, the NYMEX price range we have in this is more like $7 to $8.30 range. I think previously we had like $7 and some odd cent range. Basin prices depend on location. We have a $5.10 to $7.40 type basin range. So very wide ranges and thus, the wide range in profitability.  One key that's not on this slide is, if you look at these ranges and you compare them to 2006 results, we really have a very optimistic outlook in the sense of aggressive outlook for this year, that with legacy hedges going away and our production continue to incline. If you compare our Point estimate for 2006 or well I guess that would be our actual result to these ranges, you can see that the profit range would be between 27% to 77% increase and that obviously depends a lot on the gas price assumptions. And our production range would be increased between 13% to 25%. So we believe will continue to have very strong performance in '07.  Finally, slide 28. It is important just to summarize, we did have a greater than 200% reserve replacement. Our success rate was 99%. We continue to be blessed with the long-term inventory. We are adding to that inventory with the new projects that we are doing. We believe we will add to that.  And, I think it is very important that I end with, the outside world is recognizing and validating what we believe the true strength we have is in our employees, who work in this asset and work in the E&P side for us. They are managing this vast portfolio, and it's nice to see the outside world has given us some awards in terms of the Oil and Gas Investor Best Field Rejuvenation in San Juan and obviously the Hydrocarbon Producer of the Year at the Global Energy Awards. So I can't thanks our employees enough for a very good and strong 2006.  Thank you. And, I will now turn over to Alan Armstrong. 
Alan Armstrong: Thanks Ralph. Midstream had a great year by about any measure. We will start off here on slide 30 and highlight our 2006 accomplishments. 2006 was a record year for profits. We generated $733 million in recurring segment profit. This was 55% increase over the previous record of $471 million in 2005. Certainly record unit margins were big part of the story. The recent all time high per unit margins as we have averaged about $0.33 per gallon, which doubled the 2002 through 2006 average of about $16.4 per gallon.  Additionally across all the plants we operate, we set a new total liquids production record of almost 2.6 billion gallons in 2006. Our productive capacity in 2007 is even greater as our Cameron Meadows plant has now been fully restored and our new train at Opal kicks in this month.  In any other year, the highlight would be our deepwater fee-based revenues which grew by 49% to $158 million from our 2005 level of $106 million. This increase was led primarily by our new volumes at our Devils Tower infrastructure in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico.  We are also very excited about how well our new MLP performed in a low cost of capital, we now have available to grow our Midstream business. As we stated previously, this low cost of capital is critical to our strategy of operating large scale and reliable infrastructures in these basins that are continuing to grow for us.  Turning now to the growth picture for Midstream, we continue to have great expectations for our deepwater expansion programs. Our Tahiti, Blind Faith, and Perdido Norte projects are all in various stages of planning and construction.  In fact, Pipeline for discoveries extension to Chevron's Tahiti prospect out in 4400 feet of water began just last week and our investment in deepwater assets is now roughly $1 billion. When these three projects are completed, we will have approximately $1.7 billion invested in the deepwater infrastructure.  Our Western expansion efforts began with the purchase of Opal TXP-IV in the first quarter of 2006 and also our breaking ground on our fifth train at Opal was also in the first quarter of '06.  Today, we are happy to announce that on February 17, 2007, we placed Opal TXP-V in service. And at our midpoint commodity price assumption, we anticipate nearly $50 million in segment profit from the first full calendar year of operating this fifth train.  Probably one of the highest value transactions that we did in 2006, however, was the development of Overland Pas Pipeline project, which will provide roughly $20 million per year of tariff savings when this project starts up in 2008. And, we will likely see even greater net backs for liquids as we gain access to both Conway and Mount Belleview markets for the same rate.  Turn now to slide 31. As we just discussed, these large deepwater projects are dominating the expansion capital that we currently have in guidance for '07 and 08. Additionally, we have capital spending lining down on our Opal TXP-V project, but we are installing quite a bit of new compression in Wyoming and Four Corners that is trying to keep up with the robust drilling environment that we're seeing out west.  Looking to this middle pie chart, we have some exciting opportunities we're closing in on in this area as well. One of the more interesting opportunities is the establishment of a Deep Cut Gas processing facility in the Piceance Basin. Our E&P Group has established significant infrastructure to service Piceance's position. It now makes sense to leverage off of this and establish a midstream presence to extract the higher valued liquids, and to aggressively expand this footprint to provide third party services to the multitude of new production developments in this expansive basin.  This opportunity brings Williams businesses together in a truly integrated solution to develop the reserves in the Piceance Basin. And it also allows us to bring the full suite of Midstream services that we know how to deliver for these rapidly expanding basins. You will also note in the emergency opportunity pie chart over on the left, is a slice labeled Canadian Oilsands.  Canadian Oilsands is another area that provides tremendous growth potential via the processing of oilsands off-gas.  There are currently nine announced off-gas generating upgraders that could collectively generate from about $200 million to over $1.2 billion of the NGL from product value annually by 2020. So we see this as a very long-term opportunity for us. But tremendous amount of growth and as you are all very aware, very limited declines on the extraction of those oilsands.  We're extremely well-positioned to take advantage of this growth at our Fort McMurray facility, is located in the heart of the oilsands country and is the only facility of its kind currently operating in this exciting region.  Turning on to slide 32. This slide will look familiar to many of you. However, we have changed it just a little bit. The main message remains that we continue to generate very strong free cash flows and attractive returns under a wide range of commodity price assumptions.  As before, segment profit plus DD&A is stated on a recurring basis with both capital expenditures and segment profit components shown at the midpoint of their respective guidance ranges. The midpoint of our guidance for segment profit plus DD&A for '07 and '08 is shown by the height of the solid blue bar. And the zebra strike boxes that you see just above that, on top of the blue bar represent the difference between the midpoint and the high end of our guidance range. This high end of the guidance range assumes a recurrence of exactly the commodity pricings that we saw in 2006.  Relative to the attractive returns, you need to know that this $934 million recurring segment profit plus DD&A that we generated in '06 came from only $3.3 billion in net PP&E and long-term investments. You can do the math, but under just about any return measure you choose to employ here, these are very attractive returns. And the strong returns and free cash flows continue in '07 and '08, even with the lower projected NGL margins and heavy investment period as we aggressively expand our footprint in the deepwater.  Move to the closing slide now and key points on slide 33. Midstream certainly has enjoyed the benefits of record NGL margins and very strong production volumes in 2006. Under historically typical crude-to-gas price relationships, Midstream's margins cushion the impact of lower gas prices on the rest of our enterprise. That was certainly the case in 2006.  However, even with a more moderate pricing assumption, this business generates very attractive financials. Midstream is well positioned for growth on a number of fronts, like the opportunities in the Western US as we've demonstrated with our rapid expansion of Opal and the Midstream opportunities that we are now pursuing in the Piceance Basin.  The aggressive build-out of the key infrastructure that will serve the deepwater Gulf for years to come continues, and we intend to attract additional opportunities through being a highly reliable service provider in these basins. In a similar way our position in the Canadian Oilsands off-gas processing business, positions us for emerging basins or another emerging basin that we will serve there.  The last year has demonstrated a new high watermark for NGL margins and of course highlights the challenge that we've got in developing profit guidance in this type of environment.  So the low end of our guidance range for '07 and '08 are based on crude-to-gas ratios of about 7.4 and the upper end is based on crude-to-gas ratios of about 9.6, which as I stated earlier was exactly what we experienced in '06. But under either scenario, this is an attractive business generating attractive returns relative to its cost to capital and continued free cash flows.  But what will really keep this business healthy in the long-term, is our organization's commitment and focus on providing our customers the most reliable service available.  Thanks and with that I will turn it over to Phil Wright. 
Phil Wright: Thank you Alan, slide 35 please. Operationally and commercially 2006 was a great year with completion of our 26 inch capacity replacement project on time and within budget. Significant contract extensions on Northwest Pipeline and very importantly and as you may have noticed, the settlement of our Northwest rate case was certified by the Administrative Law Judge in the case to the full commission yesterday.  On our Transco system, we continued to serve growth in our customers' markets, as evidenced by the receipt of FERC approval for our Leidy to Long Island Expansion Project, execution of precedent agreements totaling 142,000 dekatherms a day with shippers on our Sentinel expansion. And in the first expansion beyond the initial design capacity of the system, we filed an application at the FERC for the Phase IV expansion of Gulf stream.  Lastly, but certainly not least of these accomplishments is the even higher results we received from our customers on both Transco and Northwest, where we continued to be first in customer satisfaction.  Slide 36, please. I am very proud of our team and most appreciative of the spirit of collaboration among our customers in reaching the recently certified settlement of our Northwest Pipeline rate case. The quick resolution of the case is a testament to a quality customer relationship.  We certainly believe the overall settlement provides Northwest a fair and acceptable return. But just as importantly, our customers and other interested parties involved in the negotiations agreed that it was fair resolution of all the issues in the case. Furthermore, it will provide our customers rate certainty for the next few years. I think the fact that we reached a settlement on an expedited basis will serve us all well.  This is the first rate case that Northwest has filed in 10 years, which is due to the fact that Northwest has worked diligently to manage its costs. The settlement was negotiated on what is called in rate case parlance, a "Black Box" basis. And therefore, most of the assumptions including rate of return were not identified.  Next slide please. Our maintenance capital expenditure projections remain unchanged from prior guidance. Changes to our expected expenditures for major growth projects include, an increase in the cost of our Parachute Lateral due to terrible weather, tightness in contract availability and late receipts of some key permits. The total estimated cost is now pegged at $86 million.  We've shifted some expenditures on Sentinel from 2008 to 2009 to match the phasing of the project. And we have decided to postpone applying for a certificate to construct the Greasewood Lateral project. Northwest will continue to work with potential shippers, who may be interested in capacity on the proposed lateral.  If in the future we decide to move forward with the project and seek certification to construct for a later end-service date, we will post such a decision on the Northwest Pipeline company website. But for purposes planning, we will be pulling that project out of this range of guidance.  Next slide please. This map shows where we are on previously announced growth projects. In the Northwest, at our Jackson Prairie storage field where we are a one-third owner in the facility near Chehalis, Washington, we have an incremental firm storage capacity expansion underway.  You probably saw where the open season on the Pacific Connector project will close on March 1st. As I mentioned, to facilitate movement of Exploration and Production's, gas out of the Piceance Basin, the Parachute Lateral project is well on its way to completion.  As we continue to support growth in our customers' markets along Transco and Gulfstream, we enjoy terrific growth projects. The Leidy to Long Island expansion project has been approved for start-up construction, and the Potomac expansion of 165,000 dekatherms a day beginning to be constructed in November 2007.  We signed seven separate precedent agreements with shippers totaling a 142,000 dekatherms a day for our Sentinel expansion. As I previously mentioned, we've got great expansions, both well on their way and in the final phases of kick-off of construction on Gulfstream.  Last slide please. So, again, a strong year operationally and commercially in 2006, with the completion of the 26 inch capacity replacement project on time and within budget. Excellent growth projects progressing with in service dates approaching. And a resurgence in segment profit and free cash flow generation for the Williams' portfolio being supported by our new rate cases and lower capital expenditures.  Finally, the strength of our performance was recognized at the Global Energy Awards, where we were a finalist for Energy Transporter of the Year.  With that, I'll turn it over to Bill Hobbs. 
Bill Hobbs: Thanks, Phil. We are now on slide 41. We had a strong 2006, and I am proud of our employees for the effort that they delivered. We did deals across all of our power regions creating about $120 million of cash flow certainty. Our financial results improved $87 million year-over-year. We were also successful in contracting with both power and natural gas customers. And we continue to focus on a high level of service for our Midstream and E&P businesses.  2006 also represented the fourth consecutive year of positive cash flow out of Power business. We continue to see the market fundamentals improve. Market liquidity, market participants, and our own credit in the market continues to improve. And as you heard about Ralph's growing E&P business, we are now marking over Bcf a day of equity in third-party production.  Turning our attention to 2007, on slide 42, we are off to a great start. As Steve indicated, we have cracked the 2010 barrier with our sales to So Cal Edison in the West. We are currently sold out through 2010 of our capacity, which we view as a positive, given the still uncertain regulatory environment that you see in California. And we have sold 60% of our capacity in 2011.  But also in the Northeast, we continue to be very active and very successful. We also made our first sales beyond 2010 in PJM. The PJM market, the capacity market, continues to improve, and you are seeing higher capacity values across the board in PJM. And the way we have structured our sales, we still have energy spark spread upside in the future. As the market continues to unfold, I do expect that we will be coming back to you before the end of the year with additional sales beyond 2010.  Slide 43 is a recap and shows in effect the success of our strategy we have had since 2002 and also the great start we are off to in 2003. As the title indicates, already alone in 2007, the first two months of the year, we have created $250 million of additional cash flow certainty, which is double what we created throughout the entire year in 2006.  So in summary, we had a great 2006. We are off to a great start in 2007. And as I indicated, I expect to be back to you before the year is over with additional sales beyond 2010.  With that, I will turn it back to Don. 
Don Chappel: Thank you, Bill. Let's turn to slide number 45. Our 2007 forecast guidance. Our 2007 guidance range is wide as Steve indicated, principally as a result of volatility in energy prices. During the last year, as you know, we have seen a wide variety of prices for NGLs, natural gas and oil. And oil certainly has an effect on both NGL and natural gas prices.  Nonetheless, we do believe that prices and margins will continue to remain attractive over the long term such that our investments continue to return very attractive rates of return, as well as provide us with additional attractive opportunities for investment. Just as a point of reference, the 2006 average WTI crude oil price was about $66, and we earned $1.17 on a recurring basis adjusted for mark-to-market effects.  Our guidance ranges assume that oil prices will range between about $53 and $73 with the midpoint in the mid-60s. We also assume that NGL prices will continue to correlate closely with oil. Natural gas prices are less of a factor due to financial hedges and offsetting exposures in our E&P and Midstream businesses. And we'll talk more about that in just a moment, as well as some other assumptions.  With that, let's turn to slide next, number to 46. 2007 to 2008 segment profit. This slide summarizes what you have heard from each of our business unit leaders, and also gives you consolidated total. As you can see, the $1.9 billion to$2.4 billion total for 2007, is up from 2006, and by 2008, our estimate is $2.125 billion to $2.975 billion. The midpoint increase is about $400 million or 19%.  Turning the slide to number 47, please. This summarizes our change in segment profit forecast since the November call. As you can see there, we had a reduction in the mid-point of our NGL margins of about $25 million and again, as we saw some softness in oil and some additional costs that Ralph went through in his discussion of E&P.  The next slide please, number 48. This is a summary of our commodity price assumptions. Ralph highlighted some of these. But you can see in the natural gas area. Basin prices in the Rockies are between $5.10 and $6.40, both in 2007 and 2008. And in the San Juan and Mid-Continent area, again averaging for the year between $6.10 and $7.40 in both the years. The NYMEX price is provided for reference only, but we actually build our forecast based on our forecast of basin prices.  Midstream, as Alan mentioned, would assume crude oil to natural gas, that's WTI crude to Henry Hub of 7.4 to 9.6 times. And again in 2006, we experienced that 9.6 times. And again, the crude oil is a reference because it has an impact on other prices.  The next slide please, number 49. It is just an update on our hedges. We have had added some additional hedges since we last reported to you and they were in the form of collars at the Basin. But as you can see here, we have a substantial amount of volume hedged both in 2007 and 2008. An upcoming slide will show you how significant that is.  I'd also note that we are still burdened by the legacy fixed price hedges at the basin. The first one on the slide, which were put in place back in the 2002 and prior periods where we had a 172 million a day at $3.90 in '07 and 73 million a day at $3.96 in 2008, as well, we're disclosing in the footnote that the only additional remaining legacy hedges are in 2009 and 2010 and none thereafter. But the 2009 volume actually increases to 129 million a day and the price declines to 3.67. And then in 2010, it's 70 million a day at 3.73. So, we wanted to provide that for your reference. And again these legacy hedges expire at the end of 2010.  The next slide please, number 50. This is just the graphical depiction of our natural gas exposure. The top of the bar here, at nearly 750 million a day is the net E&P production. And as you can see in the gold area, that's the amount of production that's hedged, and the blue area would be the unhedged E&P production.  The purplish area below the zero line would be the amount of fuel and shrink consumed by our Midstream business. And as you can see that fuel and shrink almost perfectly offsets the E&P unhedged production, and the net position, therefore is just slightly long, as depicted by the red line.  By 2008, our E&P production increases once again and the financial hedges diminish somewhat. However, the Midstream fuel & shrink increases, as that business grows. So the offsetting position isn't as significant and the net position is long, just short of 250 million a day. But again, on our yearly Bcfe of gross production, the net natural gas exposure is reduced to about 250 million a day in 2008.  The next slide please, number 51. Capital expenditures, again, this summarizes what the business unit leaders already spoke to. Note, the total CapEx, 2.225 billion to 2.425 billion, up a bit from our prior call as a result of some increasing investments as well as some increased costs. I would also note that we do expect capital expenditures to increase, as we continue to seize attractive, value-adding opportunities in our core businesses. And again, I think Ralph spoke to some of those opportunities. Alan outlined in some detail, some of those opportunities, as did Phil.  The next slide provides some additional information. I will speak to cash flow from operations and operating free cash flow. Cash flow from operations, guidance is unchanged from our November guidance at $2 billion to $2.3 billion in '07 and $2.4 billion to about $2.8 billion in 2008.  Being free cash flow remains negative in 2007, as a result of the very substantial growth CapEx, and by 2008, in this analysis, it turns positive.  However, again I would caveat that we are pursuing substantial additional investment opportunities that we believe will continue to add value, very attractive rates of return, adding EVA, and we will continue to update you on those as we move forward.  Good news here is we have MLP capital that can fund the great deal of these projects via dropdowns. Again, very attractive low cost MLP capital can be raised rather than Williams' equity capital to fund such investments.  I would also note that this guidance does not assume any additional dropdowns of Midstream assets to WPZ. It's not to say that we don't intend to make such dropdowns, we've just not modeled that and we're not providing any guidance with respect to those dropdowns.  The next slide, page 53, is an analysis of our cash balance through 2007. And you can see, we do have a very substantial cash balance plus, and additionally, a very substantial unused credit facility. The credit facility is used principally at this point to support our marginable hedging positions. But the cash available is above $1.9 billion of the total. Cash flow from operations will generate an additional $2 billion to $2.3 billion.  Capital spending, as I indicated, $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion and growing, and if you back out the additional activity, we see here yields, an expected surplus in the $600 million to $700 million range. And again, we will consume a substantial amount of that with some additional growth opportunities and then we have some additional cash for general corporate purposes and we'll consider what the best use of that is when considering equity value and credit considerations.  Slide number 54, just some key points. Again, we are very much focused on driving and enabling sustainable EVA growth and growth in shareholder value. The MLP is key to us and it continues to enable us to grow without issuing Williams' equity. That low-cost equity capital will fund much of our growth and the growing incentive distributions and GP value will create some nice uplift.  We'll continue to focus on maintaining and/or improving our credit ratios and ratings. We think that's key, and particularly so, given our MLP dropdown strategy because WPZ will be in the market issuing debt as well as equity. And WPZ's debt ratings and the market's appetite for WPZ debt will be closely associated with Williams' credit as well. So we think it's important to maintain or improve our credit ratings and ratios in order to ensure that we have adequate capacity and attractive pricing of the debt capital markets, as well as with our bank facilities and alike. We'll continue to reduce risk in the Power segment as Bill outlined. We continue to be opportunity-rich as each of our business leaders have pointed out to you.  With that, I'll turn it to Steve. 
Steve Malcolm: Thanks Don. Slide 56, we've looked at this before. But again, I want to assure you that our team will be intensely focused on these catalysts of value creation during 2007. And I encourage you to watch for our progress in these areas during the year.  My last slide, slide 57, our portfolio of natural gas businesses is delivering strong results. There's no doubt about that. Again, we have premier assets that are opportunity-rich. We are pursuing growth with discipline. We have generated a solid record of results, and we are taking action to drive value creation in the future.  So with that, we will be happy to take your questions. 
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We will go first to Carl Kirst of Credit Suisse. 
Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse: Hey good morning everybody and congratulations on a nice quarter certainly. If I can start actually on the E&P side Ralph, we got a little bit of cost creep coming in here. The first thing, as I just want to make sure I understand that the $150 million of the CapEx rise here in 2007, given that we have additional opportunity, we really shouldn't only be looking at that, half of that as far as capital efficiency slippage. Is that correct? 
Ralph Hill: Yes, I think exactly. The Fort Worth is additional drilling, that's 30. New opportunities in areas that we talked about before, acreage personnel and additional acreage purchases, that's about $30 million, so that's $60 million of it. Then in the $90 million number, there's about $25 million or so that's actually facilities. The facilities do have some cost creep in it, but a lot of it is we continue to accelerate all our facilities because of the long lead times.  So really, you're looking at about a $70 million to $80 million number, over about a $1.3 billion budget. So it is not a huge increase, but it is an increase, obviously, with just the scale of the numbers we have now. 
Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse: Sure. Perhaps maybe even more of my real question, if you can kind of step back and give me your sense of what you think the cost curve is going forward for, in particular, the Rockies E&P. I'm trying to look at in the context of basically flat CapEx guidance into 2008. It looks like the situation you guys are setting up is basically $1.3 billion, continuing into 2008, and yet generating EBITDA substantially greater than that, while still achieving double-digit production growth, which is a pretty strong metric. I'm trying to figure out how much risk there could be in that number, at least you perceive in that number, that that $1.3 billion could become $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion, so to speak. 
Ralph Hill: Well, at this point we feel that we baked in the cost increase, we have to see. We are not anticipating '07 will be as high increases as we saw like in '05 and '06. The second thing is a lot of potential increase in CapEx would be from these new opportunities that would come in. So at this point, we feel we've got the increases baked in that we need to have baked in. Obviously, we continue to negotiate strongly with our vendors and others. But we do feel that we're at the right level at this point. An increase in cost would primarily be due to new activity. 
Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse: Okay. Then lastly on E&P. You're guiding us understandably to sort of three-year average F&D to smooth things out. The F&D in 2006 notably, obviously, higher than that. I don't know, can you sort of prognosticate here a little bit into 2007. I think the three-year F&D is clearly going to continue to rise, as it is for everyone. But is it possible that we could see a reversion in that $238 million back closer towards the three-year average? Or have we basically kind of reset a new baseline? 
Ralph Hill: Well, a couple of things. I think one thing that's in there, and when you get to the one-year F&D, I think you mentioned $238 million or so. It's actually you take a couple hundred million dollars of facilities out. It's more like a $215 million. What we're seeing is obviously some of the years we had, three years ago, a low capital investments, a lot of downspacing, very low F&D. But obviously, that's part of the reality of what our costs were.  Facilities drop, another reason, just to back up on your question a minute ago, 2008 has about probably $150 million less facility investment than 2007. So that's another reason why CapEx goes down. Or it goes down for facilities, but not necessarily for drilling. So that's back to your previous question.  So I think, as we move forward, what we're seeing is our budget is fairly high, as you see, and it's a very strong budget, more than we're used to. You see our track record has been 500 Bcf to 600 Bcf a year of reserve adds, so that obviously increases the F&D side going forward, but still keeps us very competitive. There won't be years as we've seen in the past, we're primarily in '03 and '04 where we didn't have that bigger budget, we had a lot down spacing.  Now going forward, we are down spacing additional reserves, but we are also spending a lot of capital now to increase their productive capacity. But a portion of our capital now is obviously spending on making the PUDs translate into PDPs. But we feel very good that we've been able to spend a lot of money on that, but in addition, spend enough money that will continue to add quite a bit of reserves. 
Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse: Great. So, just the less facility spending there, the goal is here to actually have a lower F&D in 2007? 
Ralph Hill: Well, that would be, we will have less F&D in 2008, and I am sorry less facility in 2008 than 2007. So that would lower on the gross cost, absolutely. 
Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse: Great. And then last question I promise. Bill on the Power side, you have mentioned that we're hoping to get some more hedges beyond 2010, by end of year 2007. Can you help us out, that are we looking at slowly pushing out the end of low i.e., doing more deals in the 2011 and 2012, or is there the potential to take even a greater chunk down into, say for instance the team? 
Bill Hobbs: Yeah Carl. What we're seeing and I have talked in the past about the normal utility contracting cycle usually runs in three to five-year increments. So I think, with the utility sector largely, with the deals that we're looking at are going to stay in the 2010-2011-2012 timeframe.  But the banks are starting to look a little bit further out. In that we're seeing numbers quoted now, especially in PJM, as far as 2013 or 2014. Also, some of the industry players who have taken capacity, like in some of the Northeast expansion projects, are looking for long-term supplies as far out as 2020.  So we're certainly talking to people in all those time horizons. I'm optimistic that we're going to have success, but certainly they're competitive and we are not [buying or selling] our portfolio. So it's going to come down to price, ultimately. 
Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse: Great. Thanks and good luck. 
Operator: Thank you. We will go next to Shneur Gershuni of UBS. Mr. Gershuni, please go ahead, your line is open. 
Shneur Gershuni - UBS: Can you hear me now? 
Operator: Thank you. Please go ahead. 
Shneur Gershuni - UBS: Hi. Just had a quick question with respect to the Power contract that was signed today. In the past, you have put out disclosures in the back about cash flows with respect to the Power business and whatnot. I was wondering if you can tell us if the business in 2011 is set to be cash flow positive, just based on committed cash flows? 
Bill Hobbs: Well, if you look at the slide, which I believe is 43, it shows you the amount of hedged activity we have, which is still short of our demand payments. And the blue shaded area represents what our models would suggest. We're going to realize if we took all those megawatts into the market, which we are clearly not. We will continue to contract for sales in the 2011 and beyond timeframe.  I think I'll just point out, the deals that we are doing, if you went back historically and you looked at some of our tutorials, the levels we're contracting at are either equal or higher to those levels we forecasted. So, to me, these sales, we're starting to realize do support the fact that we have been fairly spot-on, as far as our future cash flow forecast. 
Shneur Gershuni - UBS: Okay. That answers my question here and I can't pretty much ask the rest of my questions. So, thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. We will go next to Faisel Khan of Citigroup. 
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Good morning. The first question I have is on the pipeline side. If I go back in time and look at some of the costs and SG&A, they seem to be rising pretty steadily over the last eight quarters. And I know you have talked about this in the past, in terms of integrity costs and stuff like that. But going forward, how should those numbers be moving around? 
Phil Wright: I'll try to respond to that as best I can. I would say that, first of all, we don't want to mix up the G&A and necessarily the integrity costs. We have seen some increased A&G, increased labor and the like. But, as Don pointed out, had cost increases baked into our rate recovery. And so that's a way to think about that. Clearly, cost control is among the highest priorities we have in our business. So, we see nothing on the horizon that would cause us to think that there's any kind of trend here for sharply increasing A&G. 
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: What about reducing it? Are there opportunities, you think, over time to reduce SG&A? 
Phil Wright: Potentially, yes. 
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: And then, if I'm looking at the revenue requirement for Northwest, you said about $404 million. If I look back in time, it looks like that roughly in the FERC filings; we're at $320 million. So basically, the $80 million improvement in revenues, does that drop straight through to the bottom line? Is that the right way to look at it? 
Phil Wright: I don't think that would be an accurate way to look at it. It's not a one-for-one type of a relationship, Faisel. 
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: And then on the Power side. Basically, the deal that was announced today, basically that are capacity deals, is that right? You are basically selling capacity in the plants you currently contract at? Is that fair to say? 
Bill Hobbs: Actually, it's a resell of toll. Where basically, we had resold our tolling obligations to Southern California Edison. So it would include both capacity and energy. 
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Capacity and energy. Okay. Is there any way to back into a capacity price, in terms of how you sold those 2 gigawatts of power? Is there any way to back into that? 
Bill Hobbs: Not really. Not unless for some reason, SCE has to disclose it publicly. 
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay. Which 2 gigawatts of the AES 4000 plants, were these? Were these like the higher heat rate stuff, or was it kind of across the board? 
Bill Hobbs: No, it was a mix. A mix of the higher heat rates. In fact, I believe and I will confirm this. I think they took most of the higher heat rate units, and we still have, in 2011 the remaining capacity, I think, is more efficient units. 
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: What does this mean in terms of kind of having to be able to re-power some of those assets, over the long run? 
Bill Hobbs: That would be something we would assess independently. The sales we are making now are pretty existing megawatts we have. Clearly, California needs capacity. And that's something that if we are able to work through it with AES, we would be bringing it to Steve and Don to look at future re-powering rights that we have in California. 
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay. And then in PJM, you said you sold 20% of your capacity there for, I think, the next year or two. What was the capacity price that you were able to sell some of that power at? 
Bill Hobbs: Again, we can't disclose what we sold, our pricing. But with the PJM market, it is an active capacity market. There's market participants that are out there. Basically it's run in the range of $110 to $150. 
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay. And then on the MLP, is there additional cost in your corporate O&M from running that separate entity? Or is it fair to say that that's part of your general G&A? Has there been an additional expense of running that separate entity? 
Bill Hobbs: Faisel, there are additional costs. They are relatively modest. They are few million dollars a year, and they are included in the consolidated results. 
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay. And when you raised that at the MLP that interest expense is consolidated in your overall corporate guidance, is that right? 
Bill Hobbs: That is correct. 
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay. And then to the extent that you raised debt there, there might be timing issues in terms of how pay down debt at the C Corp, is that fair to say also? 
Bill Hobbs: Yes, it is. That is fair to say. 
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay. And on the E&P side, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the opportunities. You talked about previously, I guess, in the Paradox basin. What's going on there and what type of opportunities are you likely to see out of that position you have? 
Bill Hobbs: Well in the Paradox, we have drilled two exploratory wells and we are doing extensive core analysis. And after the core analysis on the first well, we have set casing and we are beginning testing and we are currently evaluating that results. And, we will do the same with the second well. So, obviously we have drilled two, have done a tremendous amount of core analysis, and felt good enough to get into set casing and begin testing to see what's out there. So that's the update on the Paradox.  We have two more exploratory tests, we will drill in this year in the other parts of our acreage holding there.  And then in the Barcus Creek, I believe we have drilled several wells. We are testing the first couple and we have a total counting last year that we spud. And this year, we will drill five wells in the Barcus Creek area this year to test that area. And that’s just north of Ryan Gulch.  So those are primarily the areas that are affecting 2007, and we remain optimistic in those areas. 
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay, great. Thanks for the time guys. 
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Sam Brothwell of Wachovia. 
Sam Brothwell - Wachovia: Hi good morning. On the Power business, have your thoughts evolve at all strategically on what you might do in that longer term. I know you kind of address the possibility of re-powering. Are you thinking about possibly looking at selling that again, or increasing its profile within the corporation? 
Steve Malcolm: Sam, this is Steve. Our plans and strategies are unchanged from that we've had in mind since we brought the business back and decided to retain the business in the fall of 2004. We are not really seeking to expand our footprint. We are more all about reducing risks, maximizing cash, satisfying our existing customer commitments. And as you have seen here most recently pricing more megawatts into the marketplace beyond 2010. So I think that is a good summary of where we are with respect to the business today. 
Sam Brothwell - Wachovia: Do you think it could become more of a value generator over time? 
Steve Malcolm: I think that certainly we are beginning to see some uptick in people's perception of Power. In certain of the geographic areas where we have facilities, we have seen some excess capacity begin to be worked off. And we're seeing some people pay up for assets and so clearly, the overall feeling about the business appears to be improving. 
Sam Brothwell - Wachovia: Okay. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Gordon Howald of Calyon. 
Gordon Howald - Calyon: Hey guys, good morning. Most of the questions have been answered related to power. But regarding Midstream, certainly, it's possible that Midstream assets could continue to command today's higher multiples, but we all know markets are fickle. What sense of urgency, Steve, do you have or does Williams have for more dropdown transactions? You kind of alluded to it earlier, that some could be done. But could you provide a range of what you would anticipate in 2007? And would you at some point consider FERC-regulated pipelines for MLPs, once the tax issues at FERC are resolved? 
Steve Malcolm: With respect to Midstream, Gordon, I wouldn't in any way suggest that we have any sense of urgency. I think I would simply go back to what we've done. We did $1.6 billion last year. And what we have said is that we do have a significant inventory of assets, sufficient to support dropdowns in the $1 billion to $2 billion per year over the next few years. And really, that's all the guidance or all the comments that I have to offer today, with respect to the Midstream dropdowns. In terms of gas pipes, we continue to evaluate that issue, and are open-minded going forward. 
Gordon Howald - Calyon: Great. Thank you for that. And one other quick question on the H&P rigs, you got those 10 under contract. I think those are two-year contracts. How does it work in terms of rolling those contracts forward? And do you have a sense of what the costs could be for those rigs in 2008 and 2009, when those contracts come due? 
Steve Malcolm: No, I don't have a thought of that. They were three-year agreements from the time they started drilling, basically. So our first one, we just started drilling in, I think, January and February of last year, we have 2 years left on. And that last one spud in December, so we have three years left on that. We had first-mover advantage, and from what I can tell, what they are doing with the other subsequent flex rigs, our day rate is about $5,000 to $6,000 less per day than what we see competitively out there.  And I think, moving forward, when these start to roll over, it depends on what the market is doing at that time. We just don't know. There's no locked-in price past there, but obviously we have the first, essentially, call, if you will, on keeping those rigs. 
Gordon Howald - Calyon: Great. That's it, and I appreciate that. Thanks guys. 
Operator: Thank you. We will go next to Sven Del Pozzo of John S. Herold. 
Sven Del Pozzo - John S. Herold: Good morning gentlemen. Would you be able to tell me whether out of your 2007 production guidance, of 905 to 1,005 million cubic feet per day, how much of that is US? 
Steve Malcolm: Almost all US. Approximately 50 million to 60 million a day is international; the rest is US. 
Sven Del Pozzo - John S. Herold: Okay. And again, regarding day rates, I'm wondering, with the relatively recent influx of rigs into your fleet, I'm wondering how exposed your rig fleet might be to a prospective decline in day rates, considering the influx of new builds into the market in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2007. 
Steve Malcolm: What I'm seeing is that the new builds that most people have contracted for, are much higher than the conventional rigs that are out there. As I mentioned, have a first-mover advantage that we are lower-priced on all of our new builds in I think most of the industry, if not all industry.  So what you really see is as those new rigs come in, I think what happens in the drilling industry is actually the old rigs and there are some rigs out there built in the '40s and '50s they basically get retired. They just go away.  So I don't see a huge decrease in rig rates going forward from the current levels that we see for new rigs. The good news for us is, if they would go down, they probably would only get down to about where we are already. So I think we already have that advantage. 
Sven Del Pozzo - John S. Herold: Okay. Alright, that's about it. Thanks. 
Steve Malcolm: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. We will go next to Maureen Howe of RBC Capital Markets. 
Maureen Howe - RBC Capital Markets: Thanks very much and good morning. Ralph, I'm sorry to keep coming back to this issue. And I'm just looking for clarification regarding some of the statements you made with respect to answering a previous question. But on page 25 and, I guess, on 22, where you do set out the cost of production. In your cash costs, presumably the cash cost there is $1.81. So that's $0.46 of lease operating expense, and then the balance would be G&A taxes and gathering? 
Ralph Hill: Yes. What it is, and that $1.96 cash cost, $0.46 was 2006 performance. So it's in that range, 50-some-cents for 2007 type. Then we add FOE, which is $0.10 to $0.12 and just other costs, accretion, rentals and those kinds of things all goes in. So the LOE/FOE/other category, in this case. And it's a little apples-to-oranges versus the earlier slide. It's like $0.66. 
Maureen Howe - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. 
Ralph Hill: The gathering was $0.46, operating tax is $0.48, and then SG&A fully loaded including E&P and enterprise is $0.37. So, that adds to your $1.96 cash cost. 
Maureen Howe - RBC Capital Markets: And then the $1.55 which is the three-year average of F&D, but it would relate to 2007-2008 production because that money has already been invested. 
Ralph Hill: That’s the way you look at it. And obviously it will change each year. But, yeah we really invested $1.55 to find this, and now we are producing it. So, that’s the way we look at that. 
Maureen Howe - RBC Capital Markets: And I might I have misheard you, so I am just wondering, I thought you have thrown out and again, in answer to a previous question, a $2.15 F&D number. But I am not sure if that’s right. Because then, I think you said that you expected F&D cost to decline going forward. 
Ralph Hill: Well, I didn’t really predict going forward decline. But if you look at just one year, I think, just take our total capital divided by reserves that for '06 only, I think the one of the previous callers talked about $2.35 or $2.38. In that is included about $125 million of facilities in '06. So, if you take the facilities out, which I would, that makes one year F&D more like 2.15 or so. 
Maureen Howe - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. 
Ralph Hill: What I have seen early comparisons in the industry, most F&D I have seen for one year is more like $3. 
Maureen Howe - RBC Capital Markets: Is that right, okay. So, this -- 
Ralph Hill: So, I think we are still advantaged at 2.15 rate or even say, well let's count everything all at 2.38. I am saying that we are well below the average of the one-year average. I think going forward; I think that our capital budget has been as you see $1.3 or $1.4 billion. 
Maureen Howe - RBC Capital Markets: Right. 
Ralph Hill: Included in '07 is about $200 million of facilities and '08 it's only $65 million of facilities. So the CapEx looks like, it's going down, but a lot of that is just for the facilities as we try to get ahead of the game with facility, which has always been our strategy. So I think that lowers the overall F&D going forward, because we are not spending as much on facilities. But then pure drilling, it probably will stay in this range. Hopefully, we will continue to get better, more efficient, and driver it down a little bit. 
Maureen Howe - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. That's helpful. That clarifies that situation. Thanks for that. And now just moving to Power bill. On page 43, where you do again set out the cash flows going forward based on the contractual arrangement today. And you do say that cash flows do not include the natural gas portfolio. Can you give us an estimate of what the incremental cash might be, say using your forecast range of natural gas prices, what the top-up might be to that? 
Bill Hobbs: Well, really, Maureen, we are not really exposed to natural gas prices. Our natural gas business is primarily marketing E&P gas, which is just transfer pricing, buying, fueling strength for Alan's Midstream business, which is transfer pricing. 
Maureen Howe - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. So you don't have anything specifically in the Power portfolio that might be related to hedging, a spark spread position? 
Bill Hobbs: We certainly, if we are selling power, we are always buying gas, if it is just an outright power sale. The resellers toll, there is no need to purchase gas for it. 
Maureen Howe - RBC Capital Markets: Right. Right. 
Bill Hobbs: We do have some storage positions that are there, primarily again to support E&P, Midstream, and our Power business. But we are always looking to optimize those. But really our natural gas side of our business is tied closely to power, E&P, or Midstream. 
Maureen Howe - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. So I guess I am just confused by this note then. What exactly are you trying say in this note that these cash flows that you are showing here, the once that are contracted our basically the locked-in margin? 
Bill Hobbs: Yeah, we don’t use the term locked-in. We use the term hedge because in fact there is no perfect hedge. But the grey bars and the green bars you're seeing are the expected cash flows from the hedges that we have in place. 
Maureen Howe - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. 
Bill Hobbs: And then the blue bars which suggest, for instance, in California we still have megawatts available in 2011, as well as in the Northeast and our other regions, and the blue bar would represent what we believe the market value of those megawatts are worth. 
Maureen Howe - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. And then just one final question, it relates in part to the Power portfolio, but it's probably more of a question for Don. And that’s, in light of the transactions that you have undertaken on the Power side of the business, where do you think you are relative to your discussions with the credit rating agencies? And again is there any update on what it might take to get back to an investment grade credit rating? 
Don Chappel: I'm excited to have the next conversation with the ratings agencies on this subject. Obviously, they know about it. But we're hopeful that they view it to be a significant step forward. We think it's very significant, and we think that the prospects are for continued good news on the front of being able to hedge some Power cash flows, and we believe that should be a factor in our ratings. In terms of when and how much they will react, it's impossible to know. But we're hopeful that this helps to move the needle with them. 
Maureen Howe - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, thanks for that. Those were my questions. 
Operator: Thank you, we'll go next to Margaret Jones, Citigroup. 
Margaret Jones - Citigroup: I may have missed it, but could you just repeat or tell us what you are planning to do with regard to debt retirement either with the cash that's extra over and above your requirements at this point in time or with future dropdowns to WPZ? 
Don Chappel: Okay. We have made no specific comments with respect to any plans for debt reduction. We have said in the past that from time-to-time we will likely from time to time, we will likely take some of the proceeds from dropdown transactions and reduce debt so the consolidated indebtedness does not go too high. Again, keeping a sharp eye on our credit metrics. So we will certainly be keeping a sharp eye on our credit metrics, and that will guide us as well as looking at other potential uses for that excess cash. 
Margaret Jones - Citigroup: So right now, there is no immediate intention to retire any debt ahead of the maturity date? 
Don Chappel: There's no plan, there's no announcement with respect to that. So it's options that we're considering. And again, we have some capital projects that are on the very near horizon here, in addition to what was built in the guidance. As our business unit leaders referenced. We'll take a look at those capital projects and determine how many of them and in what quantity capital will be required in the near term to fund those projects. And see what's left for further uses. Those uses could include debt reduction. 
Margaret Jones - Citigroup: Thank you very much. 
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from Carl Kirst, Credit Suisse. 
Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse: Yeah, thanks for the time everybody. Just actually a question for Steve. With respect to the international E&P operations, APCO Argentina and like Venezuela, what's changed there? Can you recap for us what the strategic merit is for being down there? 
Steve Malcolm: In Venezuela, we are delighted with the returns that we have seen relative to our investments there. It's difficult to conclude that those are core assets as you would view Midstream assets that we have in the US. However, the performance thus far has been very strong, and while at times the political situation there is challenging, thus far we have been able to successfully motor through those waters.  In terms of APCO Argentina, as you know, we acquired that interest back when Williams acquired Northwest Energy, back in 1983. We have seen the value of our interest there grow significantly over the last few years. So we would see that investment as potential currency for us to perhaps do something in the future, either through a JV or otherwise. 
Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse: Fair enough. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. We will return to Sven Del Pozzo of John S. Herold. 
Sven Del Pozzo - John S. Herold: Hello. Could you walk me through when do you and Anadarko plan to put in a water disposal system in the Big George to lower lifting costs at Big George? 
Ralph Hill: Well, there's quite a bit of discussion going on. As you know, Anadarko already has a water line that takes some of the water out. We are in discussions with them about expanding that, running other lines and those things. But they are still just in the discussion stage.  I can just say that we're very pleased to have them in there. They have taken the lead in that pipeline before we were partners, and I think it's working well for them.  I also think that we will continue to do what we have been doing, which is build reservoirs, aeration, farming, discharging when allowed, which is allowed during part of the year, and that this water pipeline hopefully will give us a great alternative. And at this point, it's just getting through negotiations and discussion, and also the strategy of where we're drilling and where they are drilling.  What they've done is they've taken the Western assets and found a number of stranded wells which we had been mentioning to Western for quite a while. Anadarko is laser-focused on getting those wells to where they are producing water, which ultimately leads to gas. So we appreciate that, and think that the water pipeline is a viable alternative. It's just a matter of finalizing where we are. 
Sven Del Pozzo - John S. Herold: So you'd both like to do it. It's just placement of the pipeline? 
Ralph Hill: Well, I think it seems to be a good alternative. We have not come to the conclusion we are definitely doing on yet. But there is one out there. It looks like there is the opportunity to build spurs off of that one and/or do some looping. That would probably take care of some of the more problem areas we have, in terms of water disposal. So it's a great alternative that we're definitely evaluating closely. 
Sven Del Pozzo - John S. Herold: Okay. Thank you. 
Ralph Hill: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. We will go next to Gary Stromberg of Lehman Brothers. 
Gary Stromberg - Lehman Brothers: Hi. A question for Don. Don, just back to the ratings issues, is there any benefit at all to Williams or Williams Partners achieving an investment-grade rating? Is that a strategic goal for the management team? 
Don Chappel: I don't view it as a strategic goal. However, I think there are some benefits. The benefits include, obviously, lower borrowing costs, lower facility costs. Certainly with WPZ in particular, accessing the debt capital markets on a regular basis. Its access to those debt capital markets through all market conditions is substantially improved with improved credit, as well as the cost of that debt. So I think that's a factor. Additionally, if and when we return to investment-grade ratings, I think we will also be able to sharply reduce our cash position and redeploy that cash in a more productive fashion.  So I think there's a number of benefits. However, I wouldn't view it to be strategic at this point, because we do currently have good access to the capital markets, I believe, because of our positive momentum and the fact the markets view us to be stronger than our rating. 
Gary Stromberg - Lehman Brothers: I would agree with that. Just on the Midstream business, what percentage of that cash flow in 2006 would you say was fee-based versus more floating? 
Alan Armstrong: Of that, probably the best way to measure that would be against the recurring segment profit plus DD&A, because otherwise, you get into a lot of allocations of cost. But of that $934 million, about $440 million of that was NGL-margin related. 
Gary Stromberg - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Great. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Thank you. We will go next to Peter Monaco of Tudor Investment Corporation. 
Peter Monaco - Tudor Investment Corporation: Good morning. Thanks for your time. Not to beat a dead horse, but Don, could you drill down a little bit more what on you all believe to be the optimal capital structure for the firm, sort of down the road a bit, when presumably more of Power is hedged, when presumably E&P, CapEx levels off, etcetera, etcetera? 
Don Chappel: Here is a good question. I don't think I could provide any guidance, other than to point you at credit metrics that would provide us with strong BB to BBB credit. I think it's important, if we are BB, that we have a positive outlook, positive momentum.  And I think it depends on your models. You referenced a number of scenarios there. So again, I think it would depend on the model, in terms of Power and the ratings agencies' views, the debt capital market's views and all. But we would want to be in a position that we could access the capital markets even during turbulent times in the market, and at costs that are affordable. 
Peter Monaco - Tudor Investment Corporation: Okay. I will follow-up separately maybe with some more specific questions. Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. That will conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over for any additional or closing remarks. 
Steve Malcolm: Okay. This is Steve. Thank you very much for your interest in Williams. We are delighted with our results for 2006, very excited about the future. We look forward to talking with you in the future. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you for your participation. That does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Williams Companies Third Quarter 2006 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Travis Campbell, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Travis Campbell: Thank you and good morning, everybody. Welcome to our third quarter call, and thank you for your continued interest in our company. As usual today, you'll hear from Steve Malcolm, our Chairman; and Don Chappel, the CFO; also Ralph Hill, President of our E&P business; and Alan Armstrong, President of the Midstream business, will be making some comments. We're aware that there are a number of other companies that are releasing earnings this morning as well, and know many of you need to listen to those calls. So with that in mind, we have a fairly small number of slides as part of the presentation, especially for us. As with the last quarter, all of our business unit heads are here and present and each of them are available to answer questions after we get through the prepared remarks. As you would expect, all the slides and detail are available -- all the slides and all the detail in the appendix are available and for your use. Before I turn it over to Steve Malcolm, please note that all the slides are on our website in a PDF format. The press release and accompanying schedules are also available on the website. If you look at slide number two and three, titled "Forward-looking Statements," that details various risk factors related to our future outcomes, it's important that you review the information on those slides. Slide number four, oil and gas reserves disclaimer, is also very important. And we urge you to read that slide as well. Also included in the presentation today are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to generally accepted accounting principles. Those schedules follow the presentation and are an integral part of our presentation. So with that, I will turn it over to Steve Malcolm.
Steve Malcolm: Thanks, Travis. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter conference call. We are very excited about our third quarter results. And looking at slide number six, as you can see from these headlines, both quarter-over-quarter and year-to-date numbers are up significantly. Our recurring adjusted earnings per share is up from $0.22 per share last year to $0.28 per share this year, fueled by strong NGL margins and significant increases in production. NGL margins during the quarter, $0.42 a gallon, versus a five-year average of about $0.15 a gallon, versus about $0.20 a gallon experienced a year ago; production, up from 682 a day to 831. As Travis mentioned, Don will be updating you on our quarterly results. We'll also hear from Ralph, who will provide an update on some of the Piceance success. And Alan will fill you in on some exciting opportunities we're seeing in the Western Deepwater. A couple of comments before I proceed. As many of you know, the FERC recently issued an order in a Kern River rate case proceeding. Of particular interest to Williams was the portion of the order addressing Kern River's authorized return on equity. The FERC authorized an 11.2% return on equity for Kern River, which was a modification of an earlier decision by an administrative law judge recommending a return on equity of 9.34%. Certainly the FERC's order on this issue was a significant improvement over the administrative law judge's recommendation. Nevertheless, we remain committed to pursuing higher return levels in our rate cases. The FERC has recognized the importance of continued infrastructure development in this industry, and we believe that authorized returns need to be higher than 11.2% in order to encourage that development. On the topic of MLP drop-downs, and as previously announced, we continue to have a goal of completing additional transactions of approximately 1 billion to 1.5 billion involving gathering and processing assets between us and Williams Partners within the next three months. It is important to remember with respect to our MLP strategy that drop-down transactions are subject to approval by the Board of Directors of both Williams and the general partner of Williams Partners. As well, the terms of certain transactions may be subject to approval by the Conflicts Committee of the Board of Directors of the general partner of Williams Partners. This is about all that we will have to say with respect to our drop-down strategy this morning. Turning to slide seven. I don't intend to cover all of these points, but I believe that we are well-positioned for near to long-term value creation. We have premier assets that are opportunity-rich. We're pursuing growth with discipline. We have had a solid record of delivering results, and in fact have generated more than 100% return to shareholders over the last eight quarters. And I believe we're taking action to drive value creation. And as we've discussed, our MLP and our deep bench of qualifying asset plays an important role in our value creation strategy. The next few slides describe how our portfolio businesses delivers value in a variety of price environments. As this slide, number eight shows, during periods of significant commodity price volatility, our Midstream and E&P businesses have continued to produce positive and growing earnings. Here you see that over the last seven quarters, crude prices have been generally rising, as shown at the top, while natural gas prices, after peaking at historic levels late last year, have come down significantly, shown there in the middle of the slide. But throughout this whole period, our two most commodity price-sensitive segments, E&P and Midstream, have shown steady, combined growth. Another important point is reflected on slide nine. E&P net realized prices have been relatively unaffected by the cash market drop that the industry has experienced. You can see on this slide, over the last five quarters, the Opal and Henry Hub gas prices have had wild swings. Because of hedging and our transportation agreements out of our producing basins, our realized natural gas prices for E&P have fallen less than cash prices, even in what was a highly-volatile commodity price environment. Let me draw your attention to the arrows that highlight our net realized price in the third quarters of 2005 and 2006. Quarter-over-quarter, our net realized price for E&P production was off just 10% from the third quarter of 2005, and compare that with the average cash price moves during those same quarters. At Henry Hub, we saw a drop of nearly 40% from third quarter '05 to third quarter '06, and we saw Opal drop during the same period by 35%. On slide 10, as we have highlighted in the past, Williams is very good at managing the transportation that moves our gas out of the producing basins and on to market. Importantly, in many cases we are moving our production to markets where we can capture a premium over Rockies prices. And as we have said many times in the past, we are a Rockies producer, not necessarily a Rockies price taker. Turning to slide 11, obviously, commodity prices affect Midstream much differently. As you can see from this graph, recent commodity prices have provided us with very strong frac spreads. The effect of weaker natural gas prices in the third quarter in the face of continued strength in crude prices has been very good for our processing business. Slide 12. Therefore, the soft natural gas prices that we have experienced in the Rockies has obviously benefited our Midstream operations. We are a purchaser of Rockies gas to fuel our processing business. And in a strong crude market, lower gas prices dramatically improve the margins for our Midstream business. Another aspect of our portfolio of businesses is our hedging position, as shown on slide 13. Clearly, our E&P production creates a long position for the company. Long, even when you take into account the hedges that we have entered into, as noted by the red line on this graph. Turning to the next slide, slide 14. If you net against our E&P production, the fuel and shrink from our Midstream business, you see that we are slightly short gas for the remainder of 2006, short -- slightly short to balance for 2007, and only in 2008 do we get back into a slightly long position for natural gas. So, I will conclude with slide number 15. Again, we are -- I believe that we are well-positioned for near to long-term value creation. We control premier assets that are rich with growth opportunities. We are pursuing growth with discipline, having adopted the EVA methodology. We have a solid record of delivering results, and we're taking action to drive value creation. So with that, I'll turn it over to Don Chappel.
Don Chappel: Thank you, Steve. Good morning to all of you joining us on the call. I'll quickly run through the highlights of our third quarter and year-to-date results, which are more fully described in our press release and 10-Q. I'll come back later in the call to review some updated guidance and other information. Let's turn to slide number 17 please, financial results. As Steve described, we're delighted with the overall performance of our businesses. I would note that our net income is up sharply. However, net income is included -- includes both nonrecurring items and the mark-to-market effects related to our power business. So you can see on a reported basis net income is up sharply for the quarter; somewhat down on a year-to-date basis. A more transparent and a key measure of our earnings performance is on the bottom line, recurring income from continuing operations after mark-to-market adjustments and you will see what we believe is a better indicator of our performance, and this is consistent with what we have done in past quarters. We are reporting $0.28 versus $0.22, an increase of 27%, and on a year-to-date basis $0.87 versus $0.60, an improvement of 45%. Let's turn next to slide number 18, and I'll hit some of the nonrecurring items. Again, we start the slide with income from continuing operations as reported. We make some adjustments for nonrecurring items. Regulatory and litigation contingencies totaled 10 million for the quarter, 253 million on a year-to-date basis. I won't describe those in detail, as they are described in great detail in our Q and press release. We had a contingency adjustment of 8 million in the quarter. We had expense related to prior periods, a correction totaling 11 million for the quarter, 4 million year-to-date, and then finally, eliminated $8 million of gains on asset sales in the quarter, $15 million year-to-date, to come down to a recurring earnings number. But this still includes the effect of mark-to-market accounting on our power business. Let's turn to the next slide, number 19, please, and we'll walk through the mark-to-market adjustments. As you can see there, the mark-to-market adjustments for power for the current quarter, we reversed the forward unrealized mark-to-market losses totaling $16 million, as compared to $141 million in the prior year. And then we add back the realized gains from mark-to-market that was previously recognized of 80 million, as compared to $72 million a year ago. Total mark-to-market adjustments pre-tax totaled 96 million, as compared to 213, and then after-tax, 59 million versus 130 million. And you can see the comparative numbers on a year-to-date basis. The sum total of all that is, again, the recurring earnings after mark-to-market adjustments of $0.28 versus $0.22, and $0.87 versus the $0.60 that I mentioned earlier. Next slide please, number 20. This is the third quarter segment profit, both on a reported and recurring basis by business unit and consolidated. First let's look down the slide to the bold line entitled "segment profit after mark-to-market adjustment". You can see there in 2006, we had profit of $493 million, as compared to $382 million a year ago, an improvement of $111 million, or 29%. E&P profit was up about $8 million, and I'll talk through some detail in just a moment. Midstream nearly doubled. Gas Pipeline is down a bit. And Power, which after mark-to-market is on the final line on this schedule, the 17 compared to the 13 loss in the prior year, is improved quite nicely. Now let's take a little closer look at E&P results. Consolidated production volumes increased during the quarter by 22% over the prior year. Domestic volume increases were up 24%. Domestic revenue was up 68 million from these higher volumes. Average net realized price decreased about $0.49 per Mcf, or about 10%, causing revenues to be down about $35 million. Hedging effectiveness income in the quarter of approximately 5 million, versus an ineffectiveness loss of 16 million in the '05 quarter, caused a $21 million swing in income. DD&A was up 29 million due to substantially increased production and higher capitalized drilling and completion costs. Per unit DD&A is approximately $0.19 per Mcf higher this quarter versus a year ago quarter. Lease operating expense is up about $11 million, reflecting increased number of producing wells, higher industry costs, and production enhancement work-over expenses. LOE costs are $0.05 per Mcf higher this quarter versus the prior year. Turning now to Midstream. The major drivers to our recurring segment profit are another record for NGL unit margins; higher fee revenue, higher product margins from our Canadian olefins group, and increased operating expenses. Natural gas liquids margins again exceeded historic levels, averaging $0.42 per gallon. The price variance contributed 74 million of the overall 85 million margin variance, the remaining 11 million due to higher volumes. Fee revenues increased 13 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily from the Deepwater Gulf-based increase, Triton and Goldfinger volumes, resident volumes across Devils Tower, and unit -- higher unit production rates. Fee revenue in the West also contributed an increase, due to contract renegotiation, rate escalation and volumes from the Wamsutter expansion. Our olefins group contributed 10 million more than 2005 second quarter, due to 16 million in higher commodity margins and volumes, partially offset by $6 million lower trading margins due to falling prices, and about 2 million accrual for that Gulf Liquids litigation. Operating expenses increased 20 million overall, about 12 million from the West, due to large part a 7 million adjustment to O&M accrual to properly reflect liabilities for goods and services that have been received but not paid. That is a nonrecurring item that we mentioned, a portion of it. And the Gulf contributed 7 million in higher O&M, mainly due to 4 million in higher insurance premiums. Let's turn next to Gas Pipelines. Recurring segment profit of 109 million is $38 million below the same period a year ago. The main drivers are 8 million of lower earnings in the JVs and partnerships, due to certain development costs and interest expense at Gulfstream and our participation in the Pacific Connector project, 6 million of higher administrative and general labor and related costs due to the increased cost in our group insurance and retirement costs, 5 million of higher IT support costs as we continue our efforts to complete the installation and make refinements in our new common financial system, and 4 million of higher property insurance premiums due to increased premiums for our offshore facilities due to hurricanes last year. And finally, 7 million of higher contractor and outside service costs related to various repair costs and pipeline assessment work. As a result of tight demand for workers, we've seen an escalation in the costs of these types of services, especially for offshore work. Note that much of these higher costs levels are reflected in our rate filings for both Northwest Pipe and Transco, and as such, should ultimately be recovered on a go-forward basis. Again, we expect new rates to go into effect subject to refund during the first quarter of 2007. And then, let's turn to Power. Power's recurring after mark-to-market adjustment results of $17 million profit, versus a $13 million loss a year ago, reflect increase in hedge cash flows due to the benefit of structured hedges. The third quarter of '06 includes a $13 million loss due to lower cost of market write-downs on storage inventory, and 7 million of realized losses on storage injection hedges. These values are forecast to be recovered when volumes are withdrawn. Next let's turn to slide number 21, and this is a year-to-date basis. And in the interest of time, I won't walk through the detailed results. I'll just focus on the total here. Segment profit after mark-to-market adjustment of 1.430 billion, versus 1.130 billion a year ago, an increase of $300 million, or about 27%, and again, you can see the detail by business unit, with Power after mark-to-market being the final line on the slide. So, again good strong performance for both the quarter as well as on a year-to-date basis after eliminating nonrecurring items and mark-to-market effects. With that, I'm going to turn it to Ralph Hill.
Ralph Hill: Thank you, Don. I'm on slide 22. Just to highlight again what Don mentioned. Our production was up 22% for the quarter, almost 150 million a day since third quarter 2005. We also surpassed the 800 million a day of production level. We got an additional 4,000 plus acres of downspacing in the Piceance, and that brings our Piceance downspacing now to about 65,000 acres in the -- or 62,000 acres in the Piceance Valley. In the appendix, you'll see slides on the Big George and Powder River that continue to be very important part of our growth. It was up approximately 24%. We have a new farm-in; I'll talk about in just a few minutes. And we also have made significant strides in two other areas, our San Juan production is at record levels, and our Barnett Shale production is from virtually zero last year is up to about 16 million or 17 million a day on a net basis to us. Turning to slide 23. Looking specifically at Piceance production, it was up 100 million a day -- 101 million a day, or 31%, from a year ago. We currently have 24 rigs operating in the Valley and the Highlands. This time last year, we had 15. We have two of our H&P FlexRigs that remain to be received this year, and they will be received later in the fourth quarter. And as you know, in the first quarter, early part of the second quarter of 2007, we have four of the Nabors Super Sundowner rigs that will be coming in. That will give us a total rig fleet above where we will end up operating. We will now be able to high-grade our rig fleet and retire some of the less-efficient rigs that are out there operating for us. Slide 24. On the Highlands, just an update there. 39 wells were spud year-to-date. We now have over 60 wells that we have drilled in the Piceance Highlands, continues to build impressive momentum. Production this time last year was 5 million cubic feet a day, and now it's over 24 million a day. We were able to get eight rigs operating during the third quarter in the Highlands, which is a record number of rigs operating for us. Now with the winter stipulations and just the winter weather, we are back down to three rigs in this quarter, but we were able to get eight rigs up there. We are working very hard on all of our road, pipeline and facilities under construction. And we also are getting closer to getting approval both in the Valley and in the Piceance Highlands, in addition to getting to our infrastructure built, getting approval to doing year-round drilling in these two areas, which will be important for our developments in the Highlands particularly. Turning to slide 25. We were able to expand our Highlands ownership position. On this slide, the ownership positions are detailed in the red outlines. This slide does not detail Trail Ridge, but recall that is part of the Highlands opportunity that we are drilling. This just discusses the farm-in deals. Please recall in Ryan Gulch. We earned about 16,000 net acres by drilling six earning wells. At Allen Point, we earned about 6,200 net acres by drilling six wells, and we've added a new area in the Highlands which we're calling Barcus Creek. It is a bolt-on to the track of Ryan Gulch. It's in blue on the slide here, because we have not drilled it. But after we drill five earnings wells, we will earn that acreage. Turning to slide 26. Talk a little bit more about Barcus Creek. It is a direct bolt-on to the Ryan Gulch project. It does target the Williams Fork formation, which is where we drill today. We will be able to drill by drilling five wells, and we've already spudded our first well, we will earn this acreage. After earning, those -- after drilling those five wells, we'll have a 45% working interest and approximately 25,000 gross acres, or 11,000 net acres, to Williams. It is federal acreage primarily. So, it has a very healthy net revenue interest of 87.5%. Moving forward we will be partners with our -- we will head -- partners heads up with our partner in this in both the construction and gas gathering and processing systems. We will be the operator in drilling and operating the wells. And on a 40-acre density, we think there would be at least 600 potential drilling locations there, and that is on 40-acre density. And it is too early to tell that density would move away from there. And that is the end of my slides. Other slides are in the appendix, if you have any questions. And I'll now turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan Armstrong: Great. Thanks, Ralph. Midstream did have a great quarter from both the short-term and a long-term perspective. On a short-term basis, we had another record quarter for recurring segment profit, allowing us to raise guidance once again. And we made great progress on bringing some of our large projects closer to fruition, like our fifth train at Opal, our discoveries at Tahiti Lateral, and the extension of our Devils Tower system out to Chevron's Blind Faith prospect. Moving on to slide 28 here. We did from a long-term perspective make some great progress as well. We're pleased to announce that we are moving a major deepwater project into our capital guidance, and our pipeline of opportunities continues to fill in behind us as we mature some of these opportunities. Our previous slides similar to this showed about $385 million in guidance for 2006, 2007 and 2008. And we have added a new Western Deepwater expansion project, which totals about 450 million, and that carries on out past '08, actually, in terms of that total 450. You can see a schedule of that below here with the project titled "Western and Gulfwater Deepwater Expansion". I'm going to describe that project in a little more detail on the next slide, and additionally you'll note that even though we are moving this project into the end guidance bucket. Our under negotiations bucket there in the middle has also refilled with a major expansion that we're working on out in our western G&P business in the Rockies. So, we are excited to continue to see these opportunities to continue to fill in as we move forward on this. I'm going to turn to the next slide now, slide 29. As stated previously, we have added capital to our 2007 and 2008 guidance to fund our planned Perdido Norte project, and this project, which would extend out to the Perdido Fold Belt in the lower tertiary play in the western deepwater Gulf of Mexico. This prospect in this area -- the prospects in this area include Shell's Great White, Trident, Tobago, Tiger and Silvertip prospects. And the project includes approximately 65-miles of 18-inch oil line and approximately 100-miles of 18-inch gas line that will tie into our existing Seahawk gas line that serves Anadarko's Boomvang/Nansen platforms. And additionally, we will be making an expansion of our Markham gas processing facility to adequately serve this new gas production. Our Markham facility has basically ran completely full since we started that up, and so we are excited to have this new production to come in, and we will be making some expansion to accommodate this. This total project is expected to be in service and will be ready for service in late 2008, with the first full year of cash flow is expected to be nearly $100 million, and by cash flow, I mean segment profit plus depreciation there. And so, we are very excited about this prospect. It's been a long time, a lot of work, and a lot of effort by our team. We have not executed final agreements on this, but we are far enough along in the process that we felt it was appropriate to add it into our guidance here. And great potential out in this area beyond some of these existing prospects here. There's great potential out here for the future, and even into the Mexican Deepwater, as this pipeline will be positioned to serve that in the future as well. So this is a great long-term play for us, and this is exactly in keeping with our strategy to be a major player in the deepwater and get our foot out here while the window of opportunity exists to install the major infrastructure that will serve the deepwater for years and years to come. So with that, I'm going to turn it back to Don Chappel.
Don Chappel: Thanks, Alan. Let's turn to slide number 31 please, 2006 forecast guidance. You will see here, let's focus on the bottom line, the most important line, our key earnings measure, diluted earnings per share recurring after mark-to-market adjustment. We have raised the lower end of our guidance range to $1.05 from $0.95 on the strength of our third quarter performance and the outlook for the balance of this year. The strong Midstream NGL margins are the primary driver of the increases. Let's turn next to slide number 32, please. I will hit a few highlights here. We have walked through some of the details of 2006 year-to-date profit. Now we'll focus on 2006 full year, as well as '07 and '08. 2006, we have some changes, and very few changes to '07 and '08 to our prior guidance, and I'll just hit some of the highlights. Again, let's focus first on the bold item, second line from the bottom, total recurring after mark-to-market adjustments. That's increased to 1.806 billion to 202.1 billion, a range of 1.8 to 2.0 from the prior guidance up about $60 million at the midpoint, and again on the strength of very strong NGL margins and volumes. Going back to the top of the page, well, reducing the top-end of our E&P guidance, very strong production but lower than planned prices. Midstream, increasing guidance once again on the strength of NGL margins and volumes. Gas Pipelines, reducing the top-end of the range slightly as some of those expenses that I noted earlier continue to burden the current year results. And as we look to '07, you will see a nice increase in expected profitability in Gas Pipelines following those rate cases. Looking at Power, we think the clearest way is to look at the bottom line in the schedule. Power, on a recurring basis after the mark-to-market adjustment, unchanged at 75 million to 125 million. The rest of those changes up there reflect the changes in -- that are driven by mark-to-market accounting. Looking forward to '07 and '08, again the bold line near the bottom, total recurring after mark-to-market, you can see a nice increase in 2007 and again in 2008. The 2008 level of expected profitability versus '06 is up about $600 million, or 33%, in just 24 months, from our increased level of current-period guidance. 2007 and '08, I'll focus E&P, profitability nearly doubles by 2008. That's based on a -- an assumption of a steady $7 NYMEX gas price and sharply improved production. Midstream, off a bit, as a result of forecasting somewhat lower margins in '07 and '08 than we experienced this year, certainly at the bottom-end of the range. Gas Pipeline comes up nicely, as we've previously mentioned, as a result of our expectations on our two rate cases. And then Power, again, looking at the bottom line, after mark-to-market adjustments, pretty steady at about $100 million, plus or minus. Next slide please, number 33. So take a look a capital spending. And again, I draw your attention to the bottom line first. On a total basis, 2006 is relatively unchanged. 2007 and 2008 are up substantially as a result of the project that Alan described in the western deepwater Gulf of Mexico. And you can see there that the detail with the change relates to Midstream. So, current-period spending in a range of 2.175 billion to 2.375 billion, about 2.0 billion to 2.2 billion next year, and then 1.8 billion to 2.50 billion in 2008. I would note that we are opportunity-rich. We have some terrific opportunities in our E&P business, our Midstream business, as well as our Gas Pipeline business. And I would expect that our capital spending guidance would continue to increase somewhat as we are able to seize those value-adding opportunities. And more about that in future calls. Next slide please, number 34. Just kind of review some of the items again. Segment profit recurring after mark-to-market adjustment, the second line there again reflects that $600 million increase over the next 24 months to a range of 2.2 billion to 2.875 billion. Cash flow from operations about 1.5 billion to 1.8 billion this year, increasing to 2.4 to 2.8 by 2008. That's an increase of about 900 million to $1 billion, or nearly 59%. So, very strong increase expected in cash flow from operations. Capital spending, I just reviewed, and again, we are opportunity-rich. And it is our intention to continue to seize these value-creating projects, projects that create EVA, and that we expect will create value for our shareholders. And we're pursuing those in a very disciplined fashion. Operating free cash flow is negative this year, but we had a substantial cash balance coming into this year, as well as proceeds from MLP drop-downs that certainly enable that. And as we look forward to 2007 and 2008, again we're wrapping up 2008 with a very strong cash position, as well as the prospect of an MLP drop-down providing some additional cash for reinvestment opportunities. Next slide, please, number 35. Just graphically depicts the guidance that we just discussed, as well as our past performance. And you can see declining debt to cap as we continue to improve our credit as well as capital spending. And our guidance is off somewhat in '07 and '08, meaning lower than '06. However, we've depicted there that we are opportunity-rich, and we would expect to increase CapEx guidance and, obviously, related profitability and value for shareholders in the future. Next slide, please, number 36. Just some financial strategy key points and these are consistent with my prior presentations. Again, we'll continue to drive, enable sustainable growth in EVA and shareholder value, we'll continue to accelerate our delivery of MLP benefits to Williams, and we'll continue to maintain or improve our credit ratios and ratings. We think that's important for a number of reasons. We'll reduce risk in the Power segment. And finally, we are opportunity-rich, and we will continue to pursue EVA-based investments that we believe will create value for shareholders, and these EVA-based investments will oftentimes require a new capital. We have substantial operating cash flows, as well as the ability to raise capital through the MLP drop-downs. And again, the combination of growth and operating cash flows and EVA creates substantial value creation for shareholders. Back to Steve.
Steve Malcolm: Thanks Don. We have flown through our slides in record time. So, we'll certainly have time for questions. I know that some of you will be pleased that our presentation this morning was crisp and succinct, but I encourage you to review the detailed info contained in the appendix. Again looking at the last slide, slide 38, I believe, our portfolio of natural gas businesses is delivering strong performance. We are delivering both strong short-term results and long-term sustainable growth in economic value and shareholder returns. So with that, we will be happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions). And our first question will come from Shneur Gershuni with UBS.
Shneur Gershuni - UBS: Hi. Good morning, guys. Nice quarter. I just had two questions. I guess the first question is related to Power. As I'm sure you're aware, there's a perception that recontracting this to power beyond 2010 remain a drag on the stock. Can you sort of talk to what the current recontracting environment is right now? Are you excited about potential opportunities? Do you feel pretty confident that you'll be able to extend the quantity -- the contracts beyond 2010 and be able to earn offsetting cash flows against the tolling agreements?
Ralph Hill: We are excited about the opportunities beyond 2010, either through RFP processes or bilateral negotiation. So from that vantage point, I would have to say we are excited. There are opportunities, we're pursuing them, and hopefully we'll be bringing some good news in the future.
Shneur Gershuni - UBS: Okay. And just one second question here. Can you prioritize your expected use of cash flow, if the MLP drops-down generates cash flow beyond your CapEx needs?
Don Chappel: This is Don. First and foremost, I would say our reinvestment opportunities in each of our businesses; we think that we have some terrific opportunities in our core businesses that return well above the cost of capital that will create the greatest value for shareholders. And we think that that's first and foremost. Beyond that, we'll have to look at the facts and circumstances at the time and see what the best use of any such capital might be.
Shneur Gershuni - UBS: Okay. Would you be targeting debt pay downs versus share buybacks, or is that too far away to figure out?
Don Chappel: I think we've said in the past that with the proceeds of our MLP drop-downs, we will need to pay down some debt. As WPZ borrows, our consolidated indebtedness will go up, if we were to not pay some debt down. So, there will be some debt pay downs. I can't tell you it's going to be -- when it's going to be, or that it's going to be dollar for dollar, but there will be likely some debt pay downs along the way.
Shneur Gershuni - UBS: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Carl Kirst with Credit Suisse.
Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse: Hey. Good morning, everybody. Great quarter. Alan, if I could actually touch on just the Western Deepwater expansion. I believe you mentioned about $100 million of EBITDA that would come in, in the first full year, I guess, 2009. Obviously first and foremost, looks like a pre-tax cash return of about 22%; great project. I know you guys tend to contract for a majority but not all when you do these expansions, and I guess I just wanted to touch based on that $100 million. When you take the, I guess, sort of MOU to definitive agreements here, is that $100 million going to be firm, or is there a certain amount of spot developments that you are expecting to come in over time?
Alan Armstrong: Well, there's really I would categorize, I'm going to get into -- I'm not going to get in too much detail, just for competitive purposes, but I'll put the revenue in three different buckets. One, there is expected to be a minimum volume guarantee from one of the larger producers in that. Another bucket would be off of the proved reserves. And obviously on the front end, of course, the bulk of that money that -- or that revenue we are expecting comes from those two sources, so, pretty low risk on the front end of the project. The back end of the project is where we would be counting on more profitable reserves and other prospects in the area. But before that, first year cash flow pretty well would be in those first two buckets that I mentioned.
Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse: Great, helpful. Just turning to E&P, Ralph, obviously, tremendous growth here on the all-in production side; a lot of new rigs coming in, more rigs still coming. Is it perhaps too early to venture an estimate on what you guys are targeting for a proved reserve growth for 2006? Or otherwise, maybe approach it from an F&D cost angle.
Ralph Hill: Yeah. We actually will probably -- showed as you know, early in 2007. We are in the process of our reserve review right now with our outside auditors. So, it is a little preliminary to do that at this time.
Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse: Okay. The last question perhaps, if you could -- a lot going on, obviously, with the Highlands. I guess; one, could you just sort of update us the timing when you think the infrastructure in the Highlands is going to be complete? And obviously, have that area open up with even more activity. And two, remind us with sort of the ongoing oil field cost creep, what you think the economic hurdle is of gas prices in order to develop the Highlands?
Ralph Hill: Well, we are seeing -- we hope to have a majority of our infrastructure, the major parts of our infrastructure, which is the roads, the water, the employee camps and all that done by early spring at the latest. That will help us substantially. We hope to also hear good progress on our applications for year-round drilling from the various agencies that need to approve that, also in the near future. So, those two things we hope to have, I would say, done by the early springtime. As for -- and that will help the Highlands substantially, as you know. And as for gas prices and cost increases, we are looking at -- we're currently negotiating with a number of our vendors for next year. But there is pressure in various areas on price increases, or cost increases from 5% to 10%. That will not materially affect what we see going forward, as we've always said that we believe we can return our cost of capital and gas price ranges in the -- I think it was in the $2.50 to $3 range; that may move that up slightly to, say, $2.75 to $3.50 type range for those kind of returns. So, we still see a very healthy environment going forward with gas prices that are -- if they're in that range at the NYMEX level, we would be in very good shape E&P-wise.
Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse: Great, thanks. Good luck.
Operator: And our next question will come from Faisel Khan with Citigroup.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Good morning. I just wanted to make sure I understood the -- some of the basis assumption and the transportation capacity you have out of the Rockies. If I add up the transportation capacity you guys have, looks like for next year it comes to about 694 million cubic feet a day. And if I take the hedges you guys have outstanding, it's roughly -- and the collars that you have outstanding for next year, it's roughly 442 million cubic feet a day. So, is it right to assume that kind of 1.1 Bcf a day of your basis -- of basis is completely hedged?
Ralph Hill: I have, this is Ralph. I haven't thought of it that way. I look at it separate. I think that what we say is that since we do believe, we have substantial capacity to move out of the basin, if need be, which we do. We do have a number of local sales anywhere -- can be any -- sometimes up to 75 million to 100 million a day of local sales also that does not need to move out of the Rockies. But our basis is generally matched up with our hedge position. And then I guess you would say that through firm transportation, we have at least locked in the rates out. So, I think that is not a -- I think that's a fair way to look at it. I'd like to think a little more about it. But I think it's generally a fair concept.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay. Either way it looks like for next year and for a lot in '08, you -- a substantial amount of your basis risk is substantially either hedged through transportation or through contracts.
Ralph Hill: I didn't get that audio. Just one moment please.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Sorry. Did you hear me that or -- okay, okay.
Ralph Hill: No, I didn't hear -- I'm sorry. It didn't come through at all.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: No, actually in either case, your basis risk for next year in '07, '08 seems to be substantially hedged through transportation and hedges. Is that fair to say?
Ralph Hill: Yeah. That's what we believe. Absolutely.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay. Is there any way you can comment on the rates that you got on the new Nabors rigs? Is it comparable to what you were getting either previously or maybe close to your H&P contracts you had?
Ralph Hill: We feel very good that we were early movers on those rigs, as we were on H&P.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay. And who's your partner in farming into those acreage positions in the Highlands?
Ralph Hill: They've asked for us not to say their -- to divulge that.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay.
Ralph Hill: Until they're ready to.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay. And then, I think were another producer in the Piceance that talked about potentially looking at the deep side of the Piceance, in terms of what might be there. Have you guys looked at that at all?
Ralph Hill: Yeah. We continue to evaluate opportunities in what's called the Cozette and Corcoran formations, which are deeper, and we have and we will test some of that acreage, probably in 2007.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay. On the Midstream side, will the new projects that you guys have in the western part of the Gulf, will that be CapEx spend at the MLP, or will that be at the C. Corporation?
Alan Armstrong: That will be at the C. Corp.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay. And then on the Power book, I just wanted to figure out, if -- there's been strong demand for assets on the -- for Power assets around the US. And thinking about it going forward, is the Power business from your perspective; is it still strategic for you? Is it a core asset that you think will remain with you for the next -- for the foreseeable future? Or if someone came to you with the right prices, is that always an option?
Steve Malcolm: This is Steve. We've said that we don't fall in love with any of our assets, and are open-minded, and will consider any offers that we get from time to time for any of our assets. But having said that, we had the business on the market back in the 2002-2004 timeframe; didn't believe that we got any offers that made sense, and pulled the business back, and what we've been able to do since then. We've done -- we've made some great progress in hedging our positions through 2010. And as Bill described earlier, we have some exciting opportunities, perhaps, to do some things to forward sell beyond 2010. We've adopted hedge accounting, and that creates some obstacles to us in terms of being out actively seeking to sell the portfolio, and so that pretty much summarizes where we are today.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay. Fair enough. And this -- and just last on the pipeline. You talked about a lot of cost increases in the pipeline versus last year. You talked about recovering those in your current rate cases. But -- I mean, is it fair to say that a lot of those costs are -- are they really ongoing costs? Or do those eventually come off or come down in future earnings?
Steve Malcolm: I would just say this, that obviously, in this year we have a very extraordinary item with the capacity replacement project on Northwest. You filter that out. You look at our (inaudible) numbers you can see that we do expect some of that to attenuate, if you look in the out years on the capital slide. So I would refer you to that. Overall, we would expect to have to continue to do some level of maintenance investment associated with our internal inspections. But you will recall my previous comments on that, I hope, that we are having to install, for example, pig launchers and receivers to enable us to do the internal inspections that are part of the Pipeline Safety and Integrity Act. So, you're going to see a bit more investment on the front-end in the maintenance capital area than you would expect to see in the out years.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: And what's the status of Pacific Connector, is that still a viable project? Have you had conversations with suppliers?
Alan Armstrong: We believe the project is quite viable, and conversations are underway with prospective suppliers. I would say that you -- understand that Fort Chicago is developing the LNG terminal, and they are the point people on securing supply. But we do know that those conversations are underway.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Fair enough. Thank you for the time.
Operator: And, our next question will come from Sam Brothwell with Wachovia.
Sam Brothwell - Wachovia: Hi, good morning, just two quick ones. Steve, I know you said you couldn't give much detail on the MLP dropdown, but I just wanted to ask is there any reason to think that your timing that you articulated on the second-quarter conference call would change?
Steve Malcolm: I think I would just direct you to my earlier comment. I think it was that we expect to complete $1 billion to $1.5 billion in the half dropdown in the next three months.
Sam Brothwell - Wachovia: And Ralph, in terms of the bolt-on up in the Highlands region, you've got 600 drilling locations. Can you give us any sense as to what you expect to recover in terms of reserves per well ultimately?
Ralph Hill: We expect that it would be somewhat of a look-alike of to our other Highlands projects, but we are just drilling our first well, but we are optimistic that it would be -- turn out to be successful in the sense that it would look like the other Highlands areas. But we're just a little too early to tell so far.
Sam Brothwell - Wachovia: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from Craig Shere with Calyon Securities.
Craig Shere - Calyon Securities: Hi, Don, a couple questions for you to start, and then one for Ralph and one for Alan. First a simple one, I may be using too low a tax rate, mark-to-market adjusted on recurring earnings, what would a good third-quarter income tax rate be, and what would a good full-year '06 and further out be for modeling purposes?
Don Chappel: Hi, Craig. We'll get back to you with that one in a second.
Craig Shere - Calyon Securities: Okay great. On slide 34 for free cash flow, if I understand it, that slide excludes the dropdowns to the MLP. Am I saying that right? So, if you dropdown $1 billion to $1.5 billion, and the MLP has to issue debt for half of that, so you buyback half -- those same -- the debt they issue, you buy back that amount on your balance sheet as you're consolidating, right? But then, you have another $500 to$750 million extra discretionary equity cash -- cash flows for equity. Am I saying that correctly?
Don Chappel: Well, first, I would say that -- again, we'll look at the credit metrics and ensure that we don't slip back on credit. So I don't want to say that we will or will not buyback debt with the proceeds. But certainly over time, we would expect to. But certainly the excess proceeds, the equity proceeds will be dependent on the depth of the equity -- MLP equity market as it pertains to WPZ and this dropdown. So we'll see -- we'll just have to see what that is. And again, given where we are, I really shouldn't comment any further on any MLP dropdown matters.
Craig Shere - Calyon Securities: I understand. So in other words, if the markets aren't liquid enough, you may have to take some MLP units. But if they are liquid enough, then in reality, given your guidance, you'd have anywhere from $500 million to $850 million of equity cash flow or available cash in 2007 that you haven't identified new growth projects for or any other value drivers for? Am I saying that correctly?
Don Chappel: Craig again, I ought not to comment on any further aspects of our MLP dropdown at this point in time, but I appreciate your question and comment.
Craig Shere - Calyon Securities: Okay, I am sorry to press that. Maybe while you're working on the income tax rate, I can jump over to Ralph and Alan. Ralph, does production guidance assume full contributions from the new custom-built rigs? When I say full contributions -- you recently increased guidance for production based on, say 30%, roughly, improvement in efficiency on the new FlexRigs. But are you incorporating that kind of improvement on all the rigs, custom-built rigs to be delivered through first quarter next year? And are you also incorporating the year-round drilling drivers you talked about in the existing production guidance?
Ralph Hill: We are -- basically, we're assuming in the 20% range on the efficiencies for the rigs. We do have a delay in there for each rig as it comes on, a several-month delay, just to make sure the crew gets up to speed and those kind of things. So there is a lag as the rigs come on, but there is generally about a 20% increase in efficiencies there. So to the extent we can grind that out better that would help us in the future. And, then the second part of your question was, I'm sorry?
Craig Shere - Calyon Securities: Is year-round drilling incorporated in existing production guidance?
Ralph Hill: Well, it is in the sense of -- in the Valley, we're assuming that we can -- the Valley needs have some federal acreage. We'd like to do year-round drilling. We think it's more efficient. We're assuming that if we were able to do that, we would actually drill the federal acreage and do that year-round. If not, we would move to fee acreage. So in that case, yes; it is in the Valley. And then for the Highlands, we are assuming we would be able to drill more wells as we achieved a year-round drilling. So it's in there in a fairly good manner, but there is always opportunities, particularly in the Highlands after we get everything built and done that we could actually do more activity up there. So yes, generally it is, but not in an overly aggressive manner yet.
Craig Shere - Calyon Securities: So, year-round drilling would provide upside versus guidance in the Highlands. And also, the rigs thus far, the custom-built rigs thus far that you have had an operation have produced efficiencies a bit better than the 20% that you're modeling in for the existing guidance?
Ralph Hill: The ones that have been there the longest are doing slightly better -- are doing better than 20. The new ones are typically down on the first few wells. So that's why again on average we're assuming in that 20% range. And then for the Highlands, it all depends -- again, we're still -- some of those areas, we only have 60 total wells up there, so we like what we see. But we're still delineating the fields and all that, so it would take some time to see, I think, additional upside in the production there. But we would like to think that would happen.
Craig Shere - Calyon Securities: Okay. But the last of the rigs currently on order will come by the first quarter, and your guidance goes through 2008. So, am I to assume the 2008 production assumes just 20% uplift from all the new rigs?
Ralph Hill: Yes.
Craig Shere - Calyon Securities: And Alan, what is your Midstream hedging philosophy going forward? If my memory is working, last quarter call you all -- you said that for third quarter, you had hedged out 40% of the volumes at second-quarter margins, which apparently third quarter turned out to be healthy margins anyhow. As you move forward, I know you can't hedge out NGLs for years forward, but what's your thinking and philosophy with regards to that?
Alan Armstrong: Well, first of all, just to clarify what we have done, when we said hedged -- from a pure accounting term, I suppose it's a hedge -- but what we have sold forward in the past has just been the NGLs. We have not taken out the short gas position because that's covered by our E&P length. So, as a corporation, we've looked to our exposure; not to the individual business unit exposure. And so, the hedge that we had in place are the forward sale that we had on liquids actually fared pretty well for us in the third quarter, because it was gas prices lowering that actually made the difference there. So the liquids price that we sold was not that bad, because -- again as the gas price of the third quarter. In terms of our philosophy on it, we continue to look at the overall corporate exposure that we have and look for opportunities there. We also look for fundamentals that would signal us in terms of individual components, for instance, propane or ethane, and what we know about, what's in storage and so forth, and so we would look to fundamentals like that to make decisions. But we start with a corporate perspective on where we are exposed.
Craig Shere - Calyon Securities: Great. Don, do you have any numbers on the tax rate as yet?
Don Chappel: Just slide in the back of the package. On slide number 100 that gives both quarter as well as future-year guidance, effective tax-rate guidance is 39% 2007 and '08, as well as cash tax guidance 5% to 10% in '07 and 9% to 14% in '08. And are likely, kind of marginal effective rate is just a little below that 39% rate, in the 38.5.
Craig Shere - Calyon Securities: Great thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Rick Gross with Lehman Brothers.
Rick Gross - Lehman Brothers: Good morning. I just want to -- I guess, kind of refine some of the comments around the Piceance. From the standpoint of having 24 rigs operating in the third quarter, and you're going to operate the same number, I assume, in the fourth quarter, and add as you get rigs. You're stepping down from the Highlands, I assume, and redeploying the rigs in the Valley. Is that where the five rigs that aren't running in the Highlands, going to the Valley?
Ralph Hill: Yeah, there what we do is Rick we have them in the Valley, and then we'll move them up, when the Highlands drilling season opens, we'll move them up to the Highlands, drill as much as we can there. And then like with the weather gets bad and other things come into effect. For example, the third quarter…
Alan Armstrong: Effect.
Ralph Hill: We were able to average almost eight. Basically, had eight rigs in the Highlands. And now we'll -- for the fourth quarter we'll be at three because we'll move those rigs back down to the Valley.
Rick Gross - Lehman Brothers: Okay from the standpoint of moving forward, you have provided in the past, or we could kind of figure out, reverse-engineer, kind of the productivity of these rigs. Because we'd kind of get a well count. How many wells are you actually going to drill this year, in the Piceance, complete?
Ralph Hill: Counting both Highlands and the Valley, I believe, it's in the 475 range, plus or minus.
Rick Gross - Lehman Brothers: Okay and then, the next couple of years?
Ralph Hill: The guidance at this point is in that same range. And we'll be refining that guidance as we move closer to the -- well, actually when we do the February call.
Rick Gross - Lehman Brothers: Okay that's fine. From a standpoint of rig productivity, Highlands versus Valley, my assumption is that because you're drilling in essence extra rock, and you've got logistics issues. Is the productivity up there materially different than when you're drilling down in the Valley?
Ralph Hill: If you mean times of spud-to-spud, the Valley in general, it varies. But on average, let's just say that's about 15 days. And the Highlands can be anywhere from -- and we've done better and we've done slightly worse; it just depends. But the Highlands spud-to-spud time is more like 25 or 30 days. So you could say 15 days versus 30 days currently. And I think we, as you know, always try to improve both those numbers. And the biggest improvement would be hopefully in the Highlands; we would see that 30-day drop-down.
Rick Gross - Lehman Brothers: Right Okay, from a standpoint of looking at -- oh Jesus, where did I go? From a standpoint of the restrictions up there, are the drilling restrictions in the winter environmental, or are they infrastructure?
Ralph Hill: Oh they're a little of both right now. There is -- infrastructure, clearly, has to be built. The winter can be very severe up there. We are building an employee camp in the Trail Ridge area that essentially would be somewhat like almost like an offshore camp, just a much smaller version of that. But it needs living quarters and all the things that would go with that. And then there's all kinds of animal stipulations and other things that we need to work through that we're working through. So, it's really a combination of both.
Rick Gross - Lehman Brothers: Okay, completely different subject. Over on the power side, were there any further contracts signed during the quarter? Is there any information there to report?
Alan Armstrong: Rick we did sign some 2007 capacity sales that we did not report on. So, I guess I shouldn't comment on them. But we are still continuing to have success, especially in the shorter term.
Rick Gross - Lehman Brothers: Okay and then from a standpoint of capacity market development, California PJM, any update?
Alan Armstrong: Well FERC did approve the California market design, which is a step in a positive direction. There are negotiations occurring that, I think, are moving in a positive direction in PJM. We would expect some developments in both areas middle to late 2007.
Rick Gross - Lehman Brothers: Okay and then, there was a Vernon Hill, almost like right on top of Downtown L.A. project that's kind of running through the CEC right now. How would you handicap that getting through the process? And particularly they've got a startup date '09, '10?
Alan Armstrong: Yeah, I would say there is the lot of hurdles, still to be overcome, with that project. I think it is a viable project. California desperately needs new megawatts. But given its location and given some other political issues, it's going to face, it's got a ways to go.
Rick Gross - Lehman Brothers: From a standpoint -- if it's built, will that have -- will that hang because, as long as this is in limbo, will it hang up your ability to possibly contract some of your megawatts beyond '10?
Alan Armstrong: No. I don't think so Rick. I think, as I indicated, California needs a lot of new megawatts. The utilities, I think are becoming more aggressive with looking beyond 2010, at existing generation as well as new. So, I really don't see it hampering us in any way.
Rick Gross - Lehman Brothers: Thank you.
Operator: And that does conclude the question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the call back over to Steve Malcolm for any additional closing remarks.
Steve Malcolm: Well again, thank you for your interest. We're very pleased with our results. We are excited about the future, and look forward to talking with you in the future. Thank you.
Operator: And that does conclude today's audio conference. Thank you for your participation. And have a nice day.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams Companies Second-Quarter 2006 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Travis Campbell, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Travis Campbell - Head of Investor Relations: Thank you and good morning, everybody. Welcome to our call this morning. Thanks for your continued interest in our company. Today, you'll hear from Steve Malcolm, our CEO, Don Chappel, the CFO; and Ralph Hill, President of our E&P business and Alan Armstrong, President of the Midstream business, a couple of things about our format today. At last quarter's call, if you recall, we used a more streamlined format. We received a lot of encouragement and feedback to continue that format, so we will do that today. Therefore, all of the business unit heads are not presenting, but be aware that each of them is here in the room with us, available for questions that you might have. Also, we're very well aware that today, a number of other companies are also releasing earnings and are conducting their calls, so we're sensitive to that. As you would expect, all of the slides and the robust detail you have come to expect from us is available in the appendix to the presentation. So any of that information you have found valuable in the past is available. Before I turn it over to Steve, please note that all the slides, both those in the presentation and the appendix, are available on the website, williams.com, in a PDF format. The press release and the accompanying schedules are also available on the website. Later today, we will be filing our 10-Q with the SEC, and that will be available on the website by late today or tomorrow morning. Slide number two, titled forward-looking statements, details various risk factors related to future outcomes. It's important for you to review the information on that slide. Slide number three, oil and gas reserves disclaimer, is also very important, and we urge you to read that slide as well. Also included in the presentation today are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to GAAP, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those schedules follow the presentation and are an integral part of the presentation. With that, I'll turn it over to Steve Malcolm, our Chairman.
Steve Malcolm - Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Travis. Welcome to our second-quarter conference call, and thank you for your interest in our company. We are very pleased with our second-quarter results. And I believe our investment thesis continues to revolve around four key points. First, we own and operate some of the very best, highest quality, largest scale natural gas-related assets in North America. Secondly, we are opportunity-rich, in terms of our organic investment options. Thirdly, we are investing in a disciplined and prudent manner, driven by our adoption of the EVA methodology. And lastly, we believe we are in the midst of a sustained, attractive energy price environment that will allow our businesses to prosper. Let's look at slide number five, which lists the key headlines that you will be hearing much more about during the call this morning. First, crisp execution around our various business unit strategies has delivered a very strong second quarter. Some of the drivers -- 20% growth in natural gas production quarter-over-quarter and the fact that margins remain very strong, creating a nearly $200 million recurring quarter for Midstream. Secondly, we nearly doubled our recurring income from a year ago, after removing marked-to-market effect. Third, we're raising profit guidance for 2006, 2007 and 2008, a 19% increase in guidance specifically for 2006. And we're delighted that, again, production growth is up. We're seeing positive developments in the Piceance Basin, as Ralph Hill will describe in a minute. Continued robust margins, sustained strength in crude prices have allowed us to recalibrate our Midstream expectations upward again. And our gas pipeline rate cases are on pace to go into effect early next year. We're accelerating the production growth by investing incremental dollars in the Piceance Basin, and our MLP strategy will accelerate delivery of financial benefits to Williams by pursuing a goal to complete another $1 billion to $1.5 billion in drop-downs over the next six months. Slide six speaks to the fact that crisp execution around our business unit strategies is driving both near-term growth and strong, sustainable increases in shareholder value. We are clearly delivering on our promises. So far in 2006, you’ve seen increased dividend of 20%, up to $0.09. That's the third increase in less than two years. Again, increased natural gas production by nearly 20% completed a $360 million drop-down into Williams Partners. We resolved significant legacy issues. We have eliminated almost all of our secured debt and improved our credit ratings. As well, we achieved very strong second-quarter results, nearly doubled recurring results after removing the marked-to-market effects; posted nearly $200 billion in Midstream recurring segment profit; experienced robust NGL margins that more than offset the effect of lower and natural gas prices. Importantly, we are well-positioned for continued success. As a result, we have increased our 2006, 2007 and 2008 profit guidance. We have boosted capital spending to develop production and reserves faster, and we're accelerating drop-downs into the MLP. On slide seven, let's talk a little bit more about the drop-downs. We're close to the one year anniversary of our IPO, and over the past year, we've gotten a lot of questions about our strategy and about the pace at which we intend to drop down assets. We have been in and out of quiet periods because of the level of activity at Williams Partners, but let's review the bidding. Again, we had our successful IPO in August of 2005. We recently closed a $360 million transaction, a drop-down of 25.1% of Four Corners gathering and processing assets and we’ve seen a 21% increase in WPZ unit distributions since the IPO. We're pursuing a goal to drop down $1 billion to $1.5 billion in assets over the next six months. And our deep bench of qualifying assets supports annual drop-downs of $1 billion to $2 billion during the guidance period on an annual basis. However, and very importantly, as we talk about our MLP strategy, it is important to note that all of the terms, including price, of any transactions between the Company and the partnership are subject to approval by the Boards of Directors of both Williams and the general partner of Williams Partners. As well, the terms of certain transactions will also be subject to approval by the Conflicts Committee of the Board of Directors of the general partner of Williams Partners. And lastly, keep in mind that our MLP strategy requires a disciplined capital structure, as the partnership's credit rating is linked to Williams'. A reminder on slide eight regarding the key drivers for our MLP drop-downs. These drop-down create an ongoing source of lower-cost capital, essentially funding higher-return growth investments with capital derived from lower-return mature assets. Drop-downs allow Williams' general partnership interests to grow in size and value. These drop-downs drive a growing source of LP unit and general partnership distributions, and to the extent that we retain MLP units in any transactions, there's an opportunity for unit price upside and additional cash flow through distributions. With that, I'll turn it over to Don Chappel.
Donald Chappel – Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Steve, and good morning to everyone on the call. Thanks for joining us. I will quickly run through our results, and then come back later in the call to review our new guidance and some other matters. Now, let's turn to slide number ten, financial results. First, I'll just note that the third line, reported net loss for the quarter of $76 million, certainly was burdened by substantial nonrecurring charges related to litigation settlements and litigation contingencies. We will look at the detail of that in just a moment. As well, the reported earnings were affected by marked-to-market accounting business related to our Power business. Both the nonrecurring items and the marked-to-market accounting effects distort the true picture of the business's very strong performance. I'll speak more about those matters in just a moment. Let's look those matters and look to the last line on this slide, the most important earnings measure, recurring income from continuing operations after marked-to-market adjustments. This is a measure that strips out the nonrecurring and marked-to-market effects, and the one we have pointed you to consistently. You can see $0.33 versus $0.17 in the previous quarter, up $0.16 or 94%, and on a year-to-date basis, at $0.59 versus $0.39 in the prior six months, up $0.20 or 51%. Let's turn to slide number 11, recurring income from continuing operations. I'll walk you through our nonrecurring items and calculation of recurring earnings. As you can see, the second quarter of 2006, the major item that I mentioned earlier, regulatory and litigation contingencies, settlements and related costs. As Steve mentioned, we're delighted to be able to put a number of these important matters behind us. The second-quarter item includes the Williams shareholder class-action litigation settlement related to 2002 events, totaling $161 million pretax, and the recent jury award related to the Gulf Liquids litigation at $88 million. Please note that of the $88 million, $68 million was charged to Midstream segment profit and $20 million was charged to interest expense. Again, this is still distorted because of marked-to-market effects. Let's turn the page, and we'll look at recurring income and how we eliminate the marked-to-market effects related to our Power business. Going to the third line, marked-to-market adjustments for Power -- first, we will reverse the forward unrealized marked-to-market loss in the current quarter of $38 million. We will add back realized gains from marked-to-market that was previously recognized that is now reversing off the balance sheet, totaling $100 million, for total marked-to-market adjustments of $138 million, as compared to $55 million in the prior year. There's a tax effect on that, so net of tax, we have an $85 million marked-to-market effect, as compared to $34 million in the prior year, or a change of $52 million. Again, we needed to add back $52 million more than last year, in order to put the business back on an equivalent basis. Looking at the full year, we reversed the forward unrealized marked-to-market gains of $4 million, reduced income by that. We added back the realized gains from marked-to-market previously recognized of $177 million, for a total of $173 million as compared to $53 million the other way in the first half of 2005, or a $226 million swing six months to six months. Again, at the bottom of the slide, recurring diluted earnings per share after marked-to-market adjustments of $0.33 versus the $0.17 I mentioned earlier, and for six months, $0.59 versus $0.39. Next slide please, number 13. Second-quarter segment profit, in a consolidating format for both reported and recurring -- again, both litigation charges and marked-to-market effects and other nonrecurring items affect reported. I will focus my comments on recurring. If you scan down the slide to the bold line segment profit after marked-to-market adjustments, you can see the segment profit on that basis at $500 million, up from $356 million in the prior year's quarter, up $144 million or 40%. Also note at the bottom of the page that Power, on a basis adjusted for marked-to-market and nonrecurring effects, totaled $59 million versus a loss a year ago of $7 million, for an improvement of $66 million. We will talk about each of the business units as we walk through some subsequent slides. The next slide, please, number 14. On a year-to-date basis -- again, reported as distorted by nonrecurring items and marked-to-market effects. Focusing on recurring, and again scanning down the page, the segment profit after marked-to-market, $938 million in the first half versus $748 million a year ago, an improvement of $190 million or 25%. Again, Power at the bottom of the page, you can see there it's $71 million versus $11 million a year ago. Again, more on this in just a couple of minutes. The next slide, please, number 15. Take a look at E&P in a bit more detail. Again, recurring segment profit of $120 million was up just slightly from 2005 and, on a year-to-date basis, $267 million, up $53 million or 25% from 2005. We continue to be very pleased with our production growth in the E&P unit. Total net production is up over 20%, comparing the second quarter 2006 to the same period a year ago, which equates to adding more than 130 million cubic feet per day since the second quarter of last year. Recurring segment profit is up 25% year to date, compared to the same time last year, with total net production up about 19% and net realized average prices higher by approximately 8%. Operating profit in the second quarter was still up versus last year, despite index gas prices at the basin level being down 10% year over year, while our net realized average prices were essentially flat. We did have some additional operating expense recorded in the second quarter of 2006 that was associated with prior periods, for an amount totaling $9 million. $6 million of that relates to the first quarter of 2006 and $3 million relates to 2005. Excluding these out-of-period expenses, operating profit for the quarter would have been up approximately 9%. So, even though operating expenses are recorded as a up $0.21 per Mcf for the quarter year over year, after adjusting for the prior-period amounts, operating costs were up about $0.09 per Mcf. Of that $0.09, about $0.05 is related to our decision to step up our workover program in the Piceance and the San Juan Basins, further helping our volumes. The remaining $0.04 per Mcfe, or about a 9% increase, we think is not unexpected. We think this is about the same cost increase, or perhaps less than what others in the industry are experiencing. Comparing the current quarter to the prior-year quarter, net realized average natural gas prices were about flat, at $4.17 in the current-year quarter versus $4.16 in the prior-year quarter. For the six-month period, net realized average natural gas prices were approximately 8% higher, $4.42 for the current period as compared to $4.09 in the prior period. Let's turn to the next slide, please, number 16. Reported segment profit of $131 million was reduced by $68 million relating to the Gulf Liquids litigation accrual. Recurring segment profit, $199 million versus $109 million for the same quarter in the prior year, up $90 million or 83%, driven principally by the strong NGL margins. On a year-to-date basis, the recurring segment profit of $344 million compared to 2005 with $106 million, a 45% increase. Looking at the second quarter 2006 versus second quarter 2005, the major drivers to our recurring segment profit -- a record NGL unit margins, higher fee revenue, higher product margins from our Canadian olefins group and increased operating expenses. In the second quarter of 2006, natural gas liquids margins exceeded historic levels, averaging $0.33 per gallon. The price variance contributed $72 million to the overall $75 million margin variance. The remaining $3 million was contributed by slightly higher volumes. Fee revenue increased $13 million quarter over quarter, primarily from the Deepwater Gulf, based on increased Triton, Goldfinger and resident volumes across Devils Tower and higher unit of production rates. Fee revenue in the West also contributed an increase due to contract renegotiations and right escalations. Our olefins group contributed $10 million more than the prior year's quarter, mostly due to $13 million in higher margins, particularly propane and propylene margins in Canada, partially offset by lower volumes. Operating expenses increased $10 million overall, $9 million from the West due to additional turbine overhauls, more lease compression and added personnel. $1 million came from Gulf, attributed to increased insurance premiums. On a year-over-year basis, our major drivers are the very strong NGL unit margins, higher fee revenue and increased operating expenses. NGL unit margins were $0.12 per gallon higher year to date 2006 than year to date 2005. This created the $79 million increase in segment profit. Volume was down 6% from a year ago, causing a negative $6 million volume variance. The price variance was a positive $85 million. Higher fee revenue resulted in a $36 million increase. The West increased $8 million due to higher contract rates. The Gulf increased $28 million, mainly due to increased volumes from Triton and Goldfinger and higher Devils Tower unit-of-production rates. Operating expenses increased $20 million, $17 million from the West, again, with turbine overhauls, more lease compression and additional personnel and $3 million from the Gulf due to higher insurance premiums. Overall, a terrific quarter, once again. Turning next to slide number 17, you can see recurring segment profit of $123 million is $20 million lower than 2005; on a year-to-date basis, $255 million, down $42 million. Again, this is a year in anticipation of rate cases and rate increases, and we expect to recover our higher costs, beginning in 1Q 2007, following the new rate cases, which go into effect in first quarter of 2007, subject to refund. Generally, the lower year-over-year second-quarter recurring results are due to higher operating costs, including labor, benefits and depreciation, as well as higher pension expense and property insurance. These increased expenses are partially offset by higher earnings at Gulfstream and our other joint ventures. Again, it's important to note that these higher expenses will be included in our current rate filings and subject to refund. We expect them to be recovered in 2007 and beyond. The next slide, please, number 18. Segment for Power. Power reported a segment loss of $80 million, fairly comparable to the prior year, and $102 million year to date versus a reported profit of $39 million in the prior year. But again, the reported earnings here are distorted by marked-to-market effects, as well as nonrecurring items. You can see there are no nonrecurring items in the current year. However, marked-to-market effects we walked through before are noted here just above the final total. Recurring segment profit after the marked-to-market, $59 million versus a $7 million loss a year ago, an improvement of $66 million, and year to date, at $71 million versus $11 million, an improvement of $60 million. Overall, Power performance was sharply improved as legacy matters dissipated. These results are in line with our plans and our guidance. Next slide please, number 19. Take a quick look at our liquidity. Cash and cash equivalents at $980 million, other current securities about $400 million. We do subtract subsidiary international cash at $446 million, because it's not readily available for general corporate purposes, as well as we subtract customer margin deposits that we may have to return based on changes in commodity prices. I would note that that number, the $32 million that remains as of June 30, totaled $320 million as of December 2005 and $129 million as of March 2006. The $290 million decreases since the beginning of the year reflects margin that was returned to counterparties as commodity prices changed. However, that had no effect on our calculated liquidity, as we planned to return those. Those monies move in and out quite fluidly. So, after adjusting out $900 million in cash, $1.7 billion in revolver capacity for total liquidity of $2.6 billion, we maintain the substantial cash and liquidity balances to do a few different things. One is to manage our margin positions -- again, very substantial movement in cash and liquidity, related to supporting marginable hedges, as well as our substantial reinvestments into the business are currently exceeding our operating cash flows. That is driving very substantial growth. However, that needs to be funded. Finally, the litigation settlements contingencies and settlements have yet to be funded. Next slide, please, number 20. Cash flow information. Just a few highlights -- a good, strong cash flow quarter with $500 million, $673 million year to date. You can see debt retirements and proceeds from debt issuances were about even. The proceeds from debt issuances do include MLP issuances, which totaled $150 million during the second quarter, related to the Four Corners drop-down. The next line item, proceeds from the sale of partnership units, again related to MLP equity raised, totaling $225 million during the second quarter related to that Four Corners drop-down. Let's move on to slide number 21 and Ralph Hill.
Ralph Hill – Senior Vice President, Exploration and Production: Thank you, Don. Let's go ahead and flip to slide 22. 2006 accomplishments is at the top of that slide. As Don and Steve had mentioned, it was a strong quarter and first half of 2006 performance for E&P. I would also like to compliment our other business units on their very strong performance. Second-quarter 2006 production was up 20% or 130 million a day. We now have six H&P rigs operating in the Piceance Valley, additional 12,200 acres of our Piceance Valley had density, 10-acre density, spacing approved. I have a slide on that in just a minute. Our Piceance Highlands continue to build momentum. I have a slide on that also. The Big George and Powder River volumes are impressive. They continue their impressive growth. We expect to expand our Barnett Shale position through a bolt-on expansion. Our first-quarter 10-Q discussed a Barnett type expansion that we did, and we expect to do a similar size expansion in the third or fourth quarter of this year. Our San Juan Basin team was awarded the Best Management Practices from the BLM, which is about the fourth award in the last three or four years that they have won for their outstanding work in the San Juan Basin. Turning to slide 23, looking at our 10-acre densities that have been approved, the colored part of this slide shows the 74,000 acres that we own in the Valley; this is the Piceance Valley alone. The green outline shows the approximately 37,000 acres that we have had downspaced previously. The blue acreage shows approximately a little over 11,000 acres that were approved for 10-acre downspacing density approval in April of 2006, which added 800 additional bottom-hole locations. Most recently, the purple part shows the slightly over 12,000 acres that we had approved for 10-acre development in July of 2006. This will provide about an additional 890 additional bottom-hole locations. In total, we have now downspaced about 60,000 acres in the Valley, of our 74,000 acres, which is about 80% of our Valley acreage. We continue to be very successful in working with our communities, the state and local officials and regulatory officials in downspacing our acreage, which is a testament to our field employees in the Piceance area. Slide 24, looking specifically at the Piceance production, it is up, by itself, 104 million or 34% a year ago. We currently have 23 rigs operating in the Valley and the Highlands combined, compared to 13 a year ago. We will have four additional H&P rigs, Flex rigs, which will be received in 2006. We have four Nabors Super Sundowner rigs, which are similar to the H&P Flex rigs, which we will receive in early 2007. At that time, we will be able to high-grade our fleet. An additional part of what we have done in the Piceance Valley is we did perform, as I mentioned, in the first quarter what we call sim-ops or simultaneous operations. We have been doing that significantly. We had done one at the time of the last call, and now we have done quite a few sim-ops. That is basically where we are -- for the first time ever on land that we can tell, fracing, perforating, drilling and producing at the same time from the same pad. It's part of the reason for our efficiencies. So we are, as you can tell, on the last (indiscernible) able to high-grade our fleet. We are on target to achieve the rig count of 25 that we originally planned. Earlier in the year, we did pick up additional rigs, as you recall, to compensate for the delay in the H&P delivery rigs, due to the hurricanes of last year. Now, due to our efficiencies and increasing industry activity, this year in the Valley, we will drill 19 more operated wells and also, due to outside operating increases in activity, we will have 34 more nonoperated wells we will participate in than originally planned. Our current projection going forward is 20 or 21, possibly 22 rigs operating in the Valley, with about four operating in the Highlands, increasing over time to six or more as we continue to expand the infrastructure in the Highlands. The key is our efficiencies will allow us to drill more wells and high-grade our rig fleet without adding more rigs and stressing the infrastructure. We have seen rig efficiencies from the H&P rigs from 10 to 50%, with the average about 25%. A true testament to our team, they continue to grind out efficiency in the conventional rigs, and we have squeezed out another 5% to 6% improvement in efficiencies in our conventional rigs. Turning to slide 25, Piceance Highlands, we are building momentum. We now have 44 wells currently producing, up from just eight wells a year ago. We have 13 million a day of current net production, over 20 million a day of gross production. That's up over 10 million a day from just a year ago. There are seven rigs in the Highlands operating; that's part of the 23 we are talking about. Currently, we have 16 in the Valley and seven in the Highlands. We are doing major road and pipeline infrastructure buildouts. As you will see in our guidance, we are doing quite a bit. What that does for us -- by building the roads and the infrastructures and the plants and the water lines now, it provides shorter, safer and more reliable access to our thousands of wells we will have in the Highlands. It will save several million dollars per year in rigs moves, cement crew mileage, frac crew and proper transportation. Much time savings, which will ultimately decrease our cycle time and add present value per well. It will save, we believe, millions of dollars over the life of the Trail Ridge and Allen Point projects. So the investments we will be making this year will save millions of dollars in the future for us. Looking at slide 26, turning to the Powder River, continued impressive growth in the Powder River production. We have divided the graph on this page to show the Wyodak, which has generally declined, and the Big George, which has been inclining. Our total Powder River volumes are up 26 million a day or 23% from the second quarter of 2005, and the Big George continues to drive the volume growth, as the slide shows and the graph shows. It was up over 108 million a day or 99% from the second quarter of 2005, and sequentially it was up 44 million a day or 25% from the first quarter of 2006. So we continue to have very impressive results from the Powder River team. and they are doing an outstanding job. Looking at slide 27, a good and a well-established core capability, we believe our organization is to identify new grass-roots opportunities. I announced three last call, which are listed again in the appendix. Those three are listed again in the appendix on slide 62. We have another farm-in opportunity we are moving closer to finalizing that is listed on this slide. It is in the Piceance Basin. It will be a drill-to-earn type deal. It's in the Williams Fork Formation, which is what we drill in both the Valley and in the Highlands, about 11,000 net acres to Williams. Very high net revenue interest, as you can see there, with over 600 plus potential drill locations. We will operate that. That is on a 40-acre spacing. Obviously, first we have to get the deal done and then, obviously, start moving it. But it is in the Piceance, and we continue to be excited about our ability to expand our acreage in the Piceance. Slide 28 -- this is a buildup to slide 29 on our capital guidance change. As I've discussed during this call, with the continued success of our drilling programs overall and the new opportunities we're seeing, we're very pleased to announce an increase in capital guidance, production guidance and segment profit guidance. This is due to additional drilling we believe we can do in the Valley and the Highlands, due to our efficiencies. It is also is due to an increase in costs, which we're projecting at 3.7%, due to the tight nature of our industry. That would be at 3.7% on our base costs from the original budget. We also have additional gathering and processing infrastructure we need, not only for our own volumes but also for an increasing level of third-party volumes, as we become a major gatherer and processor in the Valley. We have major infrastructure buildouts in terms of roads, et cetera, in the Highlands, which I have previously discussed. We have, also, new opportunities in both the Rockies and Barnett that we are pursuing that has also added to our guidance. The changes are listed by category on the top part of this slide. The shaded box shows the midpoint changes. I believe it's also important, as you look through the midpoint changes, to note that our increase in segment profit and DD&A returns about 42% of our capital increase, just in this period alone, which reflects the fast cash return cycles we have in our E&P investments. Also, this is with very significant infrastructure investments we are making currently that will benefit our production for years to come. On slide 29, all that adds into our changes in guidance. You can see the segment profit, the new segment profit, capital spending and production guidance and segment profit and DD&A guidance, and the old guidance is listed below. Keep in mind that our price assumptions, which are listed below on the bottom part of the slide, are also below market. As you can see, they declined from assumptions in 2006. So these price assumptions could prove to be conservative. Finally, slide 30 -- we believe our value creation continues for the E&P industry. Industry leader in production growth, cost efficiencies and reserve replacements. I think that is shown by our 20% production growth. We have a very long-term, repeatable drilling inventory. Please recall we have 10.7 Tcf of 3P reserves, and our resource potential is 13 to 15 Tcf. Our strategy remains a rapid development of our premier drilling inventory, and I believe that is reflected in our increase in guidance for CapEx for our production and our profits. We continue to have a very long history of high drilling successes, short time cycles investments, fast cash returns. I would like to just restress that over 40% of our CapEx is returned by the end of 2008, even with the very large infrastructure buildup we are doing. The Highlands is significantly contributing. We are looking for even more contributions. I continue to be very thankful that we have such an experienced and talented workforce. With that, I will now turn it over the Alan Armstrong, who will reflect on a very strong quarter.
Alan Armstrong – Senior Vice President, Midstream Gathering & Processing: Thank you very much, Ralph, appreciate that. I do have the pleasure of announcing some dramatic increases in our second-quarter performance, another increase in our 2006 guidance and, finally, significant increases in our 2007 and 2008 guidance. But first, let me talk about some accomplishments during the second quarter. We reached a new record for recurring segment profit of $199 million during the quarter. We saw our NGL production volumes rebound, as our Cameron Meadows plant got back online with one of its trains. The second training Cameron will be coming back online this month, so we're excited to have that capacity back up. We enjoyed extraordinary margins in the second quarter, and these have persisted into the third quarter as well. Our NGL margins averaged $0.33 per gallon for the second quarter, and this was nearly three times the five-year annual average. We also sold forward NGL volumes during the second quarter, and we sold those forward into the third quarter that equaled about 40% of our projected sales volume. These were at prices that support the type of margin that we saw here in the second quarter. So we're excited about the position we're in, going into the third quarter. We also were very busy during the quarter managing the drop-down transaction for a 25% interest in our San Juan Basin gathering, treating and processing business. We brought in about $360 million in cash to Williams from this transaction. Just as a measure on that, this equated to an EBITDA multiple of about 9.6, based on our 2005 performance on that. The expansion of our business in our core growth area goes on, probably most importantly. Our investment and enhancements of the Opal TXP-IV train that we bought at the first of the year are certainly paying off in this margin environment. We are now hoping for mechanical completion of our TXP-V, our fifth train at Opal, by the end of this year. This is certainly going to be a welcome addition to revenue environment, as that large train starts to produce income for us. Additionally, we continue to build out our very large-scale deepwater infrastructure. The first phase of our Wamsutter gathering expansion was just recently completed at the very end of the second quarter, and we're looking forward to further expansions of that, as BP and Anadarko continue their drilling -- and Devon, actually, continue their drilling plan in that area. So overall, a great quarter and a lot of accomplishments that we are very excited about during the quarter. Going on to the next slide, this shows some exciting news that we have to share here. First of all, we're raising guidance across the board, as you can see. The smaller numbers there below on the segment profit guidance were our previous guidance, and the ones there above are our new guidance. Now, it's important to note that this guidance is on a reported basis, so this does include the Gulf Liquids charge that Don Chappel mentioned earlier. Even with that, we're still raising guidance again. In May, we raised our 2006 guidance from $400 million to $500 million to a $500 million to $600 million. Now we are raising this midpoint again by another $67 million, as measured at the midpoint. Without the Gulf Liquids charge, this guidance would be up by $135 million at the midpoint for 2006. So very strong increases riding on both the back of the strong NGL margins and the continued strong performance at some of our deepwater assets, namely our Devils Tower facility. This raised guidance assumes the commodity environment shown here of $7.84 for Henry Hub prices and a $62 to $70 WTI barrel. So on a recurring basis, it is certainly possible and probable that we could produce over $900 million of recurring segment profit and depreciation for 2006. So we're continuing to enjoy this in the third quarter, and we have got some fairly moderate assumptions in here for crude oil pricing, as you can see, for the balance of the year. Looking forward, we're raising guidance at the midpoint by over $150 million for both 2007 and 2008. This increase assumes the pricing environment that is shown in the table in the bottom of the page, so you can see that is an oil price environment of between $55 and $69 WTI, and a natural gas price of $7. It's important to note that these natural gas prices coincide with our E&P group's assumptions. So if this price is a little too low for your liking, then the positive is going to show up on E&P segment profit. The really key assumption, then, on an enterprise level gets down to crude oil price. So that $55 to $69 is important to key on. I will tell you that our margins assume a slightly lower correlation of NGLs to crude oil price than what we have seen historically. So we are being conservative in our forecast for that. No changes on our capital budget guidance, even though we have some exciting capital projects that we're anxious to announce, and I'm going to go into that here on the next couple of slides. This graph is depicting the health of our Midstream business, in terms of both sustainable free cash flow and growth. The dark blue bar that you see on the right shows our segment profit plus DD&A from our base business at a five-year average margin, which now stands at about $0.132 per gallon. The blue hashed bar shows the amount of margin lift that we expect at the midpoint, over and above the five-year average. Finally, the purple segment on top of this bar shows the recent expansions and the segment profit improvement that we're expecting from those recent expansions. Some of those in 2006 -- for instance, the Opal TXP-IV -- we're enjoy today, and you can see that there at the top of the 2006 piece. As you can see, our base business is growing even with constant margins and no new investments. This is largely driven by higher deepwater fee-based revenues and higher rates being realized in our GNP business out West. Probably the most impressive thing about this graph is the spread between our segment profit plus DD&A and our capital expense bar. As you can see, in 2008, that is reaching up to nearly $800 million of spread between our segment profit plus DD&A and our capital expenditures. So tremendous free cash flow being generated from this business, even without some of the exciting expansion opportunities I am going to mention on the next page here. This slide gives you a glimpse of the opportunities for additional investments in our business. On the right-hand side, we show projects that have moved to the point of commitment and are included in our guidance through 2008. Of course, this includes our Blind Faith expansion, which is an extension off our Devils Tower system, the Opal TXP-IV that we acquired this year, Opal TXP-V expansion that I mentioned earlier and our Tahiti lateral expansion moving out to Chevron's big play, Tahiti play, coming off our Discovery system. So all of those have been committed, contracted and are under construction. See that there. The column in the center shows the projects that we believe we will be successful in contracting in the near future, and we look forward to announcing. A little bit of that is in guidance -- things, for instance, like continued expansion of our Wamsutter investment. That's just a matter of getting, really, the scope of that project pinned down with BP, and making sure we all agree on what's the best way to expand that system to keep up with their drilling plans out there. But what is really some of the bigger drivers to this are some large Western Gulf of Mexico deepwater expansions that we're hoping to announce very shortly. Then finally, you can see -- we show a very robust set of opportunities that are consistent with our strategy of continuing to invest in very large-scale facilities in these growth basins. That's over on the left, between $0.5 billion and $1.5 billion. You can kind of see how that is broken out in terms of the areas we are expecting those to show up in. And in total, we hope to invest between $1 billion and $2 billion in this business over the next three years, as you look at these opportunities. Moving on to the final slide here, I certainly want to complement our operating team. By continuing to focus on providing our customers with the most reliable service available in the midstream industry, that absolutely is going to be the secret to our success going forward, as it has been to date. We're making great strides in proving up the value of our strategy to both our shareholders and our customers, who value our ability to expand alongside them as they continue to drill in these growth basins. Our base business continues to generate healthy returns and free cash flows. As noted, our NGL margins exceeded historic levels and, mentioned earlier, three times the previous five-year average. And this is an excellent example of how the enterprise and the integrated model is working for us, as we were unable to cushion some of the impact on lower gas prices to the rest of the enterprise. We do expect NGL margins to remain above historic levels in this guidance period, and progress continues on our deepwater expansions. And as I mentioned, we're foreshadowing some additional expansion we hope to announce in the near future on that. And in terms of the Western growth, that is tremendous in terms of the amount of opportunities we're beginning to see, even stretching outside of our Wyoming and Four Corners area, also looking into some opportunities in Colorado. So excited about what lays ahead of us and thrilled with the performance of the business right now. And with that, I will turn it back to Don.
 Donald Chappel – Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: I'm going to try to run through this next section pretty quickly. I just note that much similar information to what E&P and Midstream presented for Gas Pipes and Power is in the appendix, as well as a lot of other analysis for your reference. Side number 38 forecasts guidance; I'll just jump right to the bottom. $0.95 to $1.20, a midpoint of about $1.08, up about $0.17 or 19% from our prior guidance. And you can see the elements of that. Again, the guidance, the segment profit before marked-to-market adjustment, that also would be including non-recurring items. So those are, again, on a reported basis. The net interest expense, I would note, is up $20 million related to that Gulf Liquids litigation. And let's flip to the next slide. Next slide, number 39, segment profit summary, and again, let's just jump right to the bottom. Total recurring after market-to-market adjustments in a range of about $1.7 billion to $2 billion, midpoint of about $1.850 billion, up nicely from our May guidance. If we look over to 2008, you'll see the range increasing steadily, ‘07 and then ‘08, to 2.2 billion to almost 2.9 billion. And again, let me note that that's based on us and gas price of about $7 in crude oil price assumption that, again, is well below current market. So we believe that our price assumptions are somewhat conservative. But the $1.850 billion midpoint in ‘06 to the $2.550 billion midpoint in ‘08 represents a $700 million increase in expected segment profit, or about 38% in just 24 months. As well, the outlook beyond 2008 remains quite bright. The next slide, please. Number 40, capital spending summary. Again, some increases in the E&P, related to additional drilling activity and infrastructure to support the drilling. Again, these are low-risk, high-return projects that we believe will drive a great deal of value for shareholders. And again, we continue to be opportunity-rich, and we would expect to be adding from time to time to our capital spending guidance, particularly for ’07, ‘08 and beyond, as we are able to seize some additional opportunities that we see in E&P, Midstream and Gas Pipeline. The next slide, please, number 41. We have spent some time on segment profit. Let's look at cash flow from operations this year, in a range of 1.5 billion to 1.8 billion. Growing nicely in ‘07, and by ‘08, in a range of 2.4 billion to 2.825 billion, a very strong increase. And I will say a few more words in just a moment. Operating free cash flow is a bit more negative in 2006 as a result of these increased investments, but we think it's worth it. And again, the funding sources for that negative cash position or cash flow position are the excess liquidity we have today, as well as the expected capital to be raised in the future as a result of actions that we have discussed, particularly related to MLP drop-downs. If we, again, fast forward to 2007 and 2008, you can see operating free cash flow growing substantially. Again, I caveat that. We were opportunity-rich with very high return, low to moderate risk projects. We would intend to seize those in order to drive even more value for you. The next slide here, number 42, just graphically depicts what we just talked about. And again, I would note the increase in cash flow grows again from about $1.650 billion midpoint in 2006 to a $2.6 billion midpoint by 2008. That's a 59% improvement in just two years, almost a $1 billion improvement in cash flow from operations or 59% in just 24 months. Again, we believe that that's going to drive very strong growth and value for shareholders. The next slide, 43, a number of points just kind of made consistently. I won't run through all those today, in the interests of time. Again, I would note that I'm excited about the future. I'm very bullish about Williams and Williams' ability to create value; extraordinary opportunities in our E&P with the strong production growth, cost leadership, low-risk reserves and quickly growing reserves as a result of development, as well as some of the new deals which include farm-ins; and the lower level of legacy gas hedges that we see ahead. In Midstream, we expect continued strong NGL margins, driven by sustained higher oil prices. Again, the margins that we're forecasting are based on prices that are somewhat below current market. As well, we have franchise positions in both the West and the deepwater, and our MLP will add value to not only Midstream but the enterprise in lowering our cost of capital and building value in the GP. In Pipelines, the two rate cases take effect in the first quarter of 2007. The Northwest Pipeline replacement project, a $300 million capital project, will go in service in November of 2006. New rates will take effect in January of 2007. As well, we have a number of other organic growth opportunities. Finally, the power market continues to strengthen, and our major positions are in relatively tight markets. Let me remind you, California and the PJM market -- we have a continued ability to hedge forward and improve prospects for unhedged megawatts. Overall, again, a very bright outlook that we are very excited about. I'll turn it to Steve.
Steve Malcolm - Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Don. Obviously, a lot of great news, substantial progress, positive developments. I think we're hitting on all cylinders. Again, crisp execution around our strategies caused us to deliver very strong results in the second quarter. We've raised our profit guidance for 2006, 2007 and 2008. We are accelerating the pace of our drilling activities, and we have talked about an MLP strategy that accelerates delivery of financial benefits to Williams. Before we take questions, I'll turn it back to Travis Campbell who has an announcement.
Travis Campbell - Head of Investor Relations: Just real quickly, during the call, I was made aware that there was a problem with the webcast, with our third-party provider. Apparently, it was a systemwide problem. Please be aware that the whole call will be available for replay later today on our website, so you can get the whole call. I apologize for that inconvenience. With that, we will go ahead and turn it back to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator instructions]. We go first to Carl Kirst of Credit Suisse.
Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse: He good morning everybody and congratulations on a great quarter. First, Ralph, the downspace in the Valley, the 890 additional locations -- are we still looking at roughly a 1.3 Bcfe to 1.4 Bcfe per well EUR for the 10-acre down spacing? And I guess if so, that could at least potentially lead to quite another nice increase to the 3P potential? Am I looking at that correctly?
Ralph Hill: We basically have said the gross EUR is 1.2 to 1.4 B's, and we have seen that consistently out there. Second thing, though, we have assumed as we have gone forward, and when we've talked about 3P, we have assumed the Valley would receive 10-acre spacing already. So we have those locations in our inventory of 3P's. It's just that we have been able to get approval to ensure that they will be in the locations we can drill.
Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse: Appreciate that clarification. One other clarification. You talked about, obviously, expanding acreage at both the Piceance and the Barnett. You mentioned bolt-on. Are these small enough, I guess, that are actually in the currently envisioned CapEx guidance? Or, when you say you could bolt on these with something, you'd be independent of the current CapEx guidance, might be larger transactions?
Ralph Hill: Well, for the Piceance, they would be independent and they would be an additive to our current guidance. The small amount of the Barnett, since it is a smaller size, is already in the CapEx. We've assumed we're going to have those deals closed in the CapEx guidance. But additional bolt-ons, both in the appendix and in the one I talked about today, that would be additional opportunities for us to go out and drill, and additional locations and production and all that.
Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse: Keying off of Don's last comment, and then if Bill is in the room, maybe he could comment on sort of the current view of power market liquidity and, I guess, this latest heatwave that has come across the state. Does that change utilities' longer-term views? It has been our sense that as more, certainly, investment houses have gotten in, we have seen liquidity break out a little bit more into the outer years, 2010 plus. I was wondering if you could comment on that.
 Donald Chappel: Yeah Carl, I think the heatwave -- a couple of comments. First of all, keep in mind that our portfolio is highly hedged. So we're creating cash flow certainty, but certainly limiting some upside. I do think one thing that will come out of it, though, it shows a tightening in supply and demand. I think that will lead utilities to look longer-term for contracts.
Carl Kirst - Credit Suisse: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We go next to Faisel Khan of Citigroup.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Good morning. On your free cash flow projections that you have in your presentation, that does not include proceeds from the drop-down of assets to MLP. Is that correct?
 Donald Chappel: That is correct. There is no assumption built into our guidance with respect to MLP drop-downs.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: As you bring those proceeds back up to Williams Companies, what is the preference in terms of what you want to do with that excess cash? 
 Donald Chappel: I would note first that, again, we do -- obviously, we consolidate the MLP. But from a credit perspective, the ratings agencies and debt investors look at the combined credit of the two companies, and WPZ's credit is linked very closely to Williams' credit. So we would likely be taking the proceeds from debt capital issuances at the MLP level, and using similar amounts to pay down debt at the Williams level, in order to remain credit neutral, more or less. Then the equity capital raised at the MLP level would be available for reinvestment or other corporate purposes. Again, there is a limit in terms of how much equity capital can be raised in the MLP market. From what we have seen, it has been perhaps in the range of $500 million to $800 million on an annual basis. So $500 million to $800 million combined with a like amount of debt to properly capitalize the MLP gets you to kind of a $1 billion, $1.6 billion annual rate of drop-downs in terms of capital market capacity, without Williams taking units. Anything above that, certainly Williams may have to take Class B units as consideration.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: In terms of increasing your guidance in Midstream, how much of the increase in guidance is really a function of the current commodity prices? Or does the increase in guidance have to do with new projects coming online?
Alan Armstrong: If you look at the free cash flow bar there, you can see the portion of that that is from margin uplift, and you can see the portion that is from discretionary expansion. In 2006, the vast majority of the increase in 2006 is from NGL margins, but we also have a very substantial portion coming from Devils Tower. So I wouldn't want to give you an exact number on the Devils Tower piece, but it is a substantial portion of that. it has to do with the revenue recognition and, as well, the Triton/Goldfinger volumes that are coming in to the tune of about $4 million a month, just to give you an idea compared to last year. So that is a significant increase, and that has been higher than we would have expected from them.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay, I guess asking a different way, what is your assumptions for margin per gallon, out in 2007 and 2008?
Alan Armstrong: Okay, great as you can see there, we've put in that range of $7 gas price and $55 on the bottom crude oil and the $69, I believe that is, on the high end. That would equate to, at a midpoint -- so that basically sets the low and the high of that range. At midpoint, that would be an assumption of about $0.18 per gallon.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay, I got you. Okay, and then if I could ask a question on the Power side to follow up on Carl's question, how much unhedged capacity in the L.A. Basin do you guys have, going into the third quarter?
Alan Armstrong: Faisel we're largely hedged. I'm going to estimate we have probably got around 500 megawatts or so.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay, is that some of those units that you have unhedged, is that kind of the higher heat rate stuff, or is it a mix of kind of low/mid heating?
Alan Armstrong: It's a mix.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay, great and on the E&P side, the four new Super Sundowner rigs that you're going to take delivery on -- in terms of the pricing on those rigs, is it fairly similar to what you got from H&P?
Ralph Hill: Yes. We were very fortunate, both on the H&P and on those rigs, to have locked in a rate that we believe today is substantially below market. So yes.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: On the E&P costs sequentially, I understand that there were some adjustments; there were some one-time unusual items this quarter. But sequentially, quarter over quarter, first quarter/second quarter, was there a rise in the E&P guidance? Or was that fairly flat?
Ralph Hill: We did see a rise yearly, more for the year and I guess a lot of it is sequentially. But we saw about a $0.04 per Mcf rise just in general from last year. Sequentially, we actually, because our volumes have gone up so much on a per-unit basis, if we didn't have the prior period adjustments in there, we actually would have seen our second quarter lower than our first quarter on a per-unit basis. That is something that I wish the numbers reflected, but if you look at it, I think, if you to everything out and kind of normalized it, instead of like a -- I think our investor relations sheet shows the first quarter about $0.505, and it was probably more like $0.58. The second quarter showed $0.65, that was probably more like $0.53. So it was trending down, which I would expect it to do with the strong -- even with costs going up, our volumes are going up on a stronger basis, if you will.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup: Okay, great, thank you for your time.
Ralph Hill: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We go next to Craig Shere of Calyon Securities.
Craig Shere, Calyon Securities: Hi terrific quarter. Kind of following up on a question that Faisel asked, if you're going to raise -- and I don't know if Steve or Don want to comment on this, but if you're going to raise maybe $500 million in equity a year in cash from the MLP, and you're only raising your CapEx guidance maybe a couple hundred million a year, doesn't that create extra cash flow? And what are you going to do with that?
 Donald Chappel: Craig that's a good question. Again, we have not yet concluded the MLP drop-downs in guidance. Certainly, it's a goal, and one that we believe we can execute on. But we do have some work to do with the Boards of Directors of both Williams and Williams Partners and the Conflicts Committee of Williams Partners and their advisors. But to the extent that we're in a position where we have excess cash, we know the different uses for that. Again, we're very much focused on maintaining our credit rating, improving it over time but also focused very much so on driving value for shareholders. So we will do whatever we can to create as much value as possible.
Steve Malcolm: I would just add that, certainly, we have been very clear that we are opportunity-rich, and we do have many opportunities to invest. Alan Armstrong has foreshadowed some of his opportunities. Ralph has talked about potentially some additional farm-in opportunities in the Piceance. We believe that we are creating the maximum shareholder value by investing in these very high-return projects.
Craig Shere - Calyon Securities: So let me see if I can interpret that a little bit. Steve, it sounds like there's plenty of opportunity to ink much more in terms of accretive growth CapEx projects and ultimately raise 2007/2008 guidance and beyond. Is that a fair statement? 
Steve Malcolm: Well, I can assure you that, to the extent that we do make additional investments, then you would see an associated boost in earnings guidance.
Craig Shere - Calyon Securities: On Don's comment, I kind of heard for the first time maybe a window opening there. Maybe it's because you're having so much success that you all feel that maybe you don't have to wait until you're investment grade to start applying some free cash flow towards options like share repurchases. Did I hear that correctly?
 Donald Chappel: We're not going to go into the latter part of your comment today, but certainly, I think, as Steve points out, we have very substantial, very attractive growth projects that we're pursuing with a great deal of discipline. We do see that we will have substantial proceeds that will likely be available to us through the drop-down process, to the extent that it's equity that we raise rather than debt. We will continue to look at our cash position and our cash needs and look at appropriate uses, balancing equity and debt considerations.
Craig Shere - Calyon Securities: Great and then one question for Ralph, Ralph I'm trying to understand what is driving the increased production guidance. Is it simply the really great success you're getting with increased efficiencies, or are you factoring any potential increase in rig counts in 2007 and 2008 into your increased guidance?
Ralph Hill: Well, the original guidance was 25 rigs total. We will be more, probably, as I mentioned, 20 or 21, maybe one more in the valley, and four growing to six or more in the latter years, at least, in the Highlands. So it's a slight increase, possibly, in rigs. But most of it is just efficiency guidance, efficiency improvements, which add, for this same number of rigs, additional wells drilled, which add to the production.
Craig Shere - Calyon Securities: But when you get the Nabors rigs, assuming you don't lay any older ones down, aren't you going to be over 30?
Ralph Hill: We would be, but that's the part about high-grading the fleet. We think there's an opportunity to drill at least what we had, and probably more with less rigs, more in the 25 to 27 level, and actually be more efficient. Because some of the rigs, we will just be able to either lay down or use for new opportunities, as the other Piceance areas develop for us. So I think the Valley -- we can do more in the Valley with the number we have given you or slightly higher, and not stress the infrastructure of the Valley. At the same time, we hopefully can high-grade, maybe lay some down and/or move them to new projects.
Craig Shere - Calyon Securities: What kind of timeframe would you expect before you decide on what to do with some of those legacy rigs?
Ralph Hill: That will be mostly in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, not really in the third quarter -- and even into the early part of next year, as I mentioned, first quarter. Because we were projecting the Sundowner rigs to come on in 2007. Obviously, we don't have them yet, so we need those to actually be delivered and all that. So it will take a little while.
Craig Shere - Calyon Securities: Okay, thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. We go next to Shneur Gershuni of UBS.
Shneur Gershuni - UBS: Hi, good morning guys great quarter. I just wanted to, I guess, bring the conversation back to Power again. At this point right now, when do you think that we'll start to see interest in users be interested in recontracting in California in the 2011/2012 timeframe? Is it too early to start thinking about that now? Is that six months away? Is that a year away?
Steve Malcolm: I don't think it's too early. I think there's a couple of RFPs that are being discussed that go out as far as 2014 and one as far as 2020. They are not approved, but they're certainly being discussed among various parties, the CP6, et cetera, in California. The normal cycle is three to five years, so I have estimated probably 2008/2009, you'll start to see contracts out as far as 2015.
Shneur Gershuni - UBS: Okay and I guess the second question I had was just with respect to repowering the AES plants. Is that something that you're considering? Would it involve a capital contribution on your end?
Steve Malcolm: We're certainly looking at our options as far as repowering. We're not really far enough along to say whether it would involve capital or not. There are options out there. The RFPs that are being put fourth do contemplate repowering. So we will certainly evaluate those as they come up.
Shneur Gershuni - UBS: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. We go next to Rick Gross of Lehman Brothers.
Rick Gross - Lehman Brothers: Good morning. I've got a couple of related questions on the MLP. All along, you've indicated that there isn't anything in the guidance for the drop-down, but you have now to some degree indicated that a pretty good chance we're going to see sizable assets move. From a standpoint of just looking at the implications, it would seem that for each $1 billion that you drop down, to do the math simply, 10 times would mean $100 million of EBITDA being dropped down. Over time -- once again, that's not in the forecast. On the other hand, for each $1 billion you spend, your EBITDA multiple is much lower. Let's pick a low number for talking purposes, five times. So you have got, one would think, the ability, given that we think we can spend it but not spend it, that in your own mind between the drop-down loss, the recycling math, the new opportunities that, net-net-net, there won't be a whole lot of change, even if we drop down a lot of the assets in your forecast not adjusted for the drop-down. Is that a bad assumption? Or is there likely to be the math calculus of net loss but higher valuation in the way that the cash comes to the Company?
 Donald Chappel: Certainly, we don't see that as necessarily driving a great deal of earnings upon drop-down. That's really not the goal; it's to lower the cost of capital, as well as to receive a premium valuation because of that lower cost of capital that WPZ has, as well as grow our GP value. We believe that lowering cost of capital, it will create value for Williams' shareholders. But clearly, taking assets that are in-service and earning and recapitalizing those -- we believe that the reinvestment opportunities are terrific. We have got some very strong reinvestment opportunities, but there's certainly a lag between the time those funds are available for investment or other purposes and actually seeing that show up in earnings. But nonetheless, the lowering of the cost of capital and the growing value of the GP, we think, is powerful.
Rick Gross - Lehman Brothers: The other issue, back in the appendix, is that it showed that you go from a marginally short gas position in 2006 to about breakeven in 2007 to, I don't know, a couple hundred, maybe $225 million net long in your gas position, enterprisewide. If you drop down assets, part of that short position in Midstream begins to dissipate. It moves over to the MLP. Is it likely, or is it something you will think about as far as hedging out a little bit more of your production exposure, as this kind of math percolates through the MLP drop-downs as well? 
 Donald Chappel: Another good question. Certainly, we look at the enterprise level, and to the extent that some of that commodity exposure moves over to the MLP, that we would certainly take that into consideration in determining how much to hedge.
Rick Gross - Lehman Brothers: This is a very specific question for the Power folks. Mirant has just signed an extension. I haven't seen whether that's filed or not. If it has, have you seen the terms as far as capacity payments or any of the other interesting terms that might give indication of level of market out there?
Steve Malcolm: No, Rick I haven't. We're certainly looking at it, and we will be following to see if anything is public. I also -- and I could be incorrect here -- I think that was with PG&E.
Rick Gross - Lehman Brothers: Yes, it was with PG&E. It's different, but it's semi-related.
Steve Malcolm: Yes, certainly, it will give an indication. But we haven't seen anything public yet.
Operator: Thank you. We go next to Maureen Howe of RBC Capital Markets.
Maureen Howe - RBC Capital Markets: Thanks very much. I'm just wondering, on the Power side as well, if you can give us some color post 2008. It looks like you have done a pretty good job of contracting in the West. Are you seeing an interest in purchases going longer?
Steve Malcolm: In the West, or across --?
Maureen Howe - RBC Capital Markets: Well, really across.
Steve Malcolm: Yes, I think so. We're seeing indications that it's an RFP process, in most cases. We are seeing some municipalities and co-ops who are interested in going a little further out. I think, again, some of the things you saw over the last month or two is just another indication that markets may be tightening quicker than people thought.
Maureen Howe - RBC Capital Markets: There has been a couple questions that have sort of skirted around the issue a little bit on the credit rating, and I know you've talked about opportunity-reach. So is it fair to say that you are more -- this is probably for Steve and for Don -- more focused on pursuing the growth opportunities, and perhaps less concerned about returning to investment-grade credit rating?
Steve Malcolm: Well, we certainly drew a distinction that in 2003 and 2004, we were all about debt reduction. But beginning in 2005 and continuing in 2006 and the future, it's very much a growth story, and we believe that we are creating the most shareholder value by investing in these very attractive projects. We have also said, however, that we want to continue to take steps and actions that are credit-neutral. But we will continue to make progress towards an investment-grade rating, we believe.
Maureen Howe - RBC Capital Markets: But more focused, Steve, on the growth side, perhaps, sort of growing your way out of it, as opposed to perhaps paying your debt down on your way out of it?
Steve Malcolm: That's a good conclusion. I think that's another way to paraphrase what I said. We're clearly about growth, growing our equity. We're not seeking at this point to accelerate debt buyback.
Maureen Howe - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, that’s great. Thank you
Operator: Thank you. We go next to Rebecca Followill of Howard Weil.
Rebecca Followill - Howard Weil: On the Barnett, you have talked about that it was a bolt-on expansion. Can you clarify what that means? Is that an expansion in addition of acreage, or is actually buying proved properties? Or what do you mean by a bolt-on expansion?
Ralph Hill: It's in the same vicinity of where we are today, which is basically in the core/Tier 1 area, as they call it. Basically, it is an acquisition of both some producing properties, so existing acreage, and opportunities to drill additional wells, some PUDs and some probables.
Rebecca Followill - Howard Weil: But it would be fairly small in nature?
Ralph Hill: Yes, it is pretty small, similar to what we mentioned in the first-quarter 10-Q.
Rebecca Followill - Howard Weil: Second, on the Midstream business, can you clarify again -- I know questions have been asked, but the guidance increase that you have for 2007 and 2008 -- how much of that is due to a higher oil price, and how much of it is due to additional development or capital that you're spending on projects?
Alan Armstrong: First of all, just to kind of give you a feel for that, as I mentioned earlier, $0.18 is what we have as far as our midpoint in there. The margins we experience in the second quarter of 2006 were $0.33 on the same basis, just to kind of put that in perspective for you. But if you look at that free cash flow slide that we showed, that shows you the margin uplift over and above the five-year average, which is right now about $0.132. You can see how much is coming from margin uplift there in 2007 and then in 2008. So it's about, all in all, from our earlier guidance, all in all it's about $100 million coming from margin uplift, which includes the average that increased from $0.11 to $0.13 from the recent uplift we had, and then an additional about $0.05 uplift over and above that.
Rebecca Followill - Howard Weil: Perfect. Thank you and then the 2006 guidance excludes or includes the charges for Gulfstream Liquids? I think you said that it was $135 million, but I'm looking at the release, and it looks like more like $68 million. Is that correct?
Alan Armstrong: That's right. The midpoint has increased about $68 million on a reported basis on that guidance slide; that is correct. That does include the charge.
Rebecca Followill - Howard Weil: Finally, a question on Power. I know that it will be difficult to answer it, given your past stance on this. But any thoughts to once again maybe re-looking at putting that business up for sale? I know you probably can't answer it, but I thought I'd give it a try.
Steve Malcolm: You are right. We can't. That's the short answer.
Rebecca Followill - Howard Weil: The short and sweet is no. Okay.
Steve Malcolm: The short answer is we won't comment on that, but I would say that Williams has a history -- we don't fall in love with any of our assets. We're going to do the right thing, and we're always evaluating structural steps that we can take.
Rebecca Followill - Howard Weil: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We go next to Sam Brothwell of Wachovia.
Samuel Brothwell - Wachovia : Hi good morning. I think.
Steve Malcolm: Sam, just a minute, we're running out of time, so this will be the last question.
Samuel Brothwell - Wachovia : It will be a quick one. Just looking in the appendix at your Pipeline segment profit guidance, can you give us roughly a breakdown on the delta from 2006 into 2007/2008, how much of that is coming from your assumptions on the rate increases, and how much is growth?
Phillip Wright: If you look in the appendix on slide number -- I can't read that number; somebody help me. Is that 68? We have a box in there that shows the segment profit layers for expansions that you can lift out substantially what is associated with expansions from -- I'm sorry 69.
Samuel Brothwell - Wachovia : Slide 69? I see it. Thank you very much.
Phillip Wright: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I would like you can the conference back over to Mr. Steve Malcolm for any additional or closing remarks.
Steve Malcolm: Again, we are delighted with our progress, and we look forward to continued crisp execution around our game plan. Thank you very much for your attention this morning.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. That does conclude today's conference. You can disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to The Williams Companies First Quarter 2006 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Travis Campbell, Investor Relations officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Travis Campbell, Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you, and good morning everybody from Tulsa, Oklahoma. Welcome to The Williams First Quarter 2006 Earnings Call, and thank you so much for your interest in our company. Today, you will hear from Steve Malcolm, our CEO; Don Chappel, our CFO; and Ralph Hill, President of our E&P business. A couple of things about the format today is a little different from previous quarters. It’s more streamlined, all of our business unit heads are not presenting, but be aware that each of them is either here in the room with us or on the phone available for any questions that you might have. Additionally, all the slides and the robust detail that you come to expect from us is available in the appendix to this presentation. So, any information you found valuable in the past is still available for your use. Before I turn it over to Steve, please note that all the slides, both those used in the presentation and the appendix, are available on our website http://www.williams.com/, in a PDF format. Slide No.2 titled "Forward-looking statements," details various risk factors related to our future outcomes. Please read that slide. Slide No.3, "Oil and gas reserves disclaimer" is also very important, and we urge you to read that slide as well. Also included in the presentation today are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to GAAP: Generally Accepted Accounting Principle. Those schedules follow the presentation and are integral to our presentation. So with that, I will turn it over to Steve Malcolm.
Steven Malcolm, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Travis and welcome to our first-quarter conference call. And as always, thank you for your interests in our company. We are delighted with our first-quarter progress, and our investment thesis continues to revolve around four key points. First, we own and operate some of the very best natural gas-related assets in North America. Secondly, we are opportunity-rich in terms of our organic investment options. Thirdly, we are investing in a disciplined and prudent manner, as we have embraced the EVA methodology. And lastly, we believe we are in the midst of a sustained, attractive energy commodity price environment that will allow our businesses to prosper. Looking at slide No.5, which lists the headlines of our first-quarter performance. First of all, our key earnings measure, that being recurring income from continuing operations after mark-to-market adjustments jumped 19% on first-quarter performance from $132 million to $157 million. Key drivers of that improvement: increased natural gas production, higher net realized prices for production sold, and near-record margins realized on our sales of equity NGLs. Secondly, in the E&P space, core development and step-outs have allowed us to increase our proved, probable and possible reserves by 22%. Our 3P reserves now totaled 10.7 trillion cubic feet. Recall that our previous estimate was 8.8 trillion cubic feet. Thirdly, drilling activity has allowed us to increase natural gas production 16%. First quarter '06, our average daily production was approximately 714 million a day compared to first quarter '05, which was 614 million cubic feet a day. Next, the drilling ramp-up is designed to deliver more reserves and create strong production growth. We now have 21 rigs operating in the Colorado Piceance Basin, six more H&P rigs are scheduled for deployment yet this year. And another highlight, in March, we celebrated 400 million a day of production in the Piceance Basin. Our integrated model has allowed us to balance the volatile commodity markets. It should be no surprise, given lower natural gas prices, that we are lowering our expectation for E&P earnings for 2006. But importantly, we are maintaining our consolidated earnings guidance for '06 because of stronger than expected margins and volume demand in our Midstream business. Sixth, the company is working to complete the $360 million transaction with our MLP, WPZ. And we expect the Four Corners deal to be completed and closed in the second quarter. Finally, a series of financings have contributed to a stronger balance sheet. Some of the steps that have been taken include early retirement of secured debt, early conversion of debentures, we have replaced our secured revolver with a larger, unsecured revolver, and we have issued $200 million in senior unsecured notes at Transco. There are other steps planned, as Don will describe later in our call. Another point to make under that last bullet, some late-breaking news, S&P has upgraded Williams to BB minus with a positive outlook based on our continued deleveraging and improved operating performance. So, we are delighted with that. Slide six shows the key operations accomplishments for our four business units. And again, going through here quickly, in the E&P space, we have increased our first quarter '06 versus first quarter '05 natural gas production by nearly 100 million cubic feet a day. We are ramping up our Piceance Basin development. We have deployed four new H&P rigs, and we are capturing the cost and efficiency and environmental benefits associated with those rigs. We have kicked-off our 2006 drilling in the Piceance Highlands, obviously we couldn't kick that off until the winter weather broke. But we plan to drill over 50 wells this year in the Highlands. And, I think, another important point is that we were successful in achieving additional 10 acre spacing on 11,000 acres in the Piceance. In the Midstream space, we firmed up plans for new NGL takeaway capacity from Wyoming. The Overland Pass Pipeline project will create important transportation capacity from our two processing facilities in Wyoming, I am speaking there of Opal and Echo Springs. We have entered into sales hedge for some of our NGL production. I encourage you to look at slide 56 for details of that hedging. We are making good progress on rate case preparation to put new rates into effect on Northwest Pipeline in January of 2007 and Transco in March of 2007. We will be making those filings this summer. With the new 23-year agreements, all of Gulf stream's capacity is contracted under firm, long-term contracts, we are delighted to have that behind us. We have received very strong demand from customers for expansions on our other interstate gas pipelines, on Transco, good examples there: the Leidy to Long Island expansion, Potomac and Sentinel expansions; and on Northwest, the Parachute and Greasewood projects. Lastly, we have executed additional risk-reducing deals in the Power space. I encourage you to take a look at slide 67, which shows how the Power transactions that we have entered into since January of 2005 have increased cash flow dramatically; in fact, by $580 million through 2010. So with that introduction, I will turn it over to Don Chappel.
Donald Chappel, Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President: Thanks, Steve. Good morning and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call. I will run through a summary of our first-quarter results and then turn it over to Ralph for a deeper dive into E&P. I will come back after Ralph's presentation to review our guidance and some other matters. Now let's turn to slide No.8: financial results. Net income of $132 million at $0.22 a share compared to 201 million or $0.34 a year ago. However, the effects of mark-to-market accounting on our Power business distorted the true economic profit, which was strong and improved as I will note in just a moment. And we will describe in more detail the mark-to-market accounting effects as we walk through the presentation. On the last line, and most importantly is recurring income from continuing operations after a mark-to-market adjustment. And again, we compare the $0.26 that we calculate to $0.22 on the same basis a year ago. And those earnings are up 19%, and really are more representative of the strong improvement in our businesses. I would also note that there is a variety of non-GAAP measures included in this presentation, including this key measure that I just mentioned. And those are fully described in this presentation and in the appendix. The next slide please, No.9. We calculate recurring income by adjusting out certain non-recurring items and I will just hit the highlights there. The key item in the first quarter of 2006 was early debt retirement expense and those are the premiums and fees related to the conversion of the convertible securities to equity during the first quarter. And that totaled $27 million. That was largely offset by a variety of other issues or other matters, for a net non-recurring item of $8 million pre-tax, or $3 million after-tax as compared to a $7 million deduction in 2005 pre-tax. Turning to the next page, and certainly more importantly this quarter, and this is slide No.10, recurring income from continuing ops after mark-to-market adjustments. I will walk you through our calculation of the mark-to-market adjustments, the adjustments where we eliminate the mark-to-market effects from Power's results and consolidated results. Starting in the middle of the page there, mark-to-market adjustments for Power, we first reverse the forward unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses, in this case $43 million of mark-to-market gains which were recorded during the current quarter, as compared to $221 million of such gains a year ago, a $178 million reduction in mark-to-market gains. Again, we eliminate those unrealized gains. And then we add back the realized gains from mark-to-market that was previously recognized. So again the mark-to-market effects that were previously recorded on the books reverse out as those positions are realized. So, we are adding back $77 million in the current quarter and $113 million a year ago. That change is $36 million, and the total mark-to-market adjustments before taxes totaled 34 million this year. Add back to income versus $108 million deduction from reported income last year, or $142 million pre-tax change, or an $87 million after-tax change. Again, I think you will agree with us, or continue to agree with us that this is the key earnings measure after mark-to-market adjustment is depicted at the bottom of this page. The next slide, please, No.11, first-quarter segment profit. This is in a consolidated format, both on a reported and a recurring basis. First, let's look down the page to segment profit after mark-to-market adjustment on a recurring basis. You can see over on the right, $438 million this year versus $392 million last year, an increase of $46 million. Now, let's go back up the page and take a look at the elements of that. E&P on a reported basis had a nice increase in profit and a very strong increase in profit as well on a recurring basis of $52 million or 54%. What is driving that is the 16% volume growth as we continue to expand our drilling program, and $33 million of higher net realized prices. I would also note that the current quarter had an $85 million negative impact from the hedge as compared to a $36 million negative impact in the first quarter of 2005. And the negative impact is the difference between the hedge prices and current market. The hedges are detailed later in this presentation. I believe that is on slide No.46. It is slide No.46. Turning next to Midstream, Midstream had a very strong quarter with a number of very noteworthy positives. We had higher deepwater production handling revenues, and I think that is a particular bright spot. We have made some significant investments in the deepwater, and they are paying off to an even greater extent. And we had higher revenue from increased GNP fees and slightly higher NGL margins; again, the NGL margins in the first quarter were quite high as compared to the five-year average margins. But we also enjoyed quite high margins a year ago. Offsetting that somewhat were lower olefin margins and higher gathering and processing operating expenses. Next let's look at gas pipelines. Reported results and recurring results were down somewhat as a result of higher O&M and G&A expenses totaling about $15 million, and the absence of a couple of items that we had in 2005, most notably a $5 million Gulfstream completion fee and a $3 million operating tax adjustment. Now let's take a look at Power. And again, Power's results are marred by mark-to-market accounting and some non-recurring items. Down at the bottom of the page, we strip out the non-recurring items and mark-to-market effects, and you can see Power in the current quarter earned $11 million on that basis, as compared to $17 million a year ago. We had improved portfolio Power results. Again, the base portfolio results improved somewhat, offset by the absence of natural gas storage and legacy results that benefited 2005. And during 2006, we had a decrease in expenses, largely the result of a $24 million gain related to the sale of a receivable. Let's next turn to slide No.12, and this is 2006 cash information. It really highlights the first-quarter cash flows. I will just walk through the key elements there. We started the year with about 1.6 billion in cash. We had cash flow from continuing operations of $165 million, and that is somewhat below our normal rate of cash flows. And if you can see the footnote on that page, cash flow from operations was reduced by the return of 192 million of margin deposits to counter parties. And we had a large margin return in exchange for a letter of credit. So, cash was returned to a counterparty in exchange for a letter of credit. And that is something that we do not include in our liquidity calculation, so that really had no effect on our calculation of liquidity, and is somewhat unusual. But I'll just note that for you, and we'll touch on that in a couple of further slides. Debt retirements totaled 64 million. Those were scheduled capital spending or investments in the business, 468 million. We paid 45 million of dividends. The other net represents the purchase of other current securities, cash-like securities, ending cash of 1.115 billion, and restricted cash was 118 million. While our cash balance is somewhat higher than what I would consider to be normal for our business, let me remind you that our planned capital spending exceeds our operating cash flows in 2006, and some of this excess cash balance will go to fund that very substantial growth. And I will talk more about that in some upcoming slides. The next slide, please, No.13, liquidity at March 31st. Again, we had cash and cash equivalents of 1.115 billion, other current securities of 184 million. In calculating available liquidity, we back out subsidiary and international cash that is not readily available to us totaling $284 million, and customer margin deposits totaling $129 million. And this is related to the note on the prior page, and I would note that that number at 12/31/05 was $321 million, or $192 million higher. And that is the change that reduced the cash flow from operations during the current quarter, as we returned that cash to a counterparty and received letters of credit in large part. Available unrestricted cash of 886 million is down from 1.159 billion as of yearend. Available revolver capacity at 1.349 billion that’s up from $961 million at yearend and total liquidity is at 2.2 billion, up from about 2.1 billion at yearend. Since the end of the quarter, we’ve reduced liquidity by almost $500 million as we paid off secured debt, that’s the RMT loan, and offset that by increasing liquidity by 225 million as we executed a new revolving credit facility on an unsecured basis that totaled $1.5 billion. That concludes the initial part of my presentation and I will turn it to Ralph.
Ralph Hill, Senior Vice President, Exploration and Production: Thanks, Don. E&P, another strong quarter, with production up 16% and segment profit on a recurring basis was up 54%. Turning to slide 15, our total 3P reserves, Steve mentioned, grew by 22%. During the last call I discussed our year-end proved reserves with you, and they were up 13% to 3.6 trillion cubic feet, with a 277% reserve replacement rate. Looking at our 3P reserves, they are now 10.7 Tcf, which is an increase of 22% from last reported. This increase in estimated reserves is based on our latest analysis in drilling programs and drilling results, and it is primarily a result of our activity and successes in our relatively undeveloped areas of the Piceance Highlands. Looking at our resource potential, which we have talked before with you about being 12 to 15 Tcf, and that is on a resource potential basis, we believe that our resource potential is now at the upper-end of that 12 to 15 Tcf range. And that does not include new opportunities that we identify on appendix slide No.47 that I discussed with you during the last call. So, strong growth in our 3P reserves for E&P and for Williams this year. Looking at slide 16, Powder River, our total Powder River volumes are up 17 million a day, and this is in the overall total Powder River volumes were 16% from first quarter 2005. And the Big George continues to drive the volume growth, more than offsetting the Wyodak decline, which started about four quarters ago. Big George volumes were up 89 million a day, or 105%, from the first quarter of 2005. And if you look at sequential quarters, they were up 28 million a day, or 19% from the fourth quarter 2005. Slide 17, Piceance production growth, up 81 million, or 29% over a year ago. We mentioned that we had 21 rigs currently operating compared to 13 a year ago. Six additional H&P rigs will be received, with four H&P rigs are currently in that 21 number. We are on target to achieve the rig count of 25, and could actually be higher than that with six more H&P rigs coming. Please recall earlier in the year, we picked up additional rigs to compensate for the delay in delivery of the H&P rigs. Looking at the H&P early performance, the first six wells performance versus the field area benchmark on a drilling basis, we have had improvements in our drilling from 14% to 41%. The average of those six wells is a 27% increase in terms of improvement efficiencies. It is way too early to apply that type of percentage improvement to our program, but we are definitely encouraged by the performance of these flex rigs, which is what we expected and hoped to see happen. We also have completed the first simultaneous operations frac job on a pad, we believe, in North America with this kind of close well spacing. What that means is we are drilling on a well at the same time, we are completing a previously drilled well. We did it very safely. We did it in normal cycle time of fracturing, and we believe it is the first time that our team and the Halliburton team was able to accomplish on U.S. land operations. So, many thanks to our team for a lot of hard work to make signups work and it looks like it will work for us. Slide 18, a recap of our low-cost industry leader position on a three-year F&D case cost basis we're at $0.92. On this graph, you will see the top 15 E&P companies ranked by U.S. natural gas reserves so, our average of $0.92 on a three-year F&D cost stacked up against the top 15. If you look on an overall basis of the companies that are followed by Evaluate Energy, which is a source for this data, their F&D cost on a three-year basis is more like $2 on the average of all the companies that participate in that. So, our $0.92 per Mcf tracks very favorably with the industry. We are also top quartile in 2005 production cost per Mcf. And as I mentioned, we were top quartile in reserve replacement rate with 277%. Slide 19, realized gas price assumption is lower, slightly lower as this slide shows than what we had in a previous call. Obviously, that is with the softness that we have seen in the 2006 basin pricing that we are experiencing. However, I would point out that the numbers used for this slide, which basically have a NYMEX of $7 in 2007 and $7 in 2008, which is consistent with what we showed last time, and basin market prices of $6.32 and $6.34 for 2007, 2008 are below what we are seeing in the market today in 2007 and 2008 by approximately $1.80 to $2. So, there still could be some conservatism in this number. But however, for this year, as you see, our cash margin is down slightly on a three-year average, and that is driven primarily by the 2006 softer gas prices. Slide 20, we have numerous questions about our takeaway capacity. This is a slide I have pulled out in the past, and I've brought it back out. We are Rockies producer, but we are not necessarily a Rockies price taker. We have many directions and methods that we move our gas, and what this slide highlights is really our ability to move gas on a firm basis. There are other ways we can do that. Our mission in this -- we also have  interruptible gas that we can flow on. But on a firm basis, this slide depicts what we can do. As I have discussed before, our mission is to have flexibility and optionality in moving our gas. We can stay in local markets as well as move our gas North, South, West and East. Our current firm access totals almost 700 million a day. We can go north to Wamsutter, east to the Mid-continent, and south to the San Juan, in addition to staying in the local areas. By 2008 and 2009, our firm access increases to over 1 Bcf a day, and we add the ability to go west to Opal via Northwest Pipe's expansion, and east to the Appalachians via the Rockies Express. So, our key goal is to move our gas and have optionality and flexibility, and we believe we are situated for not only our current volumes, but our future projected volumes. With that, I will turn it back over to Don.
Donald Chappel, Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President: Thanks, Ralph. We will now look ahead and across the enterprise. Slide No.22, please. Our consolidated guidance stands unchanged, so moving parts within the guidance I would like to discuss. The first one that should be expected by all of you, as you follow the natural gas and energy business closely, is given that natural gas prices weakened following the very, very warm winter, we are adjusting our E&P segment profit guidance downward for 2006, adjusting the bottom-end of the range down by 125 million and the top-end down by 100 million. You can refer to slide No.46 in the appendix for the details and the current price assumptions we are using in our E&P guidance for unhedged volumes. In short, we have lowered our assumptions for those unhedged volumes by about $1 per Mcf in 2006. That brings our revised 2006 price assumptions down in line with our assumed prices for 2007 and 2008. And as a result, I think you will agree there is greater transparency as we compare 2006, '07 and '08 results particularly in the E&P segment. The other moving parts in our earnings guidance is within Midstream. We are moving Midstream's guidance upward by $100 million in 2006. This move is also commodity price driven. In this case, the environment of very strong crude oil prices and weakening natural gas prices is creating stronger than expected margins for natural gas liquids. You can also refer to slide 54 in the appendix for a look at the margin environment over the last 17 quarters. Again, consolidated earnings guidance remains the same at $0.78 to $1.03 per share for recurring earnings adjusted for the effects of mark-to-market accounting. While we are not providing EPS guidance for '07 and '08, we do expect strong increases as a result of the factors that we are discussing during this call. Next slide, please, No.23. 2006 to 2008 segment profit. This summarizes business unit and consolidated guidance. First, again, let's look at the bottomline. Total recurring segment profit after mark-to-market adjustment, 2006, the midpoint of the range is about 1.7 billion, 2007 is about $2 billion, and 2008 at $2.3 billion, a $600 million increase over the two years, or about 35%. Now let's take a look at E&P. As I mentioned earlier, we lowered our price forecast for natural gas prices in 2006, and we held our price forecast for 2007 and 2008. We are using about $6.10 price in the Rockies and San Juan Basin in 6, 7 and 8 as detailed in the appendix as well, let's move down to Midstream. Midstream again increased their forecast for 2006 by about $100 million on the strength of natural gas liquid margins. And I would also note that we used five-year average margins on the unhedged NGL volumes for 2006, '07, and '08. So again, we have experienced quite a bit higher than our five-year average margins over the last, I believe, seven quarters, yet our forecast continues to use five-year average margins. So we think that that's a conservative assumption at this point. I would also note that we have sold forward some NGLs for the first time, and that is detailed in slide 56. And that enables us to lock in those very high prices. The next line, gas pipelines. Again, we are in the year prior to a rate case. We are doing a lot of work in preparation for that rate case, and our 2007 and '08 results reflect the improvement in profitability following those rate cases, as well as the completion of the Northwest Pipeline expansion project, and a variety of other factors. Power results are marred by mark-to-market accounting. In the footnote, you will see Power's results after eliminating mark-to-market accounting effects, and that totals 50 to 150 million in 2006, 50 to 200 million in 2007, and 50 to 200 million in 2008. The mark-to-market adjustments you can see detail there, and those were the only changes in the Power guidance, and really just the effects of current period mark-to-market accounting. So again, no change in consolidated guidance. And over the three years I think you will see very strong improvement, about $600 million, or 35% over 2006. Next slide, please, No.24. 2006 to 2008 CapEx. Guidance, again, is unchanged. However, we are opportunity rich, and we expect to invest even greater amounts of capital, particularly in 2007 and '08 and beyond, as we continue to accelerate our development of our growing E&P reserves and seize the many value-adding opportunities we have in our franchise positions, both in Midstream, in the Western U.S. as well as in the Gulf of Mexico and in our gas pipeline businesses. Details on these growth opportunities are included in the appendix in the business unit reports regarding capital. We will continue to invest in a disciplined way in order to drive further growth in EVA and returns on capital, as well as value for our investors. I would note here, looking at E&P in particular, we are spending about $1 billion a year to develop our E&P reserves. And as Ralph noted, our rig count in the Piceance Basin is up sharply from a year ago. And I think you would agree that our plan is a year from now that the rig count would be up even more substantially as we add the balance of these 10 H&P rigs, with six yet to come. And again, in 2007 we would expect that all 27 rigs would be operating in the Piceance and drive even higher production levels. Midstream has a number of growth projects that are not currently included in capital -- some that are, some that are not. And again, I would refer you to the appendix for the details there. But we do have some exciting growth projects, both in the West and in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico that we expect to add to capital, and that will create a great deal of value for investors. On the gas pipeline business, again, 2006 includes about $300 million for the Northwest Pipeline replacement project, as well as substantial spending on Clean Air Act Pipeline Safety Act matters. Next slide, please, No.25. We have already reviewed segment profit guidance and CapEx. I would like to focus our attention on cash flow. As I mentioned earlier, we returned about 192 million to counterparties in margins, and our cash flow from operations during the current period has been reduced somewhat to reflect that. However, from a liquidity standpoint, it really had no effect on our calculated liquidity. Cash flow from operations is expected to grow from 1.5 billion to 1.8 billion this year to 2.2 to 2.6 by 2008, an increase of $700 or $800 million. Operating free cash flow is substantially negative this year, about $400 million, and forecast here to turn positive in 2007, and very strongly positive in 2008, based on the growth of the business and those strong cash flows and returns. The cash and liquidity to work our way through 2006, we believe is ample. And I will talk about some additional financing transactions that we will complete to fill out that picture. As well, the potential sale of assets to Williams Partners provide an abundant source of tax-advantaged capital, low-cost capital, to fund even greater growth in the future. Next slide, please, No.26. This slide graphically depicts our outlook and our plans; very strong operating cash flow growth, increasing investment opportunities, as well as credit improvement. Next slide, please, No.27. To summarize some of our financing activities to date, we increased equity and reduced debt through the early conversion of $220 million of subordinated convertible debentures. We removed secure debt, we retired the RMT term loan totaling $486 million, and we replaced the 1.275 billion credit facility with a 1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, increasing liquidity by $225 million, and as well as improving our credit. We issued $200 million in senior unsecured notes at Transco and we retired 64 million debt at maturity. What’s ahead? We plan to issue some unsecured debt at the Williams level, in part to replace liquidity that we used in retiring the secured RMT loan. We will also raise capital during the sale of a portion of the Four Corners asset, 25.1% of the Four Corners asset to Williams Partners. And then finally, we will raise capital through a Northwest Pipeline bond issue, again, to finance its growth. These planned financial transactions, along with our strong cash and liquidity position will enable us to continue to grow and grow value rapidly, and continue to seize value-adding opportunities while maintaining and improving our credit metrics. Next slide please, No.29. I'll wrap up here. Again, some key points. We are very focused on driving and enabling sustainable growth in EVA and value for shareholders. We will continue to maintain a cash and liquidity cushion of $1 billion plus. Again, we are well above that today as a result of our need for capital to fund our growth, as well as to manage our commodity hedging positions. We will continue to steadily improve our credit ratios and ratings, ultimately achieving investment-grade ratios. And certainly, we believe that will also create value for investors. We will continue to reduce risk in the Power segment. And I think our Power team has made great progress in that regard. Since we took the business off the market in late 2004, the Power team has been able to hedge substantial forward cash flows. And you will see, I think, a pretty clear graphical depiction of that on slide No.67, which puts us in a position where we have very highly hedged cash flows for the next several years. And we are looking forward to hedging even to a greater extent further forward as the markets continue to tighten and as we just move forward through the calendar. Finally, I mentioned we are opportunity rich. We are increasing our focus, making additional EVA-based investments in our core natural gas businesses. We have substantial opportunities, particularly in our E&P business through the reinvestment in drilling up our reserves at a faster pace, as well as our franchise positions in Midstream and gas pipelines. If new capital is needed, we will choose the optimal source of capital. And as I mentioned earlier, we have abundant source of MLP tax advantage low-cost capital available to us. And the combination of growth and operating cash flow and EVA will continue to drive value creation. I am extremely bullish on our ability to continue to create strong increases in EVA and value for our investors. And while I expect continuous improvement of results, I see 2007 as a real breakout year. As you note that during 2007, we would be drilling in the Piceance with 27 or more rigs, as well as benefit from two successful rate cases, Transco and Northwest Pipeline. Again, I think the picture is quite bright. With that, Steve, I will turn it to you.
Steven Malcolm, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Don. And looking at the last slide, which is simply a listing of the headlines, I think we are very pleased with the steady across the board progress that we achieved during the quarter. Certainly achieved recurring earnings growth, we had crisp execution around steps to strengthen our balance sheet, and I think there was clear evidence that we continue to capitalize on the many organic growth opportunities that are available to us. So with that, our team is prepared to take your questions.
Operator:
Operator Instructions:
Q - Scott Soler: Hi good morning. I had a few questions. The first one -- and maybe Steve and maybe Ralph, just kind of think about this as -- it's going to be a long-winded question, but my point is return of capital versus return on capital. With the credit rating being improved because the balance sheet has improved so much, and the company having improving cash flow going forward, if I take your estimate, Ralph, potentially up to 15 Tcf or so of 3P potential for the company, at current rates of production that's a 50-year-plus inventory, which is great. The question I have is, there was a lot of rumors in the industry over the last couple of weeks of all the different companies looking at bidding on these Barnett Shale Properties, Chief. And how do you guys think about the fact that your stock at the current share price really implies that your 3P potential is worth I mean in other words, you could buy back stock at some point down the road for way less than $0.50 in Mcf; Devon purchased Chief for over $1 on 3P. And I am just trying to -- just a little bit philosophically how you think about return of capital versus return on capital. And how does the EVA formula, I guess, that factor in to share buyback opportunity versus continuing to grow? Because you got both opportunities on your plate right now, and I just want to get an update on that.
A - Donald Chappel: Scott, this is Don. Certainly, I think you make a good point. And it's a point that we certainly are mindful of. However, I think, credit issues are major issues for us. And for us to continue to have access to the debt capital market, I think we need to continue to maintain and improve somewhat our credit metrics and our ratings. So, I think our view to date has been that a major share repurchase would be a huge setback from a credit standpoint, and would dry up our ability to access the capital market, both at the Williams level and at the Williams Partner level, as a result of ratings momentum that would become negative. And our models indicate that that would destroy value rather than create it. But we are certainly mindful of that opportunity, and we'll continue to analyze it. And if the situation changes enough that we have that flexibility, we'll certainly consider it seriously.
A - Steven Malcolm: Scott, this is Steve. Perhaps embedded in your question was an inquiry on our interest in pursuing other E&P opportunities. And as we have said before, we always want to look at these opportunities. We want to evaluate them. We think that we -- in many cases we learn from the exercise. And we will continue to do that. We will continue to evaluate these kinds of opportunities. But the other very important point that we have made is that before we would act on something, it would have to be a very compelling deal. And it is very difficult to make sense of deals given the multiples that are being paid today.
Q - Scott Soler: I appreciate you all showed a lot of restraint. And that was my only point, was that very few companies have 50 years of reserve potential long-term. And so, I think you all can be very choosy relative to a lot of companies in North American E&P, who are just trying to replace reserves -- just keep things flat, so.
A - Steven Malcolm: Our goal is to drill those reserves up faster and faster.
Q - Scott Soler: Okay. Second question if I could. Ralph, we are hearing that on some of these FlexRig and Helmerich, that at least on certain wells, their drill times in spud to spud is just a bit over 10 days. And I think most of those wells tend to flow gas from the time of completing to turning on the valve in maybe 45 days. And so, it seems as though -- I think what you were saying was, look, we are going to keep production guidance as is and be relatively conservative. But is that -- are you seeing those types of -- when you were talking about 41% efficiency, I think that gets to the sort of numbers I am talking about on number of days to drill wells, at least in certain projects.
A - Ralph Hill: It does. It gets you in that range. The key is, obviously, we have got -- the numbers I just quoted to you were six wells. And we've drilled another handful since then, but that's as of first quarter '06. So, we are still getting those rigs delivered throughout the balance of this year or through like August, September. So, it takes time for one to make sure those kind of efficiencies are going to continue on, and two, to get the full momentum of that kind of program. But obviously, we are encouraged. And it could, I don't see it doing a lot this year necessarily. Remember again, we were behind on rigs, and we caught up, basically by acquiring some loaner rigs and other things in the wintertime. So, we actually were behind running into this year. We caught up during the first quarter, and now we feel like we are catching up in the sense of rigs. Our volumes have been where we want to be, on target. But it took a while to catch up. And now the good news is, we like what we see. They are more efficient. There is a few things here and there we want to -- we're going to tweak, and our partner is great about tweaking that. So there is a lot of potential in the future, it's too early to say if that means anything for 2006.
Q - Scott Soler: Okay. And then my final question, I am not sure if Bill Hobbs is in the room. But on California, we had also been tracking down, I guess there is both the Legislature and PUC are talking more and more, still trying to get companies to extend, I mean now kind of looking for companies to come to them to extend contracts. And Don had alluded to the fact that you all are getting, I guess, at least encouraged that you might be able to do things for a little bit longer term. Could we get just maybe a little bit of context and an update on what the situation is in California?
A - Bill Hobbs: Scott, we are certainly talking to the utilities about the existing contracts that we have, and looking to extend those beyond 2010. And I think there is movement in the Legislature and at the PUC, increased interest around creating reliability through these longer-term contracts. So, it's early, but we are certainly engaged in looking to do that.
Q - Scott Soler: All right thanks.
Operator: We'll go now to Craig Shere at Calyon Securities.
Q - Craig Shere: Hi, congratulations on the quarter. Ralph, can you comment on prospects for, and maybe the timing of when you might be looking at more drilling rigs, and how the labor market looks in terms of adding rigs as we go into 2007. And Don, do the NGL hedges on a consolidated basis should we assume that increases natural gas price sensitivity for Williams going forward?
A - Ralph Hill: This is Ralph, I will go first, there is a tight market. We have several things just to be thinking of. We are in the process of contracting for some additional rigs, the new rigs that neighbors is drilling, or is building, called the Sundowner rigs, but those are more like 2007 type rigs when they will get to us. The second thing, we may not need necessarily additional rigs. As we have mentioned before, one of the reasons why is if we do -- are able to achieve the efficiencies we see early in, for example, the H&P program, and if the Sundowner rigs, which is what the neighbors brings to the table at the end of this year if they are more efficient, we actually will be able to do more with the existing rig fleet that we have. Having said that, we continue to be very opportunistic, to pick up additional rigs, and that's just the best we can do. But we have been pretty aggressive in going out and getting the H&P rigs. We are going to have some new neighbors rigs coming in. And the question here is, as we move through this portfolio, do we stay with the existing rig fleet and just add to it or do we weed out some of the inefficient ones. And those are just things we have to work at as we work through our operations this year.
Q - Craig Shere: Can you give some color on the quantity of Sundowner rigs you are looking at?
A - Ralph Hill: Four.
Q - Craig Shere: Okay.
A - Donald Chappel: Andrew will take the NGL question.
A - Andrew Sunderman: Yeah, this is Andrew. On a consolidated basis, because of the fact that when we look at our portfolio, the NGL barrels that we have hedged at very attractive prices, the offsetting gas position is already considered on a consolidated basis. So, I do not believe that our exposure to natural gas price changes as a result of these hedges, but it does improve the company's overall spread position on the NGL spreads.
Operator: Have any questions sir?
Q - Craig Shere: No, that’s it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go to Carl Kirst at Credit Suisse.
Q - Carl Kirst: Good morning everybody, nice quarter as well. A couple of follow-up E&P questions. Ralph, on the increase on the 3P number, can you actually break that down for us as far as what is probable, what is possible? I was also wondering if there was any migration over the last year from one category to the other, if we could start there.
A - Ralph Hill: No real migration from one to the other. Our proved, as you know, are about 3.6, our probable are in the range of -- that similar range, 3.6, 3.7, and possible is about 3.4. So that, hopefully, adds up to about the 10.7.
Q - Carl Kirst: Roughly equal. Right. And with respect to the Piceance, as far as -- I don't know if you have the absolute numbers, or just a percentage of the probables and possibles. Just wondering how much of that is strictly Piceance versus the other areas?
A - Ralph Hill: We split into the Highlands and the Valley. And I would say between the Highlands and the Valley, that is roughly 60% of the 3P number.
Q - Carl Kirst: Great, just -- I guess this is maybe more of a question for Don, but just as we look at gas prices right now, your assumption of $7 NYMEX going forward, obviously, we are seeing prices much stronger than right now. Last I checked, and I don't know if there has been any additional update with this slide package but you were 40% hedged for '07. Is there any – we are leaning right now towards increasing that amount?
A - Steve Malcolm: This is Steve Malcolm. We have said that normal year, we are going to be between 40 and 60% hedged, based on the businesses that we are in and the risks that we perceive, but that we will always evaluate what opportunities the market is offering us. And so, we evaluate the situation at least weekly, and we'll continue to do so. But I wouldn't want to indicate any leanings at this point.
Q - Carl Kirst: Okay, fair enough. And then just one final question if I could, really relating more perhaps to the WPZ. Just a little bit of color, if you would on Overland Pass, the -- I guess the relationship with ONEOK. From a very 30,000-foot standpoint, I guess we saw that as a very, obviously, attractive project, and one that ultimately would be destined for WPZ. Can you give us some color as to why you decided to partner up on that rather than go it alone?
A - Alan Armstrong: Sure, Carl this is Alan. Really great benefits that we saw from partnering with ONEOK. First of all, this gives us an option on our liquids between the Conway and Belvieu markets in our deal with ONEOK, which is very attractive to us. And actually, the real benefit of the project is not just the option for investment in it, after we see what construction costs and the volumes look like on it, but in addition to that benefit, the transportation tariff that we are going to see is in the order of a $20 million a year savings. And that's before we realize the benefit of the option value between those markets. So, the real plus on this deal for us is the lower transportation cost on our NGL barrels, as well as the option between Conway and Belvieu. So, it's really very attractive on that basis, and it provides an investment opportunity for us that looks attractive after most of the risk is out of the project. And that will be icing on the cake for us.
Q - Carl Kirst: Great, thanks and good luck.
Operator: We'll go now to Sam Brothwell at Wachovia.
Q - Samuel Brothwell: Hi, good morning, can you hear me?
A - Steve Malcolm: Yeah.
Q - Samuel Brothwell: The internal hedge, I guess you could call it, between Midstream and E&P worked pretty well, as you raised your guidance in Midstream by a similar amount to what you lowered it in E&P. And obviously, Midstream was helped by very strong crude prices during the quarter. Can you give us a little more color on how that relationship will play out, what kind of sensitivity we should look for in your segment profit going forward for changes in gas and crude?
A - Steve Malcolm: First of all, as to the first quarter, we really didn't see that much boost in the first quarter from the frac spread, and we certainly are enjoying that as we speak. But if you recall kind of how prices moved first quarter, while it was good and we certainly enjoyed it, it wasn't the kind of margins that we are enjoying currently. Go ahead, Andrew.
A - Andrew Sunderman: Yeah, I think if you look historically at the correlation between, say, the processing spread and the E&P production, I think we would expect -- for a $1 of gain or loss on the E&P side, you would typically expect $0.70, $0.75 in the other direction on the Midstream side only. But you also have to recall we have a Power business as well. So, on a consolidated basis, I think we have some sensitivity slides in our appendix. I don't know exactly what page they're on. But slide number 75 in our appendix, we kind of outline on a consolidated basis our exposure to natural gas. So, I think that's a pretty good guide at the end of the first quarter for what you could expect, at least for the time periods referenced.
Q - Samuel Brothwell: Okay, I see that. That's very helpful. And if I may just one quick follow-up. Can you remind us some key dates to watch for in the rate case process in the pipeline segment, particularly in Transco?
A - Donald Chappel: This is Don. We expect to file Northwest Pipe July 1, with rates that go effective January 1. And Transco September 1 the filing; rates go effective March 1. And clearly, there certainly could be some other news along the way, but those are the key dates.
Q – Samuel Brothwell: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: We'll go now to Faisel Khan at Citigroup.
Q - Faisel Khan: Good morning.
A - Steve Malcolm: Good morning.
Q - Faisel Khan: With the recent increase in your deck rate, does that have any impact on your collateral requirements at all?
A - Andrew Sunderman: This is Andrew. What we would expect -- we do have some contracts that have ratings-based improvements that we would expect to see. And I would say that I think that the rating is certainly reflective of the improvements we have made, and we're already seeing improving credit terms before we got the actual ratings increase. So, I do believe it will continue to be positive momentum to getting higher credit limits and return of collateral from our trading counterparties and from our other counterparties.
Q - Faisel Khan: Okay. On the E&P unit, was your partner apart from the asset in the Powder River Basin, and you had an option to exercise to buy into some of those assets. What was the rationale for passing on that opportunity?
A - Ralph Hill: This is Ralph. It did not meet our economic hurdles.
Q - Faisel Khan: Okay, fair enough. And then in terms of some of the news we've been hearing about potential farm-out opportunities for major holders at Piceance Basin acreage -- is that something that you guys might be looking at?
A - Ralph Hill: Well, I think that's one of the other operators more in the Valley that -- we have substantial acreage position there, and we, as you can tell by our Ryan Gulch and Allen Point, Trail Ridge activity that we are doing, there is opportunities for us, and there are additional opportunities listed on the additional opportunities slide that we are looking at in the Piceance; not particularly from any recent announcements, we have basically been looking at some of these and been negotiating on some farm-outs for quite awhile, and hope to bring a few of those across the table.
Q - Faisel Khan: Okay, great. And just, if I could get some clarification on the pipeline. Your rates go into effect January 1st and March 1st of '07 -- is that right -- subject to refund?
A - Ralph Hill: Yes.
Q - Faisel Khan: Thank you for your time.
Operator: Next we'll go to John Levin, Levin Capital.
Q - John Levin: Yes, I had two questions. One is, in the increment that you just reported, maybe the breakdown between possible, proved and probable. And secondly, you did say that you wanted to reduce the risk in the Power segment, and you are hedging perhaps future -- that was the answer to Scott Soler's question. Is there anything you can do to lower your heat rate output out there which would make it more competitive as well? So there are two very detailed technical questions.
A - Ralph Hill: Well, I think -- what I said for the 10.7 T's of 3P reserves, it's 3.7 –
Q - John Levin: No, no, no; you gave the breakdown. But I was interested in the increment in the quarter as the breakdown, at least between proved, possible and -- the breakdown of the increment is what I was looking for.
A - Ralph Hill: The increment just on the probables and the possibles?
Q - John Levin: Yes.
A - Ralph Hill: I have to get that for you. I don't have that on the tip of my tongue. I will have to get that for you.
Q - John Levin: Which category was most of it in?
A - Ralph Hill: In what way?
Q - John Levin: Well, 50/50, would you say, or three-quarters one way or the other?
A - Ralph Hill: Of the movement, or total?
Q - John Levin: Of the increment.
A - Ralph Hill: I don't know that answer off the top of my head.
Q - John Levin: Okay. And then on the heat rate improvement -- what about that anything?
A - Andrew Sunderman: We have re-powering rights in California for our positions there. And the average heat rate is about 10,000, which seems high; but again, you have to focus on where the plants are located. They are there for reliability. But to the extent we can enter into longer-term contracts, we will certainly be looking at re-powering those assets.
Q - John Levin: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Maureen Howe at RBC Capital Markets.
Q - Maureen Howe: Thanks very much. Couple of questions. First in the Power segment, I believe, Don, you mentioned you booked a 24 million -- I guess it would be a lower expense due to the sale of a receivable. Is that correct?
A - Donald Chappel: Yes it is, Maureen.
Q - Maureen Howe: So, I am just wondering, is it normal to sell receivables? And what are the economic factors that would go into that decision to proceed in that sort of strategy?
A - Donald Chappel: This was a very unusual situation that I will let Andrew describe.
A - Andrew Sunderman: Yeah, Maureen, this is Andrew. This was the finality of most of our remaining Enron receivables. As you know, that bankruptcy case has proceeded forward, and we saw an opportunity in the market to sell a major portion of the remaining receivables we had on that for very attractive prices. And that's what we did.
Q - Maureen Howe: Okay. And obviously, that is a pre-tax number.
A - Andrew Sunderman: Yes.
Q - Maureen Howe: And just moving on, this is just really for clarification in some of the slides that are in the appendix. And first, with the Power slide on page 67, there it looks like, indeed, as has been mentioned, there's been good hedging forward of that book. And I'm just wondering, for 2007, if I add up the hedged amounts, it's about 502 million, I think across the various regions. But I guess also that has some estimates of option value and so forth. I'm wondering if there is a floor to that amount.
A - Andrew Sunderman: I think what we have said in the past traditionally, and I think it is based upon some of our schedules that we show in our tutorial is, we feel pretty confident when we call something hedged that it is hedged. We have never really kind of outlined a number on a floor, but the floor is not going to be 50% of that number. If you look at what we presented in our tutorial at the year end last year, and also at year end '04, I think you will see that the numbers from hedged came in pretty close to the number. But we've never really said what the floor is, but there is not a material amount of volatility around that number.
Q - Maureen Howe: Okay. So, the distribution around that is pretty tight?
A - Andrew Sunderman: Yes.
Q - Maureen Howe: Okay, that's great. And then one last question on slide 75, which is your sensitivity slide, and this is really a point of clarification. So, when we are talking about a $0.10 change, for instance, in the price of natural gas, and we look forward to 2007, 2008, this would be the impact across the company's various divisions reflecting what you have locked in or hedged. But for instance, you are not assuming, if I understand your notes correctly, for instance, what the price -- if you have a change in price from natural gas, you are not assuming a correlation, for instance, with the change in the price of Power; it's strictly the price of natural gas in the sensitivity.
A - Andrew Sunderman: On column one, it is a completely correlated change. So, to the extent that gas changes, we have historical correlations to power, crude, and other products. So, column one would be a correlated move; columns two and three would not be.
Q - Maureen Howe: Okay. So, again -- I'm sorry for this -- but in column one, then, if there is a proven change in that, the natural gas price, you would be capturing in that column, perhaps, some impacts on Power prices.
A - Andrew Sunderman: That is correct.
Q - Maureen Howe: Okay that’s great. (voice overlapping)
Q - Maureen Howe: I appreciate that. Thanks to that clarification.
Operator: We'll go now to Jeff Coviello at Duquesne Capital.
Q - Jeff Coviello: Good morning guys. How are you? At a question earlier on the call, you mentioned a technique that you were using in the Piceance; I think it was simultaneous fracking you referred to, I was wondering if that was reflected in your production growth at the E&P segment. Or if you were able to successfully implement that technique, it would be something that could increase your production growth over what you have previously stated.
A - Ralph Hill: This is Ralph, I think it could ultimately improve overall, currently always looking to improve our time on drilling time, and also completion time. Obviously, if we are on the same pad, and we have, say, 12 to 22 wells on a pad, and we can drill four, skid over roughly 10 to 20 feet, begin completion operations while we -- begin drilling operations on a new set of wells right next to it, and being completing the other wells, that would decrease the move time you have. So, what we're doing for the first time is we are basically drilling, fracking, perforating and cementing all at the same time on the same pad, all within 20 or 30 feet of each other, all that activity. So, that would be something in the future also we might be able to -- or we hope will increase the ability for the number of wells we can drill and quicker production online. Haven't built that into our numbers, but it is something we would like to see happen.
Q - Jeff Coviello: Got it. And the first time you attempted it, it went well?
A - Ralph Hill: It has gone very well. And we did it with the first H&P rig over the last month. And we are starting today on the second one, same thing, what we call sim-ops (phonetic). So, we are doing the same thing -- drilling, fracking, perforating, cementing, all on the same pad on different wells at the same time.
Q - Jeff Coviello: Great, thank you. And my next question just relates to the take-away capacity from the Rockies. And it seems like, based on the slides in the presentation, that you have gotten 200 Mcf a day on the Rockies Express. And I wanted to just kind of confirm that and also, there is a pipe there -- the Trailblazer, I believe it is called. I was wondering if you could give us a few details on that, when you might expect it to come online, if there is any possibility of getting capacity on it.
A - Ralph Hill: Trailblazer is online. It is – it's been online for a long time. So, we have capacity today. And on the Rockies Express, we are not a firm shipper, but we have entered into an agreement with one of the firm shippers to sell them a, if you will, a firm amount of gas. So, that is why we call it a firm basis for our opportunities to move it out of the region.
Q - Jeff Coviello: How long does that agreement go for?
A - Ralph Hill: We haven’t divulged that, but it is a long-term deal.
Q - Jeff Coviello: Got it. Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Next we'll go to Drew Swinson (phonetic) at Matador Capital.
Q - Drew Swinson: Yeah, following up a little bit on what Scott Soler had talked about. On page 18 you have -- obviously show great results in terms of your relative F&D costs, and obviously your growth rates, et cetera. But, the credit rating issue that you talked about, in terms of buying back stock versus buying another company -- I guess, how do you view looking at an acquisition in the EVA world -- how do you view that versus an EVA -- the best opportunities -- so if you go out and acquire something, you are going to have positive EVA. But how do you base that or weigh that against the most positive EVA opportunity, which I would think that given your structure and the way that it appears that the E&P business at your company is valued -- can you walk us through maybe more in-depth how you weigh those options off each other?
A - Donald Chappel: Drew, we certainly have extraordinary EVA creation return on capital investing in our -- drilling up our E&P reserves. I would say in the E&P space, it’s difficult to find a large acquisition that is EVA-positive, given the volatility of gas prices. Certainly, that could turn out to be EVA-positive; however, risk factors are pretty substantial given the prices being paid and gas price volatility. So typically, larger acquisitions don't come anywhere close to our other opportunities, and therefore, we’ve not done one.
Q - Drew Swinson: All right well that I guess is helpful and a good answer. I appreciate it, thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Becca Followill at Howard Weil.
Q - Becca Followill: Good morning. Thanks, first, for the abbreviated call, guys. I think I owe you on this one. Two quick questions. One on your 3P reserves, can you talk a little bit about what you have assumed on spacing for the Highlands project? And then second, you had talked about in previous presentations some new E&P opportunities in Uinta, Paradox, and even in the Piceance. Can you update us on if you have any information on that? And if not, when do you think you might? Thank you.
A - Ralph Hill: The assumptions for Allen Point and Trail Ridge are 10-acre assumptions, and the assumptions for Ryan Gulch would be a 20-acre assumption, ultimately getting there. As you know, we do have 10-acre spacing in Trail Ridge. We do not have that yet. We do have it for a small portion of Allen, I think; maybe not. And we do not have that -- any down-spacing at Ryan Gulch. So, those are the assumptions there. As for the others, we, three of the four on the new opportunities are acreage that we own today. And it's just -- we are just beginning to establish when we are going to get in the fields and understand what we can do there. So, really no update on those yet, just long-term leases that we will start to prosecute here in the future. And I just don't know when yet. We have just got to continue to work our technical data.
Q - Becca Followill: Thank you.
Operator:
Operator Instructions:
Q - Richard Gross: Yeah, I'm going to kind of meander a little bit, maybe esoteric relative to the other questions. You mentioned that ethylene margins in the first quarter were poor, and I was a little bit curious, given the value of ethane versus naphtha and other crude derivatives. And then, on that business moving forward, what kind of margins have you assumed in the base case for Midstream?
A - Alan Armstrong: This is Alan. What we actually saw in the quarter was, it was lower than what we saw in the first quarter, and I think that is what we were referencing in terms of comparison, 1Q '05 to first quarter of '06. And that was about $21 million lower on just a pure margin basis quarter-to-quarter. In terms of the way we look at that going forward, we go purely off with the latest CMAI forecast. And so, you can always look to see what we have embedded in our margins by looking at that.
Q - Richard Gross: Given that I can't access the CMAI because it's a pretty pricey item, could you tell me?
A - Alan Armstrong: I don't have the complete forecast there, and I am sure we are prohibited from broadcasting that. But we will try to give you some guidance in terms of what we have embedded in a report.
Q - Richard Gross: Is it a classic five-year average?
A - Alan Armstrong: No, it is not. We will try to get something to you on that, Rick.
Q - Richard Gross: Okay, I'm going to try to put words to your mouth on this next question. If I look at the ONEOK deal, my assumption is that you will back in for your interest. And what this does is it allows the other guys to spend money on the construction cost, and WPZ doesn't have to carry financing until start-up of cash flow. So, you back in at moment of start-up of cash flow. And that the other part of this would be because Bushton was struggling, that I assume that you have gotten some sort of reasonable deal to fractionate at Bushton, and you’ve got some, we'll call it reasonable deals to move product down to Mont Belvieu?
A - Alan Armstrong: I think those points for the most part are clear. We certainly haven't made a decision as to whether that would be a WPZ or Williams investment. So, I certainly want to be clear on that. But obviously, the primary advantages that we get is we get some time to look at the project after some of the risks we worked out of it on top of that, which is very advantageous to us. But yeah, ONEOK makes a very good partner for us with the coke infrastructure. They make a very good partner in terms of moving product in between Conway and Belvieu. And we think that’s good for our investments at Conway as well, in terms of making that even more substantial market center. So, we are excited about the relationship with them, and we think it is a great use of the assets that they bought from Coke and their previous Bushton acquisition. So, pretty excited about that. I think it’s a great solution for the industry overall in terms of low energy cost transportation between the Rockies and Belvieu and Conway.
Q - Richard Gross: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go to Scott Soler at Morgan Stanley.
Q - Scott Soler: Hi, I have one more question. We may get this answer. I know that Standard & Poor's is having a conference call this afternoon at 2:00 Eastern regarding your debt. But what I wanted to ask, I guess, Don, is when they were going through this process most recently with you, were they specifically looking at certain coverage ratios of debt to EBITDA and CFO to debt, which would be -- debt to EBITDA would be something like 2.5 times in our model next year, if you exclude the tolls. Or was there a change in how they are viewing the tolls and how they are viewing the imputed debt, or at least how they are thinking about your risk management? And just could you maybe just sort of high-level chat for a minute on how that sort of generally was thought about, and what changed?
A - Donald Chappel: I think they have some general guidelines, but there's also a lot of judgment in terms of -- they rate us eight on the business risk scale. We think that we are lower than that, but that's their judgment. And then they have guidelines within that methodology, and I think they use their guidelines consistently. However, there is judgment to be applied, and they apply their judgment. We meet with them quarterly. Certainly they’ve given us plenty of feedback along the way, and we are certainly appreciative that they have noticed how much improvement we have made. And in terms of the power tolls, I think they still view the obligation to be an obligation. I think they do have increased confidence that the hedges are in fact good, solid economic hedges, but I think they will talk more about that this afternoon.
Q - Scott Soler: Okay.
Operator: Now we'll go to Craig Shere at Calyon Securities.
Q - Craig Shere: Hi, bit of a follow-up on Sam's question, where you all were alluding to slide 75 with the enterprise gas price sensitivities. Comparing that to slide 96 in the prior fourth quarter presentation, it certainly looks like the enterprise sensitivity to gas prices the next couple of years is lower, and that seems to be driven by the new Power hedges. Is that a fair summary there?
A - Donald Chappel: Craig, I would -- I will let Andrew speak to it, but we also hedge natural gas. So, I think if you look at the natural gas hedge slide, you'll see there's additional natural gas hedges on as well. So, Andrew?
A - Alan Armstrong: Yes, Don, I think that is accurate. I think all of that is taken into consideration. But I think the biggest change in that is the new hedges that we have put on.
Q - Craig Shere: Okay and what are we, are we just assuming the midpoint of your production guidance that you gave previously for like years '07, '08 to arrive at these numbers?
A - Andrew Sunderman: Yeah I would have to take a look at exactly what production Ralph has referenced, but we use the internal expectations, which should be right in line with the guidance, for arriving at these numbers. So, there should not be any disconnect.
Q - Craig Shere: Okay. You have given ranges previously about production estimates in the future, and it would seem that the growing and biggest question mark as far as exposure to gas prices is on the E&P side versus, say, the Power book or Midstream. Is that a fair statement?
A - Andrew Sunderman: Yeah, I think that's fair. And I think probably a good starting point is to use the midpoint of the range.
Q - Craig Shere: Okay. So from there we can kind of back into, if we are assuming a higher level, what the deltas would be. Okay I appreciate the help.
Operator: And we'll go to Jeff Berg at Matador Capital.
Q - Jeff Berg: Yeah good morning guys. Sorry to beat a dead horse, but how you guys allocate capital, in my view, is the most important question you can answer. So, I am going to be as specific as I can here. It was widely rumored that you guys bid about 1.8 billion for Chief. And at that price, that would have been about $0.75, $0.80 per 3P reserves, according to Devon's projection, and about $3 per proved reserve. Right now, the market is valuing your 3Ps at less than half of that. So, the question is very specific. Let's say at 1.8 billion, or whatever the number was, Chief was EVA positive. But yet, it was not nearly as EVA positive as buying your own assets, which as slide 18 shows in great detail, has the lowest F&D costs in the industry. How would you prioritize that? How would you -- would you have done that deal, or any deal, even if it was EVA positive, even if it was not nearly as EVA positive as buying back your stock? Because the corollary to that is a credit rating is a means to an end. I mean if you have -- whether it is an A rating or a B rating and a $20 stock, it really doesn't mean anything to your shareholders. At the end of the day, all things being equal, with a reasonable credit rating, what we are interested in is the share price. And so I think answering this question as specifically as you can is really important. Anyway, thanks.
A - Donald Chappel: Jeff, this is Don. I certainly agree that the credit rating is a means to an end. And certainly, we would expect that our improvement in our credit would be reflected in our share price as well. But all I can say on -- our policy is to not comment on rumors. And I just emphasize that it is a rumor, and we can't comment on it. But we are very thoughtful and very disciplined regarding our allocation of capital, and we are very focused on creating value for our investors. We do understand all the levers that we can pull and the levers that we don't want to pull. So, while I can't comment on the rumor, I can tell you that we are very much focused on creating value for our investors and doing things that, I believe, our investors will support.
Q - Jeff Berg: So, forget Chief for a second, Don, because I appreciate the sensitivity there. Assume its company XYZ, and it had a positive EVA, but buying your shares back had a positive 3X EVA. Is there -- would you guys still do an acquisition, even though buying in your shares had a much more positive EVA? That’s what -- that’s what we need, I think, clarity on. That's what I haven't heard an answer to.
A - Donald Chappel: Jeff, in your simple example, I think it would be an easy decision to get buy back stock. But again, we model all these things, and we are focused on creating value for investors. And if the answer is clear that buying back shares is the right answer, we would be very inclined to buy back shares, if that was going to create more value for investors than some other investment.
Q - Jeff Berg: All right I appreciate it. Congrats on the quarter.
A - Donald Chappel: Thank you.
Operator: And we go to another question this is Andrew Levy at Bear Wagner.
Q - Andrew Levy: Guys it seems to me just listening to the call that investors are really not too excited about you making a major acquisition. Can you comment on that, and how you weigh investor sentiment versus your desire to buy something versus buy back stock?
A - Steven Malcolm: This is Steve. We were always interested in investor sentiment, and I think we have been pretty clear and, that we will continue to be disciplined. We are all about EVA. And I think we’ve said many, many, many times that it is difficult to acquire something in today's market that makes sense, given the multiples that are being paid. However, we will continue to evaluate deals, because there maybe one that we would find compelling. I probably can't be more specific than that.
Q - Andrew Levy: How about monetizing any of your assets to try to outpace some value improve to investors, since the assets are worth more than what the stock is reflecting?
A - Steven Malcolm: We're always evaluating those kinds of opportunities. We will never fall in love with any of our assets. And if it makes sense to do so from a shareholder perspective, we will certainly consider it.
Q - Andrew Levy: Thank you.
Operator: And Mr. Malcolm, we have no other questions, so I would like to turn the call back to you for any closing comments, sir.
Steven Malcolm, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer: Well thank you. A good quarter. We are pleased with our results. Our growth opportunities are very robust, and we will continue to be crisp around the execution of our game plan. As always, thank you for your interests. We got some early feedback from Becca that she liked our new streamlined approach today, but we would like to hear from others. So, please give us your feedback. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude the call. We do appreciate your participation. At this time, you may disconnect.

Travis Campbell, Head of Investor Relations.: Thank you and good morning everybody and welcome to our Q4 earnings call today, thank you for your interest in the company. As always, today we’ll hear from Steve Malcolm, our Chairman, Don Chappel the CFO and the heads of our various business units Ralph Hill, Alan Armstrong, Phil Wright and Bill Hobbs. But before I turn it over to Steve, please note that all the slides that we’ll be talking from today are available on our website, Williams.com in a pdf format. Also, on slide number 2, forward looking statements details risk factors related to future outcomes, please review that slide and slide number 3 talks about oil and gas reserves disclaimer. It’s important we urge you to read that slide as well. Also included in the presentation today are various non-gaap numbers that have been reconciled back to generally accepted accounting principles. Those schedules follow our presentation and we urge you to look at those slides. With that I’ll turn it over to Steve.
Steve Malcolm, Chairman, President and CEO.: Thanks Travis and welcome to our Q4 conference call. And as always thank you for your interest in our company. Looking at our first slide, that will be slide 5, at some of the major headlines for the year, first in 2005 we more than doubled our performance on the key financial measure, that being recurring income from continuing operations after marked market adjustments. That metric increased from about $190 million in 2004 to $513 million in 2005. We also generated $1.45 billion of net cash from operations. Natural gas production was up significantly. In fact, domestic production was up 18%. We’ve taken steps to accelerate reserves development as evidenced by the fact that we’ve contracted for 10 rigs from over a 3 year term in the PMs basin. We had a successful launch of our MLP and as you know we previously announced that we have proposed to sell an approximate 25% interest on our 4 corners business to Williams partners LP. The purpose of this proposed transaction including price will be subject to the approval of the conflicts committee of the board of directors of the general partner of Williams partners LP. This proposal is still being considered and this is the only information regarding this proposed transaction that we will provide today.  Finally, we made significant progress in resolving some of the legacy issues with the settlements on gas information reporting, and ARISA. Looking at slide 6, some of the details on the business unit results, E&P is growing, production reserves and profits, recurring results are up 122% from $251 million to $558 million US. Production up 18%, mostly through the drill bit. We recorded 277% reserves replacement with a 99% success rate. Total crude reserves at 3.6 trillion cubic feet. And as Ralph Hill will describe the continues to show great promise.  Midstream generated strong earnings despite the impact of two major hurricanes. Pullies performed admirably during these hurricanes. We’re bringing new deep water volumes on line. We’re committing to expand our capacity in the rockeis as evidenced by our acquisition of TXP4 and the fact that we’re commenced construction of TXP5. Gas pipeline customer demand continues to support significant growth. Some of the major projects that we have announced, parachute, Lidey, Potomac, Sentinel, Greasewood, Phil will talk about those in a few minutes. We set another delivery record on Transco with a 8.73 decatherm peak day on January 7th, 2005. And our rate case preparation has begun on Northwest Pipe and Transco. We would expect to file on Northwest Pipe on July 1st and on Transco on September 1st. Finally, power is continued to reduce risk, had great success in executing additional mid-term deals and generated positive cash flow for the year. Turning to slide 7, in terms of our guidance, through 2008, as we run through our presentation this morning you will hear that we will be growing recurring segment profit after mark-to-market adjustments from about $1.6 billion in 2005 to $2.3 billion in 2008. that number representing the midpoint of our range. And we are truly opportunity rich within all four of our business units. That we will be investing $5 billion in capital expenditures over the next 3 years so with the majority of that going to grow our E&P production. And we expect to increase segment profit nearly 50% by 2008 and will see continued improvement in our debt to cap ratio. With that, let me now turn the call over to Don Chappel.
Don Chappel: Thanks Steve and good morning. I’ll quickly run through a summary of our Q4 and 2005 results and then turn it over to the business unit leaders for a deeper diver. I’ll come back later in the call to review our consolidated guidance and other matters. Let’s take a look at slide 9, our financial results summary. And I’d note that income from continuing operations and net income; both include non-recurring items as well as mark-to-market effects. So I’ll focus my comment on the last line which is recurring income from continuing operations after mark-to-market adjustments. You can see for the fourth quarter we posted a result of $.26 per share as compared to $.09 in the prior year and for the full year $.86 as compared to $.35. I’m pleased with our Q4 and 2005 results, which are sharply improved from 2004, as well as in line with our previous guidance. Recurring segment profit after mark to market adjustments for the quarter are 448 million, vs. 300 million in the prior year or up 50%. And that’s detailed on slide 77 in the appendix. And for the full year, segment profit after mark to market adjustment is at 1.578 billion, vs. 1.263 billion, or up 25% and that’s detailed on slide 78 in the appendix also. Additionally we’re well positioned to seize the many extraordinary value creating opportunities that lie ahead. And we’re even more confident in our ability to achieve the goals that we have set forth and will set forth during this call today. I’d also note that our 2008 segment profit guidance after mark to market adjustment is up nearly 50% from 2005 levels. Slide number 10 – I’ll now walk you through a calculation of recurring income from continuing operations just highlighting a few of the non-recurring items in the quarter. We have an accrual for regulatory and litigation contingencies, totally $78 million in the quarter or $96 million year to date. That affected principally the power segment. Impairments, losses and write offs related principally to two non-core investments and those were principally Longhorn and Oxsable. We had expense related to prior periods. During the fourth quarter, Transco recorded an expense related to prior periods an adjustment associated with the accounting and valuation corrections of certain inventory accounts. On a year to date basis this adjustment was offset by other items previously discussed. And then finally, a gain on sale of assets relatively small for the quarter, somewhat larger on a year to date basis and we’ve detailed that on prior calls. Total non-recurring items for the quarter totaled $167 million before taxes; the tax effect and an adjustment to our tax accounts reduced the adjustment by $20 million and the total of that is $168 million or $.28 a share. And again on a full year basis, $428 million or $.72 a share. Again, this includes the mark to market effects. Number 11 – I’ll walk through the calculation of recurring income from continuing ops, after mark to market adjustments, really focusing on these mark to market adjustments which we think are important to better understanding our real earnings power. Again, starting with the recurring income that we just calculated on the prior slide, we make some mark to market adjustments on our power segment, reversing forward unrealized mark to market gains totaling $70 million in the quarter, $172 million year to date and adding back realized gains for mark to market that was previously recorded, totaling $48 million for the quarter and $310 million on a full year basis. The net of that is a reduction in reported segment profit of $22 million after tax, $14 million effect on income as compared to an $85 million effect on a full year basis. Also, looking at the full year you can see that $85 million positive adjustment as compared to a $72 million negative adjustment in the prior year or a change after tax of $157 million. So again, I think it’s really necessary to look at our earnings power after these mark to market adjustments, given the very large swings. Slide 12, focusing on Williams’ liquidity at year end 2005 and I’d like just to talk through this slide. Again at the end of the year we had cash and cash equivalents about $1.6 billion dollars. Other cash securities just over $100 million and then we had some special items and I’d like to note we had subsidiary and international cash, totaling $$240 million and customer margin deposits of $321 million, m uch as we deposit margin with other counter parties, other counter parties deposit margin with us and we could be require dto return that if prices were to change or if those customers would replace that cash with Letter of Credit; so it’s really not viewed as being available to us. So backing out that $561 million that is earmarked for customers or for subsidiaries, we have cash balance of $1.159 billion at the end of the year and available revolver capacity of $961 million or about $2.1 billion of liquidity. With that, I’ll turn it over to Ralph.
Ralph Hill: Go to slide 14. I’m very pleased again to report a strong quarter for E&P. Our volumes continued to rapidly increase and our segment profit more than doubled. I want to thank particularly our very talented and dedicated workforce and employees for their relentless pursuit of increasing our production in a very safe and efficient manner while also continuing to add new opportunities for Williams and our shareholders. I hope when I have finished today and have shared results with you, you will agree that we continue to be one of the leaders in the E&P industry in production growth, cost efficiencies, reserve replacement and new opportunities. Slide 15 – segment profit is up as we mentioned. Q4/Q4 175%, volumes increased 14%, net realized price increased 79% so a very strong quarter for us. Keep in mind we do have significant number of hedges that were out of the money that did impact Q4 earnings, but still have very strong earnings growth for the quarter. Slide 16 – looking directly at the strong production growth of 18%, our domestic volumes continued to grow, 18% this year; our Q4 ’05 volumes averages 25% greater than the 2004 yearly average. So we continue to grow our volumes and as you know we predict our volumes continue to grow 15-20% growth this year and through our guidance period. Slide 17 – Accomplishments and a current update. I’ll talk about each of these a little bit more. But just for headlines, domestic volume growth is up 18%; total volume 17%; reserve replacement – I have two slides on reserves, 277%; we added 34% new staff successfully to our E&P group so we’re able to go out and recruit new talent and also retain the talent we have to operate these assets. Our production continues to climb. We now have 2 rigs operating in the Barnett Shale and in the San Juan basin, which is a very mature basin; we’re still able to increase production by 4%. Our international group kicked in with 8% volume increase and also had record operating profit from the volume increase and the increased oil price. We now have 19 rigs operating in the Peonce, which includes a second H&P rig which is onsite and should spread this week and our Peonce island production reached 18 million a day. I’ll have some more information on each of these in a minute.  Slide 18 – Looking at Powder River, the Big George continues to drive this. It was up 74 million a day or 101% over a year ago. On a sequential basis volumes were up 9% or 11 million a day. The Big George growth in the fourth quarter vs. Q3 was up approximately 50 million a day. The wyedack was down about 11 million a day, so you can see the Big George was actually more than offset in the Wyedack decline. Williams and its partner represent about 43% of the Big George volumes in the Powder River. We expect to be able to continue to have this kind of growth. We are very encouraged in the growth in the Big George production; generally the coals are thicker, have higher gas content as we thought they were and they’re living up to their potential and are drilling this year like last year and for the foreseeable future is to target the Big George prolific area. Looking at ’06, 100% of our permits are in hand from the BOM or submitted; basically we have all our permits in hand for the majority of the year with a few permits needed from the BOM towards the end of the year, but we expect those will be given to us at any time. And our water management plans; water management’s part of the application to the BOM. We have those in place and we have 67% already approved and we expect to see the rest of those as the next few months move, as we move through the next few months. Slide 19 – turning to Peonce production growth is up 88 million or 34% in the year; on a sequential basis up 5% or 17 million. Our volumes were down a little bit in the Q4 from what we thought they would be. We had some compressor maintenance issues, some interruptions on pipelines; a brief period of severe weather in early December. Those things all effected production slightly but still squeezed out 17 million a day growth and we expect those kinds of growth numbers to continue in the Peonce.  And as of march 1 we have 19 rigs operating in the Peonce. Those are divided into 4 gray wolf rigs, three cyclones, 9 neighbors, 1 that we are borrowing from an industry partner and 2 H&P rigs. We will add 8 more H&P rigs during this year that will take that number up to 27, but the loaner rig will go away at the end of March. So we’ll be in the 26 rig range by the end of the year; which essentially our target is 25-26 rigs. So we’ll be on target for our rigs. Even with the delay in delivery of the H&P rigs that experienced. Slide 20 – looking at cost performance. Our LOE is $.36 per MCS. 3 year S&D costs is $.92 and our G&A is $.34 per MCS. We believe we had industry leading performance in these areas. Not enough industry data is out yet for me to give direct comparisons, but I do believe when the 2005 data shakes out and I review us vs. the industry comparisons with you, you’ll see it’s very favorable. For example, our 3 year S&D costs of $.92; that is below what the industry had on average and in our more direct competitive areas, using numbers from 2002 through 2004. So adding in 2005 costs which were higher, I expect that the industry’s S&D costs will go up significantly and ours is at the $.92 range. So I do believe we’ll compare very favorable in all these areas. Slide 21 – On reserves. I’m very pleased to announce that reserves are up to 3.6 trillion cubic feet. Our domestic reserves are up 13.3% to 3.4 trillion cubic feet. Last 2 years we’ve grown 10.5%, this year we’re able to grow 13.3%, even from a larger base we’re starting from. Domestic reserve replacement was 277%; that’s one of the top numbers I’ve seen reported in the industry. Success rate: we drilled 1,629 wells, we had 1,617 successful wells. Again, for the 3rd or 4th year in a row, a 99% success rate. And we moved 603 BCF probable reserves to proved reserves and as you can see at the bottom of this slide, we continue to be able to move our probables to proved reserves the last 3 year we moved almost 1.5 trillion cubic feet of probable reserves to proved reserves. So as we talk about our probably reserves, we feel very strongly that those are the type of reserves you want to have and the type that can move into the proved category. In addition to moving this 1.5 TCF of probables to proveds the last 3 years, our proved developed producing percentage of our total proved reserves has increased from 43% to 49%. So we are not only moving probable to proved, we are also adding…we are not just adding we are moving more into the PDP side and have more revenue generating reserves as we move through each year of drilling program.  Slide 22 – is a reconciliation of getting to our 3.4 TCF of domestic pre-reserves. Just looking briefly from ’04 through ’05, we sold 11 BCF. We acquired a very modest range of 28 BCF. We produced 224 BCR. in addition and revision, total additions were actually 615 BCF and we had 12, a very minor level, 12 BCF of revisions. So the net number is 603 BCF. Total 3.4 TCF to the year end reserves. Also looking at sensitivities in our reserves, we believe the year end hub price used, as per the guidelines, was in the $10.80 range. If that price was cut in half our reserves would only decline by about 1.9% or about 60B, so, our reserves are not really that price sensitive. They are based on high return, long lived reserves, as you know. We are very proud of our reserve replacement ratio and just to stress approximately 99% of our reserves are audited by either for and the reserves underlying the Williams royalty trust is handled by Miller and Land so approximately 99% plus of our reserves are audited by outside firms.  Turning to the highlands project summary, I won’t go through the numbers on this table, but you do see that trail ridge is now been approved for 10 acre density. Redpoint already was 10 acre density. The point to make of this slide, these figures previously have not been included in our 3P reserves that we’ve talked about were 8.5Ts. we have now booked of the Highlands, 140 BCF of pre-reserves from the Highlands asset teams. So we have actually moved some of these reserves from this category, which really wasn’t even in our 3P reserves into a proved reserve category based on our drilling from 2004-5; primarily 2005. We expect to apply to 10-acre in the Island point at the appropriate time. Using 10 acre density for all of these projects would add substantially more reserves to our portfolio, but as we mentioned before we have not added that in there and just to stress, the vast majority of these potential reserves are not include in our 8.5TCF of 3P reserves. Looking specifically at some of the wells drilled to date on slide 24, we have drilled as you can see 15 well in Ridge, 8 in Ryan Gulch, 6 in Alan Point and 2 in Red Point. We’re excited about what we’ve been able to accomplish. Our current production from this area is 18 million a day. We expect we have enough data now to know that there is a hydrocarbon system present. And we’re well along in our understanding of what can happen here and you’ll see some of these ranges, particularly in Ryan Gulch narrow as we continue to have experience.  For 2006 we’ll significantly ramp up our drilling program with 20 wells in ridge, 15 in Ryan Gulch and 9 at Alan Point for a total of 44 wells. Also in this area you must just for outside knowledge, you probably have seen a very amount of transaction which was in the Peonce basin area, which had a tremendous market value, we think, on that. So I think if you look at those kind of numbers that Petroleum was able to purchase, what they purchased and add that to some of our projects here, you can see that there’s a tremendous amount of value here for Williams here as we proceed through.  Slide 25 – We have other opportunities. I believe that a well established core capability of any organization in the ENP industry is also to be able to identify grass roots opportunities. Some of these opportunities are now at the stage where we’re positioned to just begin preliminary discussions of them with you. Looking at this slide, the purses in the peonce basin is a shell ridge prospect; it’s below the Williams fork. We’ve leased about 14,000 gross acres, have 100% working interest, 87.5% net, 10 year leasing term. We have another project pending in the Peonce basin on the Williams work project similar to what we do right now in all of our drilling in both the valley and the highlands. We are looking to finalize this hopefully in the near future, it will be 11,000 net acres and in 2006 we have a drill commitment. In the basin we have been able to lease about almost 40,000 continues gross and net acres; this again would be a mesa verd type gas sands clay. 100% working interest, 10 year lease, 87.5% net. And in the Paradox Basin which is a resource play more, the Ismay Group, Shell and Tye Gas Sandstones, we have 37,000 gross net acres leased, again 5 and 10 year terms on the leases, 100% working interest. All of these are in the infancy stage but I think it’s important to show you that we have been out doing other things and continue to add to our portfolio. As we get more information we’ll give you more when it’s appropriate. We do believe that they have material potential and they capitalize our strengths in non-conventional plays and they give more growth visibility to our current rich inventory of opportunities.  Slide 26 – we do believe we are a leader and I think these facts are proven out by this chart on US gas production growth, particularly through the drill bit. The left side of this slide you can see just ranked by total production, we were 16th in 2005, ranked by top 20 gas producers. If you look at production growth, we were 4th. But also I would mention that most of the people on this list of the top 20 US gas producers on the right side; did significant acquisitions in either late 2004 or throughout 2005. So on organic drill bit growth we are probably the industry leader. I think it’s just a testament to our portfolio we have that we can grow this kind and expect to continue this kind of growth for the guidance period that we’ve talked about. Slide 27- Cash margin analysis. Similar to what I’ve shown before, representative of our 3 year POV and recall that our point of view at the top of this slide and now is there is a expense of $8.50 for ’06 and $7.00 for ’07 and ’08. still use that number minus fuel and shrink of about $.65 which includes transportation and fuel, minus a basis of about $.75 and the hedge loss which is again about $.75, you equate to this $5.75 realized margin. The current 3 year nymex as of February 24 was more in the $8.81 range. As of yesterday I think it dropped to the $8.59 range. So still, those prices are above the calculated strip that we were using which was $7.50. Even though there’s been some weakness in ’06 prices, ’07 and ’08 is actually staying above our forecast.  To reach the cash margin we deduct LOE, which is $.45 and of $.51 operating taxes $.51 and our G&A of about $.30 and we get cash margin of $3.98. so it is obviously a very profitable margin on a cash basis. The other way to look at it, you look at our 3 year S&D cost of $.92, we paid $.92 and we’re making $3.06 margin when you take the $3.98 minus $.92. So we’re making a tremendous margin on what we paid for. On our operating profit basis, you basically take the $3.98, subtract about $1.20-$1.30 DD&A and times our production and you see how we get into our operating profit guidance range. So again a very strong cash margin business and operating profit margin business, even with the recent decline in ’06 gas prices, we still have a very profitable business going forward.  Slide 28 – Our guidance. 2006 and 2007 did not change. We’ve added 2008. We still plan a very robust drilling program in 2008 that’s been added of about 1700 to 1800 wells similar to 2006 and 2007. The midpoint of our 2008 production is greater than 1 BCF a day so it’s a significant production growth during this period. Our comp at average growth rate over this three year period falls in the range of what I mentioned annual; our annual range is 15-20% and our compound average growth rage is in approximately the 16% range for this period. So we look to have a very strong production growth and operating profit growth during this period. Capital spending stays approximately the same in 2008 as in 2007, up slightly for potential new projects which won’t really add too much to production but we did up it some for that. As for an unhedged price assumption, you can see those at the bottom and I think it’s very key to look at our average San Juan Rockies price at the bottom. 2006 is currently above what the market is actually giving, due to the recent decline. 2007 and 2008 are below in the sense that the market is higher in 07 and 08 than what we have on this page as 609 and 610. on the 2006 basis, 732 is actually above what the market would currently give if it was priced out today. Slide 29 – Key points, hopefully you will see that we are an industry leader in production growth, cost efficiency and eserve replacement. Our production increased 18%; we predict our production to be able to grow 15-20% through our guidance period. Our cost period to be beat some of the industry’s lowest and we will provide on our next call much more direct comparisons of our performance versus the industry. Our reserves did increase 13% and the reserve replacement rate was 277%. So our strategy remains to be on top and rapidly develop our premier inventory, stay on top of industry costs. We have not seen significant cost incease over the projections we’ve put in to our plan for 2006. there is cost pressure, however, so what we’re looking at is we believe we put the right numbers in there, we believe the numbers will be able to withstand the cost pressures, but as we move through the next three months we’ll have to understand if our costs will have to go up at all. Drilling rates are up slightly, while our completion costs are basically locked in so we don’t see completion costs as a major part of our portfolio, so we don’t see a tremendous pressure on our completion side. Drilling rates are probably up about 2-5%. Overall we don’t believe at this point that we need to do anything to our ranges for increase cost, but we’ll keep you posted. We’re doing everything we can to diligently manage our costs and we think we’ve done a great job. If you look at our record on how we’re doing that. We’re also looking for new opportunities to start contributing and that’s mostly in highlands. As you know, we have about 140 BCF of reserves booked in the highlands now. We look for more of that to happen as we continue our drilling program this year. And we described 4 new opportunities that we will start to develop late this year and in 2007 and we hope to be able to talk more about those to you as we develop them. And finally I would once again thank our work force for a tremendous amount of work, a great effort during the year and looking forward to their outstanding achievements for 2006. I’ll now turn it over to Alan.
Alan Armstrong.: Thanks Ralph and good morning. Let’s go ahead and turn to slide 31 here. We’re very happy with our 2005 recurring performance within midstream, especially when y9ou consider the 40% decline in Montbellevue , 3 major hurricanes and asset sales that were in excess of our expansion capital placed in service during the period. The $471 million was nearly $80 million above the midpoint of the range we provided at this time last year and near the top of the range we provided in November. So, needless to say we’re very pleased to repeat a record year with continued steady returns and strong cash flows from this business.  The year to year story even though it looks pretty simple here, $471 vs. $471, actually consisted of about $20 million lower NGL profits that were offset by higher fee based revenues. Compare that 40% decline in Montbellevue that I mentioned earlier, you have to realize the benefit that we enjoyed by having the geographic diversity of our western production offsetting what would represent the Montbellevue which is typically just a Gulf Cost but is the industry norm. so we’re pretty excited to have been able to overcome that.  Also during the period that $20 million lower was offset by higher fee based revenues as we’ve indicated to you in the past we were headed toward. So strategy continuing to deliver. In the fourth quarter of ’05 we deliver $112 million. This was another good quarter, but was $39 million lower than the year ago blowout of $151 million and to really speak to this you have to realize our NGL profits were reduced by about $51 million quarter to quarter and we were able to offset this with lower O&M and some higher fee based revenues. So, all in all, very pleased with the year and very pleased with the way we performed in the fourth quarter to overcome what was some pretty good pressure on  Moving on to slide 33, Q4 and 2005 highlights. A few points to make on this slide. First you can see that we had much less volatility in recurring profitability from quarter to quarter in ’05 there in the gold than we had in ’04 and in fact Q4 was just under the average for the last 2 years. So some very repeatable performance. Particularly when you consider the amount of external issues we had like the 3 major hurricanes that we took on. Also we made great strides in positioning midstream for growth in the coming years as we established WPZ which currently enjoys the lowest yield in acceptor. We embarked on the construction of several significant expansions in our core growth basins and those are listed here; particular around Opal and in the deep water. And we embarked on the construction of several significant expansions in our core growth basins. An din the fourth quarter we were able to negotiate for the acquisition of the o-pal TXB4 trains at our o-pal complex and we enjoyed strong free cash flows from Triton, Goldfinger, which came on out of Devils Tower and just in the month of December, that was just starting up, we saw $2.5 million in incremental cash flow just for the month of December. So, some strong profitability. Moving on to slide – on guidance here. This is a pretty simple story here of continued growth. This is Moving on to slide here on the prospects that we’ve been showing. We continue to make great progress here on various growth projects that we’re pursuing. I don’t have enough time today to go into a detailed update of these prospects, but really the short version is that we moved several projects from the development and proposal stage that was on the left into the under negotiations basket and those of you that were able to attend the midstream tutorial back at the end of November, would remember this slide. You can see that we’re progressing some of these projects from the proposal stage into the negotiation stage. Also, a slight increase in the contracted and approved bucket here, again just reflecting the added o-pal TXP4 acquisition in there. So we continue to be very pleased with the amount of opportunity we’re seeing in the sector and we would expect to see that development and proposal stage continue to be filled in as new prospects come forward in all the areas that we’re operating. Just a highlight moving on to the next slide here. This is the overland pass pipeline proposal and this is just a highlight. One of the prospects that we’re pursuing. We first publicly announced this project back on November 30 at our midstream tutorial. We continue to be excited about this project and are excited to tell you that this project continues to move forward and is really starting to take some shape. Surveying, engineering and ride away on this proposed 750 mile pipeline are all progressing and we continue to work toward an in-service date at the end of ’07 or early ’08. As I stated back at our midstream tutorial, this project still represents the lowest cost alternative to flow the liquids from Wyoming into Conway, Kansas. And there will be relatively little horsepower required to move the product from the Wyoming area into Conway, so obviously that gives us a very low variable expense there. This low cost of transportation will result in a very strong reduction in the tariffs that we are currently paying to the Mapple system to clear our NGL’s into the market. And of course that lower tariff will flow right back to the profitability of the o-pal and echo springs facilities. So continue to be excited about this and a lot of great attributes for this project. Moving on to the next slide, this summarizes here on the key points. We just slightly edged out last year in terms of record recurring annual profitability. You have to look pretty close to determine that but we certainly are pleased with the year we produced. Segment profit plus depreciation was $662 million, the MLP proceeds exceed4ed $78 million after the funding of Tahiti and various IPO fees. And we brought in $68 million in before tax assets. And we only spent about $115 million in capital during 2005. so midstream continues to produce tremendous free cash flows and we’re excited to be able to contribute in that way. The spread between gas prices and MontBellevue liquids declined 40% from ’04 to ’05, yet our NGL margins only declined about 10%. And again, that really was attributed to the geographic diversity of our assets and so we’re very pleased with our ability to weather some of the volatility in those markets. And then finally we are forecasting very strong growth in several sectors of midstream and look forward to continuing to update you on the growth of those prospects.  And with that, I will turn it over to Phil Wright.
Phil Wright: Thank you Alan. Slide 38 please. The gas pipeline segment again turned in solid profit and cash flow performance with recurring segment profits of $574 million. Q4 reported results include the impact of 2 non-recurring, non-cash adjustments, totaling $37 million, associated with the revalueing of certain natural gas inventory accounts. These Q4 charges partially offset the $49 million of non-recurring gains we reported throughout ’05 and will reduce full year reported earnings from $586 million to a recurring level of $574 million. Lower year over year recurring results are due primarily to termination fo the Gray’s harbor contract, our northwest pipeline, higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher earnings from Gulf Stream. Slide 39 – in addition to being another year of strong positive cash flow at gas pipes, our team delivered excellent results operationally and commercially. Operationally, we established a 3 day peak record on Transco and met all of our demand obligations in spite of 3 major hurricanes. On the commercial front it is expected that the central new jersey expansion project commence service on November 1 and we held successful open seasons on Transco to serve the northeast and greater Washington, D.C. areas via the Sentinel and Potomac expansions respectively. Sentinel, which will add firm capacity of about 250,000 decatherms a day is scheduled to be in service November of ’08. The Potomac expansion will add 165,000 decatherms a day of therm capacity and is slated for service in November of ’07. we files a certificate application for the previously announced Long Island expansion and I’m pleased with the progress we continue to make on that project. We owe a successful open season for the parachute lateral, which will connect production from the Peonce basin into a hub at Greasewood Colorado, the origin of another new lateral, connecting northwest customers to new production in the Rockies. Expected in services dates are January of ’07 for parachute and November of ’08 for greasewood.  Turning now to our profit, cash and capital guidance on slide 40. Noted in prior calls, during ’06 we have no major expansions, no rate cases coming into effect. As well, due to a change at and accounting policies, we’ll charge about 25-35 million dollars of pipeline integrity costs to expense that had been capitalized before the change and will have $20 million of higher interest costs on gulf stream, following the $850 million financing completed in ’05. So we expect ’06 segment profit to be lower but to rebound following rate cases on northwest, Transco and pine needle in ’07. We’re lowering our guidance in ’06 by $10 million to account for higher insurance premiums due to last year’s hurricanes and for development costs for the recently announced pacific connector pipeline project at northwest, which will be reserved and charged to income until the project is deemed viable, at which time the costs will be capitalized.  The only other material change on this slide is in our capital guidance for ’06 and ’07, predominantly due to the expansions I noted and which are summarized for you on the following slide, which is number 41. We’ve increased our maintenance capital range in ’06 by $35 million to account for deferments from ’05 and changes in our hurricane repair assumptions. Last fall, we forecast these repairs to hit in ’05 and be reimbursed in ’06. Owing to contractor availability and weather difficulties, these are now expected to occur in the first half of ’06. We’ve also increased our cost estimate to a range of $65-$75 million, which we anticipate recovering from insurance. We’ve increased our ’07 maintenance capital guidance to advance work needed for pipeline integrity assessments that were slated for ’08. The ranges for expansion related expenditures have been increased now to include the parachute, sentinel and greasewood projects. This level of capital is well within our EBITDA and cash flow from operation projections and allows gas pipes to continue to generate positive free cash flow through the forecast period. Slide 42 please. This map shows the excellent growth opportunities served by our pipelines. The projects in the shaded boxes have been recently announced but are currently not included in the capital guidance we discussed. Production area, mainline and mobile based sales expansion will enhance our ability to transport domestic production and imported LNG from gulf coast to markets along Transco. Depending on market interest, the mainline expansion could add up to 750,000 decatherms a day of therm transportation. We’re currently holding open seasons for these projects and both are targeted to be in service in ’08. We’re pleased with the improving situation at gulf stream, our joint venture system into Florida. Gulfstream’s conducting an open season to assess interest in a proposed compression based expansion to add about 200,000 decatherms a day of capacity with an inservice date anticipate in January of ’09. We’re very excited about joining with PG&E and Ford Chicago interview partners to pursue the pacific connector, a 250 mile pipeline tying Port Chicago’s proposed Jordan LNG terminal to northwest customers and the pacific gas transmission backbone system into California. Project completion is targeted for 2010. Also, we’ve recently announced an open season for incremental therm storage service from the Jackson prairie storage facility near shahales, Washington, where we’re one third owner. The project included in our guidance will provide capacity to service long term, seasonal and peak-day growth in the pacific northwest by November of ’08.  Slide 43 – Summing up, I’m please to say that by almost any measure, 2005 was another successful year. We continue to be a strong cash flow provider, deliver excellent results operationally and our successes continue in customer service as evidenced by number one rankings in the Masteon company survey in the regions served by northwest and Transco. Going forward our focus is on placing new expansions into service and preparing our rate cases. With that, I’ll turn it over to Bill Hobbs.
Bill Hobbs.: Thank you Phil. We’re now on slide 45. slide 45 takes our reported segment profit and then adjusts for non-recurring items such as litigation contingencies, impairments and then further adjust for the impacts of mark to market accounting which bring us to a Q/Q and a Y/Y improvement vs. 2004. Although a break even year for power, it was somewhat below our expectations coming into the year segment profit negative 257 and again we adjust for mark to market accounting, we adjust for working capital changes in UC power segment, standalone, CFFO of $127 million.  On slide 47 we have two changes to guidance, one is to adjust for the impact from mark to market and the other is we are raising our floor in 2007 to $50 million, they’ve given us a range of $50 million to $200 million largely on the strength of the new deals that we’ve done. Slide 48 shows the success that we did have in ’05 and there’s a couple of key takeaways here. First of all, we were able to contract around each of our positions as well as our customer types, reflect a diverse group of utilities, banks, hedge funds and cooperatives.  Starting in 2006 on slide 49 and this slide does have a formatting error that we didn’t catch and will be fixed on our website, but we have had early success in 2006, primarily in the northeast. We have contracted for 500 megawatts of additional capacity sales for June 2006 through May 2009, with 2 utilities and as well we did our first sale to the retail aggregator in the west position of 175 megawatts that runs through the end of 2006. Slide 50 shows basically on a bar chart format the success we’ve had in contracting for additional capacity throughout the guidance period. As you can see we still have additional megawatts left to sell, that provide the in the hourly markets but also the opportunity to enter into additional long term sales.  Slide 51 is a key slide, if you will look at 2006 to 2008, the guidance period, you’ll see that the hedge cash flows are extremely significant, especially compared to the merchant expectations that we have. And if you normalize our SG&A for 2006-2008 to reduce it for the non-recurring affect of 2005, you can see that we predict a very strong cash flow forecast even if you would back out the merchant revenues. However, we do see the market improving and we do believe that merchant revenues are very achievable. Slide 52 walks us from 2005 recurring segment loss after mark to market and adjusts for the impacts of the new contracts that we have executed. Again, in 2005, high natural gas prices, mild weather, hurricanes and plant outages had a significant negative impact on our earnings. Although we do not forecast that for 2006, the new contracts have greatly mitigated that risk which gets us to our guidance range of $50-$150 million. On slide 53 and in summary, again we did contribute a positive cash flow to the corporation on a standalone basis in 2005 despite very difficult conditions in 2005 we basically produced a breakeven year and significant improvement over 2004 levels. We do believe in 2006 the market is improving. We are executing contracts. It’s showing a lot of interest from our customers and increasing liquidity in the marketplace so we’re very optimistic that we’ll continue to have success in further contracts into the future and certainly we are looking at some deals that extend beyond 2010 although at this point it’s too early to indicate the possibility of success. We remain very focused on creating additional cash flow certainty and generating EBA and reducing the risk which is evident to the long term deals that we’re contracting for and as I’m indicated we are excited about our future in that we’re going to continue to be able to offer risk management services to our customers for years to come. With that I’ll turn it back to Don.
Don Chappel: Thanks Bill. Let’s turn next to slide number 55. it summarizes our 2006 forecast guidance. Again segment profit before mark to market adjustment is largely unchanged from what we had provided last quarter and I would note that it includes $280 million of cost related to mark to market effects. We do adjust that out by the bottom of the slide and lastly and most importantly, diluted EPS on a recurring basis after mark to market we’re estimating in the range of $.78 to $1.03, up somewhat from 2006 levels and I think very importantly it positions us for 2007 a breakout year. The next slide, number 56, this summarizes the business unit and consolidates segment profit guidance after mark to market adjustment. The guidance is largely unchanged from our 11/4 call and again I would not that 2008 that approximately $2.3 billion is up $700 million or above 45% from 2005. Number 57, this slide summarizes business unit and consolidated Capex guidance. I’d note Alan and Phil previously described changes from prior guidance related principally to some timing rollover from 2005 to 2006 as well as new projects and certainly in the case of gas pipelines we would expect that those 2006 costs to the extent that they were maintenance related would be recoverable and our rate cases it would be filed in late ’06 and it would take effect in early ’07. and to the extent that they’re related to growth projects in either midstream or pipelines, those earnings would take hold as those projects go into service. Number 58, we previously touched on segment profit. I’ll focus my comments on cash flow from operations. Again, 2006 cash flow from ops, at approximately $1.8 billion, up from $1.4 in 2005 and again by 2008 or forecast is more in the $2.4 billion range, an increase of $600 milion over ’06 or 33%. Finally, operating free cash flow is a negative number for ’06 as a result of very significant growth projects as well as the northwest pipeline replacement project. As you can see by 2007 that diminishes somewhat as that northwest pipeline replacement project and some other maintenance projects are completed. But still very substantial and driving substantial growth. Operating free cash flow is positive in ’07 and very positive in ’08 and I think we’re well positioned to continue to seize opportunities in our core businesses to create additional value. Number 59, graphically depicts what we just talked about. As you can see cash flows are strong and growing quite rapidly and capex is expected to decline somewhat following 2006. Number 60, this slide graphs our segment profit growth again with about $700 million of expected growth over 2005 by 2008, or just under 50%. And then finally on slide number 61, just to hit a few key points, again we’ll continue to focus on driving sustainable growth in EBA and shareholder value. We’ll maintain adequate cash and liquidity of at least $1 billion to handle margin volatility as well as our capital needs. We’ll continuously strive to improve our credit ratios and ratings. Ultimately achieving investment grade ratios, even if that’s out ahead of us a few years. We’ll continue to reduce risk in the power segment and we’ll seize many of the terrific opportunities that we have ahead of us. With that I’ll turn it back to Steve.
Steven Malcolm: Thank you Don. Briefly, I believe our story continues to revolve around four key points. We own and manage world class natural gas related businesses, we are opportunity rich in terms of our investment options, we are investing in a disciplined manner by virtue of the fact that we’ve embraced the EDA methodology and we believe that we are in the midst of an attractive commodity outlook for our businesses. We can certainly prosper in a $6-$8 gas price environment. With that, we will be happy to take your questions.
Operator: We’ll go first to Craig Shere with Calyon Securities.
Craig Shere: Hi. A couple of questions. First Don or maybe the segment heads, can y’all provide what you see as maintenance capex numbers for each of your divisions and then a couple of quick follow ups after that.
Don Chappel: Craig we’ll ask each of our segment heads to perhaps make a comment on that. Phil Wright’s prepared to kick that off.
Phil Wright: Yes, if you would turn to slide number 41, at the top line there we have our normal maintenance and compliance capital investment detailed there. And I think as well we have in the appendix more information on capital. If you need a more detailed breakout of that, we’re prepared to do it but it gets kind of lengthy in slicing it up. As you can see the big ticket item there is the 2nd line, northwest pipeline 26” capacity replacement, which we’ve spoken about throughout the year in 2005 at $276 million in ’06 and a couple of million of cleanup in ’07.
Craig Shere.: Great.
Phil Wright: And also if you will look in the appendix under what’s title dstrong free cash flow, I’m not sure what the slide number is there, but it is in the appendix…87, you can see there both historically and in our forecast what the maintenance capex looks like for midstream. It also has the well connex and to a certain degree our well connex are running in place capital. About 25-30 of that is what we think is necessary to keep production volumes level. So, but just the cliff notes on that, it runs about $30 million a year of maintenance capex and about $25-$30 of that Well Connex, with that Well Connex capital increasing a little bit the last ocuple of years, but we are getting increasing volumes from that.
Steve Malcolm.: I failed to reinforce a point that Don Chappel made earlier and that is with these projects in ’06 and ’07 for maintenance we do expect to be able to recover on those following our rate cases at northwest and Transco.
Ralph Hill.: We generally define ours as capital required to keep our production flat. Our production’s gone up significantly. We expect to continue, but to keep our production flat at the levels we’re at now, we would estimate about $250-$300 million, probably closer to the higher end of that level to keep the volumes flat.
Craig Shere: Great, thank you. And Ralph, what are prospects for new technology deployment or obtaining reasonably priced rigs to meaningfully accelerate the drilling schedule?
Ralph Hill.: Well, we have accelerated quite a bit and we look for other opportunities, there are other companies we are talking to in addition to H&P about new technologies. Neighbors has a similar type of flex rig if you will, it’s not called flex rig, that we’re contracted actually for a couple of those rigs to come to use in early 2007. so we are doing things like that. And that’s the kind of new technology that we’re seeing right now. The top driven rigs, the closed mud-pits, the closed loop system on muds are much more efficient type rigs, so we are actively out seeking not only new arrangements with our existing drilling contractors, but possibly others. There are prospects there, at this point we’re at the range of the 25-26 by the end of this year, but we’re already in the process of looking to incerese that number for 2007 and beyond as we speak.
Craig Shere: And last question, Bill what are prospects for hedging past 2010? And any comments on the capacity markets?
Bill Hobbs: I think in general that still the utility markets are dealing in the 3-5 year range, but there are things that are occurring in the market for instance the Neptune line that’s being built in the northeast to take PG&M power to Long Island. There’s interest around that project because people will be signing up for 10 year capacity so I think they’re starting to look for supply arrangement in that kind of timeframe. We’re certainly talking to all of our utility customers, even the ones we have existing relationship with to kind of blend and extend the contracts that we have to … the rules are changing very quickly and you mentioned capacity markets but they are changing and so we’re always working with our customers to try to make sure the contractual items fit their needs and ours. Our view of capacity markets is you’re probably going to see PG&M and ISO occur in 2007 and in California is schedule to be 2007 but could slip into 2008. I will say this though, the contracts that we’re currently entering into, these deal I’m referring to, do have a capacity feature to them. So even though there’s not a defined market in all regions, customers are recognizing the need to contract for capacity.
Craig Shere: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to Schnere Gershuni with UBS Securities.
Schnere Gershuni: Good morning guys. I just have 3 quick questions here. The first question is, when do you expect to update the 2P and 3P portion of your reserves?
Steve Malcolm: As we move through this process we’re thinking the next call we should be able to do that, which his in May. It may be more like mid year but we’re in the process of doing that now. The push was to finish our proved rserves and get through that process, which we’ve now done and we’ll start to turn our attention to updating the 3P by mid year.
Schnere Gershuni: Okay. One other quick question just about reserves and this relates to the Peonce on slide 24 you have the expected estimated ultimate recovery ranges for the wells, I don’t have your previous numbers, but did you increase the range for both Ridge and Alan point? 
Steve Malcolm: I thought we tightened the range, I don’t recall us increasing the range but what we’re trying to do as we drill more in each of those areas we are tightening the range. I think that should be fairly close to what we had previously but I’ll find the old slide and look at that for you.
Schnere Gershuni: And just switch me over to power for one second. I realize you’re just talking now about some of the opportunities that you had in 2010 in the PGM market, but if we can switch to the western site, specifically California, has anything changed on the macro front that would change your outlook for I guess the confidence that you have for extending contracts beyond 2010?
Steve Malcolm: Not really. There’s talks of a new power facility being built, but California basically needs about 2,000 megawatts a year just to keep pace with the economic growth that its seeing. So I think we’ll certainly reach a point, I have said before and I think it’s probably more in 2007 and 2008, when utilities will looking at contracts as far as 2015. But, there’s nothing fundamentally that’s changed in any way to change our bullish view of that market longer term.
Schnere Gershuni: Thank you very much.
Operator: We’ll go next to Nick O’Grady with Sandel Asset Management.
Nick O’Grady: Hi guys, can you hear me? Okay, question is on as you may know, one of your peers western gas resources has talked about planning different ways to maximize value. I’m curious if you guys are looking at the same types of tings, specifically midstream, E&P, other ways to find value?
Steve Malcolm: Nick, I’m not aware of anything new that’s come out of Western on that. We’ll take a look at that if you’d like to call IR.
Operator: We’ll go next to Carl Kirst with Credit Suisse.
Carl Kirst: Good morning everybody. A couple of quick questions on the E&P side, Ralph is it fair to say with the new H&P rigs that are going to be coming down that you guys are still very focused on bringing in new and possibles to the proved category in ’06? Meaning that should we still be looking for a double digit growth in reserves in 2006, I guess partially it looked like F&D this year, ’05, was about 25. Is that roughly the range you’re looking for for 2006 as well? 
Ralph Hill.: Well, I don’t think I can predict that at this time. But we are all about trying to move our probables over to proved in addition to increasing our production. Costs are up slightly this year; we will have to weight that vs. the amount of reserves that we add. We are also going into some new areas that don’t initially add a lot of reserves. We are also adding a significant amount of facilities this year, meaning 2006, that we started in 2005 to allow us to move all this gas for the period late ’06 and beyond. So in general, our goal is to move as much over as possible each year and to continue our path of increasing our reserves while also increasing production but, I don’t think we’ve ever predicted nor will I predict this time what we think, but we have a great track record and we look to continue our track record.
Carl Kirst: Fair enough. One follow up just looking at the highlands, trying to get a sense of timing for when you might be looking at 10 acre spacing on Ryan Gulch as well. Could you at least even bucket it into an ’06 or ’07 timeframe?
Ralph Hill: Not yet. And Ryan Gulch, we’ve drilled the least amount of wells and as you can see the range on EURs is the widest range and there’s still a question will that even go to 10-acre spacing or stay at 40 or stay at 20? We just don’t know enough yet, but we are planning to drill 15 wells there this year and we’ll have a much better idea by the end of this year on what we think that can be ultimately. Ryan gulch is just too early to tell if it stays at 40s, goes to 20s or could ultimately be at 10s. just we need to do much more drilling, much more experience with that area first.
Carl Kirst.: Great, that’s helpful and just lastly, Don, can you give us if there was ever a timeframe ever established for the four corners deal, was there any timing ever talked about?
Don Chappel.: Carl, as Steve mentioned earlier in the call we are unable to discuss that transaction, so I’ll respectfully refuse to answer. So you’ll just have to stay tuned.
Carl Kirst: Fair enough, thank a lot guys.
Operator: We’ll go next to Faisel Khan, with Citigroup.
Faisel Khan: Good morning. If I could just walk through your guidance for ’06 that roughly $1.86 billion in operating income, the high end for ’06. I look at your ’05 recurring number after mark to market adjustment, it’s roughly $1.58 billion. If I look at the high end of your EPS guidance of a $1.03 compared to $.86, can you just walk me through what’s going on below the operating income line to net income that’s been causing a slower net income growth over ’05 to ’06 vs. your operating income growth?
Steve Malcolm: Faisel, I don’t know what I have to add other than what is on the slide that was provided earlier. I can certainly walk you through that but I think we’ve pretty well laid out what the components are.
Faisel Khan: What about this: in the four the quarter of ’05 your interest expense goes up by about $10 million. Can you talk about what’s causing that? Is it short term rates and then your investing income line also goes the other way by about, is a loss of about $21 million.
Steve Malcolm: I think during 2005 we did expand our credit facilities and certainly they were in place in the fourth quarter but we expanded our credit facilities to have more capacity to support our hedging program as well as provide additional liquidity for general corporate purposes. We’re also anticipating a couple of financings related to our gas pipeline business to get the capital structure at the optimal level as we approach a rate case. so perhaps those factors are a couple of components of that.
Faisel Kahn: Okay, fair enough.
Steve Malcolm.: Faisel, I might point you to slide 82 that does detail some of the components of interest expense.
Faisel Khan: There’s amortization and of another debt expense numbers…do you have those types of expenses in 2005? 
Steve Malcolm: We had some similar expense in 2005 but I also think we detailed that in our prior call, the 11/4 call, so there should be a schedule that’s similar to the one that you’re looking at.
Faisel Khan: Okay, fair enough. On the proved reserves side, you talked about the domestic reserves moved to roughly 3.4Ts but there’s an incremental 200Ds that came the international segment. Can you talk about what’s going on over there? 
Steve Malcolm: Similar to last year we had slightly over 200 BCF and we’ve had that for quite a while and that’s through our ownership in AVCO Argentina and some other related properties, down primarily in Argentina. Last year as we mentioned our domestic reserves were 3 TCFs, meaning year end 2004, and that number has moved to 3.4 TCF, year end 2005. Reserves did go up international, but not a significant amount, so adding that slightly over 200 BCF to the reserves ’04 and ’05 get us to the 3.6Ts. so it’s our ownership primarily in our Argentina properties.
Faisel Khan: And you said your reserves aren’t that price sensitive, meaning the higher commodity prices at year end didn’t really affect any positive revisions or moving any more reserves. Some reserves did become more economic as a result of the higher prices, is that true?
Steve Malcolm: Yes, that is true. We cut the price in half just to do some sensitives. And less than 2% of our reserves would actually go away.
Faisel Khan: And sort of put the pipeline company…the rate cases that you’re going to have ongoing over the next 1-2 years, are you attributing any success of those rate cases in your guidance?
Steve Malcolm: I’m sorry are we what?
Faisel Kahn: Attributing any success in those rate cases in your guidance? Are you assuming that your rates go up on your pipeline system?
Steve Malcolm: Yes.
Faisel Kahn: By the full amount or…?
Steve Malcolm: That has been our guidance for 2007. There’s an assumption that we file these rate cases late ’06 and they go into effect during the first quarter of 2007 and that is included in the guidance for gas pipelines.
Faisel Khan: Okay thank you very much.
unidentified speaker from Williams: If I could respond to an earlier question. We did raise the region Alan point. Previously the reserves were 1.4BCF and we raised that to 1.6. So to the other caller, that is correct, we did raise the upper end of that range, kept lowering the and raised the upper end. 
Operator: We’ll go next to Scott Soler with Morgan Stanley.
Scott Soler: Hi, good morning. I have 2 kind of questions. One is just in terms of earnings guidance in ’06 again following up on Faisel’s question, I wanted to ask two specific points aside from interest expenses that, Don on the tax rate the same on the effective tax rate? I think most people tend to model 36-37%. Is that higher now? And then also, on the hedges on slide 84, the hedges are at a lower price than what was previously mentioned on the same production for ’06 and ’07 and I was curious why did that change? Then I’ve got one question on E&P.
Ralph Hill: The hedges, what we did is the NYMEX price is the same but we tried to note here, please note that it’s base locations not Nymex. What we’re trying to give you now and we thin k it’s a better model is actually a fixed price at the basin. So what I’m giving you is the actual basin price…
Scott Soler.: I’m sorry Ralph, I see that now.
Ralph Hill: We did footnote that but they didn’t change in the sense of…it’s easier if you do the basin price vs. the Nymex price.
Steve Malcolm: Scott on your tax rate question we have a slide in the appendix that details that, slide number 83. We’re using a 39% effective tax rate and a cash tax of 5-10% for the guidance period.
Scott Soler.: Okay. And I guess on E&P I want to ask an update question from when we chatted a month ago. I guess that just the general comment and I don’t know what you can answer, on slide 26 it shows and our numbers too when we look at all the E&P companies in north America, Williams is probably the most successful E&P company, excluding acquisitions in growing reserves in production due to drill bit. Yet if I put on that slide my net asset value and backed into the value of the E&P business, we think the market’s better than the reserves as we roll four reserves at $1.25. which would put you at the lower range of valuation with the best E&P business in the industry. I guess what I’m trying to understand is how generally are you guys discussing potentially closing the gap? And would it come through acceleration of drilling vs. share buy back or third other options that you might have. Is there any updated thinking on that from when we met a little over a month ago?
Don Chappel: Scott, this is Don I’ll just make a comment and if perhaps Steve wants to follow it. I think our strategy is to sharply accelerate our production. I think Ralph and his team have a plan to do that really moving from 15 or so rigs in the peonce at the end of 2005 to somewhere in the 26-27 range by the end of 2006 and kind of going into 2007 with that 26-27 and perhaps more. And I think as we’re able to get our E&P production up to a level that’s optimal, certainly our earnings will come up sharply. And we would expect to receive a more full valuation. And with that I don’t know if Steve has any…
Steve Malcolm.: I would just add to that, I think as Ralph Hill has described, we intend to accelerate our drilling in the peonce and probably most of the, the new information will be around the peonce highlands area and just how attractive that oportunity’s going to be. So I think proving up and validating just how good the highlands are and how strong those step outs are to the extent that we can capture additional step outs would certainly I think further drive value in the E&P sector. We clearly understand that some investors believe it’s possible to create some short term burst of value through modifications of our company structure and to your point, where I think you were going Scott, we have analyzed along with many other options whether we could create long term shareholder value through an initial public offering or partial or complete spinoff of our E&P business. As I’ve said in the past, our current assessment is that that value creation, if any, from such actions would only be short term in nature and wouldn’t be in the best interests of our shareholders. Having said that I think we’ve demonstrated a willingness to make structural changes when we believe that they support sustainable value creation over the long term and then I think the evidence of that is the fact that we did go forward and create the MLP. So we will continue to manage our company to create sustainable long term value for our shareholders to the extent that that objective would lead us to evaluate our structure, we will consider all of the various options. But, we believe, based on our assessment thus far that we can create the greatest long term value from our E&P business and for our shareholders by maintaining the integrated natural gas strategy.
Scott Soler.: Okay. Thanks for addressing it Steve.
Operator: We’ll go next to Maureen Howe with RBC.
Maureen Howe: Thanks very much. A couple of my questions have been answered but, I just wanted to return to the expansions of the pipelines and so I was just wondering when you hold an open season and then proceed onto a regulatory filing, what term are you looking for in terms of contractual arrangements from the shippers?
Steve Malcolm: Let me speak to recent experience as an example. We’re striving to maintain this level in our future expansions as well but if you look at the long island expansion we had 20 year contracts behind that. 
Maureen Howe: So is that sort of an average that you would look at or is that what you would expect to get.
Steve Malcolm: That is what we expect to get and what we have gotten in the past although I’ll be quick to say that there’s a lot of pressure on that level of term in the marketplace. Competitors have been offering lower terms and we continue to deal with that. It’s a situation by situation negotiation.
Maureen Howe: And before you proceed to regulatory filing, what is it that you lok for in terms of percentage of contractual arrangements? Is there a threshold in terms of covering fixed costs or is there a percentage in terms of available throughput on the line?
Steve Malcolm: Each discrete expansion project is designed after the open season. We understand clearly what the market wants in the way of firm capacity. We design the facilities tailored to fit that. And, present those costs to the customer and that is in fact the rate that will be negotiated into the precedent agreement, signed with the customer. And so when we go to certification we have essentially these projects fully put to bed.
Maureen Howe: When you say that, when you go to certification, you have the project signed up to provide what you’re looking for in terms of a threshold return on equity?
Steve Malcolm: Correct.
Maureen Howe: And then I was just wondering Don, in terms of the investment grade credit rating, I guess you get asked this almost every conference call but, is…what’s your current thinking and outlook in terms of – in your mind – realizing that who knows where the credit rating agencies are…but in Williams’ mind, how long to do you think it will be before you reach the target ratios that will give you an investment grade credit rating?
Don Chappel.: Maureen I think that’s a great question and it’s one that I probably can’t answer. But, we are and have been reinvesting in the business for a couple of reasons. We think that drives more value to shareholders than paying down debt. Then also I think investment grade rating will be more a function of our coverage of fixed charges then debt to Cap ratio type metric. As well, I think the ratings agencies still are on kind of a wait and see basis on power. I think their view has improved quite a lot over the last couple of years but I think they’ll be looking forward to our beginning to hedge beyond 2010. So having said all that, I think it’s just really indeterminable but it’s certainly out there a couple of years or more.
Maureen Howe: You seem to be signing contractual arrangements on the power side and with pipeline shippers, so what would you characterize as the biggest issues and problems faced by Williams, due to a lack of an investment grade credit rating? Is it just the cost of debt or is it reducing your flexibility?
Steve Malcolm: I think we’re operating quite nicely with the credit rating that we currently have. Surely the market is giving us much more credit than the ratings agencies. So we look at really where our bonds trade and how the banks deal with us much more so than our credit ratings. So given that, we have a great deal of flexibility. We have great access to capital and reasonable costs. I think what the investment grade will give us in an incrementally better cost, more flexibility and ability to maintain lower cash balances as well as in terms of post less margin and less liquidity requirements on hedges and even on some new long term contracts, particularly in the power sector. So I think overall it’ll be a great help to us, but one that is not top of the list at this point.
Maureen Howe: Okay that’s great. And just one final question. It’s sort of just a small question for Bill. It has to do with…we’ve normally seen in the past anyways, a graph that’s put into the presentation that shows the $400 million and totaling fixed charges and then your contractual commitments that goes out a number of years and I guess shows the crossover point. I don’t see that in this presentation and I don’t see it in the appendix. Is this something that might be posted on the website? Are you familiar with the graph I’m…?
Bill Hobbs: The appendix we are now just reporting through the guidance period so I guess that’s the change you’re referring to. It is basically the same schedules we showed before, it’s now just for the guidance period.
Maureen Howe: Okay, that’s great. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Sam Brothwell with Wachovia.
Sam Brothwell: Hi. I know we’re getting close to the curtain here but I was just going to ask if maybe you could elaborate a little bit more. You touched on the interest expense question. Is it fair to say that you’re probably going to see the maximum amount of pressure on that line item this year, given that the capex is so high? I guess the other thing is, thinking about collateral posting requirements as gas prices move around, can you comment on that at all, this year relative to last year?
Steve Malcolm: Sure, Sam. Yes I would expect that 2006 would likely be some more pressured in light of both the hedges we have in place and our need to have substantial liquidity to support those hedges as well as the fact that we do have capital spending in front of us that’s in excess of our operating cash flow so we do have a need to fund some of that capital spending. So we’re maintaining perhaps more cash than we would otherwise as well as a credit facility that’s a big bigger than we would, absent both the hedges and the high level of spending that’s in front of us.
Sam Brothwell: Okay, thanks a lot.
Operator: We’ll go next to Wade Suki with Bank of America Securities.
Wade Suki: Good morning everyone. Just a couple of quick questions for you. I might have missed it, but did you mention what the domestic percentage was a year end? 
Ralph Hill: Yes, I did. The domestic PUD percentage is now 41% and the PDP is…I’m sorry, the domestic PUD percentage is 51% and the PDP is 49%.
Wade Suki: Was it 55% last year or something like that?
Ralph Hill: Last year the PUD wqs 55%, correct and the year before that was 57%.
Wade Suki: Fantastic. And again, I think you mentioned it Ralph, 12Bs and net positive revisions domestically?
Ralph Hill.: They were actually net negative, slight negative. So the…on slide 22 where you see the 603BCF of plus 603, add/revision, there was 615 of adds and 12 of revisions, just slight negative revisions. And there were very miscellaneous.
Wade Suki.: And then costs incurred, could you walk through that reconciliation with the exploration development acquisition that kind of thing? 
Ralph Hill: On which one now? I’m sorry?
Wade Suki: Just your costs incurred on the E&P business, broken out exploration, development on acquisition. Do you have that available? 
Ralph Hill: I’m not…say it one more time?
Wade Suki.: Capital expenditures, costs incurred?
Ralph Hill: What we spent last year, you mean?
Wade Suki: Yea, if you had it broken out between development, acquisitions, unproved leaseholds, all that good stuff that you usually disclose in the K.
Ralph Hill.: I do have that. I don’t have it in front of me. Primarily the vast majority was for development drilling with approximately 30-35 million for facilities and the small acquisition in the Barnett which is about I think also about 40 million. We’ll break that out in the K, but the vast majority was for drilling last year.
Wade Suki: That’s what I figured. Perfect. Thank you so much.
Operator: Next to Jeff Burr at Matador Capital.
Jeff Burr: Good morning. Just to follow up on the discussion about the shareholder value and E&P. you know, first of all you guys have done a phenomenal job in the peonce and E&P and yet there’s still this very significant valuation gap. So, kind of a several part question. You guys have done a great job, what will going from 15 rigs to 26- or 27…which will be a great accomplishment, but how will that change the valuation gap that exists now and if that valuation gap does in fact persist and its something you feel is best not addressed with and IPO or partial spinout of the E&P business, why is there not perhaps a stronger consideration of a share buyback where you can, you know, buy your own reserves at a huge discount to similarly valued assets?
Steve Malcolm: Jeff, I think the point about what might drive value I think is around quantifying in more certain terms what the peonce highlands opportunity might be and I think that’s why we think it’s premature to take steps on doing anything with the E&P business, that’s one reason. As well, Jeff, I really don’t think I have anything more to offer on the issue of structural changes that we might take. I think I’ve been very clear that we have evaluated those options with our board, with investment bankers, and again, all things considered, don’t believe that it makes sense today. But I’m not suggesting that that’s the final answer. We will continue to be open minded about that topic. We’ll continue to evaluate it often and that represents our current thinking. In terms of the share buyback, we’ve talked about the fact that as we look at how we want to make the best use of the capital and cash we have available we think that most of the…the best way to grow shareholder value today is by investing in these extraordinary E&P projects. We will continue to evaluate all of the options both from a structural standpoint and how we best use our cash.
Jeff Burr: Right.
Steve Malcolm: And Don I don’t know if you’d want to add anything?
Don Chappel: Steve, I’ll just add and Jeff, I kind of look ahead about 18 months or so. Again by mid 2007 we’re drilling with 27 or more rigs in the peonce as well as drilling in all of our other areas. We’ll have increased visibility around the Highlands, perhaps opportunities to accelerate drilling there. There are 2 pipelines we will have had rate cases, we’ll have new projects both in midstream and gas pipelines go into service. We’ll have more time for the MLP to provide us with some benefits and the whole picture, if you fast forward about 18 months in terms of earnings, cash flows and prospects is a pretty bright picture. And I think we see a lot of value creation, much of . To get something like that we would have a pretty severe setback on credit and the markets would be closed to us. 
Jeff Burr: Just as a little bit of a follow up and I’m not trying to be argumentative here. We’re ecstatic about the job you guys are doing, excited about the next couple of years. I guess Steve, what would be helpful, or Don, as you’ve looked at the option of a partial spinoff or an IPO of E&P. I mean, that does not seem like it would prevent you guys on an operational basis from being able to essentially operate in the same manner you have been. You know, the integrated way that you’ve been talking about. It just simply would create a vehicle for those who want to invest in a pure play to do so. So what am I missing there in terms of why an IPO or partial spinoff of E&P would prevent you guys on a day to day operational basis…how would that prevent you from continuing to operate the way you are now?
Don Chappel: I’ll just mention a couple of considerations, one is credit. We have a substantial amount of debt. If we were to hive off some of those cash flows from the E&P business we would have to load that E&P business with a substantial amount of debt, which would put it in a fairly weak position for an E&P company. So we really look at both the parent company as well as this E&P company that we just described as being weaker than the combined company would be. And I think that would cause some considerable valuation and opportunity issues as well as the costs of governance and the way the governance issues, as well as the opportunities that Steve described here that we think are just now emerging. We think that’ll be much more valuable in the future than they are today. So, I think that, along with the fact that we’re not currently drilling up the reserves at a pace that is optimal. I think we’re moving as fast as can be expected moving from 1 rig in 2003 in the peonce to 10 in 2004 and 15 in 2005 to 27 by late 2006. I think we’ll substantially close the gap along with the other steps that we’re taking. So I’d encourage a little bit of patience there.
Jeff Burr: Well, we love what you’re doing. We’re excited about the future, we probably just respectfully just disagree a little bit on the cap structure side, but that’s what makes a market. Thanks for the answers guys.
Operator: We’ll go next to Rick Gross with Lehman Brothers.
Rick Gross: Good morning. I’d like to ask a little bit about the Peonce and the infrastructure spending that you’re going to possibly do on expanding the gathering and processing facilities. We’ve seen in the local news out there in Colorado that you’re filed to increase the plant capacity from 3 to maybe 6 up to 800 million a day. I’m just curious as to if that plan is recognized in your current capex, either in E&P or if it’s over in the midstream business. And what type of rig count you’d need? By my own calculation you’d need well over 35 rigs to build your own equity production, which historically has been the feed into those plants, to 800 million a day. Can you flesh around what’s imbedded in the outlook as far as increasing the plant size and the infrastructure our there in the Peonce. I guess the current production’s over the plant capacity of roughly 300 right now.
Ralph Hill: Rick, the capital is included in our guidance for the facilities we need. Essentially what we see is basically we’ll be getting to those kinds of levels, at least our guidance levels, with the 25 rig program, once that’s up by the end of this year and cranking through. We can reconcile the difference between 25 and 35 later, but basically our 25 rig program and running it full speed, getting some efficiencies on both our days’ drilling, our completion, lack of rig moves, because we can stay on the same pad longer and those kind of things. So, essentially, yes, the capital’s included in our guidance for plan expansions and it is based on primarily 25 rig program.
Rick Gross: From a standpoint of firming up the plant size and the fact that you’re going to feed it with principally equity gas, is the full 800 in by the end of the forecast period, ’08, end of ’08?
Ralph Hill: Rick I think it is. I don’t recall directly so I’ll say yes I think and we can get back to you on that. And there is some third party gas that we’ll be feeding into the plant.
Rick Gross.: Is it very substantial?
Ralph Hill: Well, I don’t know what substantial definition is. But it’s…it’s a good level, but not near what we will be putting into it obviously. So it’s hard to say. We’re also negotiating for some of the third parties still to come in. so I’ll just kind of leave it at that.
Rick Gross: Okay, thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our final question of the day from Dave Foley with Crowe Creek Asset Management.
Dave Foley.: Good morning. Just one quick question for you. You guys have, or its my understanding, that APCO Argentina just had a pretty significant find down in Southern Argentina and I was wondering if you could comment on that.
Steve Malcolm: Not yet. APCO will have its 10K filed I believe within 2 weeks. I know that one of our partners in the field has sent some information out on that. I think they filed earlier. But they have had some good successes down in the southern part of Argentina.
