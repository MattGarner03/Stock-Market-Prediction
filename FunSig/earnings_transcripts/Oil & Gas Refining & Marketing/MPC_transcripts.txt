===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-06 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MPC First Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. My name is Amanda, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.
Kristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's first quarter 2025 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Maryann Mannen, CEO; John Quaid, CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. With that, I'll turn the call over to Maryann.
Maryann Mannen: Thanks, Christina, and good morning, everyone. Let me highlight a few elements of our performance that were most relevant to our results in the first quarter. Refining utilization of 89%, reflecting the safe and successful completion of the second highest amount of planned turnarounds in history focused heavily on our Gulf Coast region. We plan this turnaround activity to occur in the first quarter, a period of seasonally weaker demand. capture was 104% as we delivered strong commercial performance in a period of low refining margins and volatility from regulatory uncertainty. Our Midstream segment adjusted EBITDA grew 8% year-over-year, and MPLX announced over $1 billion of strategic acquisitions, advancing our midstream natural gas and NGL growth strategies. Our longer-term fundamental view supports an enhanced mid-cycle environment for refining. Despite reductions to the 2025 demand outlook forecasts still point to a global oil demand growth. mainly driven by demand for the refined products we produce. U.S. refined product inventories have drawn for the ninth straight week and are below the five-year average. This plus lower retail prices should be supportive as we move into the summer driving season, a period of strong seasonal demand. Within our own domestic and export businesses, we are seeing steady year-over-year demand for gasoline and growth for diesel and jet fuel. And while light-heavy differentials could remain narrow as Canadian producers increase maintenance in the second quarter, we believe that higher OPEC plus production could offset that near-term tightness. We believe underlying fundamentals support stronger margins, especially as announced refinery closures offset recent capacity additions. We anticipate around 800,000 barrels per day coming offline across several refineries in the U.S. and Europe this year. In the U.S., the Gulf Coast refinery completed its closure in the first quarter and in California, two announced closures are expected over the next 12 months. We have been investing in our fully integrated West Coast value chain. California demand for our products is driven by the 28 million conventional fuel vehicles in the state, among other factors and with nearly $8 million in Los Angeles, the L.A. region is one of the three largest refined product demand centers in the U.S. At our Los Angeles refinery, we are nearing completion of approximately $700 million in infrastructure improvements to integrate and modernize utility systems to improve reliability and increase energy efficiency while also complying with tighter emission reduction regulations. Following completion expected at the end of this year, these improvements are intended to strengthen the competitiveness of our Los Angeles refinery and position us to be one of the most cost competitive players in the region for years to come. Our long-term positive fundamental view for the refining industry is unchanged, and we expect demand growth to exceed the net impact of capacity additions and rationalization through the end of the decade. We believe the U.S. refining industry will remain structurally advantaged over the rest of the world. The U.S. has a locational advantage given the accessibility of nearby crude, which we believe will grow as the cost of transportation increases. The availability of low-cost natural gas, low-cost butane and the U.S. refining system flexibility all increase its competitive advantage over international sources of supply. The flexibility of our fighting assets and our domestic and international logistical and commercial capabilities further increase our global competitive advantage. Our commitment to commercial excellence regardless of market conditions, remains core to our execution. We believe that the capabilities we are building provide a sustainable advantage versus our peers, we look to demonstrate that through our financial performance. We are progressing our $1.25 billion standalone capital plan for 2025 with 70% targeted on high-return projects, designed to create optionality and improve our ability to capitalize on market volatility. Underpinning our commitment to safe and reliable operations maintenance capital is approximately 30% of that capital spend. In addition to the project at our LAR refinery, in our Mid-Con region, we are increasing our flexibility to optimize jet production at our Robinson refinery to meet growing demand with completion expected by year-end 2026. On the Gulf Coast, we are constructing a distillate hydrotreater at our Galveston Bay refinery to produce higher-value ultra-low-sulfur diesel with completion expected by year-end 2027. In addition to these multiyear projects, we are executing smaller, high-return, quick hit projects targeted at enhancing refinery yields, improving energy efficiency and lowering our cost leveraging our fully integrated refining system and geographic diversification across the Gulf Coast, Mid-Con and West Coast regions, we are well positioned to deliver peer-leading through-cycle cash generation. In our Midstream business, we've announced over $1 billion of strategic acquisitions since the start of the year. First, within its NGL value chain, MPLX will be acquiring the remaining 55% interest in the BANGL NGL pipeline. Full ownership of BANGL and its expansion opportunities enhance MPLX's Permian platform, as we connect growing NGL production from the wellhead to our recently announced Gulf Coast fractionation facilities. The BANGL transaction is anticipated to close in July, subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions. Second, MPLX expanded its crude oil value chain by acquiring gathering businesses from Whiptail Midstream in March. The San Juan Basin assets in the Four Corners region enhances supply to our refining system. Third, within its natural gas value chain, MPLX has entered into an agreement to double its stake in the Matterhorn Express natural gas pipeline from 5% to 10%. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2025, subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions. These acquisitions are expected to be immediately accretive. We're all well aware of the volatility in the commodity markets. However, based on feedback from our producer customers, we continue to expect year-over-year growth across our Marcellus, Utica and Permian operating regions. These basins have some of the lowest breakeven prices in the U.S., offering economically advantaged development opportunities. We believe MPLX is well positioned and has significant opportunities to support the development plans of its producer customers, especially as demand increases for natural gas-powered electricity. MPLX's financial flexibility places it in an excellent position to continue to significantly grow its distributions, further enhancing the value of its strategic relationship with MPC. Given our highly advantaged refining business and the $2.5 billion annualized distribution from MPLX, we believe we can lead peers in capital returns through all parts of the cycle. Now I'll hand it over to John to discuss our financial performance.
John Quaid: Thanks, Maryann. Moving to first quarter highlights. Slide 4 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported a first quarter net loss of $0.24 per share -- during the quarter, we returned over $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. Slide 5 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from fourth quarter 2024 to first quarter 2025 and the reconciliation between adjusted EBITDA and our net results for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was approximately $2 billion, lower sequentially by $145 million due to decreased results in our Refining and Marketing and renewable diesel segments. In addition to effects from the mix of pretax earnings between our R&M and Midstream businesses, our tax rate was further lowered by discrete tax benefits recognized in the quarter. Moving to our Refining and Marketing. First quarter segment results on Slide 6. Our refineries ran at 89% utilization, processing 2.6 million barrels of crude per day. We completed significant planned turnaround activity in the quarter, particularly in our Gulf Coast region, where utilization decreased from 97% in the fourth quarter of last year to 82% in the first quarter. As compared to fourth quarter of last year, the effects of lower Gulf Coast volumes were partially offset by higher margins in the Mid-Con and the West Coast. R&M segment adjusted EBITDA was $1.91 per barrel for the quarter. Turning to Slide 7. First quarter capture of 104% was driven by solid commercial execution as well as seasonally strong clean product tailwinds. We leverage the scale of our fully integrated system across all three regions to capture margin opportunities across our entire value chain from feedstocks to products. Slide 8 shows our Midstream segment performance for the quarter. Our Midstream segment continues to deliver cash flow growth with an 8% year-over-year increase in quarterly segment adjusted EBITDA. And in the first quarter, MPC received $619 million of distributions from MPLX, a 12.5% increase compared to the $550 million received in the first quarter of 2024. The MPLX remains a source of durable growth as it progresses its mid-single-digit adjusted EBITDA growth strategy. Slide 9 shows our renewable diesel segment performance for the quarter in what was a challenging environment. Our renewable diesel facilities ran at 70% utilization, mainly as a result of unplanned downtime at both facilities. As compared to last year's fourth quarter, the segment's largest headwind was changes in regulatory credits, which reduced margins across the industry. As we look forward, based on the latest guidance, we have already taken actions, we expect will allow us to realize incremental 45Z credits starting at the beginning of the second quarter. And we will continue to pursue value for the 45Z credits we were unable to recognize in the first quarter. That said, we're focused on what we can control. At our Martinez joint venture facility, one of the most competitive renewable diesel operations in the U.S., we are optimizing the renewable refinery to its nameplate capacity, leveraging flexible logistics and pretreatment capabilities to enable a diverse slate and margin. We have addressed the operational items that limited production in the first quarter and following some planned downtime at our Dickinson refinery in April, both our renewable refineries are positioned to run in the second quarter. Slide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the first quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was $1 billion for the quarter, driven by the strength and growth of our midstream business. Working capital was a $1.1 billion use of cash for the quarter, primarily driven by inventory builds mostly in our Gulf Coast region. Crude and product inventory builds related to planned turnarounds here in the first and second quarters as well as product bills related to in-transit export shipments. In the second quarter, we expect some, but maybe not all of this inventory build will reverse as turnarounds are completed and inventory is drawn to normal operating levels. First quarter capital expenditures and investments were $795 million and MPLX completed the acquisition of a gathering business from Whiptail Midstream for $237 million. In the quarter, MPC issued $2 billion in senior notes -- and this issuance was intended to replace the $750 million of senior notes that matured in September of last year as well as refinance the $1.25 billion of senior notes that matured on May 1. MPLX repaid $500 million of maturing debt in February and also issued $2 billion of senior notes. MPLX used a portion of the proceeds to retire $1.2 billion of senior notes scheduled to mature in June. At the end of the quarter, MPC had approximately $3.8 billion in consolidated cash including MPC cash of $1.3 billion and MPLX cash of $2.5 billion. We continue to manage our balance sheet to an investment-grade credit profile. We remain comfortable with our minimum target of about $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet being sufficient to run the business. And this is supported by the $2.5 billion and growing annual distribution from MPLX as well as our undrawn credit facilities of $5 billion, all positioning us to have ample liquidity to endure market fluctuations. Turning to guidance on Slide 11. We provide our second quarter outlook. With major planned turnaround activity behind us, we are ready to run to meet increasing seasonal demand. We're projecting throughput volumes of 2.8 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 94% and Turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $265 million in the second quarter, with activity mainly focused in the Mid-Con and West Coast regions. For the full year, turnaround expenses are expected to be similar to last year at around $1.4 billion. Operating costs are projected to be $5.30 per barrel in the second quarter. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.5 billion. Corporate costs are expected to be $220 million. With that, let me pass it back to Maryann.
Maryann Mannen: Thanks, John. We are unwavering in our commitment to safe and reliable operations, operational excellence, commercial execution and our cost competitiveness yield sustainable structural benefits and position us to deliver peer-leading financial performance in each of the regions in which we operate. To deliver this, we will optimize our portfolio to deliver outperformance now and in the future. We'll leverage our value chain advantages and ensure the competitiveness of our assets while we continue to invest in our people. Our execution of these commitments positions us to deliver the strongest through-cycle cash generation, durable midstream growth is expected to deliver cash flow uplift and to deliver distribution increase going forward, a differentiator from our peers. Investing capital where we believe there are attractive returns will enhance our competitiveness now and for the future. We are committed to leading in capital allocation and will return excess capital through share repurchases. MPC is positioned to create exceptional value through peer-leading performance, execution of our strategic commitments and its compelling value proposition. Let me turn the call back to Kristina.
Kristina Kazarian: Thanks, Maryann. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open the call for questions. Operator, we're ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Neil Mehta: Yes, good morning Maryann and team. A lot to talk about here, but maybe we start on what you're seeing real-time, from a demand perspective as we get into - deeper here in the second quarter. Are you seeing any physical evidence of an economic slowdown, and just maybe give you some real-time color, of what you're seeing in your system here?
Maryann Mannen: Yes, good morning Neil, and thanks for the question. Look, I think we've seen refined cracks improve. You look, we're about $4 better in the second quarter than, we were in the first it's showing the typical seasonal improvement into the second quarter. You've seen our guidance, when we look at overall utilization, 94%, particularly when you look at the Gulf Coast 96%, for us as we get out of our second largest turnaround. And if you will, ready to run in the second quarter. We think we are well positioned to meet this seasonal uptick in demand. And certainly, when you look at the fundamentals, the inventories that I referred to, the five-year average et cetera, and certainly sort of the overall outlook. But I'm going to ask Rick, to give you some specifics as he's looking at our system, and demand to address your question.
Rick Hessling: Yes, Neil, to bolt-on to Maryann's comments. So real-time, we're very optimistic on what we're seeing within the domestic business, we're seeing steady year-over-year demand for gas, and we're seeing growth in diesel and jet fuel. And then additionally, when we look at our exports, Neil, when you go year-on-year, quarter-on-quarter, we're seeing increases in export demand as well. So all the way across our system, we are seeing positive signs, and aren't really seeing a slowdown whatsoever. Closer to home to what Maryann mentioned, on the inventories, I want to double tap on that for a moment, because those signals are really important to us. And a great indication of how the market, is setting up as we head into our summer driving season. So as you know, we did a lot of turnaround work in Q1. We are ready to run in Q2 and with the lower street prices year-on-year, we see this as another strong demand signal that the consumers will have, to continue this demand strength that we're seeing. And lastly, Maryann mentioned the $4 a barrel increase versus Q1. Just a few specifics on that to breakdown for you by region. In the Mid-Con, we're seeing a $6 a barrel increase, of where we stand today versus the Q1 results in the Gulf Coast, a $3 a barrel increase and in the West Coast, a $5 a barrel increase. So strength across the system, Neil.
Neil Mehta: Yes. Okay. You see in the margins for now. And so, it's definitely notable in some of the hard data here. So okay, then the follow-up is just on the West Coast specifically. We've seen a lot of developments here, most notably Benicia, but how are you guys thinking about the multiyear outlook for the West Coast? How do you position yourself? And do you think that the political environment, is such that if you go into a period of strong margins, you'll be able to capitalize that?
Maryann Mannen: Yes. Thanks, Neil. Maybe a few things around the West Coast and our view sort of longer term. First, as you know, we've been investing - I mentioned it on some of my prepared remarks there. We've been investing in our L.A. asset. We believe it's flexibility, the integrated nature of that asset its ability to process different types of crudes, et cetera, gives us a long-term competitive advantage. In the case of this capital that we're putting to work, gives us efficiency improves performance, EBITDA, while at the same time, we are complying with regulatory requirements around NOx emissions. So overall, we think that's been a good investment. Just when we think about demand in the West Coast, right, 28 million conventional fueled vehicles, as I like to say in the state, a lot of that demand is centered in the Los Angeles region, so it speaks well for our asset also. And then you speak about the regulatory environment. We've spent a lot of time, as you know, you can go back really to 2018, 2019, frankly, as we began our assessment of our profitability and the competitive nature of our assets in that region, when we made the decision, frankly, to close Martinez, as a fossil fuel refinery, albeit right continued as a renewable diesel. We're watching the regulatory environment very closely, right? We've got minimum inventory law went into place in the beginning of the year, but frankly, the rulemaking isn't done. I think right now, the state and the officials there are focused on resupply as maintenance and turnaround activity happens to ensure that we can provide, - they can provide requirements for consumers there. There's also been conversation, around whether or not the state would own, or operate refineries. We certainly don't think that, that's plausible, but we'll watch it closely. And last, what I would say is, we are spending time with the regulatory agencies through our Washington office, et cetera, to ensure that there is an understanding of sort of the longer-term view and the decisions that, they are trying to make there. So we're comfortable as we sit here today, recognizing that a challenging environment. We think, we've got one of the most competitive assets in the region. And hopefully, I've done a reasonably good job of telling you, why that's the case. I'm going to ask Rick, to give you a little bit of color, on what we're seeing maybe long-term with demand there.
Rick Hessling: Yes. So Neil, we continue to see pretty positive signals also on the West Coast. But I want to maybe take a step back, and give some color to our positioning as well to add on to Maryann's comments. So we have the largest refinery in California. It is complex. It is fully integrated and we will beat the, what we call high cost alternative of imports into the region all day long. With that being said, the closures that, we have seen certainly are a tailwind to our - not only our LAR facility, but also to our Pacific Northwest facilities. So if you look, they will also be the beneficiary of product placement. And as the West Coast is structurally short gasoline and jet. So we will be leaning into these markets as others close. And lastly, I want to leave you with a nugget that not a lot of people talk about, It's on the feedstock side, if these closures happen that have been announced, Neil, we will be the beneficiary as well. We have a large TMX position, taking advantage barrels from Canada. But above and beyond that, we're a big AMS and a big SJV buyer and we will be the beneficiary of those closures that if they happen, that will put incremental pressure on those differentials, and we have a large appetite for those grades. So I'll leave it there, Neil.
Neil Mehta: Great color. Thanks, team.
Rick Hessling: Thank you.
Maryann Mannen: Thank you, Neil.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Douglas Leggate: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Maryann, I want to come back to a topic that I feel like we used to bring it up, relatively frequently and then it kind of fell into the background a little bit. And it's the issue of capture rates - you had one of the heaviest turnaround seasons in, I guess, in your history this quarter, yet your capture rate kind of knocked it out of the park. And I know this is related to the commercial organization that, you built up over the last several years. And I'm just wondering, as you get back into normal utilization rates into the, when you don't have a lot of downtime, should we be thinking that your capture rate has shifted up as a matter of course? Or I'm just curious how you would respond to that comment?
Maryann Mannen: Good morning, Doug, and thanks for your question. So as you know, one of the things that we've been really leaning in for some time, is our ability to improve our commercial performance. We think it is one of the most important elements, when we think about our value proposition, and our peer-leading performance, and over the last few years, as you said, we've been building what we think are sustainable benefits across the system. Organization-wise, other capabilities we've talked about are London office, our Singapore office, our Houston office in addition to our Finley office as well. So some of these capabilities will transcend. We've also said that approaching 100%, is clearly an objective of ours. And we think some of the sustainable advantages that, we've really put in place are being demonstrated, through our financial performance. And as some of these things, regardless of whether it's a high crack environment, or a low crack environment may not be in our control, but the ones that are that what we are trying to focus on quarter after quarter. We think, right, looking at our fully integrated system, and trying to leverage those capabilities. You hear us talk about value chain integration, the strategic importance of the relationship between MPC and MPLX. We believe all of these, will continue to deliver capture rates approaching 100%. And I'll look at Rick, and see if there was anything else that Rick wanted to add, particularly as we think about what happened in the quarter?
Rick Hessling: Yes. Thank you, Maryann. Doug, I have to chuckle for a moment. I'm guessing Maryann thinks I paid you to ask that question, because we are quite proud of our results, not only has it been this quarter, but I think you've seen it the last several quarters. And I do want to reiterate that, it is structurally sustainable. We believe we built the system and have the value chain, to continue to garner more value than our competition. In three areas of particularly strong performance that, I want to highlight in our specific teams, specialty products, asphalt and product margins - and sometimes we mention product margins, and they're specific to a region. This past quarter, I would tell you, it's all three regions. It's Gulf Coast, Mid-Con and West Coast. So very proud of the team's performance, and bringing value out of the entire value chain, as Maryann referenced.
Douglas Leggate: Okay. Well, I was thinking the 100% might now be a little conservative, but we'll see, we'll see where we go.
Rick Hessling: Please don't do that to me, but we're confident in our ability to outperform in this area, Doug.
Douglas Leggate: Good stuff. Thanks for the answer. Maryann, a completely unrelated question. Again, it's something has come up periodically. You've talked about - you want to hold $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet, but you did admittedly have some working capital moves, and you lend it into the balance sheet this quarter, it seems for share buybacks. What is the net debt level at the MPC level again, the net debt MPC level that you're comfortable with, as opposed to the cash level at the MPC level?
Maryann Mannen: Yes. Thanks for the question, Doug. Maybe just a couple of other comments as well before I get to your specific answer. But one of the things that we think is important, as we try to lean in with respect to our capital allocation priorities, and they haven't changed. You talked about the $1 billion. As you know, from quarter-to-quarter, some of those things just depending on commodity prices, et cetera, that will ebb and flow. But the $1 billion continues to be something that we have stress tested and remain comfortable in part, because we had a realized situation many years ago called COVID that helped us understand that. The second part of that, as you know, and I think you've been asking me this question for a couple of quarters now, right, if not longer than that. The distribution that MPC received from MPLX at $2.5 billion today. Covers the MPC dividend, to its shareholders as well as the 2025 capital plan that MPC has announced. And hopefully, you can see that we are supporting that mid-single-digit growth in MPLX and the distribution increase of 12.5%, which means the cash coming back to MPC, should continue to increase as that growth in MPLX happens. These are all factors that give us confidence when we talk about $1 billion on the balance sheet, that, that continues to be, if you will, a durable basis. I'm going to pass it to John, and he can talk a bit about the debt, to specifically answer that question, Doug.
John Quaid: Yes. Hi, morning Doug, thanks for the question. So maybe, again, to take it back, as you know, we'd like to kind of think about the two balance sheets a little bit separately. So if I think about MPC standalone, I'll come back to MPLX in the midstream business. Look, we've said absolute gross debt, we're comfortable in and around plus, or minus $7 billion, right? So $7 billion in absolute debt, $1 billion of minimum cash target. Again, I commented and Maryann did why we continue to be really, really comfortable with that, and comfortable with our investment grade profile. And MPLX is a little interesting, right? Their debt has stayed relatively flat, but we've really grown the EBITDA, four-year CAGRs of 7%, so leverage has really come down. And there, we look at kind of a gross debt to EBITDA. And we're sitting at the end of this quarter at about 3.3 times, and we've said, look, given that business, the durability and stable cash flow it generates, we're comfortable up to four. So we see a lot of capacity there, as MPLX looks at its growth opportunities to leverage that balance sheet. Again, on the MPC side, absolute debt, about $7 billion. As I think you know, there, we talk again about a gross debt-to-cap ratio. And I think, we've got some of that in our materials as well, what you would typically see more with an investment-grade approach. It's a little bit interesting there, because if we did something like we did this quarter, where we're leaning into buybacks and maybe a lower profitability market, you're going to impact that ratio. But over time, we're really comfortable with that $7 billion. So hopefully, that helps, Doug.
Douglas Leggate: It does. Thanks very much indeed, guys.
Maryann Mannen: You're welcome Doug. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Gupta with UBS. Your line is open.
Manav Gupta: Good morning. Congrats on a strong quarter. I wanted to ask you about the crude quality discounts, looks like OPEC would be raising volumes faster than most of us expected. So help us understand your near to medium-term outlook for crude quality discounts, and how MPC can benefit from it?
Rick Hessling: Yes, hi Manav, this is Rick. Good to hear from you. I will say this is very positive for us, given the amount of heavy crude we run in all three regions, West Coast, Gulf Coast and Mid-Con. So we are arguably the largest heavy refiner in the country, and so we will benefit significantly. And as we see the acceleration of OPEC volume, with the recent announcement this week, and certainly as a tailwind for the light heavy spreads. Additionally, though, I'd like to give you some color on Canadian, because Canadian has recently been depressed, but we see upside there Manav as well. When you look at not only the OPEC announcement of accelerating their barrels into the market, but as you look forward on their forward curve, and I don't even think the OPEC piece is baked in yet. In the fourth quarter, Manav, we're seeing $3 to $4 a barrel discount, greater than what we see today. So certainly, that's a benefit to us as we run a lot of heavy Canadian, as you know. I hope that helps, Manav.
Manav Gupta: Perfect. I actually also wanted to follow-up a little bit on the midstream side, 7% year-on-year growth on the MPLX side. But when we look at year-to-date, almost $1 billion of acquisitions some of, which have not even closed, right? And so if you think about it, how should we look at the distributions from MPLX growing over a period of time given you already had an attractive lineup of project growth at frac1, frac2. And now you're adding $1 billion of additional assets. So can we think about that 12.5% growth product distribution could be sustainable for the next, like, three to four years. And then you're already covering your CapEx and dividend through that distribution. So does buybacks can also be supported through that distribution? If you could talk about that? Thank you.
Maryann Mannen: Manav, thank you and good morning, I appreciate your question. So first of all, when you look at the MPLX, the midstream business, we talk about a compound annual growth rate, both on EBITDA and DCF in and about 7% for four years. We think, as you have heard us talk about as well, that we have projects and opportunities to be able to continue that mid-single digit growth, albeit I say it might not be perfectly linear as we move out. The point of that 12.5% distribution increase last year, was to say when you look at the growth opportunities, when you look at these mid-teen returns projects, using that strict capital discipline lens, we felt very good about suggesting that, that 12.5% was clearly doable for the next few years, to your point, because of the durability of those earnings and the opportunities that we see. This quarter, we put about $1 billion to work you are absolutely correct. Some of that has not closed yet. BANGL gives us - will give us 100% ownership, very critical when we think about the ability, to support our producer customers important to the integration of our wellhead-to-water strategy. Second, we talked about Whiptail. It's a gathering - it's natural gas, crude oil and water gathering system. We talk a lot about the value chain importance and the strategic relationship, between MPC and MPLX. It's in the four corners, critically important on the opportunity for our El Paso refinery. So two examples, as you say, plus, as we talked about $1.7 billion of capital in MPLX that is growth-oriented, of which 85% was natural gas and NGL focused, secretariat at seventh large - sorry, seven processing plant in the Permian. Bringing our processing capability, when it comes online at the end of the year to about 1.4 Bcf. So really making the connections in the integrated value chains. So we believe that 12.5% is durable for multi-years, as we bring it back to MPC to your point, we are already covering the MPC dividend, and as you know, we are continuing to lean in delivering right excess cash via buyback on the MPC side. And then we are still covering the cost, or excuse me, the capital cost with that distribution. So certainly, as it grows, it will continue to give us even greater flexibility on the MPC side of the house. I hope that addressed your question, Manav.
Manav Gupta: Thank you so much.
Maryann Mannen: You are welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is open.
Paul Cheng: Hi guys, how are you doing?
Maryann Mannen: Good morning Paul. We're well, how are you?
Paul Cheng: Very good. Good morning. Maryann, just want to ask that. It seems like you and a lot of your peers, everyone is looking at the NGL value chain, and have a lot of opportunity, and so that seems a very consensus for you, and everyone is pursuing a wellhead-to-water strategy. So can you try to help us understand that how your strategy may be different than your peers? And there's also in the commodity business, there's always some fear. If everyone is pursuing the same strategy and everyone sees that is such a great thing. It turned out that the result may not be as good as everyone hope. So maybe that you can help us that to better say, understand that what is the risk in terms of everyone is doing this?
Maryann Mannen: Certainly, Paul. Thanks for the question. So we think - and we've talked about our wellhead-to-water strategy, our completion two fracs in the export terminal 2028 and 2029. We are very confident in our ability to fill these two fracs. As I mentioned just earlier, we've got the seventh processing plant in the Permian that's going to be complete. That will give us $1.4 million and frankly, our current customer commitments really support this project. Also keep in mind today, we, meaning as we're thinking about this fractionation, we are using third-party fracs, which we will not need to use in the future. We think it has a very solid cost position, as we shared with you the total cost of the project. We think when we look at both C3 and ethane, ethane will be a domestic sale, but we know the strength of C3 when we look at its requirements in Asia, Japan, et cetera. So we think that export market will be there. And we think we're very good at executing projects. And certainly, our commercial process will give us the ability to market that in the future. They would be a few other things, Paul, that I would tell you will differentiate this project from our peers. As I mentioned, we're not looking - we're not done. We are really trying to adapt as these markets are changing, and completing these value chains, particularly when we're looking at that wellhead-to-water strategy. I hope that addresses your question, Paul.
Paul Cheng: Okay. Great. The second question is on the renewable diesel business. I mean it does look like that the RIN price is going higher, and hopefully, the LCFS price will get will - the amendment will go through and then we will see them higher later this year, or next year. But in addition to the market condition, I mean, what else are you doing internally trying to improve the profitability of that business? I was little bit surprised that we have said trend downtime in the first quarter after, or I mean that we have the fire and subsequently that you guys said we build the unit, or that repair the unit. So can you help us understand that? I mean what is the root cause of the outages in the first quarter? And more importantly than what are the initiatives that you are doing, to help to improve the operation and reliability of that business?
John Quaid: Hi, morning, Paul, it's John. I'll start here. And if we have any other questions, I'll look to some of my peers as well. So - and some of this I tried to have in our prepared remarks as well. As you noted, there's a portion of this business that's supported by regulations, whether it's RINs, LCF, et cetera. But we're really focused on the things that we can control. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we did have some opportunities here in the first quarter to address utilization. I will tell you - again, we're taking a turnaround, some doing some work at Dickinson, it's ready to run. And quarter-to-date, Martinez is running as we expect it to be. So without getting into details of what those things are, I think it's maybe more important to tell you the plant, the plant is running as we expect. And that's then what we're focused on. If we take our Martinez position really looking with our partner to optimize the feedstock into the facility, really leverage that pretreat, which is a competitive advantage for the facility and obviously where it's located in California, the key markets. So those are the things we're really focused on. As you note, as now we get to kind of hit the ground running, and really run that plant and see what we can do. So those are the big things that we can control. Again, we'll continue to work with government affairs, et cetera, for the respective agencies to understand the impact of their decisions. And I guess I wanted to maybe add to, Paul, you didn't ask it, but you might. Obviously, there's a lot of change in the industry going from the blenders tax credit to the production tax credit. We, like others, we're reacting to guidance that came out during the quarter. As I mentioned, we had very limited recognition in the first quarter, but we've already taken action that's going to drive that. And let me be clear, too, we're also going to continue to push on the regulations, et cetera, to get back to value we weren't able to recognize in Q1 as well. So that's another action we're taking. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of the play of the land.
Paul Cheng: John, can you tell us that what is the average duration before you have to change your catalyst at Martinez?
John Quaid: Yes. That might be a detailed question, Paul that we'll work with the team with you off-line.
Paul Cheng: Okay, we do. Thank you.
John Quaid: Thank you.
Maryann Mannen: Thank you, Paul.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Your line is open.
Theresa Chen: Morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I'd like to double-click on the West Coast outlook one more time. Just on the profitability and the idea that the supply of California spec products coming from Asia, by means of a regular weight production of CARBOB in Asia versus opportunistic and the regularity of and cadence of imports on an ongoing basis, even if in-state facilities can produce cheaper, do you think the regularity of imports will cap benchmark cracks over time?
Rick Hessling: Hi Theresa, this is Rick. So generally, I would say we're tracking imports as everyone else is very closely. What imports are doing is creating a lot of volatility. And what I mean by that is, when imports come in, they do have an impact on the marketplace. But when that inventory is run through, we then see a spike within the marketplace. So it's somewhat of a feast or famine, because to bring imports in is challenging, because you have a 40-plus day transit time. So it's a big bet on where the market will be by the time they get into the West Coast system. So we continue to see imports, just wreaking a lot of havoc on volatility within the industry, and continue to see our advantage really overplaying any imports that would be sustainable, because we don't believe they're going to be consistently sustainable long-term month in, month out. And that's what you've seen here as of recent.
Theresa Chen: Understood. And on the midstream side, with what seems to be an increasingly visible near to medium-term slowdown in associated gas growth from liquids plays? And relatively unchanged long-term natural gas demand outlook. What is your view on pursuing infrastructure growth opportunities in dry gas production areas, and further diversify the growth opportunity set within your footprint?
Maryann Mannen: Yes, Theresa, it's Maryann. I appreciate the question. If you go back and you look at the things that we have been focused on last year, we did the Utica transaction Summit, we think that made sense for a lot of reasons and continues to - one of the opportunities that we were looking for, was increasing utilization, frankly. We put a lot of capital to work in the Utica a few years ago. And as we watch that dry to liquids move change. So we'll continue to evaluate that. But as you've seen from the things that we are looking at right now, you see where the majority of our priorities are focused. But again, we'll look for those through our lens, of how do we deliver mid-single-digit growth consistently, ensure that we got mid-teens returns through that, that support the 12.5% distribution. So we'll continue to evaluate.
Theresa Chen: Thank you.
Maryann Mannen: You are welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Royall with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
John Royall: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So my first question is a follow-up on the L.A. refinery project. I know you had it as a year-end start-up, and it sounded like from Maryann's comments in the opener that that project is getting, maybe close to completion. So any more granular target on the start-up timing would be helpful. And then it seems like the project is more geared towards reliability, and costs as well as compliance. So should we think of the 20% IRR target, is not being highly exposed to the commodity and margin environment, therefore, maybe somewhat lower risk than your other two big projects?
Maryann Mannen: Yes. Thanks for the question, John. Yes, we're looking at - you're right. We remain committed to that project, and expect it to be complete, I'd say closer to the end of the third, early fourth quarter. The 20% return is not subject to commodity price. One of the things that we tried to do with this project, you may remember a while ago, there was a NOx reduction emission requirement. I think it's Rule 1109 to be specific, which did - which no longer allowed paper credits, it had to be absolute. So given what we believe to be one of the most competitive assets in the region, we said we would work to ensure that we had compliance. Then once we made that decision, we looked at how else we could optimize. So there were other changes that add efficiency and reduce overall cost. That's what's driving the 20%, certainly not commodity price driven.
John Royall: Great. Thank you. And then we're at the end of the call, so maybe I can sneak in a little bit more of a housekeeping question, and happy to take it off-line if it's too detailed. But we noticed a big step-up in interest expense in 1Q and obviously, there was some net issuance of debt at both the parent and the MPLX level. Is there anything one-time in that line this quarter? Or should we think about that as kind of a similar level going forward?
John Quaid: Yes, probably similar. Hi, morning, John, it's John Quaid. Sorry, I jumped right in. Probably the biggest thing, if you're looking at that over time would be, whereas our cash balance has moved lower, you're seeing a little bit less of an offset from an interest income standpoint. You can see those details when we file our 10-Q later today. But outside of that, no one-time items here in the quarter.
John Royall: Thank you.
Maryann Mannen: You're welcome, John. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Blair with TPH. Your line is open.
Matthew Blair: Thank you and good morning. I have two questions on the R&D side. One, are you still finding an economic to run vegetable oil-based feeds? Or have you shifted entirely to low CI feeds? And then two, do you think that your R&D segment is on track for an EBITDA positive quarter in Q2, as you were of some of the challenges from Q1. It sounded like the feedstocks weren't quite optimized, and you didn't capture all the 45Z. So putting that behind you is already on track to be EBITDA positive in Q2?
John Quaid: Matt, it's John. Let me try and take that maybe at a higher level. As I said, we're focused on the things we can control. What gets interesting with the feedstocks. Again, a lot of effects from 45Z kind of saying that [imported code] doesn't qualify. So that's affected some of the domestic feedstocks, and we've got teams that, as you would expect, are every day optimizing the best feedstocks we can push through that facility in Martinez and leverage its pretreatment unit. Look, it's a regulatory supported business. So I'm not going to go out on a limb, and talk about profitability for Q2. We're going to focus on the things we can control. And that's going to be driving the operational performance of the unit, getting the right slate through the pretreat, and through the facility and meeting the demands of our customers. Maryann, I don't know if you want to….
Maryann Mannen: Yes, Matt, thanks. And I think John has done a nice job of giving you some color there. A few things that I would also comment on, remember that our decision to have a JV with Neste gives us the level of competitiveness, we think now that the PTU unit is up and running, as of the end of 2024. Remember, the requirements with Neste was their ability to bring advantaged feedstock. We certainly have that advantage as well. So different sources, optimizing now around the PT unit. And as you've heard us say, we continue to believe we are the most competitive relative, right, notwithstanding what the regulatory environment is going to do and will ensure that we have cost efficiency in that asset, as we do in all of our assets. It is certainly one of our core principles when we think about operational performance and commercial excellence there will continue to optimize, as John said. But it is something that we think is an opportunity for us now that the PTU is operating.
Matthew Blair: Sounds good. Thanks for your comments. And I guess speaking of the regulatory picture, do you have any views on the upcoming RVO? It sounds like there might be a good chance that the category gets moved up quite a bit. Would you expect the sixes to decouple from DFS? And then finally, regarding the new California LCFS target, do you think they'll be implemented in 2025? Or are we looking more like a 2026 start-up date for that? Thank you.
Maryann Mannen: Hi Matt, thank you. Thanks for your question. I'm going to ask Jim to provide as much color as we possibly can to many of your questions. As you know, the regulatory environment, ebbing and flowing there. And some of those things, we just don't have control over. We can certainly give you our views. But let me pass it to Jim, and he'll provide some of the color that he can on where the specifics are.
James Wilkins: Hi Matt, still a lot of uncertainties on the LCFS time line, but we anticipate CARB will issue that revised package to the Office of Administrative law by the end of May. That will allow the office administrator law to make their final decision, by the end of June. So there will be a lot more clarity by the end of June. CARB has been pretty quiet in the public regarding the effective date if the administrative law approves the package. It could be anywhere from the beginning of the second quarter, or push all the way into 2026, as you suggest, they just have not been open about that.
Maryann Mannen: Hope that's somewhat helpful and responsive there, Matt.
Matthew Blair: Great. Thank you.
Maryann Mannen: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen. Your line is open.
Jason Gabelman: Yes. Hi, morning. Thanks for squeezing me into the call. I wanted to go back to the $7 billion debt target that you mentioned. And I guess it's kind of two parts. Given decline in prices, I think you could see another working capital having in the quarter. I know you suggested some of the 1Q working capital will unwind. But given that and potential for some volatility in the stock, given the macro environment, how willing are you, if at all, to go above the $7 billion debt target either to absorb working capital volatility and/or support buybacks if the stock gets further dislocated?
John Quaid: Hi Jason, it's John. Thanks for the question. I'll start and see if there's some other comments as well. Let me take the tail end of that. And I think I'll circle back to some of Maryann's comments. We we're focused on driving our performance and driving our cash flow, and having that then drive our capital return, right? So we're in a nice position with midstream business, MPLX, growing that business. That cash flow covering our capital, covering our dividend up at the MPC side. So if we're performing, we're running our assets safely and reliably. We're getting all the value and then some that the market is providing. That's the cash we're going to look to use, to return capital and do purchase not really looking to increase debt to do repurchases. That's not on my radar right now. Again, we'll manage the business with our revolvers, et cetera, as working capital moves. That's what those are for, but really, really comfortable with that $7 billion of debt long-term.
Jason Gabelman: Great. My follow-up is just on midstream growth again. I know we've touched it quite a bit on the call. But I'm wondering if you could characterize the appetite to do larger deals as the market weakens here, you seem pretty bullish on the midstream growth outlook you've done small deals that are enhancing the earnings growth of that business. So do you feel like it's more favorable to continue to do those smaller deals? Or would you be open to a larger deal if the right one came across? Thanks.
Maryann Mannen: Yes. Thanks, Jason. And I appreciate your comments on midstream growth. I would say, as we continue to look at those opportunities, we're going to do it through the lens of strict capital discipline. We want to ensure that they have the ability to deliver mid-teens returns that they are supportive of our mid-single-digit growth objective, and we certainly have the ability to execute. We hopefully have demonstrated to you over the last several quarters, our ability to lean in both organically and inorganically. To drive the wellhead-to-water strategy. I mentioned earlier the strength in the Utica, and what we tried to do there. We just announced a smaller one gathering crude oil, water and net gas. So hopefully, we've demonstrated to you the opportunities that we see and the ability to support it. But they will be through that strict capital discipline lens regardless of their size, Jason.
Jason Gabelman: Okay. Great. Thanks for the answers.
Maryann Mannen: You're welcome. Thank you
Kristina Kazarian: All right. If there are no further questions, thank you for your interest in Marathon. Should you have additional questions, or want clarifications on topics discussed this morning, please contact us, and our team will be available to help with your call. Thank you for joining us today.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-04 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MPC Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. My name is Amanda and I will be your operator for today’s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.
Kristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's fourth quarter 2024 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Maryann Mannen, CEO; John Quaid, CFO and other members of the MPC and MPLX executive team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ. Factors that cause actual results to differ are there as well as in our filings with the SEC. I wanted to quickly highlight our new segment reporting, which includes a renewable diesel segment. We believe this expanded level of reporting will enhance our comparability with our peers and provide you with more insight into our financial performance and capital allocation decisions. Previously, the results of the renewable diesel business were included in our refining and marketing segment. For your reference, slides 24 and 25 provide illustrations of this reporting change. And we have provided recast historical financials in our investor packet available on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Maryann.
Maryann Mannen: Thanks, Kristina, and good morning. Let me take a moment to highlight a few elements of our performance that were most relevant to our results. In 2024, we executed on our strategic commitments. First and foremost, we achieved our lowest company-wide OSHA recordable injury rate and strongest environmental performance in the last five years, demonstrating our commitment to safety and reliability. Over the full year, we delivered refining and marketing segment with adjusted EBITDA per barrel of $5.33. Our commitment to operational excellence, commercial performance, and peer-leading profitability per barrel in each of the regions in which we operate drove our strong results, with refining utilization of 92% and commercial capture of 99%. Our midstream segment, which is where we report MPLX's results, grew adjusted EBITDA by 6% year-over-year. In 2024, MPLX increased its quarterly distribution by 12.5%, driving an annualized cash distribution to MPC of $2.5 billion. This was the third consecutive year of distribution growth of 10% or greater. This was the fourth consecutive year of MPLX generating mid-single-digit adjusted EBITDA growth. Since 2021, we've grown adjusted EBITDA at a compound annual rate of 7%. Our full year net cash from operations was $8.7 billion. This enabled peer-leading capital return of $10.2 billion and a 23% capital return yield for our shareholders in a business where there is significant value in the ability to return capital to shareholders. The global macro environment continues to deliver refined product demand growth, and we expect 2025 will be another year of record refined product demand. In our domestic and export businesses, we have seen steady year-over-year demand for gasoline and diesel and growth in demand for jet fuel. Fourth quarter refining margins exhibited their typical season weakness. We expect margins will improve in the second half of this year as announced refinery closures offset recent capacity additions. Leveraging our fully integrated refining system and geographic diversification across the Gulf Coast, Mid-Con, and West Coast regions, we are well-positioned to perform in this dynamic market environment. Longer term, we believe fundamentals support an enhanced mid-cycle environment for refining as we expect demand growth to exceed the net impact of capacity additions and rationalizations through the end of the decade. We expect the U.S. refining industry to remain structurally advantaged over the rest of the world, mainly due to the availability of low-cost energy. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely and reliably operate our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees, business partners, and the community in which we operate. Our high-complexity refining assets and our domestic and international logistical and commercial capabilities further increase our global competitive advantage. We are committed to achieving peer-leading profitability in every region in which we operate. And over the past several years, we have acted to advance on this commitment. We have made sustained structural changes to improve our cost competitiveness while maintaining safe and reliable operations. Throughout our commercial organization, we are improving value chain optimization with a more integrated and advanced approach to our execution. We made disciplined investments in our refining and marketing value chains targeted to enhance margins, reduce cost, and optimize systems. Across all three of our regions, we see the results of these actions. Along the U.S. Gulf Coast, where 42% of our capacity exists, we have more than 1.2 million barrels per day of refining capacity, which leverage feedstocks and logistics flexibility to provide a wide range of products to meet U.S. and export demand. 40% of our capacity is defined as our U.S. Mid-Con region. We have eight refineries with a total capacity of 1.2 million barrels per day, which capture market opportunities by leveraging our access to advantage feedstocks, logistics, and optimization of our large integrated value chain in the region. The remaining 18% of our capacity resides along the U.S. West Coast, anchored by our 365,000-barrel-per-day Los Angeles refinery and its fully integrated value chain, which benefits from feedstock and product optionality and a highly competitive marketing business. Our commitment to safe and reliable operations, operational excellence, and commercial performance position us to deliver peer-leading financial performance irrespective of the market environment. Our disciplined capital investments have also strengthened our competitiveness in each of the regions in which we operate. Looking into 2025, we believe our planned capital investments will further enhance MPC's position well into the future. MPC's capital outlook for 2025, excluding MPLX, totals $1.25 billion. Underpinning our commitment to safety performance and environmental stewardship, sustaining capital is approximately 30% to capital spend. Investments in our refining and marketing segment are focused on value-enhancing and cost-reduction opportunities with expected returns averaging around 30%. Renewable diesel capital spend in 2025 is limited and will be focused on sustaining current operations. I'll provide some details on three of our major multi-year projects that meet our criteria for investments. We are progressing the distillate hydrotreater project at Galveston Bay, where we are investing to construct a 90,000-barrel-per-day high-pressure distillate hydrotreater. Once in service, the new distillate hydrotreater will upgrade high sulfur distillate to ultra-low sulfur diesel, allowing us to place product in this higher-value market. This project is expected to be completed by year-end 2027 and generate a return of over 20%. The Los Angeles Refinery is a core asset in our West Coast value chain and one of the most competitive refineries in the region. This low-carbon refining investment, once completed, is expected to further enhance its competitiveness by integrating and modernizing utility systems to improve reliability and increase energy efficiency. Additionally, a portion of the improvements address a regulation mandating emissions reductions for all Southern California refineries. The improvements are expected to be completed by the end of this year. We expect to generate a return on our investments of approximately 20%. The Robinson Product Flexibility Project is expected to further extend the competitive position of our Mid-Con value chain by shifting yields to higher-value products. This investment will increase the Robinson Refinery's flexibility to maximize jet production to meet growing demand. We expect the project to be completed by the end of 2026 and generate a return of approximately 25%. The strategic investments at our Galveston Bay, Los Angeles, and Robinson Refineries ensure we provide the clean-burning fuels the world demands and further strengthen the competitive positions of our U.S. Gulf Coast, West Coast, and Mid-Con value chains. This morning, MPLX also announced its 2025 capital outlook of $2 billion, including $1.7 billion of growth capital and $300 million of maintenance capital. Approximately 85% of its growth capital will be allocated to investments to grow MPLX's natural gas and NGL businesses in support of expected increased producer activity. MPLX is investing to expand its Permian to Gulf Coast integrated NGL value chain, progressing long-haul pipeline projects and grow Permian and Marcellus processing capacity. MPLX anticipates mid-teen returns on its growth capital outlook, which will extend the durability of its mid-single-digit growth profile. Over the last four years, on average, we have grown our midstream segment adjusted EBITDA by almost 7% per year. The growth of MPLX's cash flows, combined with its strong distribution coverage and low leverage, provides MPLX considerable financial flexibility. We believe MPLX is positioned for additional distribution increases like the 12.5% announced in 2024 in the future. MPLX reached a significant milestone in its NGL wellhead-to-water value chain strategy with the announcement of a project to construct a Gulf Coast fractionation complex and export terminal. MPLX's fully integrated NGL value chain connects the Permian to the Gulf Coast and will supply growing global demand for LPGs. The multiyear, $2.5 billion investment in the fractionation complex and export terminal complements MPLX's existing asset base and leverages existing infrastructure. MPLX will build and operate the Gulf Coast fractionation complex, consisting of two 150,000 barrel-per-day fractionation facilities and a 400,000 barrel-per-day LPG export terminal, all of which will be located adjacent to MPC's Galveston Bay refinery. MPLX has entered into joint venture agreements with ONEOK for the export terminal and a bidirectional purity pipeline between Mount Bellevue and Texas City. ONEOK will market its 200,000 barrels per day and provide connectivity to Mount Bellevue storage, enhancing the competitiveness of the terminal. We also believe this strategic partnership with ONEOK will create additional optionality and value for our customers. We also see it as a platform for future collaboration and growth across our Gulf Coast assets. MPLX plans to market methane production from the frac to both existing and new customers. Leveraging our strategic relationship with MPLX, MPC plans to contract with MPLX to purchase the remaining LPG production from the frac, which MPC will market globally through its existing market businesses via the new export terminal. The fractionation facilities are expected to be in service in 2028 and 2029, and the export terminal is expected to be in service in early 2028. We anticipate mid-teen returns on the project, which is expected to begin generating EBITDA when placed in service in 2028 and will ramp through the end of 2030. Additionally, we believe the expansion of our Gulf Coast NGL value chain will create a platform for optimization and incremental growth opportunities. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent. Our number-one priority is sustaining capital. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate. We are committed to paying a secure, competitive, and growing dividend. We will invest where we believe there are attractive returns, which will enhance our competitiveness and position MPC well into the future. Beyond these three objectives, we will return all excess capital through share repurchases. As of the end of the year, we had $7.8 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization, highlighting our commitment to superior shareholder returns. The durable and growing cash flow of MPLX differentiates MPC from peers. MPLX is strategic to MPC's portfolio and, therefore, its value proposition. We expect distributions from MPLX in 2025 will cover MPC's dividends and stand-alone capital outlook. Operating cash flow generated by our refining and marketing and renewable diesel segments are expected to be available for capital returns through share repurchases. With our highly advantaged refining business and the $2.5 billion annualized distribution from MPLX, we are positioned to lead peers in capital returns through all market cycles. Let me turn the call over to John.
John Quaid: Thanks, Maryann. Moving to the fourth quarter and full-year highlights, slide 14 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.77 for the fourth quarter and $9.51 for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $2.1 billion for the quarter and $11.3 billion for the year. Refining & marketing segment adjusted EBITDA per barrel was $2.03 for the quarter and $5.33 for the year. Cash flow from operations, excluding working capital changes, was $1.7 billion for the quarter and nearly $8.2 billion for the year. And during the quarter, we returned $292 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchased nearly $1.3 billion of our shares. Slide 15 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from third to fourth quarter 2024 and the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $400 million driven by decreased results in our refining and marketing segment, slightly offset by improved results for our midstream and renewable diesel segments. The tax rate for the quarter was 12%, largely reflecting the earnings mix between our R&M and midstream businesses. Moving to our refining and marketing segment results for the fourth quarter on slide 16, lower crack spreads, mainly in the Mid-Con region, were the primary driver for lower R&M margins in the fourth quarter. Our refineries ran at 94% utilization, processing nearly 2.8 million barrels of crude per day, and refining operating costs were $5.26 per barrel in the fourth quarter. Turning to slide 17, solid commercial execution, as well as typical seasonal tailwinds, drove fourth quarter capture of 119%. We leveraged the scale of our fully integrated system in all three regions to capture margin opportunities across our entire value chain, from feedstocks to products. We are committed to improving our commercial performance and believe we are building capabilities that will provide sustained incremental value and will produce results that can be seen in our financials. Slide 18 shows our midstream segment performance for the quarter. Our midstream segment continues to deliver cash flow growth, as segment adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up nearly 5% sequentially. MPLX, which is the largest portion of our midstream segment, remains a source of durable growth as it progresses its mid-single-digit adjusted EBITDA growth strategy. Slide 19 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was $1.7 billion in the quarter, driven by both our Refining & Midstream businesses. Working capital was a $497 million source of cash for the quarter, primarily driven by benefits from inventory reductions and a decrease in refined product prices. Capital expenditures, investments, and acquisitions were $935 million for the quarter. Cash was utilized to repay $1.15 billion of MPLX senior notes that matured in December. And MPC returned almost $1.3 billion through share repurchases, exclusive of excise tax payments, and $292 million in dividends during the quarter. At the end of the year, MPC had approximately $3.2 billion in consolidated cash, including MPC cash of $1.7 billion and MPLX cash of $1.5 billion. Turning to guidance, on slide 20, we provide our first-quarter outlook. We are projecting crude throughput volumes of just over 2.5 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 85%. Turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $450 million in the first quarter, with activity focused in the Gulf Coast and West Coast regions. For the full year, turnaround expenses are expected to be similar to last year at around $1.4 billion. For the quarter, operating costs are projected to be $5.70 per the barrel. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.5 billion, and corporate costs are expected to be $220 million. With that, let me pass it back to Maryann.
Maryann Mannen: Thanks, John. We are unwavering in our commitment to safe and reliable operations. Operational excellence, commercial execution, and our cost competitiveness yield sustainable structural benefits and position us to deliver peer-leading financial performance in each of the regions in which we operate. To deliver this, we will optimize our portfolio to deliver outperformance now and in the future. We'll leverage our value chain advantages and ensure the competitiveness of our assets while we continue to invest in our people. Our execution of these commitments position us to deliver the strongest through-cycle cash generation. Durable midstream growth is expected to deliver cash flow uplift and expected to deliver distribution increase going forward, a differentiator from our peers. Investing capital where we believe there are attractive returns will enhance our competitiveness now and in the future. We are committed to leading in capital allocation and will return excess capital through share repurchases. MPC is positioned to create exceptional value through peer-leading performance, execution of our strategic commitments, and its compelling value proposition. Let me turn the call back over to Kristina.
Kristina Kazarian: Thanks, Maryann. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we will reprompt for additional questions. We will now open the call to questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Neil Mehta: Yes, thanks, Maryann and team. I guess the first question is just on the refining side. There was a $543 million positive capture impact in the quarter, 119% capture. I'm curious, how much of that was seasonal? Typically, 4Q, you tend to capture well versus commercial. Anything you can do to kind of unpack it, either regionally or in terms of the underlying drivers of that capture beat?
Maryann Mannen: Yes, thanks, Neil. Good morning again. So, look, as you know, and you look back over our last several fourth quarters over the past few years, our fourth quarter tends to be one of the strongest quarters. I think if you look at it over the last several years, we've averaged in a range of about 115, 116. In general, as you know, when we look at capture, there are clearly things that we don't have control over, and then there are the things that we do have control over. As we've been sharing, our objective is to approach 100%. This year, on average, we reached 99 in the Refining & Marketing opportunity there. So clearly some things that we believe have been structural in the work that we've been doing, we've been sharing over the last couple of quarters, and obviously some of those that have just fourth quarter normal activity. But I'm going to pass it to Rick, because I think he's got a few things that he'll give you some specifics on.
Rick Hessling: Yes, hi, Neil. Let me start by saying thank you for calling this out. This is obviously a significant focus for us, and the team executed extremely well in the fourth quarter. So just a couple of nuggets for you. On the export side, Neil, we've been stating quarter after quarter that we're leaning into our export strategy, and the fourth quarter was a great example of that. Our assets ran extremely well across the board, and we were able to lean into our export strategy and set records on volume and margin. So that's a piece of the puzzle, Neil. And then secondly, an area that we don't speak much of is asphalt. But I will say we had great execution on the asphalt front, allowing us to take advantage of improved asphalt spreads and execute our strategies driven by strong asphalt retail sales. So those are just a couple of nuggets, Neil. There's many more, but I'll just leave you with those two.
Neil Mehta: Thank you, Rick. And the follow-up is just on MPLX and the wellhead-to-water strategy. The mid-teens returns that you're targeting on this, can you talk a little bit about some of the underlying assumptions? And is it fair to say that even though capital is coming in a little higher at the midstream side of the business, given the framework that you laid out here, where the buyback is coming from the refining and renewable diesel business, higher MPLX spend won't impact the outlook for your ability to return capital?
Maryann Mannen: Yes, Neil, certainly. Let me try to answer those questions for you. So first and foremost, when we think about this NGL wellhead-to-water strategy, you're right, we do expect mid-teens returns. You may know that, over the last several quarters, we have been talking about the opportunity set, but frankly, we've been looking at this project for a period of time. So, underlying assumptions with respect to overall capital that we need to spend, timing of that, markets that we will serve, costs to get implemented, are all things that we have considered and evaluated to be sure that when we look at this project, that we're confident in these mid-single-digit returns. I think the next project, sorry, question that you asked was really about capital and whether or not the capital that we would be spending in MPLX has implications for MPC. So the answer to that is no. As you know, MPLX has really solid balance sheet flexibility. One, when you look at the debt-to-debt ratio, we've talked about our ability to be kind of in the range plus or minus four times. We're somewhere in a range of three, so we absolutely have balance sheet flexibility there. Really, all of that $2.5 billion multi-year capital in MPLX is largely MPLX. There's a $70 million piece that is MPC. And then the last part of that is, as we continue to grow that MPLX distribution, you've heard me talk about the 12.5% increase. That's a $2.5 billion distribution to MPC. It covers the 2025 MPC dividend and the 2025 capital that we just announced of 1.25, therefore giving MPC the flexibility to return capital via share buyback. So balance sheet flexibility in MPLX will support the growth of those MPLX projects. Hope that gets you.
Neil Mehta: Very clear. Thanks, Maryann.
Maryann Mannen: You are welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Douglas Leggate with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Douglas Leggate: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Maryann. Fantastic result in refining despite breakeven. We actually see that bullish, so well done. My question is, I hate to ask the obvious one, but we've got a 30-day delay now potentially on, I don't know if it's posturing or not, but the tariff situation, you guys are obviously a large consumer of heavy barrels. My question is, what would be your -- how are you planning for the contingency? What would the impact be? I'm thinking specifically about how does your plant adapt to a different diet of crude if you had to? Frame it for us in whatever way you like, but we're obviously all trying to struggle with what it would actually mean if the tariffs were in fact introduced?
Maryann Mannen: Yes, good morning, Doug. Thanks for your question. It's interesting. Studying tariffs has been at the top of the list of things that we've been doing among many others, like running the business, right? So when we think about the impact of tariffs, one, if they were to be imposed or not, still a variable question. We've got a highly integrated system and we've got a lot of optionality and we'll use that optionality. Having said that, as you state, we do process a significant amount of heavy crude and therefore we think it's likely, if tariffs were to be put in place in 30-plus days or not, that we would see cost increases. We believe that the majority of that will ultimately be borne by the producer and then, frankly, to a lesser extent, the consumer. We, MPC, will use our integrated system, our commercial excellence, our operational performance to really minimize the best that we can, the margin impact to our financial results. That's our goal and we'll continue to evaluate. We're working with the administration. We're working with agencies, as well as the trade associations to be sure that the right people understand the implications of these decisions. But with that, let me pass it to Rick and he can give you a little more color on our diet.
Rick Hessling: Yes, Doug, a very timely question as we have run scenario planning for every facility and market that we have coast-to-coast. So we're well-versed in this, as you might expect. And Maryann hit it well when she touched on our integrated system, our knowledge, our commercial performance. We believe we're in as good or better shape than anyone in the industry to absorb a tariff if it were to ever get put into place. And maybe a good example of that that I would want to unpack for you is in the Mid-Con, we have worked tirelessly for a long time on our logistics capability and connectivity. So many of our refineries in our Mid-Con region, we could look to pivot to alternative crudes because of our logistics capabilities and we're quite unique that way and I would give you crudes to think of such as Bakken, Rockies, Utica, Marcellus as a few. So I want to leave you with every region's different, every refinery is different, but we believe that we have done the scenario planning to make this as least painful as possible and, in fact, we believe at the end of the day in most regions, if not all, that we operate in, we'll have a competitive advantage against others who are running significant amounts of Canadian grades.
Douglas Leggate: Rick, I appreciate a detailed answer from both of you. I wonder if I could just do a quick part B on that. If you did displace heavy with a Bakken or similar crude, would that require utilization reduction?
Rick Hessling: It may shift yields more than anything, Doug, and it could potentially impact utilization. However, I would lean you, maybe ask you to, as you look at yesterday as it played out, the market was quickly sending signals that it would quickly respond and absorb a lot of the indicators that would continue to make potentially a heavy barrel economic to run. As Maryann said, we do believe the producer will bear a large part of the impact. So I would say a light switch within our system we believe would have minimal impact.
Douglas Leggate: Thank you. Maryann, I've got a very quick follow-up, which is, I wanted to pick on one of your comments at the end of your prepared remarks. We will optimize our portfolio. I wonder if you could care to elaborate on what that means? I'll leave it there. Thank you.
Maryann Mannen: Yes, certainly, Doug. You know, for the last several years, one of our strategic pillars is to ensure the competitiveness of all of our assets. That has been in place historically and will continue to be in place. We need to be sure that every one of our assets is delivering the cash flow that we expect and is part of our long-term scenario for how we will operate in the future. So we'll continue to look at that all the time.
Douglas Leggate: Thank you so much, guys.
Maryann Mannen: You're welcome, Doug. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Gupta with UBS. Your line is open.
Manav Gupta: Hey, Maryann. I wanted to congratulate you. I think when you took over the CEO, one of your key goals was that to fully fund the dividend and CapEx at MPC through MPLX. And our model got you there, but we got you there more in '26 and '27. We didn't have you getting there in 2025. So congratulations on that. My question here is we think about MPCs buybacks as funded by RD and refining with MPLX funding the dividend and CapEx, but the projects that you announce today could put you on a distribution growth path of 12% for four or five years. So starting 2026, is it possible that MPLX distribution is not only funding the CapEx, the dividend, but also possible buybacks at MPC?
Maryann Mannen: Thank you, Manav. So, we have been trying to demonstrate that our cash flows being generated at MPLX are durable and that we can put together capital as well as small M&A bolt-on that can support mid-single-digit growth for a period of time. And hopefully today the announcement of our NGL strategy wellhead-to-water value chain is yet another example of that in addition to some of the investments that we made in 2024. Expansion of BANGL as an example, our summit acquisition in the Utica and Wing to Webster. That 12.5 distribution increase that we announced in November of 2024, we also said we thought had the ability to be sustaining in similar nature for the next several years. So as we continue to grow, we certainly believe that distribution coming back to MPC gives us flexibility for peer-leading capital allocation. We think it's a differentiator, and certainly we believe that that growing distribution to MPC will allow us to increase our share repurchase in the future.
Manav Gupta: Perfect. My quick follow-up is a little bit on the West Coast. Another refinery is probably going to go down at the year-end. There are some reports of an unplanned refinery downtime also in the first half now. So just trying to understand from your perspective the dynamics on the West Coast, understanding that the regulatory environment may not be the best, but from the perspective of supply and demand, the region might still work for you?
Maryann Mannen: Yes, actually I think you said it well. As you know, we have made some commitments in investments. I talked about one of them here on the call this morning for our Los Angeles asset. One, we think it is a really efficiency capital investment. We also think, obviously, it meets the required NOx reduction emission requirements going forward and gives us incremental efficiency and profitability, particularly in a low-carbon environment. Certainly, we understand the challenges of doing business in this environment. You know this well. I mean, we have evaluated our ability to participate in this region for many, many years, hence the decision that we made back in 2020 to close Martinez as a fossil fuel refinery and then in early in '21, the decision to convert it to renewable diesel. We're working closely with the agencies in the state to ensure that we understand, and in similar fashion as I mentioned earlier, through our trade associations, also really trying to understand and frankly influence via help so that those making the regulatory decisions and the legislative decisions in the state have the facts that they need to make good decisions. We continue to believe our asset on the West Coast is one of the most competitive, particularly when you look at the integrated nature of it, the MPLX, as well as its ability to process various crudes, et cetera. So, yes, we continue to believe in the long-term viability of that asset.
Manav Gupta: Thank you. I'll turn it over.
Maryann Mannen: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is open.
Paul Cheng: Hey, team. Good morning. Maryann and Rick, this year, I think you guys think that your turnaround cost is about $1.4 billion similar to last year, which is quite high. So trying to understand that, as for the cycle, what's considered as a normal turnaround cost for you guys? Is $1.4 billion the new normal or this is considered somewhat of a high year also?
John Quaid: Hey, good morning, Paul. It's John. I'll maybe start with that, and then we'll see what follow-ups you might have. Certainly, like you said, we're looking at $1.4 for this year, similar to last year's. If you look back over the last several years, it gets a little bit hard to see a run rate, right? You would have had COVID, where we really would have slowed down. That would have pushed some turnarounds to the right, if you will, into future years. We also continue to invest in our assets and change kind of the capacity of what we have. I mean, interestingly, if you go back pre-COVID and post either shutting down or converting refineries, we're almost back to the same or more capacity than we were previously. So I think all of those things are driving that number. And again, and Tim and the team can speak to this, right? Those are scheduled outages that we have on a cycle that we're managing to, that we need to get done. I think, though, I was trying to give you some factors, though, that are maybe driving the $1.4 we're seeing for this year.
Paul Cheng: Hey, John, thank you for that. How about -- what, consider from internally, you guys' standpoint will be more of a normal cycle, say average for the cycle?
John Quaid: Yes, Paul, I don't know if it's helpful to get into. There's lots of things that can move that on the asset portfolio, where we are in the schedule. I think we've even kind of stepped into here just recently giving you the number for the year. We used to just kind of give you the number by quarter. So I think if you're okay with it, we might just stick with what we're looking at for this year, and then we'll speak to it as the year progresses.
Paul Cheng: Okay. The second question, I want to go back into the margin capture. California actually has done really well. Yes, I mean, we stayed and took out renewables, so that improved or that helped the margin, but still it's very good. Typically, I think for the built-in branding, California doesn't really benefit that much. So trying to understand that, I think Rick mentioned about export and some of the -- is there any one-off item in California for this quarter, we should be aware, or is there any other factor that you can point us to why they seem to be performing really well?
John Quaid: Hey, Paul, it's John. I'll start and maybe then turn it over to Rick. I think one of the things we would call out, really, I'll start with Tim and his team and how we ran the facilities in the quarter, strong utilization, really positioning us to then turn to Rick and his team to take that production to market across our really competitive value chain. So at a high, high level, I think that's what you're seeing, and maybe I'll turn it over to Rick for any other details.
Rick Hessling: Yes, Paul, maybe just to address the export comment, when I referenced our exports earlier, think of that as predominantly U.S. Gulf Coast. It's not that there weren't some exports going out of the West Coast, but there were minimal in terms of our overall portfolio. The only item that I would add to John's commentary is, we often talk fully integrated value chain and our advantages in California, and in-house, we talk refinery to retail, and we are one of the few out there that takes the value chain all the way to the end consumer, and that is a value driver that I think that we believe is showing up in capture that others aren't able to capture. So we see it as a differentiator, Paul.
Paul Cheng: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Rick Hessling: You're welcome. Thank you, Paul.
Maryann Mannen: Thank you, Paul.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Roger Read: Yes, thank you. Good morning.
Maryann Mannen: Morning, Roger.
Roger Read: Good morning, Maryann. To come back to your comments on the macro and that demand may exceed capacity as we see more closures within the industry. What's your view here looking at 2'5 in terms of demand as we think about gasoline, jet fuel, and then diesel, particularly we finally got a plus 50 on the ISM manufacturing for this past month?
Maryann Mannen:
, : And then there's probably about 800,000 barrels a day that we think will be coming offline, one of them we know happening in the first quarter, another one happening in the fourth quarter, which probably won't have much impact in 2025, and then, there's a few in, I think one in Germany, a couple in Scotland, Europe, and then there's always really what happens with respect to China. So back half of the year, when we look at 2025, we think we should see improvement. We should see margins expanding. Frankly, we're beginning to see a little bit of that as seasonal unwind begins to occur. In our system, gasoline year-over-year has been fairly steady, diesel up slightly, and to your point, we've actually seen jet demand growth, which is what you would expect as well. So overall, we remain constructive long term. I think the back half of 2025 could look better. China always an interesting dynamic to the extent that's better than we anticipate could be an accelerator. Obviously, some of the decisions that are being debated here with China would mute that, and we'll have to wait and see what happens there. So I think that's how I would characterize it, Roger.
Roger Read: Appreciate that. And then maybe as an unrelated follow-up, obviously a lot of things going on with the Trump administration on the tariffs and all, but there's also in the executive orders a lot of things to roll back, a lot of let's call it pro-sustainable energy or clean energy as it was advertised. What are some of the key things you're watching on that, you know, progress that may or may not be made during 2025?
Maryann Mannen: Yes, Roger, here's what I would say. When we look at our sustainability initiatives, you look at Scope 1, Scope 2, and even our Scope 3 absolute. We remain committed to those. And frankly, last year we actually increased our target because we were making progress, particularly on methane as an example. So we'll continue to remain focused on delivering Scope 1, Scope 2. We'll evaluate what opportunities we have as we look at Scope 3. The whole concept around renewable diesel, you heard me mention perhaps in my remarks that our focus in the short term is limiting the amount of capital that we're putting to work in renewable diesel. We'll certainly do what we need to ensure the sustainability and the reliability of that asset came up to nameplate capacity in the fourth quarter, as we said, and we believe that as we look at 2025, that asset will be profitable, but again, as we look at, we'll watch the variables just really in the whole renewable space. That is certainly one that we'll be looking at carefully as well. I'm going to pass to Jim and see if there is anything that Jim feels is, that I've missed in our...
James Wilkins: Roger, I agree with what Maryann said. I think we're going to remain steadfast, kind of the middle of the fairway, on our sustainability goals and metrics and kind of watch some of the variables.
Roger Read: Great. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Maryann Mannen: You're welcome, Roger. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen. Your line is open.
Maryann Mannen: Hey, Jason. Morning.
Jason Gabelman: Thanks for taking my question. Hey. The first one on the buyback and the ability to generate cash beyond cash from ops at the parent company, I think you're going to be refinancing $750 million of debt at the parent. So should we think about that being available for use towards buybacks? And then any opportunity for buyback -- sorry, for dropdowns from the parent down to the MLT? Is that still an arrow in your quiver that you could use?
John Quaid: Hey, morning, Jason. It's John. Yes, you're spot on the cash balance and that maturity, right? That was one that matured in September. We decided to pay it off and mention at that time we'll be looking to refinance that at the right time, right? So you've got $750 million of cash that's coming back onto the balance sheet that's available for allocation. I'll let Maryann speak to the drops.
Maryann Mannen: Yes, Jason, with respect to the drop, there is a few assets that sit on the MPC side that we believe ultimately belong rightfully so in the midstream business. When we, or if we consider these drops, in the past they have certainly not been a priority for several reasons that you know well, but even when we consider these drops, we want to be sure that we're clear these drops would not count, if you will, with respect to our commitment for MPLX to have mid-single-digit growth. This, EBITDA, currently in the system we would make that drop to be sure that the assets are positioned properly in the business. Having said that, that cash on the MPC side could certainly be used to continue to buy back stock in particular when we look at the valuation today versus our long-term opportunity set and the value creation that we think we can generate in MPC. That cash could be put to good use on the MPC side but would not count, we would not do that. It would not count against MPLX's mid-single-digit growth objective because that, EBITDA, is already in our system. Hope that helps.
Jason Gabelman: Yes, got it. Understood. Do you have an estimate for the amount of EBITDA that could potentially be dropped down?
Maryann Mannen: Jason, when we, if and when we do a drop, we'll be sure that we give you good clarity so you understand how not to include that in the growth. But we'll share that with you when the time comes.
Jason Gabelman: All right, great. My follow-up is just a quick one. I noticed in the press release there wasn't a quarter-to-date buyback figure for 1Q, '25. I think that's the first time you've excluded that figure in the press release for a handful of quarters, if not two years. Do you have that figure handy, and was there a reason that you decided to exclude it this quarter?
John Quaid: Hey, Jason, it's John. Let me try and answer that for you, and maybe, too. It's kind of where you were going, a little bit of history. Certainly, if you go back in time, post the Speedway sale, post the significant change in margins, we were returning a significant amount of capital and really wanted to lean in and share with you all what that first month of the quarter looked like as we've kind of approached a more normalized balance sheet. Even as we continued to provide that, you've also heard us say, hey, one month isn't really indicative of what the repurchases might be for the entire quarter. So I think just as we're pivoting now, we decided maybe now's the time that that number maybe isn't as useful as it had been in the past. So hopefully that you can understand kind of our change in view there.
Jason Gabelman: Yep, that's great. Thanks for explaining that.
Jason Gabelman: Thanks, Jason.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Royall with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
John Royall: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So my first question's on 2024 MPC level CapEx. The $1.52 billion for '24 came in a bit above the original $1.25 billion guide. And it looks in particular like a big 4Q. I was just hoping you could help us bridge the difference between the guide from a year ago and where you ended up?
John Quaid: Hey, morning, John. It's John. Let me try and give you a little bit more color there. Really, I think what we saw were a couple things. And I'll start with you've heard Rick talk about how we're going to market in our fully integrated value chain. And frankly, we saw some really strong opportunities to invest some capital to drive cash flow in the marketing side of our business. That was probably the majority or a larger portion of what drove that. But we also had some opportunities across the refining base where we saw some projects that we could put money to. So I just give you that as some color where, again, we saw those opportunities and wanted to take advantage of them as we continue to look to drive cash flow growth of the refining and marketing business.
John Royall: Okay, thank you. And then my next question is on renewable diesel margins. There's a lot of uncertainty in the regulatory environment right now. I was just hoping for your thoughts on RD margins early in 2025 and how you think the 45Z could ultimately play out?
Rick Hessling: Yes. Hi, John. This is Rick. So with Martinez fully online, as we stated earlier, we continue to expect EBITDA contribution going forward. As you saw in the release, we were positive $28 million in fourth quarter. So, we really have a good, stable environment, and we have a great team executing our feedstocks and our product distribution. With that being said, as you said, there remains a lot of uncertainty in this space, and it continues to evolve, right? When you think of our new administration, how does 45Z get implemented or does it and at what pace? And then when you have the BTC expiry, I would tell you I would not make a prediction, but here's what I would say. We will control what we can control, and from a feedstock optimization perspective, we're procuring advantage feedstocks with low CIs and then placing them as you would certainly expect us to in the highest margin markets possible. So won't pretend to say we have a crystal ball in the future. I think we'll watch this closely, but we feel very good about our asset base and our execution.
John Royall: Thank you very much.
Maryann Mannen: You're welcome, John. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Your line is open.
Theresa Chen: Hi. Can you talk about how much LPG export currently exists within your system just off of your refining assets in the Gulf Coast and maybe the West Coast? And following the FID of the NGL infrastructure projects and MPC's role in marketing those LPGs, what kind of economic uplift would you expect this to bring to MPC either in terms of capture or EBITDA?
Rick Hessling: Hi, Teresa. It's Rick. Thank you for the question. So when we look at our current footprint, what I'll do without giving you specific numbers is tell you that our footprint and our ability to export once the dock is fully commissioned and we're up and running will be significant. We will attack global buyers, and we will go to market in a diversified approach, and what I mean by that is we'll go term. We'll go spot, a percentage term, a percentage spot, a percentage FOB versus delivered, and then from an EBITDA perspective, we have a variety of ranges. It depends on what the market is at that point in time, but we are bullish in this environment with the Chinese PDH units and the global worldwide demand. I would say we have a very optimistic view forward.
Theresa Chen: Got it, and as a quick follow-up, is MPC also marketing ONEOK's portion of the terminal facility, the volumes coming out of the terminal facility, or is it just MPLX's 50% interest?
Rick Hessling: MPC is just marketing the 50% of the dock. ONEOK will be marketing their own barrels.
Theresa Chen: Thank you.
Rick Hessling: Thank you, Teresa.
Maryann Mannen: Thank you, Teresa.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Matthew Blair with Tudor Pickering Holt. Your line is open.
Matthew Blair: Great. Thank you for the questions, and congrats on the strong results.
Maryann Mannen: Thanks Matt.
Matthew Blair: You mentioned record product exports, and we are seeing things like industrial production improve in several Latin American countries with, I guess, the exception of Mexico. My question is, could you contrast demand trends in the U.S. versus your overseas market? And if you have any sort of a split between gasoline and diesel, that would be helpful, too. Thanks.
Rick Hessling: Yes, Matt, so what I would tell you is where we're seeing significant demand signals is all things Latin America and Europe. Those are the biggest signals we're seeing. Demand growth is more robust than we have seen in a while, and then when you look at where we are from a split perspective, gas versus diesel. I will tell you diesel's been pretty steady, but we are seeing a significant uplift in gas export demand.
Matthew Blair: Sounds good, and then turning back to the renewable diesel segment, with the 45Z coming in, does this change anything in regards to your RD feedstocks, and I guess in particular, are you looking to run less vegetable oils going forward? And do you run any imported UCO? And if so, would you scale that back going forward?
Rick Hessling: So, great question. I would tell you, so what we're looking to do is maximize low-CI stocks, feedstocks, and with that, that plays right into the 45Z on what would be the most maximum feedstock we could run and get credit for and apply towards the 45Z. So, I think that's the best way to share that, Matt.
Matthew Blair: Sounds good. Thank you.
Maryann Mannen: Matt, it's Maryann. Just maybe one other comment, if I could, when we think about Martinez as well. As I mentioned earlier, we brought the asset to full nameplate capacity in the fourth quarter. That's $48,000 a day. We share that now with Neste. One of the advantages of being at full nameplate is our ability to operate the PTU. And you know, part of the strategic rationale with our developing this long-term relationship with Neste, in particular for Martinez, was to be able to optimize the feedstock. And so we think that'll be a value driver as well into 2025 as we're now able to look at given the amount of volume that's in place, but be able to look at where those opportunities exist through the commercial lens in addition to the incentives that are obviously still critical for profitability. Hope that addresses your question, Matt.
Matthew Blair: It does. Thank you.
Maryann Mannen: You're welcome.
Kristina Kazarian: All right, with that, thank you for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have more questions or want clarification on topics discussed this morning, please contact us, and our team will be available to take your calls. Thank you for joining us today.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-11-05 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MPC Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. My name is Sheila, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.
Kristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor tab. Joining me today on the call; Maryann Mannen, CEO; John Quaid, CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. With that, I'll turn the call over to Maryann.
Maryann Mannen: Thanks, Kristina, and good morning, everyone. We remain committed to peer-leading operational excellence, commercial performance and profitability per barrel in each of the regions in which we operate, while being steadfast in our commitments to safely, reliably operate our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees. The global macro environment continues to exhibit refined product demand growth, and we expect 2024 will be another year of record refined product consumption. Within our domestic and export businesses, we have seen steady year-over-year demand for gasoline and diesel and growth in demand for jet fuels. Refining margins were volatile in the third quarter as the market digested the implications of a light turnaround season, less seasonal supply interruptions than anticipated and the uncertainties around global economic growth, particularly the pace within China. By leveraging our fully integrated refining system and geographic diversification across the Gulf Coast, Mid-Con and West Coast regions our portfolio of assets is well positioned to perform in this dynamic market environment. Beyond 2024, we expect demand growth to exceed the net impact of capacity additions and rationalizations through the end of the decade. These fundamentals support an enhanced mid-cycle environment for refining. The availability of low-cost energy, the complexity of our facilities and our domestic and international logistical capabilities are further increase our global competitive advantage. The U.S. refining industry will remain structurally advantaged over the rest of the world. Operational excellence and commercial execution have driven sustainable structural benefit. Our disciplined long-term strategic and quick hit investments are allocated to projects that we believe will achieve attractive returns. These projects are expected to strengthen our competitiveness and position MPC well into the future. We believe prioritization of these capabilities will ensure that our assets will remain the most competitive in each region in which we operate. Positioning us to deliver the strongest through-cycle cash generation and lead in capital allocation. In Midstream, MPLX continues to execute attractive growth opportunities anchored in the Permian and Marcellus basins. In the third quarter, MPLX began operations at Preakness II, a gas processing plant located in the Permian Basin and today announced an additional processing plant in the Northeast. The Harmon Creek III project will bring Northeast gas processing capacity to 8.1 billion cubic feet per day and fractionation capacity to 800,000 barrels per day once completed in the second half of 2026. Executing its wellhead-to-water strategy, MPLX progressed its natural gas and NGL pipeline projects including the capacity expansion of the BANGL natural gas liquids pipeline and Blackcomb natural gas pipeline in collaboration with its partners. MPLX is strategic to MPC's portfolio, and therefore, its value proposition. Our Midstream segment, which is primarily comprised of MPLX has grown its adjusted EBITDA by over 6% and on a 3-year annual compound basis through 2023. This growth and the durability of its cash flow profile supported a 12.5% increase to its quarterly distribution increasing the expected annual cash distribution to MPC to $2.5 billion. As MPLX is able to grow its distribution, the cash flow MPC receives is expected to fully cover MPC's dividend and all of our capital programs in 2025. MPLX's growing portfolio and financial flexibility is expected to support this level of annual distribution increases in the future, strengthening the value proposition to MPC. MPC's total capital return since May 2021 has reduced MPC's share count by over 50% and following last week's announced 10% increase to MPC's dividends. Over the past 3 years, we have grown our quarterly dividend at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 6%. We announced an additional $5 billion share repurchase authorization. This will provide us flexibility to execute our peer-leading capital return commitment. Given our highly advantaged refining business and the $2.5 billion annualized distribution from MPLX, we are positioned to lead peers in capital returns through all parts of the cycle. MPC generated third quarter earnings per share of $1.87. This quarter, we delivered refining utilization at 94%, reflecting our operational excellence and value chain optimization. Utilization in the West Coast and Mid-Con regions was in the upper 90s, demonstrating strong reliability. Utilization in the U.S. Gulf Coast region reflected execution of turnaround activity. The team executed to deliver capture of 96%, reflecting strong commercial performance in a volatile market. Our capture improved by 2%, exceeding the rate of improvement achieved by our closest peers. This performance drove R&M segment adjusted EBITDA of $3.82 per barrel and cash from operations, excluding the impacts of working capital of $1.9 billion. And in the third quarter, we continue to lead our peers in capital return. The capabilities we have built provide a sustainable advantage, and we expect to continue to see the impact on our quarterly results. Let me turn the call over to John.
John Quaid: Thanks, Maryann. Slide 5 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from second to third quarter 2024 as well as the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $900 million, driven by decreased results in our Refining and Marketing segment. The tax rate for the quarter was 10% reflecting the earnings mix between our R&M and Midstream businesses. Moving to our segment results. Slide 6 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment for the third quarter. Lower crack spreads reduced per barrel margin sequentially, our refineries ran at 94% utilization, processing nearly 2.8 million barrels of crude per day. Refining operating costs for $5.30 per barrel in the third quarter, higher sequentially primarily due to lower throughputs and higher project-related expenses associated with increased turnaround activity. Slide 7 provides an overview of our Refining and Marketing margin capture of 96% for the quarter, an improvement of 2% from the second quarter. The improvement was primarily driven by our operational and commercial team's execution of value-driven secondary product strategies as prices strengthened relative to gasoline quarter-over-quarter. This was partially offset by clean product margins declining sequentially, and we also continued to see headwinds from our renewals business during the quarter. Slide 8 shows our Midstream segment performance for the quarter. Our Midstream segment continues to deliver cash flow growth. Segment adjusted EBITDA was flat sequentially but increased approximately 6% year-over-year, primarily due to higher throughputs and rates. MPLX remains a source of durable earnings growth as it advances projects targeted to enhance our natural gas and NGL value chains. Slide 9 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was $1.9 billion in the quarter, driven by both our refining and midstream businesses. Working capital was a $179 million use of cash for the quarter, primarily driven by decreases in crude prices. This quarter, capital expenditures, investments and acquisitions were $922 million, including $210 million for MPLX's acquisition of an additional 20% interest in the BANGL pipeline. MPC utilized cash to repay $750 million of debt due in the quarter, which we plan to refinance. MPC returned $2.7 billion through share repurchases and $273 million in dividends during the quarter and in October, we repurchased $500 million of MPC shares. At the end of the third quarter, MPC had approximately $5.1 billion in consolidated cash and short-term investments, including MPLX cash of $2.4 billion. Turning to Slide 10. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent. Our number one priority is sustaining capital. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate. We are committed to paying a secure, competitive and growing dividend. We will invest where we believe there are attractive returns, which will enhance our competitiveness and position MPC well into the future. After meeting those requirements, we will return all excess capital through share repurchases even as we approach a more normalized balance sheet. And including the additional $5 billion announced this morning, we currently have $8.5 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorizations, highlighting our commitment to superior shareholder returns. As Maryann highlighted earlier, with our highly advantaged refining business and the $2.5 billion annualized distribution from MPLX we are positioned to lead peers and capital returns through all market cycles. Turning to guidance on Slide 11. We provide our fourth quarter outlook. We are projecting crude throughput volumes of just over 2.6 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 90%. Turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $285 million in the fourth quarter with activity focused in the Mid-Con region. Operating costs are projected to be $5.50 per barrel. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.5 billion and corporate costs are expected to be $200 million in the quarter. In summary, on Slide 13, this quarter, our R&M segment generated $1.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA, and our Midstream segment delivered $1.6 billion of adjusted EBITDA. We invested $922 million in the business and returned $3 billion of capital. With that, let me pass it back to Maryann.
Maryann Mannen: Thanks, John. We are unwavering in our commitment to safe and reliable operations, operational excellence commercial execution and cost competitiveness yields sustainable structural benefits and position us to deliver peer-leading financial performance in each of the regions in which we operate. To deliver this, we will optimize our portfolio to deliver outperformance now and in the future. We'll leverage our value chain advantages and ensure the competitiveness of our assets while continuing to invest in our people. Our execution of these commitments position us to deliver the strongest through cycle cash generation. Durable midstream growth is expected to deliver cash flow uplift. Investing capital where we believe there are attractive returns will enhance our competitiveness now and for the future. We are committed to leading capital allocation and will return excess capital through share repurchases. MPC is positioned to create exceptional value through peer-leading performance, execution of our strategic commitments and its compelling value proposition. Let me turn the call back to Kristina.
Kristina Kazarian: Thanks, Maryann. [Operator Instructions] Sheila, we are ready.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta: Good morning Maryann and team, thanks for the rundown and good quarter here. I thought on the first topic, it would be good to get your perspective on was capital returns as you -- as we thought about 2024, you've been kind of run rating to $0.5 billion of buybacks a quarter. And as we -- as you think about 2025, the forward curve and your view of enhancement cycle relative to your cash balances. Just curious on your perspective on the level for 2025 it seems like $1.5 billion is what most investors are calibrating to and that ties into the $500 million you did in October, but just your perspective on the quarterly run rate of buybacks would be helpful.
Maryann Mannen: First and foremost, we are committed to leading our peers in capital returns through all parts of the cycle and that means returning all cash after our requirements to shareholders. When we think about mid-cycle, there's no doubt we see volatility. We've seen it in the last quarter and that volatility could continue. But we remain constructive on the long term when we look at the demand profile over the next decade. We look at the net if you will, between capacity additions that are coming online, we don't see anything beyond 2026 and you look at sort of the capacity that is actually coming offline as well we think over the long term, that remains an extremely constructive environment for us to operate. You mentioned a comment about sort of how we think about share repurchase beyond that period. Look, one of the things that we are trying to achieve is our peer-leading performance in all of the regions we operate. We're going to do that through commercial performance, we're going to do that through our operational excellence Therefore, we should have the strongest cash flow through cycle. And when we do that, we should then have the ability to lead our peers in capital allocation. Contributing to that, as I was mentioning in my comments is the durability of that midstream business. We saw the 12.5% increase in the distribution that we announced a few days ago and that brings about $2.5 billion to MPC on an annual basis, covers the MPC dividend, which, as you know, we just increased. And the capital, although we haven't given our capital guidance for 2025, highly likely it's going to cover our capital for 2025 as well. So again, just summarizing here, we expect that when we perform in this manner, we will have the strongest through-cycle cash flow and we'll be able to lead our peers in our capital allocation through share repurchase.
Neil Mehta: Okay, Maryann. And then the follow-up is just on the West Coast, very volatile tough environment in Q3. Things seem to be getting better in Q4 and then you had the big announcement in L.A. -- in L.A. around retirement. So how do you think about the West Coast setup and some of the moving pieces as we go into the next year?
Maryann Mannen: Yes. Thanks, Neil. First, I think as we've been sharing over the last several quarters, we believe in our West Coast, we have one of the most competitive assets in the region. If you take a look at our performance in this quarter, we think the results on the West Coast demonstrate that. We've got a fairly sophisticated set of assets in that region it's a region where we have been monitoring for a long period of time. Frankly, if you go back to as early as 2020, we have been assessing the performance in that region and our ability to be profitable. We made a decision at that point in time to shutter the Martinez asset as a traditional fossil fuel refinery. So again, when we look at the capability of that asset, we look at the access waterborne, we look at our crude sourcing. We look at the capability for Canadian coming out of TMX. We think over the long term, those decisions that others are making as well bode well for us, and we remain committed to that West Coast region.
Operator: Next, we will hear from Doug Leggate with Wolfe Research.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate: Maryann, I apologize for following up on the cash return question. But post-2026 is 2 years away for a rebalancing of global capacity, let's assume things remain soft on a margin outlook for a period of time, how much tolerance are you prepared to have on your balance sheet at the MPC level to fund your cash returns? I wonder if you could put a limit on where you would allow your balance sheet to get to?
Maryann Mannen: Yes, one of the things we've shared for a period of time is the comfort that we have with our cash balance. And we remain comfortable, as we've shared in the past that about $1 billion is where we think our cash balances need to be on the MPC side. And again, part of that comfort comes from historically as we weathered other things like COVID, et cetera, and liquidity evaluations. Second, as I mentioned, we do have the benefit of our midstream cash flow, that durability of that stream, $2.5 billion coming to MPC. When we think about cash allocation, therefore, capital allocation, again, we intend to lead in capital allocation as we execute on the things that I mentioned, we should be able to have the strongest performance peer leading in each of the regions we operate, generating strongest cash flow and then we'll return that cash not necessary for other requirements via share buyback. So again, while the total may look different the commitment and the framework that we have been implementing doesn't change as we watch that mid-cycle return.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate: So just to be clear, where would you like to see your net debt? Is there a limit?
Maryann Mannen: Yes. On the MPC side, we've always talked about being in a range of 25% to 30% debt to capital, and that's a gross number and we remain comfortable in that position. Today, we're sitting on under $6.5 billion of debt. That's simply because we've got about a $750 million refinance, and we intend to refinance that. We felt like when we looked at market environment and other volatility happening, it was beneficial for us to evaluate that. So that $750 million is intended to be refinanced it was a shorter-term decision as we look for opportunities to put that debt back on the balance sheet at their rates.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate: Thanks for the clarification, Maryann. I guess my follow-up is related to your prepared remarks. I don't think I've heard you say this before, so I wonder if I could ask you to elaborate. We will optimize our portfolio to obviously maximize returns. It sounds like under your leadership, there's -- there's a portfolio review underway? Is there something that you're not happy with in the asset base? And I guess specifically, you still have additional amount of equity interest in multiple pipelines, I guess, could potentially be monetized. So I wonder if you could just elaborate on what you meant by optimize our portfolio.
Maryann Mannen: Yes. Certainly, Doug. No, nothing different. One of our strategic pillars for a long time is ensuring the competitive nature of all of the assets in our portfolio. And so my comment there is our commitment that we are going to continue to evaluate those assets in the portfolio. Today, all of those assets are cash flow positive. But we'll ensure that, that competitive nature of those assets continues both today and in the future. So it is merely our commitment to ensure the competitive nature of our assets not anything different intended by that comment.
Operator: Our next question will come from Manav Gupta with UBS.
Manav Gupta: My question is around the capital investment you're making. You've highlighted high return investments in Los Angeles and Galveston Bay refineries. Can you help us remind exactly what kind of projects you're doing over there? And obviously, to follow up a little bit on Neil's question. Your competitors are looking to shut refineries on the West Coast, and you're actually making an investment in Los Angeles. So help us understand that.
Maryann Mannen: Certainly. So let me start with the West Coast. We talked earlier this year about an investment that we are making in our L.A. assets. We think that investment with roughly a 20% return. One helps us reduce Scope 1, Scope 2 emissions, gives us operational efficiency, reduces cost and ultimately will improve our competitiveness in that region in addition to giving us compliance for NOx emissions. But a 20% return, given the strength of that asset in the West Coast and what we believe to be certainly a competitive asset, we think, is an appropriate commitment to capital in that region. The other question that you were referencing our project -- excuse me, monopolize the project, the DHT in Galveston Bay. And again, another one that we talked about this year follow-on to our STAR project. This allows us with a similar return in that 20% range allows us to convert high sulfur diesel to ultra-low sulfur diesel. And particularly when you look at the curves going forward, again, we think will give us further competitive advantage on the U.S. Gulf Coast, given the strength of our asset there in that region. Let me pause and see if that answers your question.
Manav Gupta: No, that's perfect, Maryann. And my follow up a little bit on the midstream side, 12% -- 12.5% distribution growth. It kind of is getting to a point where you can grow MPC distribution as well as cover the CapEx. Just I'm trying to understand, are the opportunities you're looking in exclusively organic. Your press release is saying you can grow at 5% EBITDA organically, but are you also open to small bolt-on deals or JVs, minority interest in projects to grow your midstream business?
Maryann Mannen: Yes. Thank you for the question. So you're correct. We increased that MPLX distribution, as you say, 12.5% just a few days ago, really on the strength, the durability of our cash flows based on -- over the last 3 years, we've seen EBITDA grow at just under 7%. We've seen our distributable cash flow just under 8%. We believe there are a series of organic projects that can help us fuel that mid-single-digit growth. One of the things that we -- you don't see necessarily when you look at the amount of capital that we're putting to work in MPLX is the strength of our JVs. And as we grow those JVs that allocation is not included in the capital. So that's another source of continued growth for us. The other comment that you made also was really around our growth strategy that what we call our wellhead-to-water strategy and we think we've provided examples here, the increase in the BANGL ownership as we're looking at our NGL and nat gas and frankly, crude value chains as well. That wellhead water strategy is anchored in the Permian, we think those opportunities there to continue to capture the full value chain are extremely supportive of our ability to continue to support mid-single-digit growth in MPLX. And then the comment about whether or not we would look at other bolt-ons. If you look at the decision we made in the Utica, we think the opportunity for the Utica to increased utilization we made -- we did a transaction to buy out the rest of our JV partner there in the first quarter Summit. So we think we've got good examples of where we can continue to grow in mid-single-digit growth.
Operator: Next, you will hear from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.
Paul Cheng: Maryann look like in the third quarter, your full [indiscernible] is really good, much better than your previous guide and then your turnaround expenses. Just curious that do you have a breakdown? How much of the better than expected throughput is due to better execute the turnaround? And how much is just the base operation or lesser unpinned downtime than you expected? And also from that standpoint, is the turnaround have you changed the process, how you're doing? In other words, that the improvement we see in the third quarter, is that repeatable?
Maryann Mannen: Yes. Thanks for the question, Paul. One of the things that I wanted to be sure that we talk about is our commitment to our operational performance. And you can see, as we've shared our commitment to peer-leading operational performance as well. We talk about commercial performance, giving us sustainable benefits, clearly, our operational performance, including our safe and reliable operations has given us sustainable benefits as well. I'm going to ask Tim to talk a little bit about the strengths of those capabilities and what it's done, frankly, with respect to our turnaround capabilities.
Timothy Aydt: Hello Paul. We're routinely in the first quartile of Solomon on the turnaround performance. I think you probably recognized that in the past. And that's really based on our best-in-class procedures and processes that we have. But we're not standing still at all. we're continuing to improve and tweak these processes over time. And what we found really is that our -- when we execute our turnaround outages using this consistent approach, we do so across all of the facilities, and that leads to good results. I'd also point out that our large scale really allows us to assist the smaller plants, which then enables us the consistent performance regardless of the location. So I think that's another key benefit that you're seeing come through. And I'd also like to maybe take the opportunity to give a shout out to our teams as we had outstanding safety and environmental performance during our 4 fall turnarounds. So we had like zero OSHA recordables, zero lost time injuries, no significant environmental events all during these turnarounds this fall. So I think this is just yet another example of our safe and reliable focus and our operational excellence mindset. So hopefully, that helps.
Paul Cheng: That's great. Maryann, can I ask the renewable diesel business. I think you are probably not making money in Martinez at least. And if we assume the margin environment remains flat at this level, what's the -- and after we take into consideration of the margin loss due to some BTC transition to PTC, what's the path to profitability? I mean what in term of you are doing that will be able to allow you to actually bridge the gap and be able to push it back up to making money?
Maryann Mannen: Yes. Thanks for the question, Paul. So on Martinez, first of all, as we have shared, we expect that by the end of the fourth quarter, we will have Martinez returning to full nameplate capacity on plan, right, and that's in the range of about 48,000 barrels a day. When you talk about profitability, actually make a comment here on the West Coast, as we are ramping up the challenges of profitability are there. If you exclude the impact of Martinez in our West Coast performance, our West Coast performance is actually positive in the quarter. As we go forward, we certainly believe that at full nameplate, we will be profitable, frankly, one of the more profitable renewable diesel facilities I'm going to pass to John because I think you had some questions also around BTC, and John is going to take you through that.
John Quaid: Yes. Thanks, Maryann. Maryann really hit on it. The main factor for our Martinez facility and we're on track to do this is to get it back up to full capacity, again, running the advantaged feedstocks we can run there. So -- and Paul, as we look at that transition rate as BTC right now is set to expire here comes PTC. We're still waiting on regulations, et cetera. We'll prepare for all scenarios. But we would see longer term, the market will balance that out. But the key for us to be profitable on the West Coast is where we are now and being on track to getting back up to full capacity.
Operator: Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.
Roger Read: Yes, thanks. Maybe a couple of operational questions with some of the changes here. As we look at the West Coast and the changes coming here in, I guess, early '26 but maybe even a little sooner with some sort of unplanned downtime type items. How do you think about the incremental barrels coming to California. We've heard talk about it would be an Asian barrel. Historically, I would have said maybe Gulf Coast or even parts of Europe can bring California spec in but we've got closures coming in both of those locations. California, though, relative to the rest of your fleet and really the U.S. in general is pretty expensive place to operate. So what do you think about in terms of an incremental margin as California becomes more dependable or more dependent, excuse me, on an imported barrel?
Rick Hessling: Roger, it's Rick. So if you -- I won't speak for our competitors, but when you look at what has happened in the past, we believe it will most likely be an Asian barrel. South Korea is a logical choice. And I will tell you, Roger, that, that will introduce some new nuances to the state of California. We believe that could cause more volatility. You have increased transit time and you have market disruptors in terms of additional transportation costs to bring a barrel in. But specifically, I would tell you, South Korea/Asia will be the primary market where we believe imports would come from.
Roger Read: Okay. And then on the Gulf Coast, we do have a company that's going to be closed in one of their units in January. They've pretty much confirmed that here in the last few days. Any thoughts on what that means for crude availability on the Gulf Coast? I mean, generally, a heavy crude unit, you've got heavy crude units on the Gulf Coast. Does it matter? Does the crude just go elsewhere and it doesn't really affect differentials? Just any thoughts along those lines?
Rick Hessling: Yes. Great question, Roger. So they are a big buyer of Canadian crudes. And as you know, the Gulf Coast market has a large appetite for it. When you rebalance the market, there will be winners and losers, and I will say that more incremental capacity into the Gulf Coast is a very good thing for the spread, we believe, and we should reap the benefits of that, especially at our Galveston Bay refinery.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from John Royall with JPMorgan.
John Royall: So my first question is just on seasonality within capture rates. You're tracking somewhere in the mid-90s on capture year-to-date. And when I look at the past couple of years, there's obviously always some quarter-to-quarter volatility, but that's not out of the ordinary for 1Q through 3Q. But 4Q has historically tended to be a big quarter from a capture perspective. So my question is, do you consider the year-to-date capture to be generally in line with what you would typically expect. And recognizing that there are a lot of moving pieces, but if you have a more kind of seasonally normal 4Q, could we expect the full year to average somewhere around that 100% range, so?
Maryann Mannen: Yes. John, thanks for your question. I think you know when we talk about capture, we think our commercial performance is a key deliverable particularly as we try to execute to be the most competitive in each region where we operate. To your point, if you look at the last several fourth quarters of our performance, our capture in the fourth quarter has been greater than the capture in the prior 3 quarters. There is nothing in the fourth quarter of 2024 that would tell us that, that behavior should be anything different at this point in time.
John Royall: Great. That's exactly what I was looking for. And next one is maybe for John. If you could maybe talk a little bit about the potential timing for refinancing of the debt that you took out at the MPC level and what the use of proceeds could be there. Should we think about the 3Q buyback as maybe being held back a bit by that cash outflow and therefore, by the same token, maybe we could expect the proceeds to go back to buyback?
John Quaid: Yes. Thanks for the question, John. I mean, as we discussed before, that was a maturity. We took the advantage of the flexibility of our balance sheet to opportunistically look to refinance that at the right time. We want to get maybe past an election and some other things before we -- we look to do that, but we'll do that at the right time. Again, to the earlier comments, we'll be comfortable with that level of debt as we look out longer term. So again, just trying to leverage some of the flexibility of the balance sheet to get the most optimal cost of that debt and we look to refinance it.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen.
Jason Gabelman: I want to go back -- I wanted to go back to the shareholder returns and focus on this minimum $1 billion of cash balance. And I guess the question is more about timing of getting to that $1 billion and as we think about heading into a weaker environment next year, are you looking to maybe retain a bit more cash above that cash balance so that you can deploy the excess cash on the balance sheet towards the buyback in a weaker environment? Or how do you exactly think about the timing of drawing that down?
John Quaid: Jason, it's John. I'll take that. Look, when we look at that $1 billion target, that's -- that's what we look at minimum cash through a down cycle, right? That's what we're analyzing. So we remain very comfortable with that amount. And there's a couple of reasons why. You've heard a lot on the call today how we're confident in the competitiveness of our operations in each of the regions we operate and the things we're working on to drive positive cash flow. And then we've got this fantastic midstream investment in MPLX that continues to grow -- grow its distribution and drive $2.5 billion right now of annualized distributions back to MPC. So all of those factors are why we're very comfortable with that $1 billion, and it might differentiate us from maybe some of our peers that don't have that same business set. Hopefully, that helps.
Jason Gabelman: Yes, it does. The other question just on the quarterly results, you had mentioned that your capture trended better than peers. Just wondering if there's anything specific that drove that, that you could call out in the quarter or if it's something more structural?
Rick Hessling: This is Rick. I really would have to give a huge shout out to our Specialty Products teams. So oftentimes, Specialty Products is a headwind but when a market turns it's only as good as your team executing on the market turning. And when I think of some specific commodities that we don't often talk about, when I think of asphalt, pet chems, butane, and propane, we really did a great job. The team was phenomenal at capturing that market when it was there within the quarter. And I really am proud of them, and I truly believe they outperformed our competition. That, I would say, is the largest single call out.
Operator: And that is all the time that we have for questions today.
Kristina Kazarian: Great. Thank you so much for joining us on our call today. If you should have follow-up questions, please reach out. The IR team is available all day to help you with your questions. Thank you, everybody.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-06 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MPC Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. My name is Sheila, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.
Kristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Maryann Mannen, CEO; John Quaid, CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. With that, I'll turn the call over to Maryann.
Maryann Mannen: Thanks, Kristina, and good morning, everyone. I want to take a moment to recognize Mike Hennigan's leadership as CEO of MPC over the last 4 years. Mike's record of accomplishment has been tremendously valuable. During his tenure, Mike delivered its transformative strategic priorities and returned a peer-leading $40 billion to shareholders. We're fortunate to have Mike as Executive Chairman of MPC's Board going forward. Moving to the global macro environment. In the second quarter, supply of refined products reached all-time seasonal highs. The margin environment supported assets running at high utilization and new capacity additions continue to ramp. At the same time, demand for refined products set new records globally. We expect 2024 will be another year of record refined product consumption. Within MPC's domestic and export businesses, we are seeing steady demand year-over-year for gasoline and diesel and growing demand for jet fuel. As we look forward, demand growth is expected to outpace near-term capacity additions over time with limited global refining capacity additions expected through the end of the decade. These fundamentals still support an enhanced mid-cycle environment for refining. The U.S. refining industry is expected to remain structurally advantaged over the rest of the world. We believe our assets will remain the most competitive in each region in which we operate. Our fully integrated refining system and geographic diversification across the Gulf Coast, Mid-Con and West Coast regions provide us with a competitive advantage. We are steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees. Operational excellence and commercial execution have driven sustainable structural benefits, uniquely positioning us to capture market opportunities. Our execution remains core to our value delivery. Our disciplined capital investments are focused on high-return projects. In refining, we are making investments predominantly in our large competitively advantaged facilities to optimize our assets and position MPC well into the future. In midstream, MPLX continues to execute attractive growth opportunities focused on bringing in incremental third-party cash flows. We continue to grow our natural gas and NGL value chains. In the second quarter, MPLX closed the Whistler transaction. Last week, MPLX and its partners reached FID on the Blackcomb natural gas pipeline. It will be a 2.5 Bcf pipeline connecting supply in the Permian to domestic and export markets along the Gulf Coast. This project offers a compelling value proposition while providing shippers with flexible market access. Blackcomb is expected to be in service in the second half of 2026. Additionally, MPLX recently increased its ownership in BANGL. This pipeline transports NGLs from the Permian to Sweeny, Texas, and it is currently expanding its capacity to 250,000 barrels a day. This transaction is immediately accretive and enhances MPLX's Permian NGL value chain as part of its developing wellhead-to-water strategy. MPLX is strategic to MPC's portfolio, providing a $2.2 billion annualized cash distribution to MPC. This fully covers MPC's dividend and nearly all of our 2024 capital program. And our Midstream segment, which is primarily comprised of MPLX, has grown its adjusted EBITDA at nearly 7% compound annual growth rate over the last 3 years. Strong coverage, low leverage and growing cash flows provide MPLX financial flexibility, placing it in an excellent position to continue to significantly grow its distributions, further enhancing the value of this strategic relationship. MPLX -- sorry, MPC's total capital return since May 2021 has reduced MPC share count by nearly 50%. Cash generation will continue to influence buyback capacity as we return to a normalized balance sheet. Given our highly advantaged refining business and the $2.2 billion annualized distribution from MPLX, we believe we can lead peers in capital returns through all parts of the cycle. MPC generated second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $4.12. Our operational excellence and commercial performance support our quarterly results. This quarter, we delivered refining utilization at 97%, capture of 94%, up 2%, while other refining peers reported sequential declines. Adjusted R&M EBITDA per barrel of $7.07 and cash from operations, excluding the impacts of working capital of $2.7 billion, both of which led refining peers, and we returned $3.2 billion to our shareholders. The capabilities we have built provide a sustainable advantage, and we expect to continue to see the impact on our quarterly results. Let me turn the call over to John.
John Quaid: Thanks, Maryann. Slide 5 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from first quarter 2024 to second quarter 2024 as well as the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was higher sequentially by $133 million, driven by increased results in both our Refining & Marketing and Midstream segments. The tax rate for the quarter was 16%, resulting in a tax provision of $373 million. The second quarter tax rate largely reflects the earnings mix between our R&M and midstream businesses. Moving to our segment results. Slide 6 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment for the second quarter. Following significant turnaround activity in the first quarter, our refineries ran at 97% utilization, processing nearly 2.9 million barrels of crude per day. Refining operating costs were $4.97 per barrel in the second quarter, lower, sequentially, primarily due to higher throughputs, lower project-related expenses associated with reduced turnaround activity and lower energy costs. In our largest region, the U.S. Gulf Coast, our operating costs were $3.73 per barrel, demonstrating our cost competitiveness. Sequentially, per barrel margins were down primarily due to lower crack spreads. Slide 7 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing margin capture of 94% for the quarter. Capture in the quarter reflected tailwinds from gasoline margins, offset by increased headwinds from secondary product pricing, which was driven by high refining industry utilization. Gasoline margins were supported by a falling price environment during the quarter and, in addition, our integrated system and realized demand across our multiple sales channels was a competitive differentiator to our capture performance. Slide 8 shows the changes in our Midstream segment adjusted EBITDA versus the first quarter of 2024. Our Midstream segment is generating strong cash flows. This quarter, MPLX distributions contributed $550 million in cash flow to MPC. The 2 midstream transactions Maryann discussed earlier further enhance our Permian value chains for both natural gas and NGLs. Through organic growth and disciplined investments, MPLX continues to provide growing cash flows to MPC. MPLX is a differentiator in the MPC portfolio and remains a source of durable earnings growth. Slide 9 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was $2.7 billion in the quarter, driven by both our refining and midstream businesses. Working capital was a $541 million source of cash for the quarter, primarily driven by the decrease in refined product prices. This quarter, capital expenditures and investments were $541 million. And during the second quarter, MPLX issued $1.65 billion in tenured senior notes, the proceeds of which MPLX expects to use to retire senior notes maturing in December of this year and February of next year. MPC returned $2.9 billion through share repurchases and $290 million in dividends during the quarter. And in July, we repurchased just over $900 million of MPC shares, leaving $5.8 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorizations and highlighting our commitment to superior shareholder returns. At the end of the second quarter, MPC had approximately $6 billion in consolidated cash and short-term investments, excluding cash at MPLX. Turning to guidance. On Slide 10, we provide our third quarter outlook. We are projecting crude throughput volumes of just over 2.6 million barrels per day, representing a utilization of 90%. Planned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $330 million in the third quarter, with activity focused in the Mid-Con and Gulf Coast regions. Turnaround expense for the full year is anticipated to be approximately $1.4 billion. Operating costs are projected to be $5.35 per barrel in the third quarter. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.55 billion and corporate costs are expected to be $200 million. In summary, our second quarter results reflect strong cash generation and disciplined capital allocation. The R&M segment generated $2 billion of adjusted EBITDA and MPLX distributed $550 million to MPC. This supported investments of over $500 million and capital return of approximately $3.2 billion. With that, let me pass it back to Maryann.
Maryann Mannen: Thanks, John. My priorities are consistent with those that made MPC a peer-leading energy investment. We are unwavering in our commitment to safe and reliable operations. Operational excellence, commercial execution and our cost competitiveness yield sustainable structural benefits and position us to deliver peer-leading financial performance irrespective of the market environment. To do this, we will optimize our portfolio to deliver outperformance now and in the future. We'll leverage our value chain advantages, ensure the competitiveness of our assets and continue to invest in our people. Our execution of these commitments position us to deliver the strongest through-cycle cash generation. Durable midstream growth should deliver cash flow uplift. We will invest capital but be disciplined where we believe there are attractive returns, which will enhance our competitiveness. We are committed to leading in capital allocation. We will return excess capital through share repurchases. MPC is positioned to create exceptional value through peer-leading performance, execution of our strategic commitments and a compelling value proposition. Let me turn the call back over to Kristina.
Kristina Kazarian: Thanks, Maryann. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we will reprompt for additional questions. We will now open the call. Sheila?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Manav Gupta with UBS.
Manav Gupta: Congratulations on a very strong start. And looking at all these very attractive projects that you're doing in midstream, Maryann, like BANGL and Whistler and now Blackcomb. And looking at the way the distribution is growing at MPLX, like is the thought process somewhere here to try and grow the distribution at MPLX for 10%. And even if you can do it for 2 more years, that distribution to MPC jumps to like 2.7-plus, at that point, is covering your full CapEx and full dividend. So technically, you are a recession-proof refiner.
Maryann Mannen: Thanks, Manav. I think you said it well. The strategy that we are trying to execute in MPLX, we've talked about targeting mid-single-digit growth. As you've seen over the last 3 years, we've achieved that almost 8% in distributable cash flows as well. And to your point, we have increased the dividend over the last 3 years and more so in the last 2 years, 10% per year. We believe that our strategies, wellhead-to-water, as we explained, and the key initiatives that you just articulated for me, our investment in BANGL, our JV in the Utica, Whistler. And then also just recently, the FID of Blackcomb, we think, continue to support our ability to deliver in growing mid-single-digit growth. Therefore, our goal of increasing that distribution and bringing it back to MPC creates, we believe, incremental strategic value between MPC and MPLX. And as you stated well, that will fully cover the MPC dividend and largely the capital that heretofore MPC has been putting to work. So again, we think that strategic relationship becomes incredibly more important as we are able to increase MPLX's distribution going forward.
Manav Gupta: Perfect. And a very quick follow-up is, looking at the Gulf Coast OpEx, I think, $3.72 is the lowest in the business. It's like probably the lowest. Help us understand what's been the drivers of this because probably 3 or 4 years ago, you were not the lowest cost Gulf Coast operator. Looks like you've now gotten there. So help us understand some of the initiatives? And can this be sustained here?
Maryann Mannen: Manav, thanks. So as you know, one of our key initiatives, one of our priorities with respect to our peer-leading initiatives has been profitability per barrel. And we see that as a cost competitive commitment, if you will, in each of the regions where we operate. As we've been talking about for the last few years, the work that we have been doing, we believe, is sustainable. Ultimately, again, what we're trying to do is to deliver the best EBITDA per barrel in each of those regions. We appreciate your recognition of the Gulf Coast. I'll pass it to Rick to see if he wants to add any comments on the Gulf Coast.
Rick Hessling: Yes. So on the Gulf Coast, I will share that with utilization where it's at. We believe it to be a highly constructive market going forward and continue to rebound, Manav.
Operator: Next, we will hear from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta: Maryann, I wanted to kick off with you. As you take on the reins of the business in the CEO role. Can you talk about the first 6 months on the job. What are your key objectives? And what are you focused on here?
Maryann Mannen: Neil, thank you. I'll say, first and foremost, continuing to create exceptional value. As we've shared here and tried to articulate here this morning, we believe we can deliver the strongest EBITDA per barrel and cash flow per share. And we're going to continue to focus on notwithstanding our safe and reliable operations every day, all day, delivering outstanding operational excellence, commercial performance. We talked a little bit about that here that will be a focus as we go forward to ensure that our profitability per barrel is the strongest. Ultimately, at the end of the day, we want to have our peer-leading capital allocation, and we'll continue to drive all that we do to ensure that those allocation principles return on and return of are peer-leading. I shared a little bit. We're going to continue to do that, leveraging our value chain. We also want to ensure as we always have the competitive nature of those assets, it's something that we will continually evaluate. And then last, as we talk about one of the things that I just shared here is the durable midstream growth in our -- with the cash flows, we think that is another compelling value proposition for MPC. And with all that, we should be able to deliver the strongest through-cycle cash flow. I think those are the things that you will see me continue to focus on not only in the next 6 months, but continuously as we drive value for our shareholders.
Neil Mehta: And if I can drill down on one specific item. Over the last couple of years, the business and the value has really been created largely organically. There are some questions about whether you pursue M&A in the renewable diesel space. There was some trade articles around Neste in particular. So just love your comments on how do you create value in that business and any thoughts around that specifically?
Maryann Mannen: Yes. Sure, Neil. Let me address the Neste one, first. I heard you mention that. That rumor is not factual, and we are not having any conversations about a buyout with Neste. So just want to be sure that I address that. As we continue to look at the opportunities, we do see value within our portfolio. I mentioned the competitive nature of each of our regions. We continue to see opportunities there to drive performance. We are focused on our commercial performance and continuing to deliver the strongest EBIT per barrel, as I mentioned. So right now we see the opportunities within our own portfolio, and we'll continue to evaluate as we go forward over the long term how to deliver that value proposition. But we see our ability to grow organically.
Operator: Our next question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.
Paul Cheng: Two questions, please. I think the first one is probably for Rick. Rick for TMX, it has been -- I've been wondering for a number of months. Do you think that all the impact has already been felt in the marketplace? Or you believe there's more to come. We are surprised that 2/3 of the incremental barrel seems like being exported to Asia. And how that additional barrel in the West Coast may or may not have changed your operation in the West Coast, in terms of your crude slate and product yield? That's the first question. And second question, maybe for John. On your Page 18, there's an Other margin, say, $108 million. Can you maybe share a little bit more detail? What's inside there?
Maryann Mannen: Paul, thank you. So on TMX, first and foremost, I think we've been talking about this for the last several quarters. And what I would share with you is the start-up of TMX has largely happened as we anticipated and the results of that very similar to the way that we believe that would play out in the marketplace. So pretty consistent as we've shared. I'm going to pass it to Rick and allow him to give you some incremental color in particular on what's happening in the West Coast.
Rick Hessling: Yes. Paul, it's Rick. Just a few comments here. Really, no surprises. I would tell you from a yield perspective, the changes are insignificant from our perspective. What has changed, though, that is significant and quite helpful to us, actually, is as these incremental Canadian barrels have come into the market, it has put pressure on the ANS barrel. And as you're well aware, we're a big buyer and runner of ANS barrels on the West Coast. So we're a recipient of that. So that's been very positive for us. And then obviously, with our commitment on TMX, we have the ability to run these advantaged barrels not only at Anacortes, but at LA. So it's been very positive for us, see it being that way going forward, Paul. And then in terms of the export comment to Asia, not surprising at all. In fact, we expect that plus or minus will continue. And Paul, that will largely be dependent on differentials and your quality differentials and your transportation, shipping transportation to the West Coast. So when you factor in those 2 variables, you'll be able to back into what will happen here going forward.
John Quaid: Paul, it's John. On the other margin change you see for R&M, not all of it, but it primarily relates to us finalizing our insurance claim for the Galveston Bay reformer. So we would have finalized that, recognize that income in the first quarter and then receive the cash proceeds in Q2. So you have that recognition in Q1, but again, it's the final one. So there's really nothing to offset it in Q2. That's what's driving the change you're seeing there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.
Roger Read: Congrats, Maryann on everything. I'd just like to maybe take a couple of shots at some of the macro stuff here. As we think about the let's -- what we call better than mid-cycle, but whatever new mid-cycle, how you're looking at the structure of the market? And then how that fits in with what's generally been higher utilization throughout the industry, putting a little pressure on cracks here at least for a few months this summer. How maybe you think that works out as we look out over the next, call it, 6 to 12 months?
Maryann Mannen: Sure, Roger, thanks. A couple of things I'd say. First and foremost, over the long haul, we continue to believe in an enhanced mid-cycle, it will continue in the U.S. Clearly, in the short term, we talked a little bit about what we saw happen in Q1, Q2. Q2 coming off of pretty high turnaround across the space on -- in Q1. And then you see, obviously, continued volatility here, supply demand. But over the long haul, as I mentioned, we do not see really any challenge there. There could be supply that comes online. But when you look at demand that we are expecting over the long term, we think that will be absorbed, clearly some short term. China, obviously, that in just recent reports there in terms of where their demands flow is decisions by OPEC, all of which we think could have some short-term volatility. But over the long term, enhanced mid-cycle, we believe, depending on how you think about that mid-cycle, one of the ways that we like to articulate, we're running 1 billion barrels. If you think it's a $1, it's an incremental $1 billion to the MPC portfolio, just a way for you to maybe frame that. I'll pass it to Rick and let him give you a little more color there.
Rick Hessling: Yes. Roger, just a few more comments. So when you look, S&D is really in line with our expectations. It's really what we -- what and where we thought it would be. But when you drill down even further and look at utilization closer to home domestically over the last couple of weeks, even domestic utilization is off some 4%, ironically, bringing us to this 90% utilization level, which is where our guidance is going forward. So we see that as continuing to be very constructive. And then I'll just spend a moment talking about our demand. Our demand within MPC, both domestically and from an export perspective is very steady on the gas and diesel side, and we're seeing really strong signals on the jet side. So we believe those tailwinds, combined with the supply and demand picture, that's truly in balance further backs up our mid-cycle plus thoughts going forward.
Roger Read: I appreciate that. You kind of clip me on my follow-up on the demand side, so I'll leave it there and turn it back to you all.
Operator: Our next question will come from John Royall with JPMorgan.
John Royall: So my first question is just looking at your 90% utilization guide for 3Q. It's pretty low for MPC for 3Q. There is a fair amount of turnaround activity it appears just from the total turnaround dollars. But my question is, is there any economic downtime or pulling forward a turnaround activity or any -- in any way, any kind of response to the weaker crack environment buried in that 90%?
John Quaid: John, it's John. I'll take that to start. You're spot on with the turnaround comment really largely what you're seeing, right, we've got activity, as I mentioned, in the Mid-Con and the Gulf Coast, that's going to affect what we're going to be able to run. And then I'll make an initial comment, turn it over to Rick if he has any further. But really, we're going to continue to run our assets optimally to meet the demand in the market.
Rick Hessling: Yes, John nailed it. We will run economically and 90% is the guidance that we think is a fair number going forward as we're 1/3 of the way through the quarter.
John Royall: Great. And then I was just hoping for a little color operationally on how Martinez is running and ramping towards the target of getting to full by year-end. And relatedly, do you have any concerns about the price of feedstocks getting driven up by a combination of Martinez ramping back to full and Rodeo coming on and ramping its runs of lower feedstocks.
Timothy Aydt: Yes, John, this is Tim. I'll take that one. We continue to believe Martinez is a highly competitive facility. And in the second quarter, we did bring a second unit back online, which did provide us with the ability to run at 75% of the nameplate capacity. And as we have noted in the past, we expect to bring the last production unit online by the end of this year, which would allow the plant to run at 100% of its nameplate capacity. So we're on track for that.
Operator: Next, you will hear from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen.
Jason Gabelman: I wanted to ask, firstly, on shareholder returns and the pace of buybacks moving forward. 2Q was a very strong buyback quarter. If I look adjusting for working capital the past couple of quarters, net debt has increased about $1.5 billion at the parent. I'm just wondering if that's indicative on how you're managing the balance sheet, moving forward as you continue to deploy that excess capacity towards buybacks? Or conversely, do you become a bit more cautious here in the near term with potential for some dislocations perhaps in the stock price moving forward, should things continue to weaken, that maybe presents a more advantageous price to buy at.
Maryann Mannen: Jason, thanks. With respect to buyback, I appreciate the comment on the second quarter, you could see $2.9 billion in the quarter. We continue to see share buyback as an appropriate return of capital, particularly when you look at the current equity price of MPC and what we believe to be over the long term, the growth and opportunity in this equity. So you'll continue to see us use cash to buy back stock. Again, no change to that view as we look at that. Part of the reason you saw that change in net debt, obviously, is quarter-over-quarter. You saw the drawdown in cash. We've talked about what looks like a reasonable place for us to be in terms of the cash position. I can have John share a little bit more about that with you. But we're not near there. So we continue to believe in buybacks, and we'll go forward with that.
Jason Gabelman: Great. And my follow-up is just specifically on results in the Mid-Con. Gross margin came in very strong. I was wondering what drove that? If there was any onetime items or items you would call out for the quarter?
Rick Hessling: Jason, it's Rick Hessling, so no onetime items. What I would tell you is we believe a competitive advantage of our assets in the Mid-Con is our fully integrated system. We've been working for many years to create optionality from what we call cradle to grave when you think refining all the way through our end consumer. And we believe this is and will continue to pull through on our results.
Operator: Our next question will come from Carlos Escalante with Wolfe Research.
Carlos Escalante: This is Carlos. Doug sends his apologies. First of all, congrats on the quarter end. I suppose we would like to know what the appropriate dividend growth policy would be a resumable buyback slowdown, especially considering how strong your MPLX distribution is insofar as providing coverage for you guys in that end.
Maryann Mannen: Thanks for the question, Carlos. With respect to our dividend policy, no change in how we think about that. Some criteria. One, we want that dividend to have the ability to grow. And over the last few years, we look at that in the third quarter, and we'll do so again. But over the last few years, we've grown that dividend over a period of time, about 12.5% compound annual growth in the change of that dividend. We want that dividend to be sustainable and we want that dividend obviously to be competitive. So we'll take another look at that and share with you as we head into the third quarter as we have in prior years. We continue to believe that when we talk about return on capital, we're looking at both dividend and share repurchase, but that our share repurchase is the primary vehicle for us in the return of capital strategy.
Carlos Escalante: And you actually -- that's a good segue for my follow-up question, which is, in the software market, where would your priority be on that same balance of buybacks over balance sheet? And would you consider relevering the balance sheet and to what extent if that's what you choose to do?
Maryann Mannen: No, I don't think we would relever the balance sheet. We've talked about our strategy and structure as it relates to debt to cap. We'll continue to look at that, but don't see a reason at this point that we would relever the MPC balance sheet.
Operator: Next question will come from Matthew Blair with TPH.
Matthew Blair: Congrats on the remarkable quarter. On the refining side, the slides mentioned tailwinds on capture in Q2 from a rise in gasoline margins. But we noticed that you're gasoline yields was actually a little lower than normal at 49%. So could you talk about what kept it low? And do you think that will rebound as we move into the third quarter?
Rick Hessling: Matt, it's Rick. So the yields were really an impact of the feedstock input. And I would tell you that the ultimate capture though was enabled by our ability to capture higher margin with our specific commodities. So it's again an a testament to the team working from cradle to grave to maximize the margin irrespective of the yield percentage.
Matthew Blair: Sounds good. And then sticking with refining. When we look at octane spreads by region, the Midwest really stands out. We're seeing about $40 premiums versus regular gasoline compared to, say, the Gulf Coast around $9. Do you have a sense of what's driving those wide Midwest octane spreads? And is that something that you should be able to capture in your system?
Rick Hessling: Well, it's a great call out. This is Rick again. Yes, so the market is tight right now. There have been some notable disruptions in the Midwest that are straining supply and demand, Matt. And that's definitely been a benefit to us. While it has widen significantly as you've outlined. I would say we do expect a slight pullback to stay where it's at, probably is overly optimistic. But with that being said, constructively right now, the Midwest is tight.
Operator: Our next question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays.
Theresa Chen: Just a quick follow-up on your midstream strategy as it complements R&M. So as you grow that wellhead-to-water footprint in Permian to the Texas Gulf Coast. Is your preference still to keep the commodity exposure at MPC such that if you get that final piece in market LPGs across the water, as your Midstream competitors do and R&M keeps that piece of the earnings. Could that structurally augment R&M capture?
Maryann Mannen: Yes, Theresa, you're correct. We would keep that commodity risk as you well stated, at MPC. No desire to move that commodity risk. I'll pass it to Dave and allow him to give you a little more color there.
David Heppner: Yes, Theresa, I think as we look at building out our wellhead-to-water strategies, one thought through it is from an MPLX lens and building that industry solution, both for MPC and other shippers on the system. And the second piece of the equation as we look at it from an enterprise perspective, where can we complement the MPC, MPLX relationship to create that incremental value. But also, as Maryann touched on, maintaining the commodity risk of that marketing and trading activity more on the MPC books. I hope that helps.
Maryann Mannen: I think it's also the benefit of our integrated asset portfolio, I think you really see that come through.
Kristina Kazarian: All right, Sheila, if there are no other questions. Thank you for your interest in MPC. If you guys have additional questions or would like a clarification on the topics discussed this morning, please reach out and the Investor Relations team will be available to take your calls. Thank you for joining us today.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-30 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MPC First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. My name is Sheila, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin. 
Kristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the investor tab. 
 Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, President; John Quaid, CFO; and other members of the executive team. 
 We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. 
 We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. 
 With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. 
Michael Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Effective March 1, two new Independent Directors join the MPC Board. Eileen Drake and Kimberly Ellison-Taylor have strong records of accomplishment in complex industries making them outstanding additions, and we're happy to have them join our Board. 
 As for the macro refining environment, we remain constructive in our view. Oil demand is at a record high globally, and we expect oil demand to continue to set records into the foreseeable future. Forecasted outlook for this year estimate 1.2 million to 2 million barrels per day of incremental demand over 2023, primarily driven by the growing need for transportation fuels. Within our own domestic and export business, we are seeing steady demand year-over-year for gasoline and growth for diesel and jet fuel. And we continue to believe that 2024 will be another year of record refined product consumption. 
 Global supply remains constrained. Anticipated capacity additions have progressed more slowly than expected. And longer term, the level of announced capacity additions remains limited for the rest of the decade. In the first quarter, high global turnaround activity, the transition to summer gasoline blends, and light product inventories supported refining fundamentals, especially towards the end of the quarter. As we look forward, we believe these fundamentals will support an enhanced mid-cycle environment for the refining industry. 
 We believe the U.S. refining industry will remain structurally advantaged over the rest of the world. Our system has a locational advantage given the accessibility of nearby crude which we believe will grow as cost of transportation increases. The availability of low-cost natural gas, low-cost butane and our refining systems complexity all increase our competitive advantage over the international sources of supply. 
 Even with this outlook, we remain focused on capital discipline while investing to grow earnings at strong returns. In the first quarter, we invested over $1.3 billion in capital expenditures. Investments and acquisitions comprised of attractive refining projects and Midstream investments, including MPLX's $625 million strategic acquisition in the Utica Basin. 
 In Refining, we are investing predominantly at our large competitively advantaged facilities to enhance shareholder value and position MPC well into the future. With a focus on safety and asset reliability, we successfully completed the largest amount of planned maintenance work in MPC's history. Four of our largest and most profitable refineries were in turnaround during the quarter, limiting our financial performance. These assets were in turnaround during a period of lower demand and now we're ready to meet the increased consumption that comes with the summer driving season. 
 In Midstream, MPLX continues to execute on attractive growth opportunities. The Harmon Creek II gas processing plant was placed into service in late February, bringing MPLX's Marcellus processing capacity to 6.5 billion cubic feet per day. And in the Permian Basin, Preakness II is approaching startup and expected to be online by the end of May. We're also building our seventh gas processing plant in the basin, Secretariat, which is expected to be online in the second half of 2025. Once operational, our total processing capacity in the Delaware Basin will be approximately 1.4 billion cubic feet per day, which would average to a pace of roughly one new plant per year since 2018. 
 Additionally, MPLX announced two strategic transactions. First, in the Utica, MPLX enhanced its footprint through the acquisition of additional ownership interest in an existing joint venture and a dry gas gathering system. We've already seen growth in the rich gas window of the Utica and we see new producers moving into the region. 
 Second, MPLX entered into a definitive agreement to combine the Whistler pipeline and Rio Bravo pipeline projects into a newly formed joint venture. The platform expands MPLX's natural gas value chain and positions MPLX for future growth opportunities. MPLX is strategic to MPC's portfolio. Its current $2.2 billion annualized cash distribution MPC fully covers MPC's dividend and more than half of our planned 2024 capital program. We expect MPLX to continue to increase its cash distributions as it pursues growth opportunities, further enhancing the value of this strategic relationship. 
 Our overall capital allocation framework remains consistent. We will invest in sustaining our asset base while paying a secure, competitive and growing dividend, and we intend to grow the company's earnings while exercising strict capital discipline. 
 Beyond these three priorities, we are committed to returning excess capital through share repurchases to meaningfully lower our share count. Demonstrating this commitment, today, we announced an additional $5 billion share repurchase authorization. Our total capital return through share repurchases and dividends since May of 2021 now totals $35 billion with MPC share count reduced by nearly 50%. 
 Let me take a second to share our view on value. We continue to believe share repurchases make sense at the current share price level. When we purchased MPC stock, we are buying into a premier, highly advantaged refining system. We're also buying into a growing Midstream business via our ownership at MPLX. 
 And finally, we are buying strong business execution, disciplined investment and a commitment to capital returns, which will continue to position MPC as an excellent investment. 
 At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann. 
Maryann Mannen: Thank you, Mike. Our team's operational and commercial execution supported our ability to generate earnings per share of $2.58 for the quarter and $3.3 billion of adjusted EBITDA, while having four of our largest refineries in turnaround. This quarter, in conjunction with the planned turnaround activity, we took the opportunity to execute incremental, smaller, high-return, quick-hit projects focused on optimization and reliability initiatives. This planned maintenance activity contributed to a reduction in refinery throughput of nearly 270,000 barrels per day or 9% compared with the fourth quarter. We plan this turnaround activity to occur in the first quarter with a focus on safety and asset integrity and in a period of seasonally weaker demand. 
 Now with a large portion of our 2024 activity complete, we are well positioned to run our refining system near full utilization through the summer driving season. 
 Capture in the quarter was 92% and reflects the seasonal market backdrop. Light product margins were weaker and product inventory builds were both headwinds to quarterly results. Our commitment to commercial excellence remains foundational. We believe that the capabilities we have built over the last few years provide a sustainable advantage versus our peers, and we expect to continue to see the impact in our quarterly results. 
 We are successfully progressing our 2024 capital investment plan. This includes executing on a multiyear infrastructure investment at our Los Angeles refinery and construction of a distillate hydrotreater at our Galveston Bay refinery, both expected to yield returns of approximately 20% or more. 
 In addition to these large projects, we continue to execute on smaller, high-return, quick-hit projects targeted at enhancing refinery yields, improving energy efficiency and lowering our cost. 
 Let me turn the call over to John. 
John Quaid: Thanks, Maryann. Slide 6 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from fourth quarter 2023 to first quarter 2024 as well as the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $300 million, driven primarily by heavy planned turnaround activity, resulting in lower R&M throughputs. 
 To assist with your analysis, we thought it helpful to note the company recorded an $89 million or $0.20 per share charge resulting from the quarterly fair value remeasurement of certain long-term incentive compensation. Aligned with shareholder value creation, the charge was driven by the $53 or 36% increase in our share price as well as our total shareholder return performance versus our peers during the quarter. Again, this charge, which we did not adjust for, reduced earnings by $0.20 per share. 
 The tax rate for the quarter was 18%, resulting in a tax provision of $293 million. While this rate is lower than what we'd expect to receive for the year, it reflects the permanent tax benefits of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in MPLX as well as a discrete benefit related to equity compensation realized in the quarter. 
 Moving to our segment results, Slide 7 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment for the first quarter. Our Refining & Marketing results reflect lower throughputs associated with planned turnaround activity as our refineries ran at 82% utilization processing over 2.4 million barrels of crude per day. Refining operating costs were $6.14 per barrel in the first quarter. Higher sequentially, primarily due to the lower throughputs. Sequentially, per barrel margins were up slightly as higher crack spreads were offset by lower margin capture. 
 Slide 9 shows the changes in our Midstream segment adjusted EBITDA versus the fourth quarter of 2023. Our Midstream segment is growing and generating strong cash flows. In this quarter, MPLX's distribution contributed $550 million in cash flow to MPC. As Mike said, MPLX remains a source of durable earnings in the MPC portfolio and is a differentiator for us. 
 Slide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the first quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was over $1.9 billion in the quarter, driven by both our Refining & Midstream businesses. Working capital was a $389 million use of cash for the quarter, driven primarily by minor builds in crude and refined product inventories mainly related to the turnaround activity. This quarter, capital expenditures, investments and acquisitions were $1.3 billion, including $710 million of growth and maintenance capital and $622 million for MPLX acquisitions net of cash received. Highlighting our steadfast commitment to superior shareholder returns, MPC returned $2.5 billion via repurchases and dividends during the quarter. 
 As Mike commented, earlier today, we announced the approval of an additional $5 billion for share repurchases and as of April 26, we have $8.8 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorizations. And from May of 2021 through April 26 of this year, we have repurchased 312 million shares or 48% of the shares that were outstanding in May of 2021. At the end of the first quarter, MPC had approximately $7.6 billion in consolidated cash and short-term investments, which includes $385 million of MPLX cash. 
 Turning to guidance. On Slide 11, we provide our second quarter outlook. With our significant first quarter turnaround activity behind us, we are projecting higher throughput volumes of nearly 2.8 million barrels per day representing utilization of 94%. Planned turnaround expense is expected to be approximately $200 million in the second quarter, with activity primarily in the Mid-Con region. 
 Operating costs are projected to be $4.95 per barrel in the second quarter, much lower than the first quarter, reflecting the benefit of running our system near full utilization and lower expected operating costs. For the full year, we expect operating cost per barrel to trend towards a more normalized level of $5 per barrel subject to energy cost volatility. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.5 billion for the second quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $200 million. 
 With that, let me pass it back to Mike. 
Michael Hennigan: In summary, our unwavering commitment to safety, operational excellence and sustained commercial improvement positions us well. We will continue to prioritize capital investments to ensure the safe and reliable performance of our assets. We will also invest in projects where we believe there are attractive returns. The enhanced mid-cycle environment should continue longer term, given our advantages over marginal sources of supply and growing global demand. 
 MPLX remains a source of growth and a unique competitive advantage in our portfolio. We believe it will continue to grow its cash distributions to cover both MPC's dividend and capital requirements and still generate excess cash before the first dollar of refining EBITDA is earned. 
 Another way to frame it, MPC has reduced its share count from approximately 650 million in May of 2021, down to approximately 355 million at the end of the first quarter. Over this same time frame, the MPLX units owned by MPC has held roughly flat at approximately 650 million units. So the ratio of MPLX units held by MPC to our outstanding shares or the potential value to MPC on a per share basis from MPLX has nearly doubled. 
 The Midstream business, which continues to grow, provides a unique value proposition for MPC shareholders. We believe MPC is positioned as the refiner investment of choice, with the strongest through-cycle cash generation and the ability to deliver superior returns supported by our steadfast commitment to return capital. 
 Consistent with our goal to have the strongest through-cycle cash generation, even with four of our most profitable refineries in turnaround adjusted on a comparable basis, we still generated more cash from operations than our refining peers. Very proud of the team's accomplishments. 
 With that, let me turn the call back to Kristina. 
Kristina Kazarian: Thanks, Mike. As we open the call up for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we'll reprompt for additional questions. 
 With that, operator, we're ready. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. 
Neil Mehta: I had two questions. The first one, more of an industry one, which is your perspective on the West Coast, we've seen as [ Rodeo ] has shut down in Martinez, West Coast margins have really strengthened here, particularly for gasoline. So what's your outlook as we go into the summer and your thoughts on doing business in California, broadly? 
Michael Hennigan: Neil, I'll let Rick start off with that one. 
Rick Hessling: The market really in California is fundamentally short and it's long diesel. That's kind of the thesis as we look out there. And an example of that is if you look at gasoline inventories, especially right now, they're tight. 
 In fact, they're below the 5-year average and we're seeing solid demand across the integrated system. So I generally would say that's the reasoning for the scenario right now, and I just want to reiterate the market is short gasoline. And so this is an environment that we expect may persist through summer, and we'll see where it goes from there. 
Neil Mehta: And then the follow-up is just on the return of capital cadence. The buyback this quarter, the $2.2 billion was a little bit lighter than what I think many on the street were modeling. Just any thoughts on what, was that a reflection of some of the onetime working capital and M&A dynamics or valuation sensitivity? And how should we think about that over the course of the year? 
Michael Hennigan: Yes. Neil, this is Mike. Thanks for that question. There is no change in our commitment to returning capital, evidenced by the fact that we got the board to authorize another $5 billion. So what I would say to you is, don't read into the quarter-by-quarter variability. 
 To your point, it could have been a little bit higher, but there's a lot of factors that are influencing the activity within the quarter. So the takeaway should be, we are committed and that hasn't changed. We believe in returning capital to shareholders. You're going to continue to see us do that. 
Operator: Next, we will hear from Manav Gupta with UBS. 
Manav Gupta: Guys, in your introductory comments, you did mention that some global capacity was supposed to come on. It's challenge, it's not really come on, I'm trying to understand here, once we go past 2024, like 2025, there's limited capacity expansions that we are aware of. And at this point, I think we understand that 2024 will be above mid-cycle. But based on your commentary, would it be fair to say even Rodeo shutdown and other Houston refinery shutting down, you could well see 2025 also as a year where cracks are well above the mid-cycle levels. 
Michael Hennigan: Yes, Manav, I think you've said it very well. I'll let Rick add some comments. But in general, like we said in our prepared remarks, global supply is constrained. And we are a believer that demand will continue to set records year after year throughout the rest of the decade. So we're very bullish demand with a constrained supply scenario leads us to situation that we have in the market today. We don't see it changing based on everything that we know is available to us, and that's why we have that view. But I'll let Rick add some color. 
Rick Hessling: So I will echo Mike's comments and share what you know and what you're reading is what we're seeing and hearing in the marketplace as well that the expansions appear to be continuously delayed. And with that, Mike mentioned in his opening remarks, we see demand growing by 1.2 to upwards to 2 million barrels a day. So pick a number even in between there and that exceeds Manav, the expansions that may come online, end of year, this year or sometime in 2025. So even with those expansions coming online, we see demand outpacing those expansions and thus, why we're so optimistic on this mid-cycle plus environment lasting. 
Michael Hennigan: And Manav, let me also add that historically, the demand numbers continue to get revised up. I know everybody's real time in their thought process, but it's also good to look back no matter which agency is doing. In fact, the U.S. agency, when they put the monthlies out, have continually for a long period of time, been underestimating gasoline and diesel demand. So it's just another factor that should put on people's radar to really look at all the revisions that have occurred because the demand numbers have been stronger, once they get fully corrected, embedded, then they are sometimes in the real-time disclosures. 
Manav Gupta: Perfect. My quick follow-up here is, I don't think I remember any time when I've seen a $650 million turnaround expense in a single quarter. So this quarter was truly exceptional in the amount of downtime you took. 
 Now we look at second quarter guidance, it's meaningfully up. But if you look at the rest of the year, should we imagine that 1Q truly was exceptional because if you're going to run harder for the rest of the year, that would mean better capture, lower OpEx per barrel, but it would also translate to higher G&P earnings when you translate into the MPLX side. 
Maryann Mannen: It's Maryann. Let me start. So you're absolutely right. We tried to share, as we were on our call last quarter that we expected to have really the largest turnaround in MPC's history in the first quarter, and we did. We had four of our largest assets in turnaround. We think that's important as you well stated, given getting that work done ahead of summer driving season, we think we are well poised for that. 
 You may comment also about the utilization. As you can see from our guidance, utilization is up. OpEx per barrel similarly, when you look quarter-over-quarter, the throughput impacted by the turnaround was certainly a driver. Sequentially, we're down OpEx. And you can see from what we guided in the second quarter as well that OpEx per barrel is actually well below what we printed for the first quarter.
 So I think you said it well. We took the opportunity in the quarter while we had the downtime at those largest plants, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, to work on some projects at those same refineries, those same assets that we think will add reliability in the future as well. Hope that answers your question. 
John Quaid: Yes. And Manav, it's John. Just to build on what Maryann is saying to connect some dots as well. Those additional projects that we took the time to do, right? You can see some of that turnaround, some of that on OpEx but really, we felt like given the window we had and getting ready for the rest of the year, that was the right thing to do. Sorry, I just wanted to add that. 
Manav Gupta: And just to quickly follow up, like the higher throughput also results in higher MPLX earnings for the next quarter, right? 
John Quaid: Yes. Manav, it's John. And I'm not sure this question came up on the MPLX call as well, but I know a little bit about it from my prior role. Remember, there's maybe less sensitivity on the L&S side of that business as refinery utilization moves higher and lower, just given the contractual structure of those contracts. So while there is some sensitivity, it may not be as much as you might be thinking. 
Michael Hennigan: Manav, it's Mike. I just want to add. I think the takeaway is, as Maryann said is, we chose to use the first quarter to take down four of our most profitable refineries. It's a lower demand period in the U.S., et cetera. And our thought process there was spend that money, increase the reliability, get ourselves ready so that we're able to perform in the second and third quarters as we progress out the year. So we think we've positioned ourselves very well despite a heavy spend in the quarter. We're happy that we've done it. We think the assets are in really good shape, and we're looking forward to the rest of the year. 
Operator: Next, we will hear from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. 
Paul Cheng: I guess that maybe different answer. If we look at comparing to your guidance from last quarter, your throughput is lower, OpEx and turnaround expenses are higher than the guidance. Is it all contributed by what you characterized that some of these quick-hit projects that is not originally in the guidance or that something else has contributed that? That's the first question. 
Maryann Mannen: It's Maryann. So yes, I think you characterized it well. We took the opportunity while those assets were down in turnaround to work on a few projects, frankly, wanted each of them that we felt would improve reliability going forward. When you talk about the guidance, throughput, as you said, slightly below that, that we guided, which contributed to the OpEx per barrel number that you saw slightly higher than what we guided. 
 But in general, as you are -- as we're in turnaround and we look at the activity there, we took the opportunity to do what we needed to do to ensure safe reliable operations. And as Mike has already said, given us the opportunity to run hard as we look at the driving season ahead and increase performance. 
Paul Cheng: Okay. The second question is that, maybe this is for Rich. With the TMX part, how that will impact your West Coast operation, will you be able to fully replace the heavy oil and the medium sour that you're currently running over there by the WCS or that will have some kind of configuration limitation because the WCS consists mostly near the bitumen and a lot of condensate but don't have the [ metal ]. 
Rick Hessling: Yes, Paul. Thank you for the question. So on the West Coast specifically, let me maybe back up and share what is public. We do have a TMX commitment on the line and we believe we will be a significant beneficiary because we will receive incremental Canadian advantaged crude not only into Paul, our Pacific Northwest system, but also our West Coast system. 
 And specifically to your question, we'll end up, I believe, having a significant amount of opportunities on the spot market within the Westridge dock, to take potentially barrels to L.A. And because of sulfur limitations, because the majority of people out in the West Coast, I believe, as you know, are running ANS, we believe you'll see somewhat of a dumbbell type blending system where you'll take heavy Canadian with a lighter grade and introduce it into the units out there. But the net-net for us is we believe it will be quite positive for us, not only at Anacortes, our Pacific Northwest refinery but also at L.A. 
Paul Cheng: [ Rich ] can you share that how much WCS you think you may be able to run? 
Rick Hessling: Right now, Paul, that's an unknown. We're continuing to look at the system and we'll look at the economics. So that will vary from month to month. 
Operator: Next, we'll hear from John Royall with JPMorgan. 
John Royall: So my question is a follow-up on capital allocation. You drew cash by about $2 billion at the parent level in 1Q, you now sit at about $7 billion in parent cash. So we're slowly getting closer to the $1 billion minimum cash balance, and I know we aren't there yet, but can you talk about how we should think about the buyback once you get to your minimum cash balance? Should we expect something like 100% of free cash flow paid out given you won't be supplementing with the balance sheet anymore? Just any color on what kind of normal could look like after you've drawn down your cash would be helpful. 
Michael Hennigan: Yes, John, this is Mike. I'll start off by saying we've been fortunate enough to continue to generate cash. That's been a good story for us. Back to Neil's first question, we want to make sure there's no ambiguity. We're committed to returning capital. 
 One of the questions that Neil asked was is it a little lower in the quarter? And I tried to explain to not read into that quarter-to-quarter variability because a lot of factors that impact that. So I think the biggest takeaway is we're huge believers in returning capital to shareholders. And depending on the market conditions, et cetera, we evaluate it at every single quarter. And we try and put a program in place that prioritizes that.
 At the same time, we're also looking at where should we invest. You heard Maryann just talk about, we decided to spend a little bit more money in the first quarter to enhance the reliability of our assets. That's a good decision on our part. It's the first decision in our capital framework. But going forward, I think the big takeaway is you'll continue to see us be a leader in returning capital to shareholders. That's something we believe in. 
 You'll see us be a leader in generating cash among our peers. As I said in my prepared remarks, very happy despite the situation we were in the first quarter with four of our largest, most profitable assets down, we still generated more cash than our peers. So we think that was a good accomplishment. 
 And over time, you're going to see that we'll remain committed to our capital framework, of which -- when will we get to that $1 billion? That's a good question. I don't know that I can predict it depending on how the market treats us. But I think the biggest takeaway is we're committed to returning capital. And as long as we continue to generate cash, we'll continue to do that and reduce the share count going forward. 
John Royall: And then so my follow-up is just on long-term captures. I don't think you're officially calling 100% your long-term capture, but that's certainly where the business has trended. And you talked a lot about of sources of improvements to date. 
 My question is, what are the key drivers going forward of driving that capture from 100% to something like 105% or something larger on a sustainable basis. Are there more singles and doubles you can hit on the commercial side? Is it some of the capital projects you're working at the refineries? I'm just trying to get a sense for where we should be looking for the next wave of improvements on the capture side. 
Maryann Mannen: John, it's Maryann and thanks for the question. As we've been sharing, our commercial performance remains foundational. You heard us talk about last quarter some changes that we made in the organization to continue to focus on value chain optimization. That's clearly an objective that Mike has for the organization. 
 We're not done, we think a lot of the things that we have put in place are sustainable, but we do believe there's opportunities going forward. We like to say that we're approaching 100% over a longer period of time, as you've seen, we did it last year. And as you know, there were things from the market that we can't control. You look at our performance this quarter, as you know, we had weaker light product margins, as I shared. 
 And obviously, the commercial team took some decisions pretty late in the quarter on product inventory build as well. But we will continue to focus on the things that we can, and we do believe there are opportunities that will allow us to continue to improve commercial performance. But we say we're approaching 100%, and we hope you've seen us use that as a deliverable going forward. Ultimately, at the end of the day, as Mike has shared with you, our objective is to deliver the strongest EBITDA per barrel and cash generation relative to our peers, and that remains a key focus when we look at our capture performance. 
Michael Hennigan: Yes, John, I can't help myself to jump in here. I know this capture metric gets a lot of discussion. And Kristina has been steadfast that we need to report on it. I just want to caution, as I always do, that there's a lot of factors, market factors, et cetera, that hit on that. The market should know we're committed to improving our commercial performance. That's obviously a goal here. But the metric that I want is to look at the most is cash. 
 At the end of the day, go to the bottom of the sheet as opposed to all the very different variables throughout it. The most important thing is are we generating the most cash. So that's the metric that I start with as we analyze the performance of the assets, et cetera. So I just want to reiterate that. I know a lot of people like to talk capture, it's not the one that I think tells the story of the business that much. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen. 
Jason Gabelman: I wanted to first ask about the Martinez biofuel projects. It looks like the other income line was close to -- in Refining was close to $200 million this quarter. I think that includes the impact from Martinez. So I was hoping to get an idea of how much that contributed to earnings this quarter and then how you think about the ramp-up in capacity to 100% from current 50%? 
John Quaid: Great. Jason, it's John. Let me take the first part of that, and then I'll turn it over to Maryann. But just to clarify, that other that you're seeing on the R&M walk, it is not related to Martinez. Largely, what you're seeing there are, and you've seen it in prior quarters are some of the insurance proceeds we've recognized in regards to a claim we had at some of our refineries. But I'll turn it over to Maryann to talk about Martinez, but I want to clarify, it's not in that bar. 
Maryann Mannen: Jason, it's Maryann. Thanks for the question. So let me give you an update on Martinez. As you stated, we are currently operating at about 50% of our nameplate capacity. In November, we had a heater tube failure at Martinez and as I shared with you last quarter, we continue to work with all the regulators to align on what repairs are necessary and ensure a safer level operation going forward. 
 We would expect to continue to operate at 50% for the second quarter. And then somewhere mid-third quarter, we would expect to see our capacity increase to about 75% of that nameplate. And again, when I talk about nameplate, I'm talking about 48,000 barrels a day, by the way, just for clarity. And then we do expect to ramp up to full capacity on Martinez by year-end. So again, 50% second quarter ramping to 75% mid-third quarter with full rate capacity by year-end. 
Jason Gabelman: Got it. And that means, I guess, you got approval for the fixes that you need to make in the unit. And then is there any cost OpEx associated with the improvements you need to make at the plant? 
Maryann Mannen: So in our second quarter guidance, we do not have any cost yet included in that second quarter. Yes, we continue to work with regulators to align on the path forward. So we believe, again, continue to work with them, but we believe we understand the work that needs to be done, and we are aligning with our regulators to achieve that. 
Jason Gabelman: Great. And then my other question is -- sorry, Mike, I'm going to go back to this capture metric. And you include just $392 million headwind on Slide 8 of capture impact. Some of that is from product inventory and derivatives. I'm wondering if that amount, if you could share what that is and if that reverses in 2Q. 
Maryann Mannen: It's Maryann. So you'll notice that we try to give you on that slide, we show you the impact that is from crude and the impact from product. And what you saw this quarter is what was normally a very positive impact from product margins really narrowed quite a bit in the first quarter. 
 Alternatively, that crude is typically a key driver. It always pulls capture, and that will ebb and flow just depending on a series of things. But the key driver in this first quarter as you see were product margins, and the inventories, right? We made some commercial decisions, which we think were the right ones, and we made those decisions sort of late in the quarter. But as those market dynamics change, we'll be able to share that with you going forward. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. 
Roger Read: I guess I'd like to dig into here maybe your expectations on crude as we've heard from some of the other companies, what's going on in terms of available barrels out there and you've talked a little bit about the positives on the West Coast. But how should we think about the impact in the Mid-Con down to the Gulf Coast, Mid-Con, thinking the WCS going west instead of south and then along the Gulf Coast, just what you're seeing in terms of available barrel on the heavy-medium to heavy side and thoughts on the light heavy spreads. 
Rick Hessling: Roger, it's Rick. So I'll start with light-heavy spreads. We continue to see them right about where they're at today. Obviously, we've seen the WCS spread come in a few bucks. And ironically, if you look out on the forward curve towards the end of this year, it actually starts to move back out $2 to $3 due to strong Canadian production and diluent blending. So we see this as a little bit of a near-term blip.
 Specifically in the Mid-Con, I do believe there is a misconception that the Mid-Con will be [ short and heavy ]. We don't believe that to be the case. As you know, we're a big buyer in the Mid-Con. And when we look at TMX coming online, we believe the marginal Canadian barrel that's going to get backed out of the system first is the U.S. Gulf Coast export barrel. And so with that being said, when we're looking forward here, whether it's PADD 2, 3 or 5, we expect to generally run about the same mix of Canadian barrels that we've run here in the past several quarters. 
Roger Read: Yes, that makes sense. And I guess if we do see fewer barrels on the Gulf Coast, Canadian or otherwise, what's your anticipation there relative to what you've been running at either Galveston Bay or Garyville? 
Rick Hessling: Yes. We don't see it changing a lot. I will tell you, when we look at Brazilian growth, when we look at [ Guyana ] production, and then Canadian even with some barrels getting backed out. We don't see our mix changing that much, Roger. And then we certainly have barrels that could potentially come from the Middle East if we get the right economic signals. So I would say, all in, I really don't expect a significant change. 
Roger Read: One final clarification on the West Coast. We've heard some say that the acidity of the WCS barrel could be a headwind for running some. And I think when people ask about your ability to run max barrels of WCS, maybe that's what they're getting at. Is there any limitation from a metallurgic kind of physical capacity issue for you on the West Coast? 
Rick Hessling: It is something that will balance, Roger. I believe I said earlier, ANS, the biggest difference is ANS. It has about 5x lower sulfur than WCS. So that's why we believe there will be a lot of blending going on, on the West Coast. But I do believe, in general, you will see it limit other's toolkits on what the amount is that they can run but we've yet to see -- we need to see that play out. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Blair with TPH. 
Matthew Blair: We're seeing octane spreads at record levels. Is that a function of the Tier 3 low sulfur gasoline specs and perhaps any dynamics in the NAFTA market. Could you talk about the drivers here? And how much of MPC's gasoline production is high octane? 
Rick Hessling: Yes, Matt, it's Rick again. So I will tell you, good call out. We're seeing octane values being extremely high. And as you know, we have a lot of reforming capacity. So we are a large octane producer, so we're seeing the benefit. Certainly, you hit on a couple of the reasons. Specs is certainly a region. But I will also tell you, we're seeing strong signals on the export side.
 And when you think about the export market, we're sending over volume there that generally does not have ethanol in it. So that is eating up a lot of octane [ long ] product. And then there is persistent length from the NAFTA market due to poor petchem margins. So that's helping us out on the octane side. 
 And then lastly, more recently here, you're certainly seeing the impact of high turnarounds, just taking octane off the market here in Q1, and it's carrying into Q2, and we see it persisting for a while, Matt. 
Matthew Blair: Sounds good. And then circling back to an earlier question, I think you mentioned you were long diesel in California. Is that a function of RD share approaching 60% or so? And if so, what do you do with those extra diesel barrels? Are they exported to like Mexico or Canada or Asia? 
Rick Hessling: Yes. So great comment. And my comment earlier, the industry, I would say, is long diesel, and we're not alone in that category, we are as well. And you're right, we've got to find export opportunities, Matt, whether anything waterborne where we can find a home to clear the product is what we and others are doing. 
Operator: Our last question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays. 
Theresa Chen: When we think about your marketing margins within R&M, the direction of wholesale gasoline prices benefiting Q4 as they came off and then acting as a headwind in Q1 as prices shot up, how can that move the broader R&M capture quarter-to-quarter or the cash generation from the segment and how should we think about the [indiscernible] into second quarter? 
Rick Hessling: Theresa, can you restate the back half of your question, I'm not sure I caught that part, please. This is Rick. 
Theresa Chen: Sure, Rick. Related to your marketing margins and the move of the flat wholesale [ gasoline ] prices benefiting Q4 as prices declined and then acting as a headwind as they came up on how much is that can really bring noise to the R&M capture quarter-to-quarter? 
Rick Hessling: Yes, good question. So it can be significant. And depending on the region it's just tough, as you pointed out, in an upward market. If you look at Q1 to your point, Theresa, I think we had a $14 flat price increase throughout the quarter. So it definitely was a headwind, and it can be significant. We, amongst all of our competitors need to be competitive at our racks and in an up market, it continues to be a headwind. So I don't have a specific number that I can share with you. but it's definitely a factor in our capture. 
Theresa Chen: Got it. And Mike, going to your earlier comments about MPLX as a strategic investment and with the announcement at the partnership over the past few months and just migration of more and more third-party cash flows, do you have a long-term target for the breakdown of third party to [ GP ] driven EBITDA cash flows over time? And would a shift towards more third-party cash flows help MPC possibly have more flexibility in the upcoming contracting events to take place over the next few years? 
Michael Hennigan: Yes, Theresa, we don't have a target per se using that term. We do have a goal of generating increasing cash flows from third parties as well as optimizing within our own system as well. The point I was trying to make is where we stand today, that distribution from MPLX covers the MPC dividend and more than half of the capital. 
 But going out, and again, this isn't guidance, but if you look at the trend, we're going to continue to increase the MPLX distribution over time. And as you see that occurring and depending on the capital needs at the refining side of the business, the statement I said was there'll be a point where MPLX's distribution will cover the dividend and all of the capital and still have excess cash. That's how unique the competitive advantages of that business. 
 And we've been bullish natural gas growth for a long time. And I always caution, I'm not saying natural gas price, I'm saying natural gas growth volume. We continue to believe that, that has tailwinds behind it whether it's all the topics that have been talked about recently. But as that continues to occur, that ability for MPLX cash generation increase will just continue, and it will get to a point where it's covering the dividend at MPC, the capital at MPC and still generate excess cash. That's where we're headed. So I don't know that we have a target other than that target, and we'll try and keep growing that. 
Kristina Kazarian: All right. With that, thank you so much for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or would you like clarification on topics discussed this morning, please reach out and the IR team will be available to help with your call today. Thank you for joining us. 
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you once again for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-01-30 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MPC Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. My name is Sheila and I will be your operator for today’s call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.
Kristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum’s fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor cab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, President; John Quaid, CFO and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results could differ. Factors that cause actual results to differ are there as well as in our SEC filings. References to MPC Capital during the prepared remarks today reflects standalone MPC Capital, excluding MPLX. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike.
Mike Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call. First, I’d like to recognize some changes we made at our executive management level. Maryann Mannen has been appointed President of MPC. In this role, she will be responsible for our Refining & Marketing, Commercial and HES&S organizations. John Quaid, previously CFO of MPLX succeeds Maryann as CFO of MPC. In addition to these changes, Rick Hessling has been appointed Chief Commercial Officer. Rick will lead our global feedstock and clean products teams with the goal of maximizing margin capture across the entire value chain. Brian Partee has been appointed Chief Global Optimization Officer. Brian will be responsible for assessing and redefining business processes that are critical to improving our performance, including our value chain optimization efforts and determining investments needed to accelerate the delivery of results. At a high level, these organizational changes put more emphasis on advancing important value-creating initiatives, driving increased performance throughout our entire value chain and making a step change in our cash flow generation capability. Turning to our 2023 results. We are pleased to continue to deliver on our strategic commitments. Full year cash provided by operating activities was over $14 billion on a consolidated basis, reflecting our team’s strong execution. Our Refining & Marketing business delivered excellent full year results generating EBITDA of $12.74 per barrel of throughput and capture of 100%. These results reflect strong utilization of our assets and improved execution against our commercial strategy. Incremental to our Refining & Marketing results, our Midstream business posted nearly $6.2 billion of EBITDA. EBITDA for the Midstream segment grew by approximately 7% year-over-year or by approximately $400 million. We expect MPC will receive $2.2 billion of annual cash distributions supported by MPLX’s most recent 10% increase to its quarterly distribution. MPLX is strategic to MPC’s portfolio. Its current pace of cash distributions fully covers MPC’s dividend and more than half of our planned 2024 capital program. We expect MPLX to increase its cash distribution as it pursues growth opportunities further enhancing the value of this strategic relationship. We are committed to returning excess capital to shareholders. In 2023, we returned $11.6 billion through share repurchases, bringing total repurchases to over $29 billion since May of 2021. In addition, we increased MPC’s quarterly dividend by 10% in the fourth quarter. Over the past 5 years, we have grown our quarterly dividend at a compound annual growth rate of over 12%. For the full year 2023, this capital return represents a payout of 92% of our operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment to superior shareholder returns. Executing on our commitments, combined with a strong macro environment led to total shareholder returns of approximately 31% for MPC in 2023. Turning to our view on the refining macro environment as we head into 2024, global oil demand hit a record high in ‘23 and we see another year of record oil consumption in ‘24. The IEA is currently projecting demand growth of over 1.2 million barrels per day with their projections having been raised higher over the last 3 consecutive months. In our system, both domestically and within our export business, we are seeing steady demand year-over-year for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Global supply remains constrained and anticipated global capacity additions have progressed slower than expectations. Gasoline and diesel inventories remained tight globally. And as we look into ‘24, we anticipate that above-average turnaround activity globally in the first quarter as well as the transition to summer gasoline blends will be supportive of refining margins. As we look further into 2024, we believe the U.S. refining industry will experience an enhanced mid-cycle environment due to global supply demand fundamentals and its relative advantages over international sources of supply, including energy costs, feedstock acquisition costs and refinery complexity. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. These include: first, sustaining capital. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. Second, our dividend. We are committed to paying a secure, competitive and growing dividend. We intend to evaluate the dividend at least annually. Third, growth capital. We will invest capital, but be disciplined where we believe there are attractive returns, which will enhance our competitiveness and position MPC well into the future. Beyond these three objectives, we will return excess capital through share repurchases to meaningfully lower our share count. From May of ‘21 through January 2024, we reduced our total share count by approximately 45%, repurchasing approximately 300 million shares at an average price of $97. As we execute in 2024, we remain committed to share repurchases as a key component of our capital allocation priorities. MPC’s standalone 2024 capital investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals $1.25 billion. Underpinning our commitment to safety and environmental performance, sustaining capital is approximately 35% of capital spend. In Refining & Marketing, gross spending is down nearly $200 million compared to 2023, reflecting strong capital discipline. In 2024, we are focused on investments that enhance margin and reduce costs. In low carbon, we are investing in an opportunity that offers an attractive return, lowers our cost, increases reliability and reduces emissions. This morning, MPLX also announced its 2024 capital investment plan of $1.1 billion, which is anchored in the Marcellus and Permian basins. At this point, I’d like to turn the call over to Maryann.
Maryann Mannen: Thanks Mike. Solid execution of our three strategic pillars remains foundational. We believe the improvements we’ve made to our cost structure, portfolio and commercial execution have driven sustainable structural benefits, irrespective of the market environment. We will continue to build on this strong foundation to recognize value throughout our business. Our refining utilization in 2023 was 92% as we operated our portfolio to meet consumer demand. Recently, we have said we believe our average capture over longer periods of time is approaching 100%. And in 2023, our full year capture was 100%. This commitment to commercial excellence is foundational and we expect to continue to see these results. While our capture results will fluctuate based on market dynamics, we believe that the capabilities we have built over the last few years and expect to enhance further will provide a sustainable advantage. Turning to our operations. In the Gulf Coast, the Galveston Bay reformer repairs progressed as planned. We started the unit back up in mid-November and returned to full operating rates by mid-December. At our Martinez facility, we will be operating at approximately 22,000 barrels per day in the short-term. We have been working closely with the regulators to proceed with repairs to ensure safe and reliable operations. Let me move to Slide 7, which shows our capital investment plan for 2024 in a bit more detail. MPC’s investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals $1.25 billion. The plan includes $1.2 billion for Refining & Marketing segments. Our growth capital plan is approximately $825 million between traditional projects and low carbon. We are investing primarily at our large competitively advantaged facilities to enhance shareholder value and position MPC well into the future. Within traditional Refining & Marketing, $100 million is associated with a multiyear project to increase finished distillate yields at the Galveston Bay refinery. $375 million is focused on smaller projects targeted at enhancing yields at our refineries, improving energy efficiency and lowering our cost as well as investments in our branded marketing footprint. Within low carbon, approximately $330 million is allocated to a multiyear infrastructure investment at our Los Angeles refinery, which will improve energy efficiency and lower facility emissions and $20 million for smaller projects focused on emerging opportunities. Slide 8 provides an overview of the multiyear investment at our Los Angeles refinery. The Los Angeles refinery is the core asset in our West Coast value chain and is one of the most competitive refineries in the regions. This investment, once completed, is expected to further enhance its cost competitiveness by integrating and modernizing utility systems, which will improve reliability and increase energy efficiency. Additionally, a portion of this improvement addresses a new regulation mandating further reductions in emissions. This regulation applies to all Southern California refineries. The improvements are expected to be completed by the end of 2025. We expect to generate a return on our investment of approximately 20%. Turning to Slide 9. At Galveston Bay, we are investing to construct a 90,000 barrel per day high-pressure distillate hydrotreater. This project is planned to strengthen the competitiveness of the refinery through increased production of higher value finished products. Once in service, the new distillate hydrotreater will upgrade high sulfur distillate to ultra-low sulfur diesel, eliminating the need for third-party processing or sales into shrinking lower value high sulfur export market. This strategic investment ensures we provide the clean burning fuel of the world demand and further enhances the competitive position of our U.S. Gulf Coast value chain. The project is expected to be complete by year-end 2027 and generate a return of over 20%. Turning to our low carbon initiatives, we challenge ourselves to lead in sustainable energy by setting meaningful targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, methane emissions and fresh water intensity. Targets, which we believe we can demonstrate a tangible pathway to accomplish. In our 2024 capital outlook, we are investing to significantly lower energy intensity and emissions at Los Angeles, one of our largest refineries. Additionally, we are investing in smaller amounts of capital in early-stage developments like RNG which could significantly aid in greenhouse gas emission reductions in the future. Overall, we are taking disciplined steps to advance our goal to lower the carbon intensity of our operations and the products we manufacture, while continuing to supply a growing and evolving market by safely operating our current asset base with the objective to deliver superior cash flow. Let me turn the call over to John.
John Quaid: Thanks, Maryann. Moving to fourth quarter highlights, Slide 11 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.98 for the fourth quarter and $23.63 for the full year. This quarter’s results were adjusted to exclude the $0.14 per share net effect of three items, a $145 million LIFO inventory charge, $47 million of net recoveries related to MPLX’s Garyville incident response, and a $92 million gain recognized by MPLX. Adjusted EBITDA was over $3.5 billion for the quarter and almost $19 billion for the year. Cash flow from operations, excluding working capital changes, was nearly $2.3 billion for the quarter and $13.9 billion for the year. During the quarter, we returned $311 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased over $2.5 billion of our shares. Slide 12 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the third quarter to fourth quarter of 2023 as well as the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $2.2 billion, driven by lower R&M margins. The tax rate for the quarter was 18%, reflecting the impacts of the MPLX structure and a discrete benefit largely related to state taxes. For 2024, we expect our tax rate to be around 21%. Moving to our segment results. Slide 13 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment for the fourth quarter. Our 13 refineries ran at a 91% utilization, processing nearly 2.7 million barrels of crude per day. Sequentially, per barrel margins were lower across all regions driven by lower crack spreads. Capture for the quarter was 122%. Refining operating costs were $5.67 per barrel in the fourth quarter, higher sequentially due to higher energy cost, particularly on the West Coast as well as higher project-related expenses associated with planned turnaround activity. Slide 14 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing margin capture of 122% for the quarter. We ran well and our commercial teams executed effectively to deliver strong results. Capture this quarter benefited from late product margin tailwinds, in particular for jet fuel as well as less of a headwind from secondary product prices. Slide 15 shows the changes in our Midstream segment adjusted EBITDA versus the third quarter of 2023. Our Midstream segment delivered strong fourth quarter results. For the full year 2023, our Midstream segment EBITDA is up 7% compared to the prior year. Our Midstream business is growing and generating strong cash flows as we advance high return growth projects anchored in the Marcellus and Permian basins. Slide 16 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was nearly $2.3 billion in the quarter, driven by both our Refining and Midstream businesses. Working capital was a $1.1 billion use of cash for the quarter, driven primarily by declining crude prices. Cash from ops for the quarter was also impacted by a $320 million headwind from changes in our income tax receivable, which you might usually expect to see as a working capital change. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $896 million this quarter. This includes MPLX’s acquisition of full ownership of a gathering and processing joint venture in the Delaware Basin for approximately $270 million. MPC returned $2.8 billion via share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. This represents an approximate 125% payout of the $2.3 billion of operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment to deliver superior shareholder returns. As of January 26, we have approximately $5.9 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. And at the end of the fourth quarter, MPC had approximately $10.2 billion in consolidated cash and short-term investments, including approximately $1 billion of MPLX cash. Turning to guidance on Slide 17, we provide our first quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of almost 2.5 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 83%. Utilization is forecasted to be lower than fourth quarter levels due mainly to higher turnaround activity. Planned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $600 million. We are executing turnarounds at 4 of our largest refineries, Galveston Bay, Garyville, Los Angeles and Robinson, all in the first quarter when margins are typically lower to minimize the financial impact of these outages. Turnaround expense for the full year is anticipated to be similar to last year at around $1.3 billion. Operating costs in the first quarter are expected to be $5.85 per barrel higher sequentially due mainly to lower throughput volumes associated with the significant planned turnaround activity. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.45 billion for the quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $185 million. And with that, let me pass it back to Mike.
Mike Hennigan: Thanks, John. We’ve delivered strong execution on our strategic commitments again this year. This includes running reliably with high utilization, structural improvements to our commercial performance, fostering a low cost culture and strengthening the competitive position of our assets. At MPLX, the partnership has continued to grow, increasing its cash flow and its cash distribution MPC. We have invested capital to grow earnings while exercising strict capital discipline. This has resulted in superior cash flow generation and supported the repurchase initiatives. Looking forward, we will continue to prioritize capital investments to ensure the safe and reliable performance of our assets, and we will also invest in projects where we believe there are attractive returns. We believe our focus on safety, environmental, I’m sorry, operational excellence and sustained commercial improvement will position us to capture this enhanced mid-cycle environment, which we expect to continue longer-term, given our advantages over marginal sources of supply and growing global demand. MPC’s Midstream segment, consisting primarily of MPLX has grown EBITDA by $1.3 billion since 2019, which is a 6% compound annual growth rate over the last 4 years. As MPLX continues to grow its free cash flow, we believe it’s in a strong position to continue to consistently grow its distributions. As a result of MPLX increase against distribution 10% of reach in the last 2 years, and MPC expects to receive $2.2 billion of cash distribution, which reflects a $400 million increase since 2020. Each 10% distribution increase is approximately $200 million of additional cash flow that MPC receives through its ownership in the partnership. In summary, this year, we generated $14 billion of cash from operations. We increased our dividend 10%, repurchased $11.6 billion of shares, resulting in a 92% payout ratio. In 2023, MPC’s total shareholder return was 31%. We believe MPC is positioned as the refinery investment of choice with the strongest through-cycle cash generation and the ability to deliver superior return to our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back over to Kristina.
Kristina Kazarian: Thanks Mike. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we will reprompt for additional questions. Sheila, we’re ready.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Neil Mehta: Yes. Good morning, Mike. Good morning, team. Thanks for doing this great quarter. The first question is really on Slide 14, and this is what we’re getting from investors this morning, which is the 122% system capture and that $885 million of margin uplift. And I recognize there is some sensitivities about what you can say and can’t say here. But just can you talk about what drove that strength? And how much of this feels one-timeish versus stuff we want to carry forward?
Maryann Mannen: Hey, Neil, good morning. It’s Maryann. Thanks for the question. So first and foremost, as you know, commercial performance has been and will continue to be a foundational pillar for us in terms of delivering outstanding execution and meeting the goals and objectives that Mike shared with you around delivering best through cycle cash flow throughout the cycles. In the quarter, we generated about 122% capture as we shared. Overall, as you know, we’ve been talking about our ability to continue to drive toward 100%. Over the last couple of quarters, Rick and Brian have been sharing with you some of the key elements around structural changes that we believe are sustainable, and then Mike announced this morning a couple of other changes, which we think will continue to drive our ability to identify and deliver against that foundational principles. In the quarter, we had a couple of benefits that delivered the 122%. So first of all, strong light product margins and frankly, a more favorable secondary products impact. This is not abnormal for this period of time. Having said that, we also saw stronger jet fuel premiums to diesel and the benefit of diesel blending, excuse me, of butane blending in the quarter as well. To your question, how much of this is repeatable? Obviously, some of those things are not repeatable, particularly when we look at the sharper drop in crude oil and refined product prices. We also did have the ability of having, as I shared with you, our reformer at GVR and other benefits of projects that we completed fully operating in the quarter. So let me pause there and see if that helped to answer your question at all.
Neil Mehta: That’s great, Maryann it’s a lot of good color there. The follow-up is just on Slide 17, sticking with the deck here, which is it does seem like a period of heavier turnaround in Q1, particularly in the West Coast region. Maybe talk about the decision around where you took maintenance, how that fits into the full year plan? And anything we should be thinking about as you approach this turnaround season?
Mike Hennigan: Yes, Neil, it’s Mike. Yes, I think we said in our prepared remarks that our turnaround spend this year is about the same as last year. But the way you should think about it is, as Maryann mentioned, in the first quarter, we’re pretty heavy at four of our largest facilities, our largest financial generating facility. So we’re taking advantage of the fact that margins are down in the first quarter. So we’re spending $600 million in the first quarter, which is a high number, relative to the full year. And I know we don’t traditionally give quarter-to-quarter, but I’ll just tell you that next quarter, the turnaround number drops down to like $200 million or so, somewhere in that range. So we’re being opportunistic in some regard. A lot of the activity does get planned, but at the same time, we want to take advantage of the fact that the margin environment now is constructive for us to be off-line so that when margins, we think, are going to be a lot stronger in the second quarter, we will have our four largest facilities turn around and ready to deliver results.
Neil Mehta: Thanks, Mike.
Mike Hennigan: You are welcome, Neil.
Operator: Our next question will come from Manav Gupta with UBS. Your line is open.
Manav Gupta: First of all, congrats guys. I know one of the goals was to get to 100% capture, although Mike always stays focused on EBITDA per barrel margin and free cash. I know one of the goals was to get to 100% capture. So congrats on overshooting that mark. My question here is on the two growth projects. Los Angeles. Some of the people out there are looking to exit the state given the tougher laws, you were actually going back and investing in this project. So help us understand what’s driving that? And again, on the Galveston Bay moving from upgrading high sulfur to ULSD, what kind of realization uplift could you get if you do execute this project?
Mike Hennigan: Yes, Manav, this is Mike. I’ll start. First of all, thank you for the comment on capture. And as you said, it’s not my favorite metric, but I’m a big believer in how much cash are we generating, how much cash per share we’re generating. And I want to lead in those categories is the metric that I spend the most time looking at. But, it does get some good indication, as Mary said, it’s hard just to differentiate the question Neil asked between what’s happening in the market? And what are some of the structural improvements that we’ve implemented over the last couple of years here. But anyway, thanks for the comment. As far as our capital investment, I’m hoping everybody sees a couple of things. One is, yes, we are investing in our L.A. facility. It’s an area where we believe that we can put a decent amount of investment in there and really improve the competitiveness of that facility, but we already believe it’s one of the top facilities on the West Coast. So it is an area that we want to invest in. Now that particular investment is about efficiency, reliability and lowering our costs. And to your point, being a very reliable supplier out there is an important part of the equation. The other project that we’ve announced is a margin enhancement project. And in our view, things are not going to get easier for unhydrotreated distillate into the future. And if you look at the spreads today, even today, they are pretty wide. So at the end of the day, what’s driving us the most in both of those, when we put this in the slides is we think both of these projects are north of 20% returns. And hopefully, we’re conservative on that, but we think they are very good investments and again, in two of our largest, highest financial generating facilities. So one of the themes that you’ve heard from us is we’re going to invest in projects that we feel really strong about on a return basis, but they are also enhancing in competitive positions of some of our biggest facilities. And I think you’ve heard the theme from us for a while here. It’s margin enhancement, lower cost and efficiencies. And out on the West Coast, the other driver is there is emissions reductions goals that are going to occur over time, and this project will take care of that in a large way, and that’s why we grouped it into our low-carbon area. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color.
Manav Gupta: Perfect. My quick follow-up here is you were looking to ramp towards the nameplate capacity at your renewable diesel project on the West Coast. If you can give us some update over there, how is that project progressing?
Maryann Mannen: Certainly, it’s Maryann. Currently, we are running at about 22,000 barrels a day versus our nameplate at 48,000. We’re going to continue to run at that level as we work with the regulators to determine what repairs need to be complete in order to be able to get to that nameplate at 48,000. As we think about that, as you know, we’ve got our JV partnership with Neste, so really, what we’re looking at is the differential for MPC of about 13,000 barrels a day. So not meaningful to the 3 million-barrel system that we run. But again, running at 22,000 overall for the facility, and we will continue to work with our regulators to determine when we can bring it to full 48,000.
Manav Gupta: Thank you so much.
Mike Hennigan: You are welcome, Manav.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we will hear from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Securities. You may proceed.
Doug Leggate: Hi, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Mike, I hate to do this. So I wonder if I could try to capture a question in a slightly different way because we, I guess have a slightly different view of this. If you look at your system as more of an LP, we see a great deal of linearity between the indicator margin and what you’re delivering. I think I agree with you. I think capture is a terrible metric to try and measure a linear program business, frankly. But what we do see, however, is that the mix of inputs seems to be changing some, which is allowing you to capture more of the margin. So my question is really that. What are you doing in your commercial business or operations that is changing the optimization of the slate that you’re running in your system? Obviously, there are a lot of moving parts around crude in the U.S. right now with TMX and a few other things. Is that a factor?
Rick Hessling: Yes. Hi, Doug, this is Rick. So I’ll take a stab at that. So we are significantly I would say every day, Doug, we are optimizing our slate. And we look at this regionally. We look at this by plant. But in the end, Doug, I think what we do better than others in the industry, is we optimize for the betterment of our total return at the end of the day. So we are not, we could suboptimize one plant for the benefit of another, and we have worked years, decades, as a matter of fact, to give ourselves optionality within our Mid-Con system. We are currently juggling optionality with TMX and our West Coast and Pacific Northwest system as well as we’ve worked on it for quite a while on the Gulf Coast. So you are onto something from a crude slate perspective. It’s constantly changing. We’re constantly pushing the norm on what we should run, what crudes we look at, what assays we look at, updating our system. So this is just an ongoing exercise that’s been happening now for several years now. And I’ve said it before, we’re unpacking everything from A to Z, Doug, we’re leaving no rock unturned in terms of capturing value. And that not only goes certainly on the crude slate side, but it goes throughout our entire value chain.
Mike Hennigan: And Doug, it’s Mike. I know it’s been a source of frustration since we don’t give a lot of detail in this area for competitive reasons. But to Rick’s point, we’ve made some changes. And to be honest with you, I’m more excited about what’s in the future for us. Brian’s new role as Head of Global Optimization for us, I think, is going to make a step change for where we’re going. So we’ve had a lot of momentum in this area. It’s showing up in the results. As we discussed, capture is not my favorite, but generating cash is. And at the end of the day, I think we have more opportunity in the whole area. If we run well and then deliver commercially, we will continue to generate cash and be a good source of return for shareholders.
Doug Leggate: LPs are a complicated beast and you guys seem to have figured it out. So thank you for the answer, guys. My follow-up is probably for, it might be for Maryann. I’m not sure. Congratulations to everyone on the new roles. But Maryann, if I look at Slide 21, you’re showing your debt maturity profile at the MPC level. Obviously, sitting with a net cash position at the MPC level, what are your thoughts on where you want your balance sheet to be as those debt maturities come due?
John Quaid: Hey, good morning, Doug, it’s John. I’ll go ahead and take that.
Doug Leggate: I wasn’t sure if you take or not. Thank you.
John Quaid: No, no, not a problem at all. And I think you kind of – were hinting at it as you were getting there. We’ve got a lot of financial flexibility right now. We’re very comfortable with the gross amount of debt that MPC has but certainly have the balance sheet to be very thoughtful about the right timing of refinancing that debt and really optimizing our cost of capital and really that cost of debt. And I think longer-term, right, we’ve laid out a target of kind of the gross debt to cap of 25% to 30%. We’re a good bit away from that, but that’s something we will continue to monitor as we look out into the future.
Doug Leggate: And John, remind me, is that consolidated for MPLX or stand-alone?
John Quaid: It’s stand-alone.
Doug Leggate: Okay, thank you.
John Quaid: In a much different position, I can probably speak to that one pretty well just given the seat I was in before, or. You’ve got a really stable company running at sub-3.5% leverage, but the cash flows there can probably support a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4x. Again, they have got some financial flexibility to be smart about what they are doing as well. So I think both balance sheets are in a really strong place.
Doug Leggate: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is open.
Paul Cheng: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Mike Hennigan: Good morning, Paul.
Paul Cheng: Mike, I think in the past, you have shown that you are not really interested in acquisition of refining assets. But one may argue that, I mean, given how well you are running your facility, do you think that there is a value to be added to have some additional assets to your platform so you can apply your technical know-how to even a bigger profile. And also in the Gulf Coast, you have two huge refineries. If we add additional facility, would that further diversify and reduce the operating risk, having multiple facilities and also, frankly, that will perhaps even increased commercial and optimization opportunities. So just want to see that, I mean, how you guys look at that question internally?
Mike Hennigan: Yes. Paul, first off, Dave Heppner’s group is constantly looking at the market and what assets are available I always say I never say never. But in the meantime, while Dave is working on that side of the equation, we’re also looking at the footprint we have and the assets we have. And that’s part of the reason that we came out with the announcement today. Two of our key facilities, we think we can make a meaningful change. And we’ve been more transparent than normal to try and explain to people. We think we got north of 20% return projects here on the assets that we own ourselves. So, there is always a balance call between, obviously, the assets you own, you know inside and out, whereas the ones you’re evaluating externally, there is a little bit of concern from diligence, etcetera. But I will tell you, I think people know my DNA in general. But at the same time, Dave and his team are challenging where can we make investments that are outside of our portfolio. We haven’t done a lot, as you mentioned on the refining side. But we have made some investments overcalling low carbon. We made some investments in some pretreat facilities on the low carbon side. We’ve invested in an RNG facility. So Dave and his team are looking at both refining and outside of refining. And we just constantly talk about that and decide where do we think we want to put our capital. And for today, we’re pleased to report that we think we have two pretty good projects. But the other part, let me just mention this one last thing because this is kind of important. On the slide where we talk about our capital, we say in traditional refining, we’re investing $475 million. Maryann mentioned that $100 million of that is related to the DHT project, but $375 million of that is what we don’t typically talk about on earnings calls. These are projects in all of our facilities that are higher returns, really good projects for us, but they don’t have the sexy headline about them. But if you look at it, though, $375 million out of the $475 million in traditional are these smaller high-return projects. So, the team does a nice job. Tim and his organization are constantly looking for areas where we can make margin improvement, lower cost, increase reliability. As you said, this all starts with you got to run reliably, and then you got to be smart commercially. And I think we’ve demonstrated that a little bit, and then we just try to invest capital to keep bolstering that equation. So hopefully, that gives you a little more color.
Paul Cheng: Absolutely. Can I just go back into the commercial question? In the fourth quarter, you guys definitely done well in the [indiscernible]. And if we’re looking at versus the margin capture of 100 additional 22%, is there a number that you can share how much of them is coming from the commercial side of the business that you have done really well? And that’s why that you are seeing that much better in the capture. And also that I think in the past, you’re saying that one of the maybe Holy Grail for commercial operations is that you will be able to optimize based on breakdown the [indiscernible] and optimized based on the total company. Where are we in that process? Do you think that you are already there or that you are just still stretching the surface on that process?
Mike Hennigan: Paul, I will start with the second part. As I have said, I will repeat myself a little bit, but we still think there is quite a ways to go where we can do better, and that was part of the reasoning behind the organizational change. Brian’s role as global optimization lead is going to his team is going to work with the commercial guys with our refining guys. And you heard me say we define process, find places to invest, change what we are doing today. So, I think we have made a lot of progress. People always ask what inning or I guess it’s football season, so what quarter are we in. And that’s always hard to ascertain because I think we keep peeling the onion back and seeing that we can make another step change. So, I am optimistic that we got a lot of road to go. And I think at the end of the day, our mantra is we will just keep watching our results and you will see what comes out of it. As far as the first part, it’s always hard. That’s why I am not the biggest fan of that metric. It’s always hard to differentiate some of the market factors that Maryann mentioned. Obviously, the fourth quarter, you get butane blending as one thing that enhances capture. But there is a significant, if I want to give some kudos to our team, there is a significant change in the way we are approaching the business. You heard from Rick earlier. And so I think it is additive to whatever the market has given us. And my thought is the way we have to run the company is we don’t control the margin environment, but whatever margin environment is given to us, we just got to deliver more results and generate more cash and more cash per share. So, while everybody outside and inside wants to talk about that capture metric, I just keep looking at the one that matters the most to me.
Paul Cheng: Thank you.
Mike Hennigan: You’re welcome.
Maryann Mannen: Hey Paul, it’s Maryann. I just might try to add a bit more around some of the things that we are doing specifically around commercial performance without necessarily trying to give you a percentage. But we have been talking over the last several quarters about the capabilities we have built regionally, obviously, at Houston office and Singapore office or London office. That has helped us. That was laughingly saying to Mike about cracking the code on linear programming. But some of the capabilities that Rick and Brian and their respective teams have built historically give us very robust tools and data analytics that allow us to assess the decisions that we have made and know how good or bad those decisions were and what we might do with that to change it. So, it is building. These capabilities are building sustainable learnings and capabilities in the organization that we think will continue to drive our performance. I hope that’s a bit more helpful, too.
Paul Cheng: Absolutely. Thank you, Maryann.
Operator: Next, you will hear from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.
Roger Read: Yes. Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter.
Mike Hennigan: Thank you, Roger.
Roger Read: Maybe just if we could address the changes here on the management team and whether or not that, what’s in – what it does portend about the future? I know, Mike, you are approaching the point at which the Board has to make a decision to extend if I understood correctly from the meetings back in late November. So, anything you can offer us up on any updates there?
Mike Hennigan: Yes. Roger, I will start off with, the changes are driven by two things. Results, one of the things that I feel my responsibility is to reward the results that we are getting because the team has done a very nice effort across the whole team. And the second part is development, putting people in positions such that they grow more personally so that they can contribute to the team. So, both of those factors, I think played into a lot of these assessments that occurred at the executive level, but it’s also occurring below that and not everybody gets to see. So, I am a big believer in the team approach, practically all decisions that we make, all of our team is involved in. So, there is a heavy component of development on top of the results that have occurred in the last couple of years. As far as me, personally, I think you have heard in the past, that’s a Board decision. The Board is very aware of that. That will play itself out in time. But Board’s, if it’s not their top priority, it’s obviously at the very top of the first couple is what their responsibility is. So, that’s just work in progress. It’s been in progress for quite some time, and it will play itself out as time goes by.
Roger Read: Okay. And then my other question was to follow-up a little bit on the balance sheet question, I think that I get asked about in debt-to-cap guidance given. But if you keep buying shares back, theoretically it could end up shrinking the equity side, which could get you to the 25%, even if you held debt flat. So, one of us can predict the future exactly where all this will shake out. But would that sort of math imply that you could actually end up staying at the same debt level? In other words, simply refinance the debt, implying that all the cash that’s on there would be eligible for share repurchases or some other sort of return to shareholders, and that’s the right math to follow?
John Quaid: Hey Roger, it’s John. You read through my subtle comments very, very well. And certainly, the other part of that equation, right, is what we are doing on the equity side. So, that was my comment, hey, we think our gross levels of debt are appropriate as we look forward, because that will be part of the math. We will take a look at that, but I think you are pretty spot on. I am not sure I can add much from what you said to be honest.
Mike Hennigan: Roger, the other thing I would add is – I am sorry, I just wanted to just add. As a general rule, my belief is we don’t want to be under-levered. We don’t want to be over-levered. We want to find what we think is the appropriate level. And we think we have been there and we have been consistent there. And that’s why people should read into our cash position as that’s going to be targeted for return to shareholders. I think our job is to generate the most cash we can, run the balance sheet properly, which we have done over the past, and then at the end of the day, return excess capital to shareholders.
Roger Read: Thanks.
Mike Hennigan: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from John Royall with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
John Royall: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, I just had a follow-up on the balance sheet. You had another strong quarter for the buyback of $2.5 billion. But with the crack environment turning down, you did end up drawing almost $3 billion of cash. And despite the big maintenance coming up in 1Q, it looks like January is off to a really healthy pace at $900 million. So, my question is, would you expect to maintain a similar pace throughout 1Q as you progress these turnarounds? And what could that mean for the cash draw and where balances could be at the end of 1Q?
John Quaid: Yes. Hi. Good morning John, it’s John here. I will take that one and let Mike add some other comments as well. But let me just start by saying, as I roll into the seat, I want to be clear, there is no change in how we are viewing return of capital, as you heard even in Mike’s prepared remarks. Again, really strong performance last year, again, as we are looking to drive strong returns to our investors, and that will continue to be a key part of our capital allocation priorities in 2024. And as we look at that, we are going to look at lots of things. One, we want to be opportunistic in the overall capital allocation and we will consider the refining macro environment along with lots of other items, but – and the balance sheet and where it is. But ultimately, I just want to be clear, we are going to be steadfast in our commitment to return of capital.
Mike Hennigan: John, it’s Mike. The only thing that I will add is we think it’s part of our DNA and duty to return capital as part of our mantra. So, we have been saying for quite some time, and we have been fortunate, as you said, the margin environment has been conducive to generating more cash. But we have targeted all along to return that capital to shareholders. We are going to continue to do that. And then again, whatever market environment we get handled, or get handed, I am sorry, we will make that still a priority for us. It’s on our capital allocation priority. We will start off with maintaining the assets, growing the dividend, investing in the business. So, that’s still part of our DNA as well. But at the end, I am a huge believer is, give that capital back to shareholders and then let shareholders decide where they want to invest longer term. We want to be the vehicle where we generate cash and return capital, and as people have seen that over time, that isn’t going to change regardless of what the margin environment is.
John Royall: Great. Thank you. And then I apologize ahead of time to Mike for this, but I do have another question on capture. But the commercial stuff aside, can you help us think about some of the moving pieces in the first quarter? And particularly, how should we think about the impact of the heavy maintenance in the quarter? Is this still a potential to be 100% maintenance, given you have so much maintenance and any other moving pieces that we should think about that might move you away from that 100% either direction in 1Q?
Maryann Mannen: Hey John, it’s Maryann and let me see if I can take that for you and address your question. So, first and foremost, we would say we continue to think for 2024. Our objective is to drive towards that 100%. You are absolutely right in the quarter. As we have said, we have got about $600 million, but we are touching crude units. So, we are not expecting a significant amount of negative impact on our capture, despite the fact that we are seeing that level of turnaround. Now, as you know, we do have variables that impact the capture rate from quarter-to-quarter. But right now, we are not expecting turnaround to have a substantially negative impact on that drive towards 100%.
John Royall: Great. Thank you very much.
Maryann Mannen: You’re welcome.
Operator: Our next question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Your line is open.
Theresa Chen: Hi. I wanted to ask about [Technical Difficulty] including within your own system, which should be constructive for inventories going to summer, but internationally, there is quite a bit of new supply coming online. And one of your competitors has talked about 1.5 million barrels per day number. Would you agree with that? And how much do you think could be realistically utilized?
Rick Hessling: Hi Theresa, this is Rick. I will attack the new refining capacity first. So, we see that coming on later versus sooner. And when I say later, I would say second half of this year and then some over the years, when you bring on new greenfield facilities, which are being brought on, it’s been proven difficult to bring them on in a timely fashion. And these specific facilities like others, we will face challenges with logistics and supply. So, I won’t specifically comment on the 1.5 million barrels, but I will say we believe it will be later versus earlier. And then for the demand piece specifically, certainly, you have seen, as you referenced, utilization even here recently down 7% in the last week due to turnarounds and weather-related events. When we look at that and look going forward, we are continuing to see steady demand. As Mike mentioned in his opening remarks, our export book on gas and diesel has been very solid. It was solid in 2023, and we are off to a very good start in ‘24. So, when we look at all of this together, we see it setting up very well, Theresa, for a very supportive spring and summer season.
Mike Hennigan: Theresa, it’s Mike. I will just add. I mean it’s pretty well documented. I mean last year, oil demand globally was over 2 million barrels a day. I know some of the forecasters are calling it 1 million barrels plus-ish. We will see how that plays itself out for this year. But I think the bigger picture, even though there has been a lot of attention, particularly to these two refineries that are coming up, as Rick mentioned later in the year. The reason we believe it’s more constructive over time is we are still believers in demand is going to continue to rise. And absent this short-term issue with some of the supply coming on, we just see it very constructive where demand is going to continue to outpace, and that’s why we think the margins will stay in an above mid-cycle of the term everybody is using. I think at the end of the day, we will obviously keep a watch out it, and there may be some short-term variations to that. But I think part of the reason that we remain bullish is that if we look over time, we are just big believers in demand is going to stay robust. And on paper, aside from the short-term issue, we don’t see a whole lot of supply response, trying to match that. Hopefully, that makes sense to you.
Theresa Chen: Thank you.
Mike Hennigan: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Ryan Todd: Great. Thanks. Maybe as a follow-up on that last question, in your prepared remarks, I mean you mentioned that you, what you view as an enhanced mid-cycle environment for U.S. refiners in the coming years. I mean I think you were just talking about some of the broader global supply and demand that I think would feed into that. But can you maybe talk a little bit more about what you view as the primary drivers that uplift the margins, particularly for U.S. refiners. And when you think about the go-forward environment versus go-forward mid-cycle versus past mid-cycle, do you – what sort of uplift can, or do you think about $1 a barrel, $2 a barrel is there, and how do you underpin that in terms of kind of U.S. advantages for you and your system?
Rick Hessling: Yes. Ryan, it’s Rick. So, for U.S. advantages, they are quite significant. Mike touched on early on in his prepared remarks, we have a feedstock advantage here in North America with feedstock at our doorstep, and we have access to crude from around the world. So, we believe that’s a significant advantage. And it’s been very well documented. We have an energy advantage with the U.S. being extremely long in nat gas, and we have cheap nat gas prices. But in addition to that, when we look at our workforce, at our assets and our refinery complexity, when you start layering all of those on top of one another, Ryan, it adds up significantly to an advantage, which is why Mike referenced earlier, we believe in an enhanced mid-cycle. Now, when you think of it from our perspective, this is where our scale really comes into play. So, we run a 1 billion barrel of system, a 1 billion barrel system annually. So, you can pick the number. We won’t give you a number, but it’s easy math. If it’s mid-cycle plus $1, that adds $1 billion to MPC’s bottom line, a $2 incentive or enhancement over mid-cycle, $2 billion. So, that’s where our scale really comes into play. Now, we are bullish because of a lot of the reasons Mike mentioned. Global demand, we believe will hit a record consumption in ‘24. ‘23 was a record, we believe ‘24 will be a record. IEA believes ‘24 will be a record. In fact, IEA continues to revise up their demand forecast month-after-month and have done so for the last three months. In addition, we referenced turnarounds. Globally, turnarounds are high. When you are looking at history and we are set up well here for a strong spring and summer. I hope that helps you.
Mike Hennigan: Hi Ryan, it’s Mike. Let me just add. We don’t pick a number. We do scenario planning, like Rick have gave you some examples. But – so we do scenario planning, what if it’s $2, what if it’s $4, what if it’s $6 and take a look at it from that perspective rather than trying to estimate what the number is. I am a big believer and it’s hard to call the 50-yard line, but if we get the banks of the river we get the two end zones, right. Then we will be able to run the business properly for the long-term.
Operator: And we do have time for just one more question. Our last question will come from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen. Your line is open.
Jason Gabelman: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask about the West Coast project that you disclosed today and a two-part question on it. First, when you referenced the returns, how much – is there a decent chunk of that that’s related to avoided regulatory penalties that you would incur if you didn’t do the project? And then how do you get comfortable with the demand outlook on the West Coast and the potential regulations that can limit MPC’s ability to capture periods where product prices are higher?
Mike Hennigan: So, Jason, on your first part, there is nothing that you said was avoiding costs, however. So, nothing is related to that. So, it’s a – think of it as a reliability project, a modernization project, an efficiency project, a lower-cost project, and reducing greenhouse gas, which we need to do out there. There is regulations out there that are going to occur over time. We could have made the choice to wait until that regulatory requirement was there, but we saw an opportunity to enhance the facility ahead of time. And we have kind of disclosed already, we think there is greater than 20% return there. How do we get comfortable in the overall macro, there is going to be a tough environment for California, if things get more and more competitive out there. But we think we have a very competitive asset. So, we think we are in it for the long-term. We don’t think all the facilities out there will survive the long-term, but as that volatility occurs out there, we want to have a really strong, competitive, reliable, efficient, low-cost facility.
Rick Hessling: Jason, I will just add to that. We believe our integrated system in California is a competitive advantage over the merchant refiner as well. So, when you look across our entire value chain from feedstocks and all the way through to the station level, that’s a competitive advantage over the merchant refinery when you have demand declines.
Kristina Kazarian: Alright. And with that, thank you for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or like clarification on any of the topics discussed this morning, please reach out and a member of the Investor Relations team will be here to help you. Thank you for joining us.
Operator: That does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-31 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MPC Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. My name is Sheila and I will be your operator for today’s call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.
Kristina Kazarian: Welcome to the Marathon Petroleum Corporation third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investors tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. References to MPC’s refining utilization for the third quarter, as well as fourth quarter guidance now include the addition of approximately 40,000 barrels a day of capacity related to STAR in our Gulf Coast region. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Mike.
Mike Hennigan : Thank you, Kristina. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call. Beginning with our view on the refining environment, in the third quarter, we saw strong demand and global supply tightness supporting refining margins. Diesel cracks led the barrels inventories remain tight and European distillate production ran below capacity. Globally, oil demand is at a record high as the need for affordable and reliable energy increases throughout the world. In our system, both domestically and within our export business, we are seeing steady demand year-over-year across the gasoline and diesel and demand for jet fuel continues to grow. Global supply remains constrained and global capacity additions have progressed at a slow pace. In the regions where we operate, seasonal butane blending has increased gasoline supply. However, we expect typical seasonal turnarounds to be supportive of cracks. To that end, we’ve seen 3.5 million barrels of gasoline inventory drawn out of the U.S. system over the past several weeks. OPEC+ has reduced production, adding pressure to medium sour differentials. While crude differentials have generally been narrowing, we have seen WCS widen and we’re strategically situated to run heavy Canadian crude at our refineries across PADDs 2, 3 and 5. As we look towards 2024, we believe an enhanced mid-cycle environment will continue in the U.S. due to the global supply demand fundamentals and the relative advantages over international sources of supply, including energy costs, feedstock acquisition costs and refinery complexity. Turning to our results, in the third quarter, we delivered strong cash generation across our business. In Refining & Marketing, strong margins, 94% utilization and solid commercial performance led the segment adjusted EBITDA of $4.4 billion or $16.06 per barrel. Our Midstream segment delivered durable and growing earnings. This quarter, it generated segment adjusted EBITDA of over $1.5 billion. Year-to-date, our Midstream segment EBITDA is up 6% compared to the prior year period. The strength of MPLX’s cash flows supported its decision to increase its quarterly distribution by another 10%. With this increase, MPC is expected to receive $2.2 billion of distributions from MPLX annually. MPLX is strategic to MPC’s portfolio. Its current pace of cash distributions fully covers MPC’s dividend and more than half of our planned 2023 capital program. We expect MPLX’s cash distribution to continue growing as it pursues growth opportunities, which will further enhance the value of this strategic relationship. We believe MPC’s current capital allocation priorities are optimal for our shareholders. In the third quarter, we returned $3.1 billion to MPC shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Last week, we announced an additional $5 billion share repurchase authorization and a 10% increase to MPC’s quarterly dividend. With this increase, we have grown our quarterly dividend at over 12% compound annual rate over the past five years, which has led our refining peers. Our overall capital allocation framework remains consistent. We will invest in sustaining our asset base, while paying a secure competitive and growing dividend. We intend to grow the Company’s earnings and we will exercise strict capital discipline. And beyond these three priorities, we are firmly committed to returning excess capital through share repurchases to meaningfully lower our share count. Let me also share some of the progress on our low carbon initiatives. The Martinez Renewables fuel facility is being delivered safely, on time, and on budget, and by the end of 2023, the facility is expected to produce 730 million gallons per year. At that point, Martinez will be among the largest renewable diesel facilities with a competitive operating profile, robust logistics flexibility, and advantaged feedstock slate and should benefit from the global strategic relationship with Neste. Our Dickinson renewable diesel facility is operating well. The facility processed 75% advantaged feed in the third quarter. The nearby Spiritwood soybean processing plant, which is owned through a joint venture with ADM, is expected to deliver enough vegetable oil to produce approximately 75 million gallons per year of renewable diesel. Additionally, we are advancing early stage developments through our interest in low carbon intensity RNG and other small scale investments. We believe through these projects, we’re taking disciplined steps to advance our goal to lower the carbon intensity of our operations and the products we manufacture and supply to a growing and evolving market, while operating our current asset base to deliver superior cash flow and meet demands. At this point, I’ll turn the call over to Maryann.
Maryann Mannen: Thanks Mike. Moving to third quarter highlights, slide 5 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $8.14. This quarter’s results were adjusted to exclude a $106 million gain on sale of MPC’s 25% interest in the South Texas Gateway Terminal, as well as $63 million of response costs associated with our unplanned outage at Garyville. These adjustments reduced our reported adjusted earnings by $0.14 per share. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.7 billion for the quarter. And cash flow from operations, excluding favorable working capital changes, was over $4.3 billion. During the quarter, we returned $297 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased over $2.8 billion of our shares. And from May 2021 through October 27th, we have repurchased 285 million shares or approximately 44% of the shares outstanding. Slide 6 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from second quarter 2023 to third quarter 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was higher sequentially by approximately $1.2 billion, driven by higher R&M margins. Corporate expenses were higher sequentially by $40 million, primarily due to a charge related to valuation of existing performance-based stock compensation expense. The tax rate for the third quarter was 22%, resulting in a tax provision of approximately $1 billion. Moving to our segment results, slide 7 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. Our refining assets ran at 94% utilization, processing nearly 2.8 million barrels of crude per day at our 13 refineries. Sequentially, per barrel margins were higher across all regions driven by higher crack spreads. Capture was 93%. Refining operating costs were $5.14 per barrel in the third quarter, flat sequentially. We did have unplanned downtime during the quarter, impacting our two largest refineries, which resulted in lost crude throughput of 4.7 million barrels due to the Galveston Bay reformer outage and 2.1 million barrels at Garyville. Additionally, this downtime resulted in a headwind to our overall capture. We began construction activities on the reformer repair about three months after the event, once regulators gave us clearance and we were able to finalize the required repairs. Since then, repairs have progressed as planned and during this outage, we pulled forward turnaround work into the third and fourth quarters, which had been scheduled in the first quarter of 2024. Slide 8 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing margin capture this quarter, which was 93%. Our commercial team executed effectively, despite weak secondary product pricing and refinery downtime, which weighed on capture this quarter. Capture results will fluctuate based on market dynamics. We believe that the capabilities we have built over the last few years will provide a sustainable advantage. This commitment to commercial performance is foundational and we expect to continue to see the results. Slide 9 shows the change in our Midstream segment adjusted EBITDA versus the second quarter of 2023. Our Midstream segment delivered strong third quarter results. Segment adjusted EBITDA was flat sequentially and 3% higher year-over-year, primarily due to higher throughputs and rates. Year-to-date, our Midstream segment EBITDA is up 6% compared to the prior year period. As Mike mentioned earlier, the growth of MPLX’s earnings supported its decision to increase its quarterly distribution by another 10% to $0.85 per unit, and MPC expects to receive $2.2 billion in cash from MPLX on an annual basis. Our Midstream business continues to grow and generate strong cash flows. We are advancing high-return growth projects anchored in the Marcellus and Permian basins. Slide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the quarter, operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital with over $4.3 billion in the quarter. Working capital was a $609 million tailwind for the quarter, driven primarily by increases in crude oil prices. Year-to-date, working capital has been $1.4 billion worth of cash. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $486 million this quarter, consistent with our 2023 outlook. MPC returned nearly $3.1 billion via share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. This represents an approximately 72% payout of the $4.3 billion of operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment to superior shareholder returns. As of October 27th, we have approximately $8.3 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization, which includes the additional $5 billion approval announced last week. At the end of third quarter, MPC had approximately $13.1 billion in consolidated cash and short term investments. This includes approximately $1 billion of MPLX cash. Turning to guidance, on slide 11, we provide our fourth quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of over 2.6 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 90%. Utilization is forecasted to be lower than third quarter levels due to turnaround activity having a higher impact on units in the fourth quarter. In the Gulf Coast, with respect to the Galveston Bay reformer, repairs have progressed as planned. We anticipate starting the unit back up in mid November. Production is expected to ramp over the next several weeks. And guidance anticipates returning to full operating rates by mid-December, following advanced turnaround activity. And as I mentioned earlier, during this outage, we plan to continue progressing and complete turnaround work that was previously scheduled for 2024. As a result, planned turnaround expense is now projected to be approximately $300 million in the fourth quarter. Operating costs per barrel in the fourth quarter are expected to be $5.60, higher sequentially due to higher energy cost, particularly on the West Coast, as well as higher project-related expenses associated with planned turnaround activity. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $175 million, representing the sustained reductions that we have made in this area. With that, let me pass it back to Mike.
Mike Hennigan: In summary, we will continue to prioritize capital investments to ensure the safe and reliable performance of our assets. We’ll also invest in projects where we believe there are attractive returns. Through the third quarter, we’ve invested over $1.7 billion in capital and investment, which includes $390 million of maintenance capital as well as over $900 million on refinery turnarounds in 2023. Our focus on safety, operational excellence, and sustained commercial improvement will position us to capture the enhanced mid-cycle environment, which we expect to continue longer term given our advantages over marginal sources of supply and growing global demand. MPLX remains a source of growth in our portfolio. Partnership is expected to distribute over $2.2 billion to MPC annually. And as MPLX continues to grow its free cash flow, we believe it will continue to have capacity to increase its cash distributions to MPC. We believe MPC is positioned as the refiner investment of choice, with the strongest through cycle cash generation and the ability to deliver superior returns to our shareholders, supported by our firm commitment to return capital. With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.
Kristina Kazarian: Thanks, Mike. As we open the call for your questions and as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If time permits, we’ll re-prompt for additional questions. And with that, Sheila, we’re ready for them.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Manav Gupta with UBS.
Manav Gupta: When we look at the refiners, they look at themselves and perform -- on different performance metrics, some look at refining capture. You guys really focus on EBITDA margin per barrel. And when we look at that metrics, it looks like for a second year in a row, you’ll be on top of that table, outperforming your peers. So, help us understand a little better what’s allowing you to drive this outperformance and deliver such strong results when it comes to EBITDA margin per barrel in your refining system?
Rick Hessling: Hi, Manav. It’s Rick. First of all, thank you for the perceptive callout. I will tell you we are uber-focused on EBITDA and our results compared to others. And our team will certainly greatly appreciate your callout on this as they’ve been working on this consistently for years now, Manav, and you’re seeing it pull through to our results. So, who kudos to the team there. I will kind of backtrack and state what we’ve stated in past quarters, Manav. We’ve made structural improvements throughout our entire commercial value chain to capture value from the front end all the way through the back end. And specifically, we’re doing so in a way today that is -- it is creating a mindset change within our teams, and we are, I would say, taking more calculated risk with our approach and how we look at everything. There isn’t a rock that we’re not overturning to see what’s under it. And we’re assuming, Manav, we do everything wrong. And with that mindset, you can create a lot of value, in looking at things you haven’t looked at in the past. In the Midwest specifically, I will really pivot on a couple of things. We have a fully integrated system. We have four great refineries in the Midwest. In the third quarter, as you know, they ran very well. We have access to advantaged feedstocks, both Canadian and domestic, and then Brian’s team has created exceptional optionality for product placement. So, when you combine all those factors together, Manav, you really get to an end result that it’s been consistent, as you stated, over the last several quarters and we expect it to continue.
Mike Hennigan: Manav, it’s Mike. The only thing I would add to what Rick said is, we start with EBITDA per barrel. We want to make sure we’re generating as much earnings as we can as we run our assets. Ultimately, though, I care the most about cash generation. I mean, it starts with EBITDA per barrel, but the bottom line is, are we generating significant amount of cash to give us the flexibility to drive shareholder returns. So, I think you hit the starting point with EBITDA per barrel. The ending point is generating cash and then having that flexibility.
Manav Gupta: Perfect. A quick follow-up here. You guys are known for your strong operational performance. 3Q was a little unusual. You had some unplanned incidents. And despite those, you delivered a pretty strong beat. But I’m trying to understand, let’s say those incidents would not have happened, would we have got even a stronger quarter, if you could talk about that?
Maryann Mannen: Yes. Thank you, it’s Maryann and thanks for the question. You’re right. As we shared with you, we did have a couple of unplanned downtime events in the quarter that impacted the Gulf Coast. One, the most significant in terms of its contribution is the Galveston Bay reformer, and then, obviously, we had our, Garyville. Had we not had those two impacts, I’m happy to share a little bit more about those in a moment here, our capture would have been 6% higher than what we reported with the lion’s share of that capture event obviously being the reformer. As I mentioned, 4.7 million barrels in the quarter that we lost, and then on Garyville, it’s about 2.1 million barrels as we operated about half rate for just under a week. It took us about -- just back to, Galveston Bay for a moment. It took us about three months before, we were able to begin our work as we -- as the regulators got through their work and then we determined where all the repairs needed to be. So we were about three months, to the start of getting those, activities launched. I hope that answers the question.
Operator: Next, we will hear from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Doug Leggate: Well, first of all, thank you for taking my questions. Maryann, that last response was actually one of the key things we wanted to hit. So, let me try two more if I may. First of all, Mike, in your opening remarks, you talked about demand in your system is pretty strong. I wonder if I could ask you to isolate that to export demand, because obviously that’s a fairly big swing factor for the U.S. market in particular. How does that look in your system?
Mike Hennigan: Yes. Doug, I’ll let Brian comment on that.
Brian Partee: So really, our theme on demand, both domestically and internationally is stable and steady. It’s been that way really throughout the year. In the quarter, we exported roughly 250,000 barrels a day out of our system in the Gulf Coast, despite some operational challenges, as noted. About two-thirds of that is distillate, the balance of course is gasoline. The demand center in Latin America and the Caribbean really has been strong and resilient and growing throughout the year. They import roughly 2.3 million barrels a day into the system. The U.S. has been about 65% of that. We have come off a little bit in terms of our share into Latin America and the Caribbean in exchange for share into Europe. So, we are seeing growth in European imports as you’ve probably seen as well, roughly 200,000 barrels a day in the quarter from the U.S. into Europe. The one cautionary tale there, it is the one weakest spot that we see throughout our network, which is distillate demand in Europe. Our team sees it as roughly 4% to 6% off year-to-year with expectations and a bit of hope that as we get into the colder weather season here later this year, we’ll see a pickup in demand in Europe, but that is the one soft spot that we’re seeing.
Doug Leggate: Mike, I apologize for this one, but I guess somebody’s got to ask it. So, there’s speculation overnight about the Citgo process and Marathon being mentioned as a potential bidder. So, I wonder if you could frame whether that is, in fact, a consideration that you thought about, what the rationale would be and how you would see something like that fitting in with your portfolio high-grading focus that you’ve had over the last several years?
Mike Hennigan: I’m going to let Dave start, and then I’ll come back afterwards.
Dave Heppner: So, I appreciate the question. We anticipated that. And Mike said in the past, we like to and do look at everything out there as a general comment. But I think we’re more focused currently on -- and Rick touched on this a little bit on opportunities to build out our competencies and increase our competitive advantages along our existing refinery value chains. And when we say that, that’s inclusive of MPC and MPLX, so from wellhead to wheel is the way to think about it. So, with that said and on the current environment, we believe that M&A within refining, refining M&A is one of the more challenging ways to create value. And with all that said, I would not anticipate us, or you shouldn’t anticipate us participating in the current auction process for the Citgo assets. I don’t know where the rumor came from, but we’re not interested in the auction process.
Operator: Our next question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.
Paul Cheng: Maybe this is for Maryann or maybe for Rich. For the West Coast marketing margins condition, that seems to be very strong and you do have a dealer network there. So just curious that in the third quarter, how much is the West Coast contribution coming from that piece of the business? Is it growing or that -- what’s your plan over there? That’s the first question.
Brian Partee: Yes. Paul, good morning. This is Brian. I’ll take that one. Really very limited impact in the quarter from our marketing business on the West Coast. We actually saw prices increase pretty substantially on the West Coast in the quarter due to some unplanned outages in the system. And when that occurs, we actually see just the opposite. We see a lot of pressure on the margin out in the West Coast and other markets. So, not a big contributor there in the quarter. Now, as we look ahead to 4Q, as market comes off, we would expect to see some recovery and some margin expansion in the fourth quarter. But to your other question, we are absolutely actively engaged in growing and continuing to grow that network. We’ve put up really good numbers last year and this year and look at it as a strategic component of our position out in the West Coast.
Paul Cheng: Hey, Brian, do you have any rough estimate you can share that, how many stations that you’re trying to grow it on annual basis over the next several years there?
Brian Partee: Really don’t want to forecast a station growth expectation, Paul. We’re really focused on value growth. So it’s really it’s a PV optimization looking at volume and margin, so it’s not driven by station growth or volume alone.
Paul Cheng: Okay. Mike, I know that maybe it’s still a little bit early, can you talk about that plus and minus is on the variable for the CapEx outlook for the next several years compared to this year? Are we expecting a pretty steady program or that you’re looking for opportunity to grow both in the -- maybe refining, including the yield or that reducing energy and MPLX? So, can you just give us some idea that how the trend is going to look like in the CapEx and efficacy level?
Maryann Mannen: Sure, Paul. It’s Maryann. Let me talk a little bit about CapEx in general and then I’ll pass it to Mike and he’ll share some incremental thoughts as well. But as you know, one of our principles, if you will, our strategic pillars is strict capital discipline. And I think that has -- hopefully you’ve seen that we have implemented that principle well over the last few years. When you look at 2017 to 2020, our consolidated CapEx averaged about $3.5 billion. And as you look ‘21 to ‘23, that’s averaged $2.1 billion. So again that premise of strict capital discipline ensuring that we’re delivering the returns has been an important piece of the work that we’ve been doing. I think in refining, we continue to look for cost reduction type projects, those that can enhance reliability, margin enhancement type projects, then that we would be continuing to evaluate, and there are several of those projects that we’ll evaluate. In terms of the timing, we’re a bit early for 2024, frankly, even 2025 guidance. But let me pass it to Mike because I think he wants to give you some incremental color on how he’s thinking about it.
Mike Hennigan: I think, Mary, you answered it very well. Paul, the way we think about it is on the MPLX side of the house, we’ve been spending roughly about $1 billion and growing those cash flows. If you listen to the MPLX call, we’re still very comfortable with those cash flows growing that will continue to kick over to MPC via distribution. And then Maryann said it well, on the refining side of the house, we’re still very optimistic that we have some good projects that enable us to either increase reliability which will hit the bottom line or enhance our margins in such a way that we talked about earlier that we’ll generate more EBITDA per barrel. So, we have a pretty fulsome look at where we think we’re going to invest. And like Mary just gave you the numbers over the last couple of years, you’re spending $2 billion to $3 billion overall on a consolidated basis. We think that’s a nice base case to have. And then we always look to optimize around that. When we do that, we generate sufficient free cash flow that we can still return capital via dividends and buybacks. And as you’ve seen in this enhanced margin environment, that’s part of our DNA to return capital to shareholders.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.
Sam Margolin: Question’s on the buyback, and it’s kind of conceptual just sort of how you think about the stock when you do your internal process. But when you are looking at an MPC share, the question is really how do you view it, or what does it represent to you? Is it representative of just the parent company and a repository for MPLX distributions, or do you kind of analyze it as a consolidated entity where something like 40% of it is like a synthetic MPLX share. And the reason I ask is because we do get a lot of questions about sort of your price sensitivity in the buyback. And I think the methodology maybe is important.
Maryann Mannen: Sam, it’s Maryann. Let me give you a few thoughts on that, and I can pass it to Mike in case he’s got some added value. I mean, there are several things that we look at as we are making decisions about the level of share buyback. And certainly, when we’re looking at intrinsic value, there’s a couple of approaches. So we’ll look at some of the parts. We’ll look at discounted cash flows. We use a series of reviews, obviously, looking at our EBITDA multiples of their respective businesses. But typically, when we are making the decision about an MPC buyback, that intrinsic value assumes the discounted cash flows, as I just shared. There are several constraints as we look at that that we evaluate each time we go to buy back stock, none the least of which obviously is market, cash flows, where we think the quarter is going to be, where we think our cash balances are. And we’ve worked pretty diligently to try to outperform the market here. Hopefully, you’ve seen that over the significance of the buyback that we’ve done. But we do look at it in a holistic approach. Let me pass that back to Mike and see if he wants to add any color.
Mike Hennigan: Yes. Sam, here’s the way I think about it. As you know, we don’t control the margins. So, as the quarter progresses, we don’t have a specified amount that says we’re going to do x in this quarter, other than we’ve been trying to be as aggressive as we possibly can within the constraints that the SEC puts on us, such as daily volume traded limitations or blackout periods, et cetera, et cetera. So, we’ve been -- because it kind of looks like it’s been consistent just because we’ve been trying to be as aggressive as possible, once we generate the cash, as we talk to Paul’s question, we have our dedication that we want to invest capital in. And then we want to be returning capital to shareholders as quickly as we can. At the same time, I will tell you that we also still try to beat the market. One of our goals is to be as aggressive as we can return capital, but take advantage of the volatility that’s within the quarter. And since we started this program, we’ve ended up reducing the share count by about 40%. It’s a rough number. And during that process, we’ve kind of beat the market by about $4. So, if you say, hey, we’ve reduced somewhere around 270 million shares at around $4, it’s roughly about $1 billion of value creation just in our execution. But it starts with, obviously, generate cash, figure out how much we can return to shareholders as quickly as we can within those constraints and then try our best to beat the market during that execution. I hope that helps.
Sam Margolin: Yes, very much so. Thanks. And my follow-up is just more of a straightforward ops question, but it’s about the West Coast. And TMX has been delayed. But once it starts up, it might be impactful to fundamentals on the West Coast. And it seems noteworthy because of your comments about how the Midwest is this integrated system with shipper status for WCS and you’re able to move things around. And so I wonder in the context of TMX, if there’s -- if you see any analogs there with building out sort of a full value chain or commercial integrated platform.
Rick Hessling: Sam, it’s Rick. Your analogy is spot on. So when TMX comes on line, we’ll not only see benefits in the Pacific Northwest, specifically at Anacortes and at L.A. So, the way we look at it is you’re going to get access to an advantaged barrel more so than what you do today. And we believe that barrel will compete very well, especially on the West Coast. We believe TMX will have some start-up issues. They have some well-publicized marine hurdles they need to get over. And with that being said, having that barrel clear all the way to Asia will be difficult. And sitting on the West Coast, we have a structural advantage from a transportation cost perspective. So, we do see that playing into both of our assets, one in the Pacific Northwest and L.A. on the West Coast.
Operator: Next, you will hear from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.
Roger Read: All right. I’d like to come back around on the renewable diesel. We heard from others and seen some stories about permit issues. Just curious you can kind of walk us through the way we should be thinking about that as we head into start-up kind of year-end and in early part of ‘24.
Jim Wilkins: Roger, this is Jim Wilkins. We’re working with the county on one issue related to our land use permit. That issue, we expect will get resolved in the upcoming months, and it’s related to our odor mitigation plan. The resolution of that matter won’t impact our ability to construct or operate the facility.
Roger Read: Does it change at all the feedstock that you’d be able to use early on?
Jim Wilkins: No.
Roger Read: I’m not terribly experienced with this, but I know that some of the feedstocks are -- well, let’s just say, they’re not what you would want to smell, I guess.
Jim Wilkins: No, Roger. So, we actually have an approved odor mitigation plan with the Air Quality Division. And actually, what we’re doing is circling back to the land use permit where we said we’d develop an order mitigation plan and embedding the plan that’s already been approved.
Roger Read: Okay. Perfect. And just to be absolutely clear, no other regulatory hurdles that need to be cleared for startup?
Jim Wilkins: Correct.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Royall with JPMorgan.
John Royall: So I had -- my first one is a follow-up on the buyback. You’ve now gotten through another quarter with a really solid crack environment in 3Q and another quarter where you aren’t drawing any cash. And in fact, you build cash by about, I think, $1.5 billion which I wouldn’t characterize as a problem by any stretch, but you’ve talked about getting that cash balance down closer to $1 billion longer term. And Mike talked about the constraints to doing more on the buyback. And now, we’re seeing a worsening environment in 4Q. So, my question is, given all your excess cash, should we think about the buyback as not particularly sensitive to the crack environment? And would you expect to start drawing cash from here?
Maryann Mannen: Hey John, it’s Maryann. So, a couple of things. Yes, you’re absolutely right. As you see, we said a little over $13 billion at the end of the quarter, and again, just keeping in mind, about $1 billion of that belongs to MPLX. And then obviously, there is some working capital sensitivity as we have timing of our liability payments. We would expect to see a bit of that unwind as normal. We’ll see some of that happen in the fourth quarter and then again in the first quarter. Having said that, your point is accurate. We’ve said we’re quite comfortable with $1 billion on our balance sheet. The nice part about having the cash on the balance sheet today versus if we were sitting here a year ago is we’re generating close to $0.5 billion in interest income as we’re holding on to that cash. Certainly, when we are looking at the amount of share buyback that we want to do in any particular period of time, and I think Mike articulated it as well, we’re looking at several factors. The fact that we’ve got cash on the balance sheet to allow us to take advantage of volatility, I think, is a plus. We remain committed to share repurchase and the return of capital. We’ve got some priorities, obviously, safe and reliable operation of our assets gets it first. We’re committed to our dividend, as we just shared with you. And we’re looking for opportunities to put that capital to work in order to be able to grow the business and particularly earn the types of returns that you all expect. And we continue to see share buyback as an efficient return of capital. So again, we’ll look at all factors as we head into any particular quarter and try to be as opportunistic as we can and be sure that we are doing our best to beat the market and taking advantage of the volatility where we can.
John Royall: Great. Thank you. And then Maryann called out some turnaround work pulled in from next year to the second half of this year. And so just thinking about next year, any early look on what 2024 could look like from a turnaround perspective. I think you had some catch-up over the past two years, and now this work pulled into ‘23. So, is it reasonable to think it might be kind of a below average year?
Maryann Mannen: Hey John, Maryann again. So in general, notwithstanding the impact of COVID, if you look over an average period of time, our turnaround is pretty similar. We’re operating 13 refineries, fossil fuel and two renewable diesel. And at every point in time, there is some level of turnaround. You’re absolutely right. One of the things that we did, notwithstanding the unplanned downtime on the reformer is pull forward some turnaround that we expected to do in our 2024 plans into 2023. But again, absent the period of COVID, you can see the level of turnaround being pretty similar watching those. In the fourth quarter also, you may have noticed in our guidance, West Coast utilization, we do have turnaround activity there. We’ve got two locations in LAR. We are trying to get those turnarounds done ahead of the driving season next year, just as an example, if you’re looking at activity in the fourth quarter as well. I’ll pause there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen.
Jason Gabelman: Decent amount of focus on the buyback. I wanted to ask about the dividend raise of 10%. Last year, the dividend raise was higher in line with the amount you had repurchased over the trailing 12 months. This year, that wasn’t the case. And it’s also, I guess, lower than the incremental cash you’ll be receiving from MPLX with their higher distribution. So, the question is, how do you think about kind of that dividend raise? How did you come up with that 10%? And then how do you think about it moving forward, especially in light of the commentary that you expect the refining environment, the mid-cycle environment to be higher, and I would expect the dividend moving higher would be a good way to message that earnings power to the market.
Mike Hennigan: Jason, it’s Mike. I’ll start, and I’ll let Mary jump in. Yes, I think what you’re referring to is we had a bigger increase before because the way we looked at it is most in our industry kind of paused around COVID during that tough year of cash. So, we made a bigger jump. And now what we’re showing this year is we’re trying to show the market that we believe in a growing dividend that is part of our capital allocation. We want it to be competitive. But at the same time, I often say that it’s more tax efficient to go return capital through share repurchases. And the sheer quantum of dollars in each case is pretty different. So overall, we want the market to know, yes, we’re going to grow the dividend. We’re going to consistently do that. We want it to be competitive. We want to show that we’re going to grow earnings, that comes back to investing capital and all the self-help that we can do. But at the same time, we’re going to err more on the side of share repurchases because we think it’s more tax efficient and a better way to return capital.
Maryann Mannen: Jason, it’s Maryann. The only thing that I would add to Mike’s comments are the dividend is only one part, as you said, of the capital allocation strategy. But having said that, we think this increase is peer leading at 12% CAGR over the last five years. So, we hope you see it that as well.
Jason Gabelman: Got it. Thanks for that. And then my follow-up is on one of the growth projects that I think you have for next year, the hydrogen hub project that was selected for funding from the DOE. I was hoping just to get more color on exactly what Marathon’s participation is in that project, how it could benefit the Company? Any thoughts around capital spending that you would have to contribute there?
Dave Heppner: Yes. Jason, this is Dave. I’ll touch on that. So start with high level. Number one, there are 7 hubs that were approved for fund from the DOE for $7 billion. We mean MPC/MPLX, we’re involved in two of them. So, one in Appalachia and one in the Heartland area. So when we think about the involvement of MPC and MPLX, they’re a little bit different. On the MPLX side, it’s more around story of hydrogen and transportation of CO2 on pipelines. From an MPC perspective, it is inclusive of lowering the carbon intensity via hydrogen production. And when you think about it in the Heartland area, due to the location of it’s very -- the proximity very close to our Dickinson renewable diesel facility. So of course, anytime you can lower the CI of the base product you’re making from renewable diesel, you can get that pull-through value of that asset that we already invested in. So, the best way to think about it, like we do everything, these are bolt-on type investments that can create value up and down the value chains.
Jason Gabelman: Okay. When should we see those benefits start to accrue when do the projects come on line?
Dave Heppner: Yes. So that’s great. So, we are -- while this DOE funding was a major milestone for all of us that got granted, some funding from this, it’s in the very early stages. So, to think about it, next phase of this is a negotiation with the DOE on the funding and the contractual commitments around that funding requirement, then you’ve got to design and build the facility. So, from a capital spend and an associated benefit to the company, I think you’re looking into late 2024, 2025 time frame. So, it’s still a ways out there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays.
Theresa Chen: I wanted to follow up on Sam’s question related to TMX for which MPC has a known commitment. And I was just wondering if you could update us with where you think the toll may settle at given the discussion with the pipeline owner and the bid/ask currently? And related to that, how much do you think really it can tighten WCS differentials for your Mid-Con assets given that coast holds are comparable to going to the U.S. Gulf Coast versus Burnaby?
Rick Hessling: Yes. Hi Theresa, it’s Rick. So on the first part of your question, I’m just really not in a position to comment on the toll or speculate what it may end up at. On the second part of your question, the guidance I’d give you is as we look at the forward curve on WCS, so today, WCS sits at about a $26 discount. In Q1, it’s plus or minus $25. And in Q2, if TMX comes online there, and I think the market is still questionable on that. The forward curve is $15 to $18 discount. So still a pretty significant discount. And we’ll just have to see where it goes from there.
Theresa Chen: Got it. And going back to Mike’s earlier comments about additional investment opportunities, RNG being one of them. Can you just give us an update on progress related to the LF Bioenergy assets after the Q1 acquisition announcement, how that’s trending? And do you expect to use this as a launch pad for additional RNG investments, or is this going to be more of a roll up strategy from here?
Dave Heppner: Yes. Theresa, this is Dave again. I’ll touch on that. So yes, the LF Bioenergy investment, that joint venture is progressing as we planned. We are building out the facilities. The plan is to build out 13 of those RNG facilities collecting a very low CI dairy RNG and then monetizing that, again, as I touched on a little bit with the hydrogen hub taking that RNG into our renewable diesel facilities such as Dickinson and Martinez, will lower the CI of that base renewable diesel product coming out. So relative to the relationship and the investment, we’re very happy with the investment, the management team there, the projects we’ve -- that they’re identifying, they’ve got a good runway of portfolio projects and they’re coming on line as planned. And the second part of your question, is this a one-off or a foundation for subsequent investments in renewable diesel space or the renewable natural gas space. So, we continue, as I said earlier, we look at a lot of stuff. There are some opportunities out there. But we -- the key to this one was we got in early and didn’t overpay for a built-out system. So when we think of subsequent investments, I think of them that way. If there’s one that we can step in early and participate in the build-out of the infrastructure and integrate it with our business rather than paying for a built-out system, we’ll continue to evaluate those opportunities.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Blair with TPH.
Matthew Blair: Maybe sticking with the renewables. For some operators, the next leg of the RD story is moving into SAF, is that an option for Martinez? And if so, any thoughts on timing or cost to add that flexibility?
Dave Heppner: Yes, Matthew, this is Dave again. So yes, there is no question both from a Dickinson and Martinez, both those have the opportunity to convert to SAF. And HEFA SAF is one of the most cost competitive on a CapEx per barrel basis for SAF production. With that said, the challenge in SAF is the premium associated to justify the investment. And while the IRA has been communicated, there’s a lot of unknowns out there and a lot of clarity that still needs to be determined relative to the IRA, not only from the sliding scale and the CI benefit of it, but also the long-term duration. Right now, it ends in 2027, as far as the documented incentives relative to that. So it’s hard to make multi-hundred million dollar investments without that clarity going forward. So lack of clarity and lack of premium from airline industry makes it very difficult to justify those investments at this time.
Mike Hennigan: Hey Matthew, it’s Mike. I’ll just add to your and to Theresa’s question. I think what you’re trying -- or hopefully, what you’re seeing from us is we’re attentive to this whole low-carbon world, whether it’s investment in RNG, like Theresa talked about or as Dave just mentioned, SAF, in my opinion, is going to happen at some period. As Dave said, there’s a little bit of wrangling around the economics of it at this point. But when those opportunities present themselves to us, we’ll continue to optimize our portfolio. So, I think if you take a stair step over time, you’re going to see us continue to be conscious of that, at the same time, recognizing that the base business is still the majority of what we do. But over time, we’re going to continue to look, whether it’s RNG, whether it’s SAF, whether it’s continued build-out in some other areas, those are things that we continue to evaluate. Dave and his team is constantly looking at it, and we’ll make some investment there. But we’re not looking for the big splash of a major investment, as Dave just said. We’re not looking to buy something that’s already been proven out. We’re looking to get ourselves in and grow with those opportunities.
Matthew Blair: Sounds good. And then, do you have any early thoughts on refining margin capture into the fourth quarter? Do you think it would be up on tailwinds from things like butane blending and getting the reformer back for at least part of the quarter?
Maryann Mannen: Hey Matthew, it’s Maryann. Yes, I think it’s hard for us to project capture. But when you talk about the things you did, obviously, as we shared, the reformer we expect will begin to come back up mid-November, our guidance reflects the fact that it will be operational at planned rates mid-December. We talked about some secondary headwinds. We talked about marketing margins changing. You heard Brian talk about that as well. Those things clearly have a positive influence on capture. But as you know, it’s difficult to predict where capture would otherwise go. But certainly, those things point to improving capture from the third quarter.
Operator: Our last question will come from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.
Ryan Todd: Maybe if I could I have one follow-up on the Martinez conversion project. Can you talk about where you are from an operational point of view there? Maybe how much throughput you had in -- during the third quarter from Phase 1 of the project? And maybe as we think about startup of Phase 2 of that project by the end of this year, is there any ramp that we should associate with it, either in terms of total throughput or in terms of the type of fees that you anticipate working their way into the system? So, how should we think about the progress from an operational point of view from -- for that asset?
Tim Aydt: Okay. Ryan, this is Tim Aydt. Thanks a lot for the question there. I would say that, first off, the project is going exceptionally well, both from a safety and on-time and on-budget standpoint. The team’s really done a great job, and I do want to give them a shout out because it really kind of demonstrated one of Marathon’s key strengths here and that they can execute on a complex project. We did, as you likely know, we start up the pretreatment unit in late second quarter, and it is operating very well. We’re able to pretreat the entire production that comes about with the Phase 1 Martinez capacity. And now we’re going to be looking to ramp that pretreatment capacity with the production of RD that’s coming on toward the end of the year when we finish the project. And as Maryann said earlier, when we do finish the project, we’re going to be able to produce 730 million gallons annually, and that should happen by the end of the year. So, all-in-all, operationally and project wise, we’re moving forward, wrapping it up, and we’ll be ready at the end of the year.
Kristina Kazarian: All right. With that, thank you so much, everyone, today for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or would you like clarification on topics discussed this morning, please reach out, and our team will be available to take your calls. Thanks so much for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-01 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MPC Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. My name is Sheila and I will be your operator for today’s call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.
Kristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation’s second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investors tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements during the call today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as our filings with the SEC. And with that, I will turn the call over to Mike.
Mike Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone. Beginning with our views on the macro environment, refining margins continued strong in the second quarter. Despite crack spreads incentivizing high refining utilization, product inventory levels remain low. Global capacity additions continue to progress slower than anticipated and we believe that global demand growth will remain strong. In the second half of the year, the refining outlook remains healthy. We expect year-over-year U.S. late product demand to grow consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year supported by lower energy prices and recovering air travel. This demand strength post tight inventories and receding economic headwinds are expected to continue to support elevated margins. And as we completed nearly four quarters of elevated turnaround activity early in the second quarter, we are expecting an increase in industry planned maintenance work by our peers in almost every region in which we operate. Overall, we believe an enhanced mid-cycle environment will continue in the U.S. due to relative advantages over international sources of supply, including energy costs, feedstock acquisition costs and refinery complexity. Now turning to our results. In the second quarter, we delivered strong results across our business. In Refining & Marketing, strong margins, cost discipline and sound commercial performance led to segment adjusted EBITDA of nearly $3.2 billion. Our Midstream segment delivered durable and growing earnings. This quarter, it generated segment adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion, which is up 5% year-over-year. MPLX remains a strategic part of MPC’s portfolio as it anticipates growing its cash flows and increasing distributions to unitholders. MPLX’s distribution MPC was $502 million this quarter, an annualized rate of over $2 billion, which fully covers MPC’s current dividend and half of our planned 2023 capital program, not including MPLX. During the second quarter, we have progressed key projects such as completing the STAR project at the Galveston Bay refinery. The competitive position of our Galveston Bay refinery is enhanced by the increased residual fuel and heavy crude processing as well as distillate recovery. We are well positioned with two premier 600,000 barrel per day refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast with significant logistics and export capacity to support our global commercial strategy. At the Martinez Renewable Fuels facility, construction activities are progressing. Pre-treatment capabilities are starting to come online in the second half of 2023 and the facility is expected to be capable of producing its full capacity of 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023. At that point, Martinez will be among the largest, most competitive renewable diesel facilities with a competitive operating profile, robust logistics flexibility and advantaged feedstock slate and a strategic relationship with Neste. On capital allocation, in the second quarter, we returned nearly $3.4 billion to MPC shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. And from May 2021 through the end of July, we have repurchased 264 million shares or approximately 40% of the shares outstanding. Moving to our sustainability efforts. In July, we published our 12th annual sustainability report and our 7th annual perspectives on climate scenarios report. Our perspectives on climate-related scenarios which aligns with TCFD standards, provides insights into how we see the energy landscape, our thoughts on climate-related risks and opportunities the resources we put towards addressing them and the results that we have achieved. Our sustainability report shows continued progress on goals that we have set for ourselves, our efforts to strengthen the resiliency of our operations and to innovate for the future. At this point, I’d like to turn the call over to Maryann.
Maryann Mannen: Thanks Mike. Moving to second quarter highlights, Slide 5 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $5.32. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.5 billion for the quarter and cash flow from operations excluding favorable working capital changes was over $3.1 billion. During the quarter, we returned $316 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased $3.1 billion of our shares. Slide 6 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the first quarter of 2023 to the second quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $700 million as higher refining throughput was more than offset by lower market crack spreads. Corporate expenses were roughly in line with our guidance. And despite general inflationary pressures, we have maintained cost discipline since taking $100 million out of our corporate cost since 2020. The tax rate for the second quarter was 18.4%, resulting in a tax provision of approximately $583 million. Our tax provision included a $53 million discrete benefit related to prior years. Moving to our segment results. Slide 7 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. Refining utilization increased 4% to 93% despite significant turnaround activity as plan work had a lower impact on crude units in the second quarter. During the quarter at Galveston Bay, an incident occurred at one of the refineries catalytic reformers. This unit has been out of service since May 15. This resulted in approximately 2.5 million barrels of crude throughput reduction and an approximate 1% reduction to capture. Sequentially, per barrel margins were lower in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Con regions driven by lower crack spreads and our sour crude differentials. Capture was 97%, reflecting a strong result from our commercial team, particularly given the extensive turnaround activity early in the quarter. Refining operating costs were $5.15 per barrel in the second quarter, lower sequentially and due to higher throughput and lower energy costs. Slide 8 provides an overview of our refining and marketing margin capture this quarter, which was 97%. Our commercial team executed effectively and achieved a strong capture result, considering a significant amount of planned and unplanned refinery downtime. Gasoline and distillate margin tailwinds were balanced against weaker secondary product pricing. We are also seeing incremental product yield and crude mix benefits from recent major capital projects. Capture results will fluctuate based on market dynamics. We believe that the capabilities we have built over the last few years will provide a sustainable advantage. This commitment to commercial performance has become foundational, and we expect to see the results of this emphasis. Slide 9 shows the change in our Midstream segment adjusted EBITDA versus the first quarter of 2023. Our midstream segment delivered strong second quarter results. Segment adjusted EBITDA while flat sequentially was 5% higher year-over-year. Our midstream business continues to grow and generate strong cash flows. We are advancing high-return growth projects anchored in the Marcellus and Permian basins. These disciplined capital investments, along with our focus on cost and portfolio optimization are expected to grow our cash flows. This will allow us to reinvest in the business and return capital to unitholders. Slide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was $3.1 billion in the quarter. Working capital was an $854 million tailwind for the quarter, driven primarily by changes in crude oil and refined product inventories. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $570 million this quarter, consistent with our 2023 outlook. MPC returned nearly $3.4 billion via share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. This represents a 100% payout of the $3.1 billion of operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment superior shareholder returns. And as of today, we have approximately $6.3 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. At the end of the second quarter, MPC had approximately $11.5 billion in consolidated cash and short-term investments. Turning to guidance, slide 11. We provide our third quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of roughly 2.7 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 94%. Utilization is forecasted to be higher sequentially due to lower planned turnaround activity in the third quarter, and enhance mid-cycle margins, continue to incentivize high refining utilization. While we have not confirmed a start-up date, our throughput guidance assumes the reformer at the Galveston Bay refinery will be down for the entire quarter. Planned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $120 million in the third quarter. Operating cost per barrel in the third quarter are expected to be $5.10, as we expect to see benefits from higher throughput and lower costs, given we have completed the significant portion of our turnaround and project activity. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion for the third quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $175 million, representing the sustained reductions that we have made in this area. To recap, our second quarter results reflect our team’s execution against our strategic pillars across the company. Our capital allocation framework remains consistent. We will invest in sustaining our asset base while paying a secure competitive dividend with the potential for growth. We want to grow the company’s earnings and we will exercise strict capital discipline. Beyond these 3 priorities, we are committed to returning excess capital through share repurchases and to meaningfully lower our share count. With that, let me pass it back to Mike.
Mike Hennigan: Thanks, Maryann. In summary, we will continue to invest capital to ensure the safe and reliable performance of our assets and where we believe there are attractive returns. Year-to-date, we’ve invested over $1.2 billion. Our focus on operational excellence and sustained commercial improvement will position us to capture this enhanced mid-cycle environment. MPLX remains a source of growth in our portfolio, distributing over $2 billion to MPC annually. And as MPLX continues to grow its free cash flow, we believe we’ll continue to have capacity to increase its cash contributions to MPC. We believe MPC is positioned as the refinery investment of choice with the strongest through-cycle cash flow generation and the ability to deliver superior returns to our shareholders. With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.
Kristina Kazarian: Thanks Mike. [Operator Instructions] And now, we will open the call. Sheila?
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Doug Leggate: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for having me on. Mike, I want to pick up on one of the headlines from your press release, which seems to becoming a bit of a recurring theme, sustained commercial improvements. And I guess it’s a capture rate question, but can you just walk us through what’s going on in your capture? Because it looks like we are – as I look back pre-COVID, for example, leaving the distortions of COVID out of it for a minute, your capture rate seems to have stepped up. Is that portfolio management? Is it something else? Is it trading? What’s going on to have addressed that issue on capture rate?
Mike Hennigan: Yes, good morning, Doug. Thanks for the question. I am going to let Rick give a little more detail, but I’ll start off with a couple of comments. One, we have made structural changes and have changed our commercial process quite a bit. With that said, I know yourself and a lot of the analysts like to look at that capture metric. I just want to always caution people that the metrics that I care more about is cash flow generation and earnings profitability. So I look at that much more than that capture metric, because I think there is pros and cons to it. But to your point, obviously, it has trended up and driven by a lot of the things that we have changed over the last couple of years. So I’ll let Rick give a little more detail.
Rick Hessling: Yes, Doug, first off, very perceptive question. I think it’s a good call out and warranted. We do believe the structural change is something that’s going to stick. In fact, we continue to improve and we are never going to be done improving in this category. So it’s something that we focus on daily. So in giving you an answer, I think you will respect that I will have to be broad as to not give away what I would call true competitive advantages. But it’s all the buckets you’ve touched on, it’s optimization, it’s trading, it’s all of the above. And the best way I can say it, Doug, it’s a holistic change in our mindset on everything we do to optimize our assets around our size, our logistics system, our knowledge, our expertise, and it’s driving incremental value throughout our entire system from feedstocks to products. And there isn’t anyone in the company that’s not engaged. I mean I can’t say enough. Our goal is to be the best cash flow generator through cycle and this just isn’t a one-and-done exercise. This is the mindset that not only our commercial team, but our entire company is attacking everyday with.
Doug Leggate: We will continue to watch it, Rick. Thanks for the color. I guess my follow-up is also a question that it’s hard not to bring this up every other quarter. But Maryann, the buyback pace in July is $800 million. Your dividend at the MPC level is about 150% covered by your distributions from MPLX. Why should we not assume that buyback should be ratable at mid-cycle at that kind of level going forward?
Maryann Mannen: Hey, Doug. Good morning. Maryann. Thanks for the question. From a capital allocation framework perspective and hopefully, even from the comments that Mike and I have both made here this morning, we remain committed to superior returns and remain committed to our capital allocation as we have defined it. As it relates to the back – as you know, each quarter now, we are trying to look as best as we can. We take a series of things into consideration. We look at market. We look at our cash flows and we try to do the best job we possibly can to maximize our ability to perform in a given quarter, as you have seen $3.1 billion in the quarter. When you look from month to month, you see that visibility as you get our quarterly documents, you see a bit of variability there. But again, we remain committed. We think share repurchase is a very efficient return of capital. As it relates to the dividend, again, an important part of our capital allocation framework, as we have shared in the past, we remain committed to that. We want it to be sustainable. We certainly want to be competitive and the opportunity to grow that as well. I hope that answers your question.
Doug Leggate: Maryann, forgive me the clarification question, are you price agnostic because your shares are pretty much at the all-time highs you were there this year?
Maryann Mannen: Again, Doug, we try to be as opportunistic as possible as we can in the quarter. So we hope that that’s the – what you are seeing from our approach to that. So yes, we continue to buyback stock as you have seen.
Doug Leggate: Opportunistically. Okay, thanks so much. Go ahead, Mike.
Mike Hennigan: Let me just add a couple of comments to it. As I just said to your first question, the number one concentration is to generate cash. And then I am a believer that this business has both return on and return of capital as its requirements. So on the return on, we are investing capital to improve our earnings and grow our cash flows over time, but we are also committed to return of. So we used the word strict capital discipline. We set our programs such that we are going to be able to participate in both sides of that, because I am a big believer in both. We got to show the market that we can invest capital wisely to grow our earnings, and we also want to show the market that we’re returning capital to the owners. So that’s a program that we’ve been on for a while here a couple of years. We’re going to continue in that mode. And I just want to give you a little bit more flavor as to how we look at it, but it all starts with generating cash and then optimizing return on and return of.
Doug Leggate: Very good. Thank you.
Mike Hennigan: You are welcome.
Operator: Next, we will hear from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.
Neil Mehta: Yes. Good morning, team. I want to get your perspective on the product market. So we’ve really seen a firm up here across the crack. And so any perspective you have on the strengthening – recent strengthening of margins? And then what are you seeing from a demand perspective in your own system for diesel, jet and gas?
Brian Partee: Neil, good morning. This is Brian. Yes, let me first comment on the demand side of the equation because we are seeing the demand side of the equation really lead the crack. So on gasoline in the quarter, our system was up. And when I say our system, it’s really our entire marketing book was up 4% year-on-year versus an EIA call of about 2%. This most recent week, we see continued strength. We were up 7% last week on the gasoline pool. So we continue to see the strength, which is very encouraging as we enter the back half of the driving season here. And the West Coast has been an outsized performer, 5% on the quarter, 8% last week. And then looking at diesel, it’s been largely flat. EIA has got a call for the quarter of up about 1%. And of course, I think everybody has pretty dialed into Jet. We had a 9% increase on the quarter. For jet fuel demand year-on-year versus EIA of about 3%. And just real quick on the crack. I would say that the big story here over the last 30 to 60 days has been the distillate. So I mean, our view is distillate really ran up late last year, obviously, with the situation in Ukraine, uncertainty around sanctions in the first part of this year over in the EU. And now we have a lot more certainty. So the market came off pretty precipitously since the beginning of the year, and now we’re seeing it recover to a more fundamental level.
Neil Mehta: Thanks, it’s been notable. The follow-up is just around the dividend. It’s down to about 2% given how strong stock has been perspective and just your perspective on, is there headroom to raise the fixed dividend and remind us again when you typically would do that.
Maryann Mannen: Neil, thanks for the question. It’s Maryann. So as I mentioned, hopefully, you see that we’ve got a couple of criteria for the dividend obviously, yield only being one of them, sustainability of that and obviously, the potential to grow. So as we’ve committed, we will be back next quarter with our intentions to share with you our plans for the dividend. So next quarter, consistent with our approach from last year as well. I hope that answers your question.
Neil Mehta: Thans, Maryann.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Manav Gupta with UBS. Your line is open.
Manav Gupta: Good morning, guys. My question is like this year, you are bringing to conclusion two of your big mega projects, the Galveston as well as the Martinez RD. At this point, you haven’t indicated another mega project. So should we assume in the year 2024, more of your CapEx would be dedicated to quick hit projects, which generally are not that expensive. And that can mean that year-over-year, 2024 CapEx could be down versus 2023, unless you pick up a mega project at this stage?
Maryann Mannen: It’s Maryann and thanks for the question. I think you characterized it well. As we shared with you, STAR is largely behind us. And as you heard from our comments as well, Martinez on its way to be with this next phase up and running by the end of the quarter. As you know, we’re a bit early to give 2024 guidance. We will get a little bit closer to that and give you some more color we intend to give you, as we have in prior quarters, to look at what we would be contemplating spending in refining as well as our low-carbon initiatives as well. But I think you stated it well. We haven’t talked about any significant major projects here to for. Hope that helps.
Mike Hennigan: Manav, this is Mike. I just want to add. It’s just a little early in the year. We obviously have some insight as to what we’re planning to do in ‘24, but we will talk about that in subsequent quarters as opposed to now.
Manav Gupta: I completely understand. My quick follow-up here is, as I understand, when you first envisioned the Martinez project, it was more of so being refined and refined. As you brought in the partner somewhere your own thought process or what you want to run changed. And at this stage, you are looking at a higher percentage of lower CIS stocks versus soybean. Can you comment a little bit on that?
Brian Partee: Yes, Manav, this is Brian. Certainly, you got it pretty dead on there in terms of the strategy and the strategic relationship we have with Neste. Just a couple of things to mention around your question, though, that we are on start-up diet here. So as mentioned, we’ve got our pretreatment facility coming online and really full horsepower of this facility really enters in the back half of this year, but we’re quite confident in our ability with our relationship with Neste that really is looking beyond just Martinez. This is just the beginning of our relationship. But one point of view that I will share with you, not Martina specific, but to give just a little bit of perspective, we just exited July with our operation up in Dickinson, and we ran a 74% advantaged feed slate out of our facility up in Dickinson. And its start-up design was very similar to Martinez. So hopefully, that frames things up for you a little bit better of what to expect when we get Martinez up to full rate later this year.
Mike Hennigan: Manav, it’s Mike. I just want to add that when we look at the project, we try and challenge ourselves as Brian said, without the advantaged feedstock to make sure we’re comfortable that we have a good project even in that conservative nature. And then obviously, the commercial teams are going to work very hard to optimize the feedstocks whether it’s to our other refineries or to the RD facilities. But we try and start out before we deploy that capital in such a way that we feel comfortable that we’ll have upside as we do better commercially on the feedstock side.
Manav Gupta: Thank you so much.
Mike Hennigan: You are welcome.
Operator: Next, you will hear from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is open.
Paul Cheng: Hi, thank you. Hey, guys. Good morning. I think in the past, you said if we’re looking at your refining portfolio, cars and they see the biggest potential upside. So – is there any kind of investment initiative that are you currently thinking on that to capture that upside? That’s the first question. Second question that maybe this is for Rick. When I’m looking at the third quarter, your throughput guidance, which has actually come in that to be about exactly the same as the second quarter, but the turnaround activity is significantly lower. So are we missing something? Or is number is just being very conservative, that one we had thought with the turnaround activity is much lower you will have a much higher throughput than the second quarter. Thank you.
Mike Hennigan: Paul, it’s Mike. I’ll start on the first one, I’ll let Rick take the second one. Similar to Manuv’s question is – we’ll give a little more color on 2024 capital in the next couple of quarters. We do have some projects that we think will continue to optimize our portfolio and improve upon it. But like I said a few minutes ago, it’s a little early to talk about that capital at this point. So if you can just hold your thought, we’ll give a little bit more on the next quarter and start to give you a little bit more insight as to what we’re thinking in ‘24.
Rick Hessling: Yes. Hi, Paul, it’s Rick. So on our throughput guidance for 3Q, you’re correct, it is lighter than 2Q, and we see that as an advantage, especially as a lot of our competitors have heavier turnaround work in 3Q. But with that being said, Paul, I think the one difference maybe that you’re not accounting for is the reformer outage. So when you factor that in, that’s really takes you to where we landed in our guidance, Paul. That’s really the only difference.
Paul Cheng: Where can I clarify on that because the reformer was done since in mid-May – and so this is only going to be I think maybe half of our quarter of the down timing. So that what dropped you 30,000, 40,000 barrels per day in total throughput. So – and it still is a really be surprised that the book level is not higher on the guidance for third quarter.
Maryann Mannen: Hey, Paul, it’s Maryann. Let me try to provide incremental color into all the commentary that Rick has given you. So you’re right, in the second quarter, the reformer was down from May 15 to the end of the quarter. For purposes of guidance in this quarter, what we have assumed is we would not be operational at all. So it’s about 75,000 a day, when we talk about the impact last quarter, it was about 1%. If you look at the impact, just strictly in the U.S. Gulf Coast from the absence of that particular unit not operating, it’s about a 7% reduction quarter-over-quarter in U.S. Gulf Coast, and that’s about a 3% overall to the whole system. So hopefully, that’s helpful to you.
Paul Cheng: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Sam Margolin: Hi, everyone. Thanks for calling my name. This is a macro question, and I want to harken back to a call, a Marathon call from earlier this year. I think it was Brian made the prediction that the Russian sanctions first diesel cracks will go down and then they would go up again. And that’s sort of exactly what happened and it has to do with the destock pattern and then later on, specification issues. And so I just want to bring that comment back to the service here and see if it is part of the reason for the strength we’re seeing in diesel cracks now and if you see in your export markets, for example, if you see a shortage of on-spec products that’s driving some of the strength there?
Brian Partee: Hey, Sam. Good to hear from you. Yes, absolutely. We are seeing things played out as we expected. I mentioned it earlier. I think the big thing with the Russian situation was the uncertainty, and I think the market has become much more certain today for all of us in terms of really limited friction on Russian distillate barrels hitting the world market. We have seen a little bit of market share exchange, deeper penetration of Russian barrels into Latin America, notably Brazil, an exchange share for the U.S. system into Europe. So we’re seeing here in the last couple of months, almost 300,000 barrels a day of distillate exports to backfill the European market. And what we’re hearing from customers over in Europe is really energy security. No surprise is a big driving factor for them. So with our team over in London right now, operating really, really strong, we are finding really good traction for our book over into Europe. But to your broader question on demand, the export market has been very stable and strong for many cycles now and continues to be our outlook going forward, the case on both gasoline and distillate.
Sam Margolin: Okay, thanks. And then this is an operational follow-up, but we’ve seen heavy intermediate differentials compress and it seems to correspond to a bunch of different factors, maybe starting up as one of them, but – there’s a couple of other similar new conversion units and new refining capacity starting up concurrently. And then you have the OPEC cuts. And so just on this heavy light set up and specifically on high-sulfur fuel oil, this is the tightness here just a function of all of these things happening at once. And then over time, the market will adjust and we might see just if I go back towards where it was? Or is this kind of the normalization with all the new capacity? Thanks.
Brian Partee: Yes, Sam, this is Brian. A couple of data points on that. So if you look at the heavy sulfur distillate spread. Of course, we swung real, real low last year. And of course, the system was in max distillate mode. So we were producing we, the whole entire refining complex is producing as much diesel as possible, which generated more high sulfur distillate, which outran hydrotreating capacity by and large, as we’ve come off of MAX diesel mode, and we’ve been in gasoline mode here as a system this summer. We’ve seen that retrench. So more of a traditional relationship. So I think the factor to look at is really, are we in MAX gas or MAX diesel load. Some of the things you mentioned are nominally impactful. But if you’re looking specifically at the Gulf Coast, the one kind of watch out is it’s a very thinly traded market, so it can move quite dramatically up or down depending on what’s occurring in the system.
Sam Margolin: Thanks so much.
Rick Hessling: Hey, Sam, this is Rick. Just to tag on to what Brian was saying, as part of your question, the heavy light crude differentials. So – we do believe the bottom is in. We’re actually quite optimistic. We believe that spread will get wider point forward through the end of this year. And it’s really for a variety of reasons. You’ve got increased planned turnaround work specifically in PADD 2 and 3 that’s going to take some crude demand needs off the table. So that will cause some length. You’ve got the Canadian producers that have come out of their maintenance season, and they are running well. And then you’ve got incremental Gulf of Mexico and Venezuela production from Chevron clearing to the U.S. Gulf Coast. So when we look at the markers and specifically, Sam on heavy Canadian, it hit its low in around June at about a $10 discount. The current trade cycles got it at about a $14 discount. So it’s widened out even significantly here over the last 30 days. And we continue to see it widening out further when you look at the forward curve between now and the end of the year.
Sam Margolin: Got it. Thank you so much.
Rick Hessling: You are welcome, Sam.
Operator: Next, we will hear from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen. You may proceed.
Jason Gabelman: Yes. Hey, thanks for taking my question. I want to key in on a couple of macro comments Mike made on the top of the call. I was hoping you could elaborate. First, he mentioned higher maintenance moving forward in almost every region that you operate in. It sounded like from Rick’s answer just now that was going to be impact you in PADD 2 and PADD 3. So one, can you confirm that? And is that higher maintenance sequentially? Or is it higher than what you would typically expect in the fall? And then secondly, on the macro, you mentioned some refinery startups globally are a bit delayed. I was wondering if there are any sites, in particular, that you had in mind? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.
Mike Hennigan: Yes, Jason, it’s Mike. I’ll start, and then I’ll let Rick jump in. What I was saying in the prepared remarks is we as a company have gone through four quarters of pretty heavy turnaround. And so we’re later into the rest of the year, compared to what we see as the industry, and we’ll have to see how it plays out, but it looks like the industry has a lot more activity into the rest of the year. So that’s what I was trying to say as far as the difference between where we are and where we think the rest of the industry is.
Rick Hessling: Yes. And then I’ll just tag on. In terms of global refining capacity, what we found, and it appears to continue to be true is over-promise and under-deliver. So generally speaking, I really don’t think it’s appropriate to give you specifics. But generally speaking, we’re seeing delays versus others throughout the world, meeting their projections of when that – when their utilization is going to come online. So, more of a general comment.
Jason Gabelman: Okay. Great. And my follow-up is on the Martinez biofuels projects. I just wanted to confirm because it’s tough to tell. It sounds like everything is going according to plan, but we’ve heard from industry sources that there are some court challenges that you’re having to address. Is that fair in terms of what’s going on? And is there any risk that any of these court challenges could impact the ramp up of the project to the full 730 million gallons?
Rick Hessling: So there were six challenges to our land use permit. We prevailed on five of them. And the one is currently still being briefed with the court, and we anticipate a favorable outcome here in the upcoming months. So nothing projected to impact construction and/or operation.
Jason Gabelman: To clarify, you need – can you ramp up while that court is ongoing, while our case is ongoing or would you need that to be resolved before you ramp up capacity?
Rick Hessling: No. We can continue both on construction and with the operation.
Jason Gabelman: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Roger Read: Thank you and good morning. I’d like to follow up as well on Martinez. Maybe just if you can help us out with understanding some of the milestones we should watch. We know that the industry has been challenging times to get these facilities to start up cleanly. You have obviously put out a goal of full run rate by the end of the year. So, as we think about this point in late October, looking back at the third quarter, where would you expect to see that unit? And when would you anticipate that it becomes a positive contributor in terms of EBITDA, cash flow, earnings?
Timothy Aydt: Roger, this is Tim. I will take that question. So, first off, the remaining construction activities at Martinez, they are on schedule and things are going very well. As both Brian and Mike indicated early on in the prepared remarks and the Q&A, we recently started up a portion of the Martinez pretreatment unit. And we are now pre-treating on-site with one train that will really just support the Phase 1 volumes. The big ticket item, though is when we ramp up with the second train at the end of the year when we bring alongside the RD capacity when the facility conversion is complete. So, I would give it positive remarks. Team is doing a great job and we look forward to the end of the year.
Mike Hennigan: And Roger, it’s Mike. To your question, financially, you got to be thinking into ‘24. As Tim said, we are ramping, we are starting up. We are going to bring on the additional units and if all goes well, we will be on by the end of the year. So, you will start to see the financial performance more in ‘24 on a go-forward basis.
Roger Read: That makes sense. And then maybe this question is for Maryann. Dickinson is a very small operation, so I understand as part of refining, but now that it’s going to be a much bigger overall operation, Granted, you own half of it via the Neste joint venture, but how should we think about from a reporting accounting standpoint, when are – or will we see a breakout of renewable diesel operations from the rest of the business?
Maryann Mannen: Thanks for the question, Roger. As you said, as it relates to Dickinson first, we have been operating for about 2 years and consistent with the way we have expected profitability there. Although some of the moving parts are different, we continue to see the performance of that consistent with what we thought. Mike just shared with you when we should expect to see real contribution from Martinez. So, we will evaluate both Dickinson and Martinez in terms of their total contribution. As you know, we have said for 2023, we are not planning to break that out. But we will come back to you as we continue to move along our path of profitability for both Dickinson and Martinez.
Mike Hennigan: And Roger, it’s Mike. The other thing and I know you know this already, but obviously, the refining assets cash flows are significantly higher than what’s happening in renewable diesel. I think the way you should think about that is, us looking at all our assets, and we talk about portfolio optimization to take two assets that we did not think would be competitive long-term and deserving of investing capital and it put them in a positive cash flow mode going forward, obviously, in a diesel mode as opposed to a crude mode. So, I think it’s more of a portfolio optimization realization compared to where we are on refining cash flows.
Roger Read: Well, I will just leave you with my final thoughts on it, which is we haven’t really put a lot in valuation uplift because it’s difficult to know exactly what some of the contributions will be and where. So, I think more disclosure will be a positive for you.
Mike Hennigan: Okay. I appreciate that feedback. Thank you.
Maryann Mannen: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Royall with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
John Royall: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, my first question is just coming back to the Galveston Bay reformer. Is there an update on when we could see that coming back? I know you are assuming out for the full quarter with 3Q guidance, but maybe just a little bit of color on where you are in that restart process beyond just that assumption in your guidance.
Timothy Aydt: So John, this is Tim. I will take part of that. And all I can really share is that we are expeditiously and prudently completing the repairs on that unit. And we don’t have any further guidance beyond what Maryann has already provided relative to schedule.
John Royall: Okay. Fair enough. And my next question is on tax. You had a very low rate in 2Q. You called out a $50 million-ish of that looks non-recurring. But even when I adjust for that, it’s still trending down the past couple of quarters. Is that just on the mix of non-taxable MPLX versus refining, with refining coming down past couple of quarters? Are there any other moving pieces to think about in the tax rate?
Maryann Mannen: Hey John, it’s Maryann. Yes, thanks for that. So, as we stated, the $53 million that I called out for you is related to prior periods. It’s a good news story. We were successful on a resolution of an item that has prior period benefit, and it will have some, but all bet smaller benefit going forward. And that’s about $0.13 in the quarter. As you have stated, typically the biggest mover on our rate is the relationship between our midstream business and our refining business. But from time-to-time, we could also have discrete items. Those items could be positive or negative. And in some cases, they are positive. But as you stated, the typical driver there, when you look at our Federal rate and the State tax rate would be that relationship.
John Royall: So, if I adjusted out the $53 million in this quarter, that’s a decent run rate to think about going forward?
Maryann Mannen: One of the things that you have said when you look at that rate, it’s a little bit lower than average. I think you are probably coming to around a 20% ZIP code in the quarter. As you have seen from last year, we have run about 22%. So, there is a range there, but certainly, 20% is at the lower end of that when you look at the relationships between refining and midstream today.
John Royall: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Your line is open.
Theresa Chen: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I just had a quick follow-up related to the discussion of the Martinez ramp up and your renewable diesel outlook in general. Related to the economics of LCFS, it seems that the final draft of the proposed changes will be submitted to CARB over the next couple of months. And I would love to hear your thoughts and expectations on where you see that landing and your general outlook for pricing from here?
Brian Partee: Theresa, good morning. This is Brian. Yes, so we have been very actively involved with CARB on the valuation of the reset. We remain optimistic. We believe CARB foundationally wants to find a way to support the program. Obviously, LCFS prices have come off fairly precipitously over the last couple of years as RD has penetrated. So, we are expecting support for the market. But note, LCFS is the smallest variable in our overall value equation. So, it’s not been a big needle mover, but we do think it’s important going forward to underpin the profitability on the RD space. In addition, obviously, we are looking at markets beyond California. So, as LCFS prices come down in California, there is other state-level programs on the West Coast and beyond that we are finding opportunities to penetrate with our RD market position.
Theresa Chen: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Matthew Blair with TPH. Your may proceed.
Matthew Blair: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions here. Chicago diesel cracks were quite weak earlier in July, even related to other PADD 2 markets like Group III. Do you have any color on what was going on here? It looks like they recovered so far, but any color as to why Chicago Diesel at one point was negative on an RBO adjusted basis?
Brian Partee: Yes. Matthew, this is Brian. Yes, it’s a great question. Clearly, overdone. It’s recovered fully. The unique nature of the Chicago Complex is the marker is in the far west side of Chicago, which from time-to-time can get pretty volatile. And I think really, that’s what we saw from a trade basis over on the west side of Chicago, but it’s recovered quite nicely here as we have trended out of that period of time. And we remain optimistic that we are in a good position as we head into the harvest season here in the Midwest where we expect to see distillate strength.
Matthew Blair: It sounds good. And then on the CARB data posted last night, it showed that in the first quarter of this year, California diesel consumption was 49% RD and up to 8% be the – for your Los Angeles refinery, are you having any problems placing your petroleum diesel volumes in that California market? And are you having to export new volumes to Singapore or Mexico? Do you consider that a risk down the road?
Brian Partee: Yes, Matthew, this is Brian. On the prop basis, no problems clearing the barrels. But yes, you are on point there. As RD penetrates the California market, it’s a one-for-one relationship. It’s fairly balanced. I will say the West Coast system as a whole, that our expectation and planning horizon does include the ability to make sure that we can export barrels beyond the U.S. In addition, obviously, jet is very, very strong right now. So, if you look at the yield structure in terms of how we are running the refineries, we are working really, really hard to make sure that we are maximizing jet fuel at the cost of the distillate side of the book.
Matthew Blair: Great. Thank you.
Brian Partee: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. We do have time for just one more question. Our last question comes from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Ryan Todd: Okay. Thanks. Maybe a question on the refining side, on the Gulf Coast, you had very strong performance despite the downtime at the reformer at Galveston Bay. Can you – I am curious as to how much contribution you saw from the STAR expansion in the quarter? And maybe just an update on how the expansion of that project is going forward and contribution in the future?
Maryann Mannen: Yes. Thanks for the question, Ryan. It’s Maryann. Let me try to give you a little bit of color. When you look at Q1 to Q2 performance, keep in mind in the U.S. Gulf Coast, as you stated, we were under turnaround in the first quarter and obviously ramping up. So, you saw the benefits of that, obviously, in the second quarter despite the fact that we did have the reformer down for just a portion of the month. As I was commenting on, it’s only about a 1% impact for the second quarter that will get a little bit larger, as I shared, given the fact that we are assuming it to be down. I think the other thing to keep in mind is typically when we look at cost in the quarter, when we are doing heavy turnarounds, as we did in the first quarter, we are typically doing other maintenance work and that was much lighter in the second quarter as well. As it relates to STAR, as you know, we were ramping up our comments as we have been sharing STAR was ramping up through the second quarter. So, minimal impact with respect to STAR, but you will begin to see that now as we have reached the completion of that project.
Ryan Todd: Great. Thank you, Maryann. And maybe just kind of a high-level question, you have obviously been active today in various low-carbon transportation fuels, meaningful investment in renewable diesel, even a recent investment in an RNG producer. As you look at the long-term outlook for transportation fuels in your markets over the next 10 years, how are you thinking about your overall strategy for the transition? In particular, maybe a sense of your role in a broader definition of transportation fuels. And where do you go from here in terms of potential future investments?
Mike Hennigan: Yes, Ryan, it’s Mike. I like the word energy evolution more than energy transition. I know a lot of people use energy transition, but I think it’s going to evolve over a longer period of time than most have written about. So we’re trying to be very thoughtful. We will using the word evolve. We will evolve the company over time. As you pointed out, 2 of our facilities now are renewable diesel. We made a small investment in an RNG facility. So Dave and his team are looking at all those opportunities. We talked on the call today about we’re active in some of the DOE hydrogen hubs, and we’ll see how that plays out over time. So think of us as going to be very thoughtful. We try to use the word strict capital discipline. We do want to invest as opportunities present themselves, but we are committed to getting solid returns. So overall, I’d say you’re just going to see us chip away at little activities over time and constantly evolve it to your point about, what are we going to look like in 10 years? And 10 years, 20 years or whatever Marathon has been around for 130 years. We plan to be around for 130 more. So we’ll evolve the company as the market dictates. And obviously, consumer preferences, regulatory impacts, all those things are going to drive what happens and we’ll be very attentive to it and we’ll look to deploy capital as we see the opportunities.
Kristina Kazarian: Alright. Well, thank you for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or would you like clarification on topics discussed this morning, please reach out a member of our Investor Relations team will be here to help today. Thank you so much, everyone.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today’s conference. Thank you once again for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-02 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MPC First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. My name is Sheila, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.
Kristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO; and other members of the executive team. . We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike.
Michael Hennigan : Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone. Let me first share our view on the macro environment. In the first quarter, volatility in the global energy market remained high, driven by uncertainties around the potential for recession, the pace of China's economic recovery and the impact of sanctions on Russian products. At the same time, supply remains tight, supported by nearly 4 million barrels per day of global refining capacity that has come offline in the last couple of years. Global demand continues to grow as the need for affordable, reliable energy increases throughout the world. IEA is projecting 2 million barrels a day increase in 2023. Since last quarter, distillate cracks have come down, gasoline cracks have improved as expected given the onset of the summer driving season. So overall, we believe supply constraints and growing demand will support strong refining margins throughout 2023. Cracks have decreased from 2022 levels but still above historic mid-cycle levels. In alignment with what we said last quarter, we remain bullish into the driving season, and gasoline strength is expected to improve the diesel situation, while jet demand continues to improve. As we continue through the year, much will depend on the ongoing recovery in China and the extent, if any, of recessionary impacts. We continue building out our global presence, supported by our offices in Houston, London and Singapore as we invest in our global commercial strategy. And our cost advantaged refining system is well positioned to supply growing markets. This quarter, despite significant planned turnaround work at several key facilities, in particular, in our Gulf Coast region at Galveston Bay and Garyville, we delivered the strongest first quarter results in the company's history. Planned maintenance activities reduced refinery throughput by 11 million barrels compared with the fourth quarter. Our team's operational and commercial execution supported our ability to generate Refining & Marketing segment adjusted EBITDA of nearly $4 billion or $15.09 per barrel. MPLX remains a strategic part of MPC's portfolio as it continues to grow its cash flows and capital returns. Our Midstream segment delivers durable and growing earnings. This quarter, it generated adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion, which is up 9% year-over-year. MPLX distributions to MPC was roughly $500 million this quarter and an annualized rate of over $2 billion, which fully covers MPC's dividend as well as half of our planned 2023 capital program. During the first quarter, we advanced value-creating projects. At Galveston Bay, we completed the STAR project. Rather than expand the GBR cokers, we elected to upgrade the resid hydrocracker unit as it offers better conversion and increased liquid volume yield. Fractionation modifications offer increased diesel recovery and the refinery will be able to process significantly more discounted heavy crude. Overall, STAR is expected to add 40,000 barrels per day of incremental crude capacity and 17,000 barrels a day of resid processing capacity. Start-up activities are progressing and we expect STAR to ramp through the second quarter of 2023. The incremental profitability from this project will primarily be determined by the spread between heavy crude and untreated diesel over the incremental 40,000 barrels a day of crude capacity. At the Martinez renewable fuels facility, we reached full Phase I production capacity of 260 million gallons per year of renewable fuels, ramping to design rates and yields as planned. Phase II construction activities are on schedule. Pretreatment capabilities are expected to come online in the second half of 2023, which will enable the facility to ramp to its full expected capacity of 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023. Martinez will be among the largest renewable diesel facilities in the world, underpinned by a competitive operating and capital cost profile, robust inbound and outbound logistics flexibility and advantaged feedstock slate and our strategic relationship with Neste. In the first quarter, we returned over $3.5 billion to MPC shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. And today, we announced an additional $5 billion share repurchase authorization reinforcing our commitment to strong capital returns. Let me share some of the progress on our low-carbon initiatives. The Martinez indicative facilities are competitively advantaged. They're supported by upstream value-creation integration with our Beatrice and Cincinnati pretreatment plants and downstream integration with our vast marketing footprint. The strategic partnerships we're cultivating with Neste, ADM and the Andersons creates platforms for additional collaboration within renewables. This quarter, we had an investment in an emerging producer of dairy farm-based renewable natural gas, providing the ability to participate in early-stage development at an attractive entry point. Our Virent subsidiary is progressing a commercially feasible assessment for converting bio-based feedstocks in the gasoline and sustainable aviation fuel. We believe for these projects and opportunities we are taking steps to advance our goal to lower the carbon intensity of our operations and the products we manufacture and supply to a growing market. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann.
Maryann Mannen : Thanks, Mike. Moving to first quarter results. Slide 5 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $6.09. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.2 billion for the quarter, and cash flow from operations, excluding unfavorable working capital changes, was nearly $4.2 billion. During the quarter, we returned $337 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased nearly $3.2 billion of our shares.  Slide 6 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from fourth quarter 2022 to first quarter 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $600 million. This decrease was driven by Refining & Marketing as refining margins per barrel were down quarter-over-quarter. As we indicated last quarter, throughputs were lower primarily due to the significant planned turnaround activity. Corporate expenses were roughly in line with our guidance. And despite general inflationary pressures, we have maintained cost discipline since taking $100 million out of corporate costs since 2020. The tax rate for the first quarter was 21%, resulting in a tax provision of approximately $800 million. Moving to our segment results. Slide 7 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. Like many in the industry, several of our refineries were impacted by winter storm Elliot at the end of December. These impacts carried into the first quarter, reducing our crude throughput by 3 million barrels. Winter Storm Elliott and higher planned maintenance in the Gulf Coast region reduced overall refining utilization, which was down 5% to 89%. Sequentially, per barrel margins were lower in all regions compared with the fourth quarter. Capture was 98%, reflecting a strong result from our commercial team, particularly given the extensive turnaround activity this quarter. Refining operating costs per barrel were roughly flat sequentially in the first quarter at $5.68. Lower throughput compared to the fourth quarter impacted operating cost per barrel. This was partially offset by lower energy costs, primarily in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Con regions, although we experienced higher natural gas prices in the West Coast. We expect operating cost per barrel to be lower in the second quarter as reflected in our guidance. Slide 8 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing margin capture this quarter, which was 98%. Our commercial teams executed effectively in a volatile market environment. Light product margin tailwinds were balanced against impacts associated with inventory builds and planned maintenance activity. Capture results will fluctuate based on market dynamics. Still, we believe through our commercial efforts, our capture baseline has moved closer to 100%. As our strategic pillar indicates, we have been committed to improving our commercial performance and believe that the capabilities we have built over the last 18 months will provide a sustainable advantage, we have meaningfully changed the way we go to market from a commercial perspective throughout our entire company. We believe these capabilities will provide incremental value beyond what we have realized to date. Slide 9 shows the change in our Midstream adjusted EBITDA versus the fourth quarter of 2022. Our Midstream segment delivered resilient first quarter results. Adjusted EBITDA was 9% higher year-over-year, reflecting business growth. Our Midstream business continues to grow and generate strong cash flows. We are advancing our capital plan with projects anchored in the Marcellus, Permian and Bakken basins. These disciplined investments in high-return projects, along with our focus on cost flow optimization, are expected to grow our cash flows. This will allow us to reinvest in the business and return capital to unitholders. This quarter, MPLX distributions contributed $502 million in cash flow to MPC. MPLX remains a source of durable earnings in the MPC portfolio and is a differentiator for us compared to peers without Midstream businesses. Slide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the first quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was nearly $4.2 billion in the quarter. Working capital was a $98 million headwind for the quarter, driven primarily by increases in crude and product inventory, offsetting benefits from a decrease in refined product receivables related to lower product sales. Capital expenditures and investments totaling $664 million this quarter. We saw consistent spending in refining in the first quarter as were progressed on the Martinez renewable fuel facility conversion and the completion of the Galveston Bay STAR project. MPC returned over $3.5 billion via share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. This represents an 85% payout of the nearly $4.2 billion of operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment to superior shareholder returns. We now have $9 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization which includes the additional $5 billion approval announced today. At the end of the first quarter, NPC had approximately $11.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. Turning to guidance. On Slide 11, we provide our second quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of roughly 2.6 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 91%. Utilization is forecast to be higher than the first quarter levels due to planned turnaround activity having a lower impact on crude units in the second quarter. Planned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $400 million in the quarter, with activity primarily in the Mid-Con and West Coast regions. We expect turnaround activity to be front-half weighted in 2023. By the end of the second quarter, we expect to spend roughly $760 million on turnaround in 2023 and anticipate the full year turnaround spend to be comparable to the level of spend in 2022. Operating cost per barrel in the second quarter are expected to be lower at $5.20 as we expect to see benefits from higher throughput and lower energy costs. As we look further into 2023, we anticipate our operating cost per barrel would decline and trend towards a more normalized level of $5 per barrel as we complete turnaround and project activity. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.35 billion for the second quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $175 million, representing the sustained reductions that we have made in this area. To recap, our first quarter results reflect our team's strong operational and commercial execution across the company. Our capital allocation framework remains consistent. We will invest in sustaining our asset base while paying a secure competitive dividend with the potential for growth. We want to grow the company's earnings and we will exercise strict capital discipline beyond these three priorities we are committed to returning excess capital through share repurchases to meaningfully lower our share count. With that, let me pass it back to Mike.
Michael Hennigan : Thanks, Maryann. In summary, our results reflect the strongest first quarter in the company's history, generating $5.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA. MPLX remains a source of durable earnings in the MPC portfolio, distributing just over $500 million to MPC this quarter. And as MPLX grows its free cash flow, we believe we'll have capacity to increase capital returns to MPC. This quarter, we invested $664 million. We will invest capital where we believe there are attractive returns. We remain focused on ensuring the competitiveness of our assets as we progress through the energy evolution. Solid execution of our three strategic pillars is foundational. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. We believe the improvements we've made to our cost structure, portfolio and commercial and operational execution have driven sustainable structural benefits, which will enable us to capture opportunities irrespective of the market environment. We believe MPC is positioned as the refiner investment of choice with the ability to generate the most cash through cycle and delivering superior returns to our shareholders with our steadfast commitment to returning capital. Let me turn the call back to Kristina.
Kristina Kazarian : Thanks, Mike. As we open the call for your question, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions. Sheila, we are ready for them.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta : Congrats on a great first quarter. I had a couple of questions here. The first is around the West Coast. We're all watching Singapore margins right now and they continue to trade very weak. And just your perspective of, do you think the weakness in Asia is a reflection of demand? And do you see risk that, that product comes to the West Coast at which point there could be some downward pressure on PADD 5 margins?
Rick Hessling : Neil, it's Rick. Really, I think the way we look at it is -- we're looking at it from a global perspective. So we'll touch on the West Coast here in a moment. But when you think globally, it's a great call out to put Asia and Singapore in a bucket, but I'd also throw Europe into that bucket as well. And if we've learned anything over the last couple of years as trade flows and cracks or the world is more connected than it's ever been. So it's a really good call out in drawing if there is a truly impact to the U.S. refiners. One thing I'd say is as we look at Asia and Europe specifically, we actually see that as support for U.S. cracks. We see it as bullish for MPC. I mean we're hearing rumors of both regions you mentioned, Singapore and Asia and Europe, we're hearing rumors of run cuts there, which we see as bullish for us, especially on the West Coast, as you know, the incremental barrel at times comes from Asia. And if it doesn't come to the West Coast, we see that as positive for margins and cracks. And then lastly, I'd say our breakeven is structurally lower than it's been in the past. And as we view Europe as the marginal player in the world, we have a competitive advantage, as you know, on energy costs, feedstock acquisition, complexity of our refineries, our workforce, our reliability. And then last, but certainly not least, we have an incredible export -- global export program on products. So we're able to clear our markets quite well. So we believe if you -- when you add all of those up, Neil, it really gives us quite the competitive advantage, specifically in the West Coast, but I would say in PADDS 2, 3 and 5 where we operate. And with that, I'll ask Brian if he has any specific comments on products in the West Coast to add.
Brian Partee : Yes. Thanks, Rick, and Neil. Just a quick data point. Very good question. We are seeing some fundamental shifts in global trade flows as a result of economic activities and product sanctions, et cetera. Rick did mention the marginal barrel coming into the West Coast has traditionally been for many years, an import coming from the Far East. So just on order of magnitude, we're looking at 250,000 barrels a day to balance the system, primarily gas and jet fuel, and we expect that balance to continue to trend in terms of favoring more imports as we go forward as more facilities are converted to RD on the West Coast. Other data point, I think that's relevant in terms of penetrating the West Coast market and from the Far East, is also the tanker rates and availability of the foreign fleet. Current rates out of South Korea into the West Coast are about $8 a barrel. That's about 2x of what historically we've seen in the market. And the other two components that make it a little bit tricky to push incremental barrels into the West Coast or, of course, in California, you meet the spec. And then just logistics constraints in terms of docs and tankage, which are also being further constrained by some of the RD penetration that we're seeing in the West Coast market.
Neil Mehta : That's great perspective, guys. And then a follow-up for me is just around return of capital. And you guys have done a super job getting the share count down. Is there a consideration here though, given the degree of economic uncertainty that might be out there about downside resilience through strengthening the balance sheet as we've seen in the past, companies have gotten themselves in trouble by buying back stock towards the top of the cycle, and you guys have generally been countercyclical in your buyback approach.
Maryann Mannen : Neil, thanks for the question. It's Maryann. So look, first of all, as you know, we've got a little over $11.5 billion of cash sitting on the MPC balance sheet. And you've heard from the team, and Mike this morning, our views on the balance of the year. We do take into consideration each time we make our decisions what the share repurchase will look like, and we do that quarterly. We look at the macro conditions. We look at our cash positions. Obviously, having a strong balance sheet is foundational for us to be able to execute our capital allocation program as we just shared with you. But we do take a look at it quarterly. It is not something that we set for a long period of time. We have the ability to evaluate all of those things, as you just outlined for us.
Operator: Our next question will come from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Kalei Akamine: This is actually Kalei on for Doug. My first question is just on the macro and how you're positioned here for the second quarter. So your peers are seeing really solid demand numbers and your opening commentary was quite constructive. Yes, the throughput guidance put out for the second quarter looks a bit conservative. So at a high level, can you share any insights on demand from your own system and maybe elaborate a bit more on your outlook near term?
Brian Partee : This is Brian. Yes, let me weigh in on that. So first and foremost, as we look across an outlook for demand, we really look comprehensively at our entire book of business from a marketing standpoint. So it's including our wholesale class of trade, our direct dealer our branded jobber, our national accounts. So we really think that, that's more reflective of the market as a whole. And let me give you some color on the quarter. So I'll give you some numbers in terms of what Q1 look like relative to Q1 of 2022. So on the gasoline front, our book of business is just described was up 4.7%. The EIA call on demand on Q1 was about 1.7%. On the West Coast, despite some historically heavy rainfall and flood events, we're actually flat year-on-year, which bodes for some optimism as we trend into the summer in the West Coast. On the distillate side, we are off about 1.2% in the first quarter. EIA call on demand was down about 7%, but we believe that's heavily weighted with some sluggish home heat demand due to the warmer weather temperatures this past winter in the Northeast. On the West Coast, often asked in terms of distillate, we were actually up 1.4% year-on-year again despite those weather events. And on the jet fuel side of the business, we saw a 6% rise in demand in the quarter, which comps to about 5% from the EIA perspective. And we expect to see jet to continue to grow on the trend that it's been on really over the last two years to reach pre-pandemic levels late this year into early 2024. A couple of other really important data points as we look forward on demand, I think it's important to mention that -- if we look at gasoline, last year around this time of the year, we were about $4.20 per gallon at retail. We're currently around $3.61. So about 15% below prior year. We believe that bodes favorably. We're seeing that. As we look at our April sales, as we trend into Q2, we've seen week-on-week growth. So we're seeing that optimism built into the summer driving season. And similarly, on the distillate side, retail is off almost 22% year-on-year. Now as it relates to some of the sluggishness in demand in the first quarter on the distillate side of the book, as we look domestically, certainly, inflation is creating some degree of drag on demand. We're seeing that really pretty consistently across the U.S. on a nominal basis coming off a pretty high clip over the last year or so. But it goes without saying, with the inflationary pressures, you do expect to see some demand curtailments, and we do see that manifesting. But it's not something that is a bright red light for us right now. It's something that we're watching closely. As we trend into the ag season here in the Mid-Con, we're seeing early signs of recovery of demand as we go into the second quarter and have optimism as we roll through the balance of the year. The last thing I would say is as we look forward, and we've seen a shift away from a demand perspective, favoring diesel to gasoline. We do think that, that sets up well for our commercial capabilities as we look to do more inter and intra-regional optimization as we come away from a strong, strong distillate lead over the last 1.5 years or so, to more of a balance between gas and diesel in terms of which one leads the crack.
Kalei Akamine: So I guess, on balance, it sounds quite positive. My second question is for Maryann. The buyback is obviously something that separates you from your peers, and we appreciate the visibility provided by the $5 billion expansion today. But I want to ask about the ordinary dividend. In our view, refining is not contributing to that dividend today as it's more than covered by the distributions from MPLX. So as you close out spending on the STAR project and consider what we think is a reset in the mid-cycle, it looks like the dividend has a lot of capacity to increase here. So how are you thinking about that piece of your value proposition?
Maryann Mannen : Thanks for the question. So as it relates to the dividend, we continue to be committed to the secure competitive and as we've said, potentially growing dividend. We've committed to evaluate that dividend at least annually, and we intend to do so in a very similar schedule as we did in 2022. It is part of the capital allocation framework, as we've shared, and we will evaluate that in a similar time frame as we did in 2022. 
Michael Hennigan : I just want to add to that. Thanks for noticing that. One of the things that we think is unique in our value proposition is the $2 billion-plus that we're getting from MPLX. And if you listen to the call earlier, MPLX had a very strong quarter. We continue to grow the cash flows at MPLX. We'll have a similar distribution increased discussion later in the year. But I think it's pretty important to understand that $2 billion-plus coming in, as you mentioned and I mentioned in prepared remarks, covers the dividend and a good portion of the capital. So I think it's a pretty important point as to the way we think about all the cash flows within the portfolio. So thanks for pointing that out, and it does come into our thinking as we advance both dividend and repurchase activity.
Operator: Our next question will come from Manav Gupta with UBS.
Manav Gupta : See, I quickly just wanted to focus a little bit on Galveston-based STAR project. I think it's not as well understood. And if you could help us understand how to model it little more accurately? I mean, 40,000 barrel day increase we can model more accurately. But how does the 17,000-barrel resid processing capacity, what are the spreads we should watch for that so we can give you full credit for this project because I honestly don't think you're getting too much credit for this project in your numbers?
Michael Hennigan : Manav, it's Mike. I'll start, and then I'll let Tim add some color. As far as modeling, the way to think about the incremental change at the plant now is we'll be able to run 40,000 barrels a day of more heavy crude with the additional resid processing capability. So the way to model it is 40,000 times the delta between heavy crude and untreated or unfinished distillate that's exactly what STAR is doing, and then we can add in commercial changes to that, et cetera, et cetera. But as far as the modeling, it's that delta for whatever margin you think. And today, I will say, right today, that's running about $15 to give you a point in time, multiply it by the 40,000 and wherever you project margins into the future. Tim, can give a little bit more color on where we stand on the project itself.
Tim Aydt: Yes, Manav, this is Tim. Thanks for the question. I would say that you have to keep in mind is, first off, I think, that we completed this project in phases. So really a good amount of the STAR scope has already been completed and has been put in service previously. So it's already earning a return. I think the remaining STAR project is really around this resid portion of the room. So that is indeed finished up during the mechanical completion during the first quarter turnaround and then we've been in start-up during April. So that's all looking good from that standpoint. I think the other thing that I would say is that we ended up expanding the -- hydrocracker instead of the GBR cokers -- and that's really because of the better conversion and the liquid volume expansion that you get with the addition of the hydrogen. So that can maybe be explained a little bit if you -- if you look at a comparison between a coker and the RHU unit, if you put 100 barrels of liquid into the coker, you get about 80 barrels of liquid out and the rest is coke. That's lower value. If you put that same 100 in the RHU unit, you get 107 barrels of liquids out. So obviously, that 27 barrels is about 34% increase in liquids, which are higher valued. So that's why we made that decision. I would also point out that GBR is unique and this got the only operating resid hydrocracker unit in the U.S. So that's what made that beneficial. And we had a pretty capital-efficient project there to make the modifications to the RHU as opposed to starting with another greenfield coker. So hopefully, that's helpful.
Manav Gupta : That's very helpful. My follow-up quickly here is your first phase of Martinez is already on, looks like a very smooth start compared to some of the other projects which are facing problems. Now obviously, at some point, pretreat comes on and then the second phase. So if you could just walk us through when everything starts up. And then there is one small request is that once everything starts up, you probably are one of the bigger producers of renewable diesel. So at some point, if you could break those earnings out for us, then we can give you more credit for it.
Tim Aydt: Okay. Manav, I'll start with maybe just giving an update on the schedule. So you are correct. The Martinez has reached the full Phase I production of 260 million gallons per year back in -- earlier in the first quarter. Facility did ramp up to the design rates as planned and as scheduled. We're happy to report that the remaining construction activities at Martinez are on schedule. Regarding the pretreatment unit, that's scheduled to come online in the second half of 2023. And then by the end of the year, we're looking to have the full rate of production of renewable diesel at 730 million gallons per year by the end of December. And now I'll turn it to Maryann relative to the second part of your question.
Maryann Mannen : Thanks for the question, Manav. Yes. We'll continue to evaluate the appropriate timing for a renewable segment. As we've shared before, for 2023, we won't have a renewable segment, but we recognize the question. We recognize the importance of our renewables and commitment to low-carbon strategies, and we'll continue to evaluate that and make a proper determination as these projects come full online as to when we'll do that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.
Paul Cheng : Can I just go back into the Galveston Bay? Can you -- I mean, you talked about wanting more oil. Does it in any shape or form that change your product slate and also that what is the OpEx associated with wondering that additional assets or that expanded asset?
Michael Hennigan : Yes, Paul, I think you hit it on the head. It just gives us more ability to run heavy crudes. So that's at the front end and the incremental coming out the back end is distillate. The project itself coming out of the resid hydrotreater, it's unfinished distillate, but that's why I was trying to answer Manav's question on how to model it. The easiest way to think about it is heavy crude to unfinished distillate. That's the crack spread of the incremental change.
Paul Cheng : So we should assume that the entire 40,000 -- because then you have a monometric expansion, so that your throughput is up, say, 43,000 barrels per day. Is it all of them that will be distillate or 70%?
Michael Hennigan : No, no, it's the 40,000 Manav -- I'm sorry, Paul. I'm saying just like I answered to Manav is, it's 40,000 barrels a day of crude that comes into the plant, heavy crude, what comes out of the plant is untreated distillate.
Paul Cheng : I see. Okay. So at the end of time, will be untreated distillate. And how about the OpEx associated with that unit? Is that...
Michael Hennigan : We haven't given that specific -- that particular unit itself specifics.
Paul Cheng : Okay. The second question is quite simple. Maryann in your presentation, you indicated that first quarter result was being hurt by unfavorable inventories impact. Can you quantify and that -- also that -- say where's that unfavorable inventory impact that you’re showing up? I suppose that you're showing up in the plant but not solution? And also that -- whether those will get reversed in the second quarter?
Maryann Mannen : Sure, Paul. So in the quarter, as I was trying to share capture in the quarter was 98%. There were a couple of key factors that actually impacted our performance. One of those, as I mentioned, was planned turnarounds. Obviously, that impacted throughput, Galveston Bay. And as you know, we took Galveston Bay -- we took that opportunity to complete STAR as well. And there was also turnaround in the Mid-Con as well. The second driver was inventory impacts. And you may remember from the fourth quarter, we actually had a tailwind. We built some inventory in the quarter. We wouldn't expect necessarily that inventory to impact the second quarter as well, but those things are volatile. And then one of the key benefits in the quarter was actually light product margins. In the second quarter, we gave guidance. But remember, we are very much front-half-weighted from a turnaround perspective. Actually, our guidance for Q2, roughly $400 million is above the first quarter actual turnaround expense. This will be for us four quarters of heavy turnaround somewhat unprecedented. We made what we think were some good decisions in early 2022 to delay turnaround to be sure that we did not have lost opportunity with respect to the heavy driving season and the increased demand. And similarly, when we think about the second quarter, we would expect that the months of May and June would see benefit as we look at the turnaround expense there. So I will pause there and see if maybe Rick and/or Brian want to add any incremental color with respect to the performance in the quarter.
Paul Cheng : And Maryann, I just want to clarify that. So the first quarter, the statement saying that is a negative inventory -- unfavorable inventory impact, that is the absence of the fourth quarter benefit or that it actually is a negative inventory impact in the first quarter?
Maryann Mannen : No, Paul, sorry about that. It is actually a negative impact in the first quarter. We actually built inventory in the quarter.
Paul Cheng : And would you quantify how big is that?
Maryann Mannen : Paul, we normally don't give that level of detail. It was not, however, the -- of those three elements, it was not the single largest driver.
Paul Cheng : Okay. And can you tell us which region that majority of the inventory build happened? Or is it just across all regions?
Maryann Mannen : Yes. We had inventory builds across all regions, Paul. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.
Sam Margolin : This one is on diesel. It connects to some of your comments earlier about the heating impact and maybe some timing-related factors in the market. But there was an expectation that as jet fuel recovered that it would benefit the diesel market because there was some overblending of jet components into diesel and we ran into sort of tough demand comps around both price and weather. And so maybe that benefit didn't necessarily filter through, but I was wondering, since you're so you guys are pretty indexed heavily to the jet market probably see things that other operators don't. If you think that, that benefit is maybe coming just a little bit on a lag, particularly given some of your comments around demand on the jet side, which seems to be performing as expected
Brian Partee : Yes, Sam, this is Brian. Yes, very good question, very on point. I think the question here in the paradox is demand looks fairly decent as you look across the distillate barrel, but we've seen this sell off here over the last several weeks. So there lies the question. And our view is it's a little bit overdone. But I think the read-through is not on the macro fundamentals of supply and demand. But the one element that we think overreached into the distillate market and the outlook was the Russian sanctions. So we've all been anticipating the sanctions that went into place earlier this year and the associated impacts were uncertain. And as you know, the market doesn't process uncertainty very well. And I think the market had to be more bearish view, if you will, of those sanctions and the implications in terms of slowing flows into the global market. And what we've seen is those flows have continued, albeit at a pretty significant discount, they have continued. So I think the overreach or the overarching sentiment around distillate and valuation is not on supply and demand, but with a little bit more clarity around the impact or lack of impact, if you will, on the Russian sanctions on the global distillate flows.
Sam Margolin : Okay. Yes, that makes sense. We saw the same thing in crude, I guess. Sorry, go ahead.
Michael Hennigan : No, I was just going to add, Sam, we still are constructive on jet recovery as well, to your point. It's been slowly moving in the right direction. We think that's going to continue to advance throughout. And if gasoline is as strong as we think it's going to be, I mean, inventories are still pretty low gasoline compared to last year compared to the 5-year average, however, you want to look at it. It's a constructive gasoline market, it's a recovering jet market. And in our view, that bode well for distillate.
Sam Margolin : Okay. And as a follow-up, this is sort of a redo on Neil's question about the balance sheet structure and capital allocation, but I'll put it in a different way. I think a lot of people are aware now that the MPLX distribution more than covers the MPC dividend, but what's interesting now is that your interest income on your cash balance covers like half of the MPC dividend or almost. And it's -- there's a matter of uncertainty in the economic environment, but then there's also sort of what's going on with rates and the optimal capital structure around that. So I'm just wondering if -- maybe there's a change to kind of the mid-cycle cash balance that I think was $1.5 billion that you were targeting?
Michael Hennigan : Yes. I'm going to start and turn it over to Maryann. Thanks for pointing that out as well, Sam. One of the things, I know all the analysts want to hear, what are we going to do over the next 12 months or so? And what we've been trying to say is it's much more of a dynamic discussion. Obviously, having north of $11 billion on the balance sheet is an important part of what we're doing. And at the end of the day, you said it very well. We're generating a decent amount of earnings off of that compared to where we were just a time ago.  So overall, I think the message that everybody should take away is we're not projecting out 12 months as to what we're going to do there because we think it's a real-time discussion. We are committed. As everybody has seen our DNA, we're committed to returning capital. At the same time, we look at all the parameters that come into play there. The MPLX distribution, the interest that we're getting on that, et cetera, et cetera. So I think you pointed out a couple of things that are important in our discussion and I know it frustrates people that we won't say what we're going to do for the next 12 or 18 months. But I think you've seen us get additional authorization from the Board. So we're committed to returning capital. I think you've seen us be very strict in our discipline on investing capital. We'll continue to do that. And our thought is, over the long term, that gives us the ability to increase value for shareholders.
Maryann Mannen : I think Mike has covered it well. We talked about ultimately carrying $1 billion. We've had some real life during COVID stress testing of that. We remain committed to our $1 billion. Your comment around interest, I think, is a real fair one. When you look at the -- our total interest and other financial costs. You can see over the last several quarters, the impact of the benefit of interest income on those cash balances as well, Sam. So I hope we've covered your question well.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen.
Jason Gabelman : I wanted to first ask -- I want to first ask on the light heavy spreads. They've come in quite a bit. It looks like Brent is now below $12. Can you just talk about what you're seeing in the market? Why that tightening is occurring? And if we were setting back to maybe something that's a more typical light-heavy spread versus where we've been the past 6 months or so?
Rick Hessling : Jason, it's Rick. So actually, we believe the market's been overdone, which is often the case in markets. When you look at Q4, one could say it was overdone to the positive for us. Right now, we're looking and saying it's overdone to the negative. And a lot of things are yet to play out. And what I mean by that is when you look at the OPEC+ announced cuts, what will they really cut? History says they announced something and then often do less. So we'll watch that play out throughout the global flows. But in addition to that, I think a dynamic that we've seen change, and we actually view as a positive for us in some instances as barrels are staying closer to home. So what do I mean by that? When you look at Gulf of Mexico production, you look at BP's Mad Dog 2, look at Shell's Vitol platforms that just came online, that's incremental production right in our backyard in the Gulf Coast. We have a really close pulse on Canadian production, and we're seeing upticks in Canadian production. And that's positive for us throughout our entire system. Then you have the Venezuelan barrels that have been in the news lately, the Chevron [Venz] barrels that we and others have taken advantage of. So I think this is yet to fully play out, Jason. I don't think it's as bad as it is today. Where it will go? That's a tough call. We just don't feel it is as depressed of an environment from a sweet-sour spread is what you're seeing today. And then lastly, I'll state, we were a big buyer of SPR barrels. Those barrels will just be coming into our system. That data is public. So when you add up all of the pluses and minuses, we actually feel a little more optimistic today going forward than pessimistic.
Jason Gabelman : Great. I appreciate that outlook. My second question, I wanted to follow up on prepared -- on the prepared remarks you made around the low carbon business. And it seems like you may have aspirations to grow this business well beyond the Martinez renewable diesel plant. You talked about partnerships with a few counterparties, you purchase -- or you bought into the small RNG business. Can you just -- and then I guess the other thing is you have exposure to natural gas sourcing via MPLX. So I was just hoping if you could discuss maybe broadly, how you see this business evolving over the next few years? How big it could get? What the areas of growth you're focused on, particularly in light of the Inflation Reduction Act?
Michael Hennigan : Yes. So I'll start. We're very enthusiastic that there could be some opportunities, albeit we think it's going to take a considerable amount of time for those to develop. We guided at the last quarter that we would spend about $350 million roughly in our low carbon portfolio. As you heard in our prepared remarks, we have some things going on in a couple of different areas. . I think at the end of the day, that's why I keep using the word evolution rather than transition. It's going to evolve over a long period of time. It's going to be something that we think will be additive to our base business, but it will take a while for it to be meaningfully different than the strong refining and natural gas footprint that we have. But we're trying to be attentive to it. I mean we understand how the pendulum is going to move in that direction. We think the pace will be slower than other people think in general. But at the same time, we do think there's some opportunities for us. As we mentioned, we've made a small investment in renewable natural gas, which -- if that continues to be what we think it could be, we'll continue to put capital to work there. We went in at an early entry point. We thought that was important for us, and then we'll see if we can grow out that business as -- that's just one example. So we're attentive to it. Dave's team has a lot of resource looking for opportunities for us. And as we see them, we'll continue to update you.
Kristina Kazarian: Sheila, I think we are ready for the next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.
Roger Read : Coming back to commentary on the gasoline markets. Just kind of maybe dig in a little deeper where you see the bigger issues, be it gasoline supply itself, whether it's components and then as we think across the 5 PADDs, the stress is not evenly distributed, right? I mean PADD 3 doesn't look all that bad on its own, the PADDS 1, 2 and 5 also kind of different issues. So between the regional things you're looking at, the underlying demand trends and then anywhere else, there's octane components or something else? Can you walk us through where you think the biggest challenges will be for supply?
Brian Partee : Yes, Roger, this is Brian. So I'll give you a little bit more color on kind of our views. And I think you're fairly rooted in it based on your questions. The way I look at the markets, they're fairly well balanced and in check. So if you look at the -- the only really interesting now is is the New York Harbor market, as you indicated, on gasoline, both whether it's in the West or out of the Gulf Coast. And the New York Harbor has seen quite a bit of strength in the quarter, primarily attributed to really low inventory levels. As mentioned earlier on the distillate side of the book that was more of a drag, it was more of a net positive on the gasoline side of the business in the New York Harbor Northeast markets. There was some turnaround work as well in the pad. The drug things down a little bit in the first quarter. And of course, some of the labor strikes over in Europe caused a little bit of havoc in New York Harbor in the markets and the balance is a bit. One of the kind of related read-throughs, if you will, on the interplay between Europe and the New York Harbor, I think, is relevant. As we've looked through the transition over the last couple of years, the New York Harbor has been long-time position as really the recipient of the push barrels, gasoline barrels coming out of Europe. And as refining balances have changed, a little bit more of a change in terms of consumer preference in Europe towards gasoline and away from distillate on the back end of diesel gate and some of the outflow of that several years ago in Europe have now created more of a pull environment into the New York Harbor. So that dynamic has changed and progressive over the last year. And yes, you're right to say that it's one of the more interesting markets in the U.S. And I'm confident that the market will work to close that gap. We're active in that market. We continue to see opportunity to push further into that market. Beyond that, octane, just for a moment, we had a huge pullout last summer in octane as $5 a barrel. We had a really strong start in the first quarter on octane values, but we do see that plateauing. More naphtha coming into the stream for blending in gasoline. And actually, as we switch from a diesel optimization throughout the system, it's more of a gasoline focus that will help the balances. And even some of the favorability of the light crudes in the Gulf Coast have a better yield on the gasoline/octane side of the book. So the forward view on octane is still favorable, but not -- we don't see quite the environment that we enjoyed last year as we progressed through the summer months.
Michael Hennigan : And Roger, it's Mike. Brian gave a lot of specifics. I'll just give you my simplistic view is gasoline inventories, like you said, are spread around in the different regions, but there's still 10 million barrels below last year, 17 million barrels below the 5-year average. The demand numbers are strong relative to last year, if you look over a longer period of time. So at least in our view, we think it's a very constructive time for gasoline at this time of the year as we're heading into which is more of the higher demand time as we head into the summer. So we're more constructive, I'll say, than maybe some people out there. And as I mentioned earlier, I know there's some concern around distillate, but we think Jet is going to continue to recover as well. And for the first time in whatever it is, 18 months, gasoline is now over distillate. That's a change in the environment going into this summer that wasn't there last summer. So we still think it's a very constructive environment for us, and we'll see how it plays out.
Operator: Our next question will come from John Royall with JPMorgan.
John Royall : So I just had a follow-up on capture rates. Just any thoughts on the moving pieces directionally in 2Q from the 98% in 1Q? It's another heavy maintenance quarter, but you have the non-recurrence presumably of inventory impact. So should we center around maybe the 100% level as a starting point, maybe a little lower due to maintenance or any other moving pieces we should think about?
Maryann Mannen : John, thanks for the question. It's Maryann. I'll give you a few high-level comments, and then I'm going to pass to Brian and Rick to give you a little more detail on the quarter. You're right, actually, as we talked about turnaround is slightly higher in the second quarter, but we will be touching less of the crude units just as an example. . And so while there is some planned maintenance, the impact of that should be less in the second quarter. Commercial performance, as you know, has been something that we have targeted for the last 18 months. We believe a lot of the work that we have done is sustainable and it certainly is a continued focus of the team as we head into the balance of the year. I'm going to pass it to Rick and Brian and let them give you a little more color on their expectations for Q2.
Rick Hessling : John, it's Rick. So I'll just double-click on really the last item Maryann touched on. I can't emphasize enough under Mike's leadership, we've unpacked and changed everything we do commercially from A to Z, from feedstocks through finished products, there isn't anything that hasn't been looked at under the covers and redesigned where it needs to be redesigned. So as we look forward, a lot of people say, are you done? And Brian and I will say, will never be done. And Mike would tell us that on a daily basis rightfully. So with that being said, we do expect to continue to get incremental value by region going forward in every region we operate in. We're continuing on this journey and it's a journey that won't end. And it's quite the change for us corporately as we improve collaboratively from refining all the way through commercial. So if you can't tell, we're quite excited about it. And without giving too much detail, we would encourage you to stay tuned and continue to look at our results. Our boss tells us our results speak for themselves, and that's the mantra we live by and feel good about in this metric as you've seen over the last year or so.
Brian Partee : Yes, John, this is Brian. Just to maybe wrap it up, I think Maryann and Rick covered it quite well. But I see it very simply on the journey that we've been on and where we're at, really working hard to leverage our scale, our unrivaled business insights in the industry. Moving further down the value chain for enhanced margin capture is also another important attribute that we have momentum behind whether it's our export program and delivered cargoes or a branded business, all the things that we're doing -- or we've done historically, we're just doing better today and with more focus and rigor down the value chain. The last thing I would say is really mindset, and Rick hit on this is really two things: continuous improvement, we are never done, and relentless innovation, always trying to reimagine how to run the business, how to do things differently. And I'll put it in the exclamation point, we've been pretty opaque around specifics, but keep watching the results. Rick is proud of the work that the team has done, and we've got more to get.
Operator: And we do have time for just one more question. Our last question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays.
Theresa Chen : Just really quickly, Brian, on your demand commentary. Clearly, you categorically beaten all the industry data in the first quarter. And as we are a month and change into the second quarter, I am curious to hear a little bit more on the diesel side. So you're seeing some early indications of incremental demand from an ag perspective, what about trucking just because we've seen some of the easing in the tonnage data?
Brian Partee : Yes, Theresa, sure. So on the distillate side, yes, we do see ag picking up. Of course, that's a year-on-year comp. So it's hard to get a complete read, but we expect it to be a strong season. We do see, again, as I mentioned earlier, some softness on the transportation side of the business, largely driven through consumption and the curtailment of consumption. So whether it be activity at the ports over the road, fairly consistently with our big customers, we've heard that theme. The positive standout though, I would mention is in the mining business, and we do have a pretty big exposure on the mining side of the industry. And we do see robust activity on the mining side of our business throughout really all regions. But it's really that consumer consumption component that we're watching very closely. As we transition here seasonally, I think it's early. As I stated earlier, to call favorably or unfavorably, which direction things are going to break, but it is something that we're keeping a close eye on.
Kristina Kazarian: All right. With that, thank you so much, everyone, for joining our call today. If you have additional questions or like clarifications on topics discussed this morning, please feel free to reach out to any members of the Investor Relations team, and we're here to help today. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-01-31 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MPC Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. My name is Sheila, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.
Kristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ, and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. References to MPC’s capital spending during the prepared remarks today reflects standalone MPC Capital excluding MPLX. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike.
Mike Hennigan: Thanks Kristina. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call. First off, I want to recognize a new director on the MPC board. Toni Townes-Whitley will be joining our board in March, bringing tremendous experience with her most recent executive position at Microsoft, as well as her board experience on the NASDAQ and PNC boards. Also like to recognize Christine Breves, who was appointed as a new independent director of MPLX in November, and recently served as CFO for US Steel. As we look back at 2022, we've delivered on our strategic commitments. Full year cash provided by operating activities was just over $16 billion on a consolidated basis, and over $13 billion, excluding MPLX, reflecting our improving operating and commercial execution. Our commitment to safe and reliable operations resulted in refining utilization of 96%. And our team's dynamic responses to volatile product markets delivered strong commercial performance, resulting in a 98% full year capture. Our focus on fostering a low-cost culture enable us to sustain our previously achieved $1.5 billion of structural cost reduction throughout the year. We formed a strategic partnership with Neste, which will enhance the economics of our Martinez Renewables fuels project and create a platform for additional collaboration within renewables. In Midstream, our business grew 7% year-over-year, MPLX raise its distribution by 10%. And based on this level, we expect MPC will receive $2 billion of annual distributions. MPLX remains a source of durable earnings in the MPC portfolio. And as MPLX grows its free cash flow, we believe we will continue to have the capacity to increase its capital return to unit holders. In 2022, we return nearly $12 billion through share repurchases, bringing the total repurchases to almost $17 billion since May of 2021. In addition, we increased MPC’s dividend 30% to $0.75 per quarter. Executing on our operating, commercial and financial objectives, combined with a strong macroenvironment led to total shareholder returns of 87% for MPC in 2022. Before Maryann goes through the results for the quarter, we wanted to share our outlook on the macroenvironment and the financial priorities for 2023. Our outlook remains bullish for ‘23 supported by the nearly 4 million barrels per day of refining capacity that has come offline globally in the last couple of years. Demand for transportation fuels we manufacture remains robust. We've seen recovery in demand across all our products since coming out of the pandemic. And we anticipate further recovery in 2023, particularly as we expect consumers to adjust consumption patterns to lower retail fuel prices. Uncertainties remain around the pace and impact of China's recovery, the magnitude of a potential US or global recession and the impact of Russian product sanctions. But despite these unknowns, we believe that the current supply constraints and growing demand will support strong refining margins in ‘23. Our financial priorities remain unchanged. These includes first sustaining capital. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operating our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees, and support the communities in which we operate. Second, our dividend, we are committed to the dividend which we increased 30% at the end of last year, and intend to evaluate at least annually. And as we repurchase shares, the reduction in the share count increases the ability to support future dividend growth. Third, growth capital. We believe this is a return on and return of capital business. We've been through a progressive change over the last few years and remain focused on ensuring the competitiveness of our assets as we progress through the energy evolution. We will invest capital where we believe there are attractive returns. In traditional refining, we're focused on investments that enhance the competitiveness of our assets. In the low carbon area, investment at this time is primarily associated with the completion of the Martinez Renewables project, as well as a project at our LA refinery that will improve energy efficiency and lower facility emissions. In addition, we're focused on growth opportunities in emerging technologies, as well as opportunities enabled by digital transformation. Beyond these three objectives, we're also returning s excess capital through share repurchases to meaningfully lower our share count. In the period from early November through the end of January, we've completed nearly $2.4 billion of share repurchases. And today, we announced an incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization, reinforcing our commitment to strong capital returns. Our goal is to be the investment of choice in the refining space, generating the most through cycle cash flow, creating value through strategic deployment of capital and delivering superior returns to our shareholders. We also challenged ourselves to lead in sustainable energy by setting meaningful targets to reduce GHG emissions, methane emissions and freshwater intensity targets which we believe we can demonstrate a tangible path to accomplish. As we innovate for the future, Phase 1 of our Martinez Renewables fuel facilities progressing startup activities, marking a significant milestone in our sustainable energy goals. The facility is on track to reach full Phase 1 production capacity of 260 million gallons per year of renewable fuels by the end of the first quarter 2023. Pretreatment capabilities are expected to come online in the second half of ‘23, which will enable the facility to ramp up to its full expected capacity of 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023. At Dickinson, we've optimized operations to be able to bringing in more advantage feedstocks, lowering the carbon intensity of the fuels we produce. We've enhanced our position in the renewables value chain through our pretreatment facilities in Beatrice and Cincinnati. We'll continue to look for opportunities leveraging the strategic partnerships we're cultivating with Neste and ADM. As evidence of our progress on our sustainability goals, this year, MTC was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America for the fourth consecutive year. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann.
Maryann Mannen: Thanks, Mike. Moving the fourth quarter results. Slide 6 provides the summary of our financial results, this morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.65. This excludes a $176 million LIFO inventory benefit, as well as $60 million gain related to the Speedway transactions. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.8 billion for the quarter, and cash flow from operations, excluding unfavorable working capital changes, was $4.4 billion. During the quarter, we returned $351 million to shareholders through dividend payments, and repurchased over $1.8 billion of our shares. Slide 7 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the third quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $1 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by refining and marketing, as the blended crack spread was down over $5 per barrel, reflecting a 20% quarterly decline. Corporate expenses were higher in the fourth quarter driven by a retroactive operating tax assessments for prior periods. We intend to pursue recovery of these multiyear tax assessments. In addition, corporate includes special compensation expenses, which also affected our refining and marketing and midstream segments. We do not anticipate that these costs will structurally impact future corporate cost. The tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22%, resulting in a tax provision of nearly $1 billion and the full year tax rate was 22%. Moving to our segment results, slide 8 provides an overview of our Refining and Marketing segments. Like many in the industry, several of our refineries were impacted by winter storm Elliott at the end of December, primarily in our Gulf Coast in Mid-Con regions. Most of our assets were back online after a short period, and we have not seen structural issues. The crude throughput impact was approximately 4 million barrels, which reduced our crude capacity utilization for the fourth quarter by roughly 2%. Looking to January, we anticipate impacts to throughput of 3.5 million barrels which is reflected in our guidance for the first quarter of 2023. Even with a disruption at the end of the quarter, our refining assets ran at 94% utilization, processing 2.7 million barrels of crude per day at our 13 refineries. Sequentially we saw per barrel margins decline most notably in the West Coast region, while US Gulf Coast margins were relatively flat, supported by export demand. Capture was 109% reflecting a strong result from our commercial team. Operating expenses were lower in the fourth quarter primarily due to lower energy cost partially offset by a special compensation expense of approximately $0.15 per barrel, paid in recognition for our employees contributions. Due to lower throughputs in the quarter refining operating costs per barrel were roughly flat in the fourth quarter at $5.62 per barrel as compared to the third quarter. Our full year refining operating costs per barrel is $5.41 when we compare to 2021 refining operating costs per barrel of $5.02, this increase can be entirely attributed to higher energy costs. We believe the actions we have taken to reduce our structural operating costs are sustainable. Slide 9 provides an overview of our refining and marketing capture this quarter, which was 109%. Our commercial teams executed effectively in a volatile market, light product margin tailwinds improved secondary product prices and favorable inventory impacts all benefited capture. We do not expect all of these tailwinds to be repeatable. And in particular, we would expect the inventory impacts to reverse in the first quarter. As our strategic pillar indicates we have been committed to improving our commercial performance and we believe that the capabilities we have built over the last 18 months will provide a sustainable advantage. Historically, we communicated a captured target of 95%. But over the last few years, the baseline has moved through our commercial efforts closer to 100%. We believe we have built capabilities that will provide incremental value beyond what we have realized to date, and will produce results that can be seen in our financials. Slide 10 show the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the third quarter of 2022. Our Midstream segment delivered resilient fourth quarter results. We did see lower EBITDA, primarily due to impacts associated with lower NGL prices. This quarter MPLX distributions contributed $502 million in cash flow to MPC. Slide 11 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital was $4.4 billion in the quarter. Working Capital was a $72 million headwind for the quarter, driven mostly by declining crude prices offset by benefits from inventory impacts. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $1.3 billion this quarter. We saw consistent spending in refining in the fourth quarter as work progress on the Martinez Renewables fuel facility conversion and the STAR project at Galveston Bay. While not reflected in the 2022 capital spend, due to the timing of the JV close, the 50% reimbursement from Neste for Martinez capital spend, was received and reflected in overall cash flows in the third quarter. MPC returned nearly $2.2 billion via share repurchase and dividends during the quarter. We began using the incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization in November. For the full year, we returned $13.2 billion out of $17.7 billion of our 2022 cash from operations, excluding working capital impacts, representing a 75% payout. This was partially enabled by our commitment to complete our $15 billion capital return program. The outstanding purchase authorization of $7.6 billion, which includes the incremental $5 billion approval demonstrates our commitment to returning capital. At the end of the fourth quarter, MPC had approximately $11.8 billion in cash and short-term investments. Slide 12 provides their capital investment plan for 2023, which reflects our continuing focus on strict capital discipline. MPC’s investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals approximately $1.3 billion. The plan includes $1.25 billion for the refining and marketing segment, of which approximately $350 million or roughly 30% is related to maintenance and regulatory compliance. Our growth capital plan is approximately $900 million split between low carbon and traditional projects. Within low carbon $150 million is allocated for completion of the Martinez conversion. We are also executing a project at our Los Angeles refinery, which will improve energy efficiency and lower facility emissions. This is a multiyear project. In 2023, we expect associated capital spending to be $150 million. And we have allocated $50 million to smaller projects focused on emerging opportunities. Within traditional refining, $150 million is associated with the completion of the STAR project. $200 million is focused on smaller projects targeted at enhancing the yields of our refineries, improving energy efficiency, and lowering our cost. In marketing, we plan to spend $150 million for projects that focus on enhancing and expanding the platform for our Marathon and ARCO brands. This morning MPLX also announced their 2023 capital investment plan of $950 million. Their plan includes approximately $800 million of growth capital and $150 million of maintenance capital. The capital spending plan focuses on adding new gas processing plants and smaller investments targeted at expansion and debottlenecking. of existing assets to meet customer demand. Turning to guidance, slide 13, we provide our first quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of roughly 2.5 million barrels per day, representing 88% utilization. Utilization is forecasted to be lower than fourth quarter levels due to turn around impacts in our US Gulf Coast region, plan turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $350 million in the first quarter, with a significant level of activity in the Gulf Coast region. The remaining scope of the STAR project, specifically 40,000 barrels per day of crude and 17,000 barrels per day of resid processing capacity is expected to be tied in during the turnaround at Galveston Bay in the first quarter, and should begin to ramp starting in the second quarter of 2023. We expect the level of 2023 turnaround spending to be similar to the level of spend in 2022. However, unlike 2022, we expect turnaround activity to be front half weighted this year, with significant planned work in the first and second quarters. Therefore, we will have executed four consecutive quarters of heavy turnaround work. Operating costs per barrel in the first quarter are expected to be flat at $5.60 per barrel for the quarter. In conjunction with our turnarounds, we anticipate higher project related expenses as we utilize our planned downtime to complete other work plans. We are seeing the benefits from lower energy costs in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Con regions. But given the majority of our turnaround activity is heavily weighted to the Gulf Coast. Our expectations of flat operating costs quarter-to- quarter is driven by our West Coast exposure, where we have not seen a decline in energy costs recently. As we look into 2023, we anticipate our operating costs per barrel would decline and trend towards a more normalized level as we complete this turnaround and project activity. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $175 million representing the sustained reductions that we have made in this area. With that, let me pass it back to Mike.
Mike Hennigan: Thanks Maryann. In summary, we believe solid execution of our three strategic pillars remains foundational. Similar to what we've achieved with cost reductions and portfolio. We believe the improvements we've made to our commercial and operational execution have driven structural sustainable benefits, which will enable us to capture opportunities, irrespective of the market environment. Our goal is to position MPC as the refiner investment of choice, generating the most cash through cycle and delivering superior returns to our shareholders with our steadfast commitment to returning capital. Let me turn the call back to Kristina.
Kristina Kazarian: Thanks Mike. [Operator Instructions] And with that, Sheila, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta: Yes, good morning team and congrats on strong results here. The first question I had was around the magnitude of capital returns. How should we think about the percentage of cash flow or free cash flow you target to get back to shareholders in a given year through buybacks and dividends? And then you talk about a $1 billion being the target level of cash. We've heard some of your peers talk about that number being higher, why is a $1 billion the right number and how long does it take to get there? Given how strong the environment is?
Maryann Mannen: Hey, it's Maryann. Thanks for the question. Let me try to break that into a couple of parts there and then see if I can -- if I've done your question justice. So in first part really the cadence if you will of the share buyback and our return of capital, as you can see from the quarter, Neil, we did $1.8 billion in share repurchase and then we continue to buy back in the month of January. Just wanted to remind you we did complete our $15 billion share repurchase in early October and I indicated on the quarterly call that we would begin using that incremental $5 billion authorization in November. So essentially for the better part of October, our cadence, we worked in the market buying back in October, just to be clear. And then we did seek and have announced an incremental $5 billion authorization. So that leaves us with $7.6 billion of share buyback authorization, hopefully indicating our continued commitment to buyback. And we hope you see that. The second part of your question, just really think around our commitment there. I think that's what you were saying. So when do we get to that $1 billion? How long does it take us and why? We feel a $1 billion is an appropriate level of cash. First, because during the pandemic, we probably stress tested our liquidity and our cash position in one of the most challenging markets. Second, I'd say keep in mind that we receive a $2 billion distribution from MPLX, probably unique when you look at us compared to our peers. So, in reality, that's about $3 billion. And then you combine that with our liquidity, we feel pretty comfortable within a range of outcomes that $1 billion is appropriate. I hope that addresses your questions, Neil.
Mike Hennigan: Neil, it’s Mike. Let me just add to what Maryann just said. So we had been at about $1.6 billion from MPLS, moved up to $1.8 billion, we're now at $2 billion pace, we expect that to continue to grow. If people listen to the MPLX call, we're in a real good position there. But that distribution, let's say at the $2 billion pace, that essentially covers the dividend, and half of the refining capital commitment for refining. So that's part of the reason that we are comfortable with $1 billion on the balance sheet. Now, as you pointed out, we still finished the year with close to $12 billion on the balance sheet. So we still have a lot of financial capability to get to a new normal at some point, but hopefully that helps explain why the $1 billion is the right number. And it has to do with our affiliation with MPLX.
Neil Mehta: Yes, good problems, Mike. And then the follow up is around the STAR project, remind us economics, it seems like it's coming on at a good time. But how should we think about what this project could mean for incremental cash flow? And in both a midcycle environment, but also, its current spot economics?
Mike Hennigan: Yes, Neil, thanks for that question. It's one we've been getting from a lot of people. So it's relatively easy to model. So up until now, the parts of STAR that are in place are in our results. What's not in our results, is 40,000 barrels a day of crude capacity. And the easiest way to model is take that number times the differential between heavy crude, and ULSD. So if you look at that differential, and you multiply it by 40,000 barrels a day, that's the additional EBITDA that we'll get once STAR is online. But STAR is a pretty unique project for us. So I'm going to ask Tim to make a couple of comments on it. So you have the financial side of it, but let me give you a little bit of the background behind it with Tim some details, please.
Tim Aydt : Okay. Thanks Mike. So Neil, is good question that you have there. So let me give you a little backdrop, keep in mind that we've done this project in phases, a fair amount of the STAR scope has already been completed and put in service, so it's already earning a return, the remaining work that we have is really going to be completed with this planned turnaround that ends late in the first quarter, and then we'll be starting up the units in April. So we do expect STAR’s EBITDA contribution to continue to ramp after startup in April and through the second quarter. The remaining scope is really going to be one like Mike just indicated, is going to increase crude capacity by 40,000 a day, and also the resid upgrading capacity by 17,000 a day. So maybe a little background on that decision rather than expanded the Galveston Bay cokers, we elected to upgrade the resilient hydrocracker unit because it offers better conversion and increased liquid volume yield. So it was a better choice than the coker. The fractionation modifications that we made are also going to increase the diesel recovery, which is profitable. And then the refinery will also be able to process a significantly more of the discounted heavy Canadian crude. So those are some of the reasons that drove us to that. So we feel really good about the economic drivers of the project. And with the current heavy crude discounts and the strong diesel margins, the near-term economics are better than when we sanction the project. So hopefully that's helpful.
Operator: Our next question will come from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.
Doug Leggate: Someone didn't pay the phone bill, guys. I'm so sorry about that. So how is everybody doing? Thanks. I apologize for that. So I, well I was – half of my questions got asked, but let me give it a go. I guess Mike, first of all, when I look at the earnings part of the business, and I look at where your share price is trading. And obviously you gave us a dividend back in November. How are you thinking about you reloaded the buyback program? How are you thinking about the balance between dividends and share buybacks? And you know where I'm going with this? Because obviously, your dividend is fully covered by your distributions from MPLX. So in this kind of environment, should we be buying back a lot of stock at this level? Or should we be thinking that the dividend is a bit more of a bias in 2023?
Maryann Mannen: Hey, Doug, it’s Maryann. I'll pass it back to Mike here in a second. But as we talked about the dividend, we committed to looking at that dividend annually. We wanted to be sure that it was secure. We wanted to be competitive with the potential to grow. And we will continue to look at that. As we've shared in the past, and obviously, as you stated, we have increased the outstanding authorization to $7.6 billion of share repurchase, we continue to think that share repurchase over dividend is an appropriate return of capital. You'll see us continuing to use that authorization as we did here in the last quarter. So, yes, we'll evaluate that dividend but we continue to see share repurchase as a bit more preferential over the dividend. I'll pass it to Mike.
Mike Hennigan: Yes, Doug, I'll just add to what Maryann said, obviously, we want to have a competitive dividend and a growing dividend over time. So that is foundational to us. It is a little bit tax inefficient relative to share buybacks. That's why Maryann just said that we leaned a little more that way. And the sheer magnitude of the financial capacity we have right now with finishing the year with about $12 billion of cash on the balance sheet and continuing to have a strong refining environment, just the sheer magnitude is much more towards that side of the return of capital. So we're going to look at it, we've committed that we'll look at it each year, and we want to be committed to it. At the end of the day, obviously, a lot of our attention just because of the magnitude of the number is directed towards the repurchase program.
Doug Leggate: Okay, I understand, I guess no one is going to complain about the yield, given that your share price is a big part of that. So but I appreciate the answer. My follow up is an operational question, Mike, I think it's pretty well known that you guys had a fair amount of maintenance in the quarter. But the capture rate was still quite strong, at least on our numbers. And I am looking at the product sales relative to the refinery throughput and wondering if that was part of what was going on there. So I'm wondering if you could help us understand the strength of the operating performance, and maybe give us a steer as to how you see your full year ‘23 downtime average because we're hearing from a lot of your peers that ‘23 is going to be a big year for the whole industry. And I'll leave it there. Thanks.
Mike Hennigan: Doug. It's a good question. So I'm going to pass it to Maryann in a second. But when we started this out a couple of years ago, we said there's three areas that we're going to concentrate heavily on, one of them was improving our commercial performance. So let Maryann give a little more color on that.
Maryann Mannen: Sure. Thanks, Doug. As Mike indicated, our strategic pillars remained foundational, and our commercial performance is clearly one that we remain committed to, you may remember in the last set of guidance, we said that we thought our capture could actually be impacted, given what was a higher turnaround, frankly, they are highest one in 2022. But the commercial team did take quite a bit of initiative in the quarter. I'll give you some highlights and then pass it to Brian and Rick, but one of the things that we saw at 109% capture in this quarter, we had strong light product margins, we had favorable inventory impacts. And then also favorable pricing of secondaries. We we don't think necessarily all of these tailwinds would repeat, and certainly depending on where we sell pricing, some of them could actually be a headwind, particularly when we look at our secondary products. And historically, we've talked about a 95% capture rate over the last few years, given the work that the commercial team has been doing. We're moving more toward 100%. So we're going to continue to challenge ourselves to deliver that. And with that, I'll maybe ask Brian and Rick to give you some incremental color on the specifics there.
Rick Hessling: Hey, Doug. It's just a few add-ons to Maryann's comments. So the 98% in 2022, is it sustainable? What I would say to that is, is there will be a lot of volatility, and it'll ebb-and-flow. But this is not a one-time event, we have meaningfully changed the way we go to market from a commercial perspective throughout our entire company. And the focus that we've had since Mike has taken the helm and put in the new leadership team has been night and day and will continue to be. So when you look at 2023 and beyond, I would say you should expect continued momentum, expect volatility, but expect results that will continue to outpace many of our peers.
Doug Leggate: Honestly, guys, I think that has been overlooked. Sorry, please go ahead.
Brian Partee: Yes, Doug, this is Brian, I was just going to bolt-on, real quickly to Rick's comments that we really have the team relentlessly pursuing value capture. We've got the team consolidated into really one functional team across the entire value chain, which historically was divided up into multiple silos. And that's been a key differentiation point for us. We're also very adamant about serving our customers. So my team has an example on the clean product side of things. So as we think about turnaround activity and impact to capture, we've got to operate in an environment where whether it's an unplanned outage or planned outage, we've got to serve our customers. So there's a lot of things that we can do from a turnaround planning perspective to build and advance the turnaround to build different feedstocks, depending on the units that are down. And ultimately, we've got the logistics firepower to purchase to cover as well. So I think that's what you're seeing in the numbers as you called out the churn activity relative to sales. We've got the right capabilities to purchase the cover, if we've got refining down either planned or unplanned.
Doug Leggate: Guys, I think it is going to surprise a lot of people. I really appreciate the full answer. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.
Roger Read: Yes, good morning, everybody. Yes, another, certainly, I'll give you congrats on the capture there. Well done everything. Maybe to change pace though a little bit. I'd like to ask about the process in Martinez, and how we should think about the upcoming timeline and any particular milestones we should be watching for, and maybe how you think about it contributing at a cash flow basis, whether that's happens meaningfully in ‘23 or we should wait till ‘24.
Tim Aydt : Hello, Roger, this is Tim, I'll take that one. I guess first on the schedule, we spent really the most the part of January, conducting startup and commissioning activities. And we put fresh feed and actually yesterday in the HDO unit. And we expect finished product the storage here next week. So we are on track to reach full phase production capacity, which is 260 million gallons per year of renewable fuels by the end of this first quarter here. You may know that we're also what we refer to as Phase 2 is constructing some pretreatment capabilities. And those are scheduled to come online in the second half of 2023. And then the facility is expected to be capable of producing the full capacity, which is 730 million gallons per year, by the end of 2023. So we're on track and feeling good.
Mike Hennigan: Roger, it’s Mike. The only thing that I would add is we feel really good about the project. And the team's execution has been good. But in light of where the refining macro is today it's not the contributor that it would be saying it when we get back to midcycle at some point, it's going to be a meaningful contributor, but obviously, it's dwarfed by what's happening in refining today.
Roger Read: Yes, refining is certainly strong, but that kind of gives me my other follow up question is we've obviously seen some good things in terms of pickup in jet demand, gasoline has continued to look a little soft, I just wonder if he could give us an overview. I guess basically, across your system, how you see things.
Brian Partee: Roger, this is Brian. So I'll start in just a little bit of reflection on 2022. Because I think we've as an industry really domestically here in the US exited at a point of inflection as relates to COVID recovery. So globally, really strong year in 2022, when you look at a year-on-year 2.3 million barrels a day of overall oil demand increase, as Mike mentioned, in his prepared remarks, we expect to see continued increases into 2023 and beyond. Domestically from what we're seeing, and this is a bit of a triangulation, I know, there's a lot of dialogue around individual marketing books, EIA, data, mobility data. So you have to be a little bit of a statistician and try to piece it all together to formulate an informed view around actual demand. But from an overall perspective, backing through the back end of COVID, diesel has been resilient throughout. It remains resilient domestically here in the US, gasoline if you remember when we went into COVID, early on a lot of conversations around structural impacts. And we do feel like we've seen some structural implications as a result of COVID. But most of that's been on the gasoline front. And we're kind of at a point now where our call of post COVID demand is off about 3% on the gasoline front from 2019 levels. That's probably pretty sticky. The headwind, there is obviously the work from home a little bit of tailwind. We've seen some decreased use in public transportation offsetting that, but 3% is been about the number that we've seen consistently as we look across our books. And then as it relates to jet, steady rate double recovery as what we've seen the last couple of years, we expect to see full recovery domestically here, as we progress through 2023. So back half of 2023 seeing full recovery. As relates to our book, maybe I'll just kind of wrap it up there. What we found in Q4, gasoline year-on-year, 2%. The bright spot of interest was the West Coast. So we actually saw a 5% increase year-on-year in the fourth quarter in the West Coast. Diesel was up 4% and jet was up 3% on year-to-year basis.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.
Paul Cheng: Hi, guys. Good morning. Few questions, if I could. The first one is really simple. Fourth quarter, I think Maryann mentioned that as some favorable inventory benefits. I assume, Maryann, you were referring outside the LIFO impact which you take it as a special item or that's what you refer. If this is not then can you give us some idea, then how big is that number in the fourth quarter? And secondly, I think you guys talking about a continuing investment, that this year $150 million in the LA refinery system? If I didn't get it wrong. Can you maybe give us some idea that what all investment we're talking about? And what all of benefits we could expect from there, is there any changing in terms of the crews lay or energy usage or that product yield? Anything that you could share on that? Thank you.
Maryann Mannen: Hey, Paul, it's Maryann. So you're absolutely correct. The inventory benefits that I was discussing, when talking about the capture rate we achieved in the quarter are outside the LIFO benefits. As you've seen, we've excluded the LIFO benefit from our adjusted results. So I'm talking about commercial performances, obviously, winter storm has impacts on us. And the ability for our teams to address the inventory issues is really what I was referring to when we talk about capturing the quarter not LIFO.
Paul Cheng: Yes, Maryann, can you quantify how roughly -- how big is that benefit in the fourth quarter?
Maryann Mannen: Yes, Paul, we've not provided that level of detail on each of those individual contributors, inventory, a piece of that, again, I mentioned strong light product margins in the quarter. We saw the benefit of pricing happen on the secondaries. So there were several contributors to the upsides performance, but we typically don't provide that granular detail on this significance of each one of those.
Tim Aydt : Okay. This is Tim, I'll take your second question. Relative to the LAR project that we were referring to in the opening remarks, that's really a project that addresses the next phase of an upcoming regulation that is going to be mandating further NOx reductions. And that's regulation is going to apply to all of the refineries in the LA basin, not just ours, of course. And so there's going to be some significant investment required by the industry in order to comply with this. And we believe we have a very unique opportunity at our Los Angeles refining complex to really modernize our utility systems at both Carson and Wilmington facilities in order to meet this Phase 1 and Phase 2 of these reduction requirements. So that's what's driving it. And I think the other thing that's worth noting is this novel project really goes beyond NOx reductions for us. And it will also reduce our SO2, our particulate matter, or VOCs, and some greenhouse gases. So besides lowering our facility emissions, it's also going to improve our reliability. And it's going to reduce our energy usage, which will significantly lower our operating cost. These cost reductions will come in the form of energy efficiency and lower maintenance spend. And the thing we like about it is that these favorable economics are independent of the light product margin fluctuations that can occur. So this was kind of all around the backdrop of the LA refinery is certainly a core asset for us on the West Coast. And it's part of the value chain. And it's already one of the most competitive refineries in the state. So this project is going to further cement its competitive position in California, which is consistent with our strategic initiative of being the most cost-effective refiner in every market we serve. So we expect the project to be completed in 2025. And in time to meet the initial compliance dates for the new regulation. So hopefully, that's helpful.
Paul Cheng: Yes, what's the total investment? That $150 million for this year, should we assume $150 million again in 2025. And in terms of the lower energy costs, better efficiency on there? Is there any number you could share to try to quantify what is that benefits?
Tim Aydt : Unfortunately, we generally don't get into those specific numbers on individual projects and returns but it's significant in the sense that it's lowering our emissions and providing a payback.
Paul Cheng: $1 billion CapEx, is it $150 million a year?
Mike Hennigan: Hey, Paul, it's Mike, we haven't disclosed the multiyear, we will give more color on that as time goes on. What Tim was trying to say is, it is a multiyear project, and we're going to start off with it. It'll be $150 million this year, and we'll give more color as time goes by.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Royall with JPMorgan.
John Royall: Hye, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So just to stick with project growth, and looking at your CapEx budget, and your growth program was about $900 million. That number, I assume will be going down close to Martinez and STAR. So looking into the future, where do you think growth capital goes from here? I think we could structurally lower growth CapEx in 2024 plus, or is there maybe another phase of project we'll start hearing about going forward? And I know you've spoken about the LA project, but just wondering beyond that.
Mike Hennigan: John, it's Mike, I’ll start off. We've broken it into two buckets, traditional refining and low carbon. And it's our expectation that low carbon bucket will continue to grow over time and at the same time, though, we do have a bunch of projects Tim just mentioned one that will really improve the competitiveness of LA, we have a bunch of those still, that we think we can implement on the traditional refining side as well. So I think you're going to see a nice blend on both sides of the business there over time. I don't think you should expect that number to be going meaningfully down. Yes, I know, people have talked a lot about STAR but we have enough projects that we think are attractive returns, we just want to implement them over time and be disciplined on the way that we allocate capital, but I think you're going to see both buckets and not have an expectation they're going down, because we still think there's a decent amount of return on capital opportunities for us in light of what's been a major return of capital recently from us.
John Royall: Great. That's really helpful. Thanks. And then maybe just talk about how you're thinking about the Russia product sanctions that are going to be hitting here on the certain? And how that maybe -- how that may trickle through the market? And how long do you think it will take for supply chains to adjust? And then relatedly, if you could just remind us the breakdown of Marathon’s export destinations? How much goes to Latin America? How much goes to Europe? And do you expect to increase your exports to Europe after the fifth?
Brian Partee: Yes, John, this is Brian, I'll take that. So just really quick on your question on timeline, we do not expect it to really unfold until the second quarter. So leading into the sanctions, as you'd expect, we saw a pretty meaningful de-inventorying coming out of Russia getting out of the sanctions, coupled with a re-inventorying in large parts of Northwest Europe. So as a result, we're entering the sanction period of time at really historically high levels of inventory, particularly in Europe. So we view it as 2Q and beyond timeline perspective, but directionally, we see it as bullish for cracks. We see 800 million to 1 million barrels a day of I'll call them structural historical imports into Northwest Europe coming out of Russia, those are going to have to be displaced. And we do expect a high degree of friction on those barrels, for variety of reasons. Product spec mix, is going to be difficult to place them in other markets. So as you'd expect, you have various regional specifications that need to be met local fuel standards that's going to propose some headwinds. The global tanker fleet is really pretty active and overburdened right now with differing trade flows on the crude front. And this is going to create another degree of inefficiency on a tanker, global tanker fleet capacity that we think will provide a degree of friction. And the last thing I'd mentioned, unlike crude on the product side, these are generally going to either countries or end consumers that really rely on receipt of the product. So supply assurance is a new variable that's really important here as well, that is we're hearing from our customers every day, that's a really important thing for them. I think, given the dynamic nature of the situation in Russia, that supply assurance component is really a big unknown, but we feel well, very well positions to take advantage of that, given our position in the Atlantic basin, as you probably know, we opened an office over in London late last year, and are very active in that market. The last point of your question in terms of distribution, without giving too much granular detail, a large portion of them historically have moved into Latin America. We've historically exported 250,000 to 350,000 barrels a day, depending around turnaround and unplanned downtime activity within our system, we do see an incremental pull into Europe, we've seen that we've got some actually really good fit for our Garyville distillate stream because we don't make jet out of our Garyville facility. It fits well into Northwest Europe, especially this time of the year. And we've seen exports into Northwest Europe late last year and the 120,000 barrels a day for the US into Europe. And we've done a meaningful part of that. And we expect to be meaningful part of that going forward.
Rick Hessling: Hey, John, this is Rick, just add on to Brian's comments. So a couple of points to further drive home how we feel about this market going forward. If you look at winter storm, Elliott in December, when it hit the immediate impact, it had on cracks. And it is again taken our life product inventories, especially here in the US down to levels that are five-year type low numbers, when you compound diesel inventories with VGO and the potential impact that the EU ban on Russian exports will have this could just further exasperate cracks to the positive. So more to watch on this. See how it plays out. I think Mike said earlier, it's neutral to positive. We're viewing it as a positive, especially if the cutbacks and sanctions take hold like most people think they will.
Operator: Our next question will come from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.
Sam Margolin : Good morning, everyone. Thank you. I'm actually, I'm tempted to ask about commercial and turnaround integration again, because I do think that's probably the most important thing from this call. But I think people got the picture there. Instead of asking about low carbon growth, and specifically SAF. And I'm asking because investors ask about it a lot, because airlines talk about it frequently. And both of your partners in the renewable fuels category are also sort of publicly, very pro SAF. And so it'd be great to get your thoughts on that category. And see if you think there's any opportunity there. Thank you.
David Heppner: Thanks, Sam. Hey, this was Dave, let me step back a little bit and touch on first that one of our strategic growth pillars for the company is around maximizing the value of our renewable liquid fuels. And so while promptly, a lot of that has been focused on renewable diesel with our Dickinson and Martinez, and the pretreat facilities around those as we look forward that's inclusive of Sustainable Aviation Fuel or SAF. So when you're thinking about growth, it is also inclusive SAF. And so second thing I want to maybe touch on is that we are a very large supplier of fossil fuel, jet fuel today. And our goal is to supply the products that our customers want, and need going forward. So as they, as you stated, there's a lot of chatter around SAF, we're there to help meet that and why you're hearing a lot of the chatter through the airline industries is because SAF is the most viable near term, decarbonization tools for that space. So as we look forward, we are very active in that. The challenge is the premium required, as you look at the SAF whether it be a conversion of a Dickinson or Martinez produce SAF or new investment, these are multiyear very large capital projects. Having confidence in that premium to justify that investment is where that little opportunities exist today. So we are very active just as we were in RD and the evaluation, the studies of where to participate in SAF and I think you see a lot of it within MPC, but also within our subsidiary company Virent. They take sugars into sustainable aviation fuel, you've seen announcements with them on test flights with United, most recently won with the Emirates along with our JV partner Neste. So you can see We're very active in the space of evaluating it, studying it, monitoring it and determining when is the right time to invest.
Operator: Our next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays.
Theresa Chen: Hi there. I just had a follow up question related to the Russia discussion, and specifically related to VGO and with the Russian’s VGO exports to Europe dissipating from market and lack of clarity where incremental VGO is going to come from and understand that could help definitely in cracks all else equal, but how should we think about how it impacts your capture and what your net VGO position is long or short and how it trickles through your system?
Rick Hessling: Yes, Theresa, this is Rick. So we're short VGO, we're out in the market, especially now more than ever, when it’s turnaround season and I will tell you the way we view this is this short and VGO is going to high grade up all capture specifically on Jet, diesel and light products. So we believe will be a recipient of it and that'll show through via the cracks going forward. Specifically, I will tell you as these Middle Eastern refineries come online midsummer, Theresa, they will domestically consume VGO which, in turn will further short the market, which we believe to be a nice shot in the arm, kind of mid-year end year. So more to come on that. Just something to keep your eye on.
Theresa Chen: Thank you. And I also had a follow up question related to my comments about consumers potentially adjusting consumption patterns to lower retail fuel prices. Just curious what your views on elasticity is or are at this point. How does that reconcile with Brian's comments about gasoline and potentially structurally being off about 3%?
Rick Hessling: Yes, Theresa, it’s a great question. It's one that we look at and try to draw the right corollary too but we do see a degree of flexibility there. Of course, it depends on the market, depends on the extent of the retail prices. We have seen and I commented on the West Coast in my comments earlier, in what I didn't mention, but we got under $5 a gallon on the West Coast in Q4. So that's where we saw my view is we saw nice demand recovery as relates to retail prices. But our forward view is definitely instructed by a moderated view on retail pricing, which we do think will impact demand somewhere in the neighborhood of 2% to 3% depending on the market, but somewhere in the neighborhood of 2% - 3%.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Gabelman with Cowen.
Jason Gabelman: Yes, good morning. How's it going? I don't think you guys discussed the outlook maybe I missed it, the outlook for light heavy crude quality dips. Clearly, they've been very supportive in the past couple quarters to earnings. And I think many in the market, expect those to come in as refiners consume. The SPR releases, new capacity comes online. OPAC exports have fallen off a bit. Can you just discuss how you expect those differentials to trend throughout the year? Thanks.
Rick Hessling: Yes. Hi, Jason. It's Rick. Very good question. So it's kind of a tail of two ends. I'll start with the front end here. Because as you look with what happened with the Keystone Pipeline outage, that back then barrels into Canada, Canadian inventories are high. We've had a lot of turnarounds in the US Gulf Coast. We've had winter storm Elliot back in barrels. So when you kind of add all of these together, along with a few of -- a few folks in the in the Mid-Con specifically pad two having issues. We are seeing really robust spreads right now. And we continue to see that to hang on for a bit. As the year plays out, and things get back to normal. I would say you could see some fall off to the spread, but we're still quite optimistic that it's going to be a better spread than midcycle as we look at the year in total.
Jason Gabelman: Great, that's helpful and just my follow up. I appreciate the comments on the Martinez project. And operationally, it sounds like everything's going well there. I was wondering from an earnings perspective, how much you expect that project to contribute in 2023, just given the pretreatment unit won't start up until later in the year. And at the numbers we look at, it seems like margins for projects that don't have pretreatments are much more challenged than projects that do. So if you just talk about the earnings in 2023, and the potential step up from the project once that operation units online.
Brian Partee: Yes, this is Brian, Jason, I just maybe a reminder that we do have pretreatment capacity, not on site but off site. So both at Beatrice and Cincinnati facility, we've got substantial pretreatment capability there. So just kind of a reminder there, and I'll refer it regarding the overall EBITDA or our economic outlook to Mike and Maryann.
Mike Hennigan: Yes, Jason, we don't give specific individual facility earnings profiles. I know it's a question and people have been trying to get their arms around. But the best guidance I can give you is if you look at the macroenvironment around the California market, and where each of the subsidies are trading, the key to remember because people ask us about LCFS. But there are other components to subsidy out there that all kind of worked together. And the three of them together have been relatively consistent, even though a lot of them are moving around a little bit. So that should help you a little bit as you model it. And then obviously, look at where feedstocks are trading and diesel's trading.
Maryann Mannen: The other incremental comment that I would add to Mike's also is remember when we completed the JV with Neste, one of the things that we were looking for was incremental improvement around our feedstock slate, and we got that with a partner in Neste. So even though we are sharing 50% of the project, we actually improve the economics of the project by the feedstock that Neste is obligated to bring through their partnership with us. So just another data point as you're contemplating how to think about that.
Operator: Our next question, and our last question will come from Matthew Blair with TPH.
Matthew Blair: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Could I get your thoughts on the wide octane spreads that we've been seeing? What -- do you think that'll persist for the rest of 2023? And are you fully compliant on Tier 3? Or are you short and buying credits in the market? Thanks.
Rick Hessling: Yes, Matt, I can comment on the octane, they obviously you're going to move seasonally and quite a bit. But we've seen steady strength in octane spreads, really as a result of running the systems harder. As we look at not just our system, but the global system working to meet demands, and out running our octane capacity to a certain extent as other facilities have been shut down throughout the network. So you kind of have a bullish long-term outlook as it relates to octane spreads and position well around that, based on our octane capacity in our system.
Brian Partee: And to the last part, we're not going to comment on our long or short position on the credits.
Kristina Kazarian: All right. With that, thank you, everyone for your interest in Marathon. If you have any additional questions or if you'd like clarification on the topics discussed this morning, please reach out and our IR team will be available to your call. I look forward to speaking with everyone. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-11-01 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MPC Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. My name is Casey, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.
Kristina Kazarian: Sounds great. Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ, and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike.
Michael Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to introduce Tim Aydt, who will be joining our call as a new Executive Vice President of Refining. Tim has over 37 years of experience in leadership roles across our midstream and refining organizations. Most recently, he was Executive Vice President of Pipelines, Terminals and Marine and Chief Commercial Officer, where he oversaw the business development for the MLP. Now turning to the macro environment. Roughly 4 million barrels per day of refining capacity has come offline globally in the last couple of years. Yet demand for the transportation fuels we manufacture remains robust and continues to grow. In the U.S., demand is still below 2019 pre-COVID levels, and we believe there will be a continued recovery. As supply remains constrained and demand continues to rebound, we maintain a bullish outlook towards the refining environment as we look into 2023. Our third quarter results reflect the team's operational and commercial execution as we focused on delivering products for consumers in this very tight market. In our Refining segment, we ran near full rates while maintaining our steadfast commitment to safely operating our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. The commercial team focused on optimizing our scale, footprint and feedstock slate to deliver against strong demand. And despite volatility in the global energy markets, our execution reflects progress towards our goal of improving commercial performance. We normally see seasonal demand decline at this time of the year but to date, we're not seeing those signs. Strong forward crack spreads and wide salary differentials for 2023 indicate the expectation of a strong refining environment going forward. In the fourth quarter, we're currently running our system at full utilization, except for the planned maintenance activity we have occurring given our back of the year weighted turnaround schedule. Aside from the Refining business, I want to point out that our Midstream segment earnings continue to grow. In the third quarter, our adjusted EBITDA was up nearly 9% year-over-year in midstream. We've been executing strategic capital investments, fostering a low-cost culture and optimizing the portfolio, including advancing several organic growth projects in the Permian Basin. The strength of these cash flows supports MPLX's decision to increase its quarterly distribution by 10%. Based on this level, MPC will receive $2 billion of distribution from MPLX annually. We've received questions regarding the structure of MPLX and whether MPC will acquire the outstanding public unit. So we want to restate what we said in the past. MPLX is a strategic part of MPC's portfolio, its current pace of cash distributions to MPC is $2 billion per year, and we expect that to continue growing. MPLX has continued to demonstrate resilient through-cycle earnings and growing cash flows. As MPLX pursues its growth opportunities, we expect the value of this strategic partnership will continue to be enhanced, and we do not plan to roll up MPLX. Switching to capital allocation, we believe MPC's current capital allocation priorities are optimal for our shareholders. In October, we completed our $15 billion return of capital commitment, repurchasing approximately 30% of MPC's shares outstanding. We're committed to executing our capital allocation framework to deliver peer-leading total return to shareholders. Today, we announced an increase to MPC's quarterly dividend of approximately 30%. In addition, we intend to continue repurchases, which we believe are a more efficient way to return capital and we expect to commence buybacks in November using the remaining $5 billion repurchase authorization. In early 2000, we shared our three strategic areas of focus. They have become part of MPC's DNA embedded in our unwavering commitment to increase profitability, have the best through-cycle cash flow generation and drive a long-term value creation. As we focus on strengthening the competitive position of our assets, in September, we closed on our Martinez Renewables joint venture with Neste. Construction is well underway, and we expect Phase 1 mechanical completion by year-end. We're excited about the partnership with Neste, a global leader in feedstock procurement and renewable fuels production. This joint venture enhances the value of the project by reducing MPC's capital commitment to $0.55 per gallon as well as improving the overall project feedstock slate. Neste has the obligation to bring 80% advantaged feedstock in Phase 2. Due to these improvements, we expect MPC share in the JV's EBITDA to be only 25% lower than our original stand-alone case. Additionally, this strategic partnership with Neste creates a platform for collaboration. We believe there will be opportunities to leverage the differentiated knowledge and capabilities of two industry leaders as we pursue our shared commitment to the energy evolution. We continue to challenge ourselves to lead in sustainable energy and have made progress on the sustainability goals that we have set for ourselves. Focusing specifically on the Martinez Renewables project which converts our petroleum refinery into a renewable fuels facility. We anticipate the conversion to result in a 60% reduction of the facility's Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions, 70% lower total criteria air pollutants and 1 billion gallons of water saved annually. If you haven't had a chance yet, we invite you to go to the Sustainability section of our website and learn more about the ways we are challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann.
Maryann Mannen: Thanks, Mike. Moving to third quarter results. Slide 6 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $7.81. This quarter's results were adjusted to exclude three items: a $549 million noncash pretax gain related to the contribution of our refining assets to the Martinez Renewables JV, a $509 million noncash gain related to an MPLX third-party contract reclassification and a $28 million LIFO inventory charge. Adjusted EBITDA was $6.8 billion for the quarter and cash flow from operations, excluding unfavorable working capital changes was just under $4.5 billion. During the quarter, we returned $285 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased $3.9 billion of our shares. Slide 7 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the second quarter of 2022 to the third quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially by approximately $2.3 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by refining and marketing as the blended crack spread was down approximately $10 per barrel, reflecting a 25% quarterly decline. The tax rate for the third quarter was 22%, resulting in a tax provision of $1.4 billion. The tax rate is similar to last quarter due to the Refining & Marketing representing a larger component of total earnings. Moving to our segment slide results. Slide 8 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. During the quarter, we focused on supplying transportation fuels to meet continued strong market demand. Our Refining assets ran at 98% utilization processing over 2.8 million barrels of crude per day at our 13 refineries. We saw margins decline sequentially across all three regions. Capture was 97%, reflecting a strong result from our commercial team in a volatile global market. Operating expenses were higher in the third quarter. Energy costs were approximately $0.15 per barrel higher in the third quarter, driven by higher natural gas prices. Additionally, we recorded a nonrecurring multiyear property tax assessment of $0.13 per barrel in the third quarter, which we will continue to pursue recovery. We believe the actions we have taken to bring our structural operating cost down to approximately $5 per barrel are sustainable. The cost increases we have seen year-to-date have almost entirely been driven by higher energy costs. Turning to Slide 9, which provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing margin capture this quarter. Market backwardation remained a headwind for the industry but our commercial strategy of selling ahead of product backwardation while keeping inventories optimized, supported our ability to meet demand and capture strong prompt margins. And while not as significant as the previous quarter, secondary product prices were a headwind as they lagged higher light product prices. Our ability to capture 97% of the market indicator across an incredibly volatile three months was in part due to our commercial responses. Slide 10 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the second quarter of 2022, our Midstream segment demonstrated earnings growth with adjusted EBITDA up approximately 3% sequentially and up 9% year-over-year. Overall, we continue to focus on identifying and efficiently executing high-return projects to drive further growth for our midstream business. As Mike mentioned earlier, the growth of MPLX's earnings supported its decision to increase its quarterly distribution by 10% to $0.775 per share and MPC expects to receive $2 billion in cash from MPLX on an annual basis. MPLX remains a source of durable earnings in the MPC portfolio and as MPLX grows its free cash flow we believe it will have the capacity to return capital to its unitholders. Slide 11 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter, operating cash flow excluding changes in working capital, was just under $4.5 billion in the quarter. Working capital was a $1.9 billion headwind for the quarter. This quarter, we made a payment of $2.3 billion for estimated federal income taxes declining crude prices or also a headwind to working capital. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $756 million this quarter. The increased level of capital spending was related to a ramp in activity related to the Martinez Renewables fuels facility conversion and the Galveston Bay store project. The STAR project is expected to be completed early 2023. Other cash flow benefits of $790 million is primarily driven by the distribution MPC receipt from the Martinez Renewables JV upon closing on September 21. At the end of the third quarter, MPC had approximately $11.1 billion in cash and short-term investments. Moving to Slide 12. We have completed our $15 billion share repurchase commitment, utilizing the proceeds from the Speedway divestiture at an average price of $78, ahead of our commitment of no later than the end of 2022. As you will see today, when our quarterly financials, the 10-Q was published, we were able to complete that early in the month of October. We intend to begin repurchase against our $5 billion outstanding authorization in November, now that our financials are public. On Slide 13, I'd like to walk you through our financial priorities, sustaining capital. We remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. We're committed to a secure, competitive and growing dividend. We believe the quarterly increase to $0.75 per share we announced today is secured through cycles, competitive with peers and the broader market and leaves opportunity to potentially grow our dividend in the future. We anticipate this dividend will be supplemented with repurchases and we are committed to executing our capital allocation framework to deliver peer-leading total returns to shareholders. We will evaluate growth opportunities and margin enhancing projects. Share repurchases will be used to return excess capital to shareholders, which we believe are a more efficient way to return capital and will continue to lower our share count. Underpinning these priorities, we believe a strong balance sheet is essential to being successful in a competitive commodity business. It's the foundation, allowing us to execute our strategy. On Slide 14, we highlight the strength of MPC's balance sheet. We continue to manage our balance sheet through an investment-grade credit profile. At the end of our third quarter, MPC stand-alone gross debt to capital ratio is 21% which is under our target of a 25% to 30% gross debt-to-capital ratio. MPLX has a leverage ratio of 3.5x debt to EBITDA under its target of 4x. Both businesses have strong balance sheet with leverage ratios under their respective targets. Turning to guidance on Slide 15, we provide our fourth quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of roughly 2.7 million barrels per day, representing 93% utilization. Utilization is forecast to be lower than third quarter due to planned turnaround activity having a higher impact on crude units in the fourth quarter. Planned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $430 million in the fourth quarter with a significant level of activity in the Gulf Coast region. Turnaround activity is reflected in our fourth quarter throughput guidance. We are expecting operating cost per barrel in the fourth quarter to be lower projected to be $5.30 per barrel for the quarter. This is primarily driven by expected lower natural gas and energy costs. As a reminder, natural gas has historically represented approximately 15% of operating costs. Our natural gas sensitivity is approximately $330 million of annual EBITDA for every dollar change per MMBtu. This equates to a sensitivity of approximately $0.30 per barrel of cost. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the fourth quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $170 million representing the sustained reductions that we have made in this area. In closing, we will continue to execute on our three strategic pillars, strengthening the competitive performance of our assets, fostering a low-cost culture and improving our commercial performance. We are committed to position MPC as a reliable and efficient energy provider with new investments focused on high-return opportunities supporting the company's evolution, which will position it to lead in an energy diverse future. We will stay steadfast in our plan to position MPC as the refiner investment of choice, striving to deliver superior cash returns regardless of market conditions, and while ensuring we safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. Let me turn the call back to Kristina.
Kristina Kazarian: Thanks, Maryann. [Operator Instructions]. And with that, operator, can you open up for questions today.
Operator: Yes. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Go ahead please. Your line is open.
Douglas Leggate: Thank you, guys. Sorry, trouble with the mute button. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess Mike or Maryann, whichever one wants to take this. Now that you've completed the buyback or at least the first phase of the buyback -- your distributions from MPLX were still more than covering your dividend. So can you kind of walk us through how you think about what the new pace of buybacks could look like? Because obviously, the $5 billion authorization is probably going to be true through fairly quickly. And what we should think of in terms of the balance between future dividend growth and where you want your balance sheet to be? Basically, it's a use of cash question because this is a pretty nice problem to have. And then I've got a follow-up, please.
Maryann Mannen: Thanks, Doug. So as you know, we made a commitment that we would reassess the dividend immediately completing the $15 billion, and we've done so. We wanted three objectives really around the dividend. One was for it to be secure competitive. And then obviously, with the potential to grow dividends in the future, as you said, we believe our increase to $0.75 in the quarter meets all three of those objectives. As you know, we completed that $15 billion share authorization and have a remaining $5 billion new authorization, which both Mike and I had shared on our prepared remarks that we intend to begin to use that very early in the month of November. We continue to think that our equity is undervalued. And when we look at distribution return on capital between dividend and share repurchase, we believe share repurchase remains a more efficient tool in that portfolio. So we'll look at market, we'll look at other growth opportunities, and we'll look at the macro, and we'll continue to use share repurchase absent other growth opportunities as the vehicle to continue to return capital to the shareholders and every decision that we make, obviously, focused on trying to ensure we've got peer-leading returns. I hope that helps, Doug.
Douglas Leggate: It does, Maryann. Sadly, it also prompts my follow-up if I may. And it's a little bit of a, I guess, a less easy question to answer. And you just made the point of -- that you believe your equity is undervalued. Now we obviously agree with that, but your share price is at an all-time high. So when we think about value when the market thinks about value, there have to be some assumptions that go behind how you're defining value. So my question is, what's the mid-cycle to the extent you can define it EBITDA or cash flow that you anticipate from the portfolio that goes behind that statement of we believe our equity is undervalued? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.
Maryann Mannen: Doug, I'll start off, and I'm sure Mike will want to add incremental comment as well. I think the mid-cycle is an extremely difficult way for us to put a pin in as we stand right now. Certainly, when we look at the market dynamics, as Mike shared as well, we remain pretty bullish on the outlook, not only for the fourth quarter, but certainly as we head into 2023. So a series of factors that we use and we look at to determine when we say we believe that equity is undervalued, and we'll continue to be as opportunistic as we can as we are using share repurchase in evaluating where both the fourth and the first quarter will go and, frankly, longer term. So several factors that we consider, but we certainly look right now at a fairly optimistic outlook for the next several quarters.
Michael Hennigan: And Doug, it's Mike. I'll add to Maryann's comments. So what I said in the prepared remarks is the fundamentals of the business have changed as a result of what's happened over the last couple of years -- roughly 4 million barrels of refining capacity has come out of the market. At a time early on when demand was down, but demand continues to recover. We're still not at 2019 levels of demand across all the products, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel. So we're still below, but we are slowly recovering. So you have supply constrained, you got demand recovering. And to your point, the mid-cycle that we see into the future is clearly above the previous mid-cycle because the global fundamentals have changed. And as we look out in time, there are going to be some capacity additions occurring throughout the world, but we also believe that demand is going to continue to pace such that the new mid-cycle for what we're going to see is significantly above where we've been in the past. So that's obviously why we have a bullish overtone here and why we still believe that the assets that we have are still trading under intrinsic value. Now I know you'd love us to give the exact number what we call internally. So I'm not going to do that, as you know but we stress tested. We stress tested in a low case, our view of a mid case and our view of a higher case. And as we look at all those things, we still believe fundamentally that we can purchase our shares at a price that's still adding value to our shareholders. So that's why we've been so aggressive in that area. We had committed to that return. As Maryann said in the prepared remarks, we bought back at a pretty good number, and we still see that as an ongoing opportunity. You also asked about the dividend. I mean our dividend being where it was, was mainly because of the equity price coming up. And we did feel it weren't an adjustment. People had asked us for several quarters in a row, whether we're going to do that. And we said we're going to do it after we do the $15 billion of Speedway. So hopefully, we were consistent with what we said there. We've moved it up as Maryann said, it's not a tax-efficient way to return to shareholders. But we want to have a competitive number as well. So 30% is a good bump. We'll keep an eye on that. And at the same time, we're going to continue to reduce the share count. Hopefully, that gives you a little more color.
Douglas Leggate: You make significantly higher mid-cycle as what I was looking for. Thanks very much indeed.
Operator: Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead please. Your line is open.
Neil Mehta: Good morning team. The first question is really to build on your comments around commercial. The capture rates have continued to come in very well over the last couple of quarters. And Mike, I know when you came into the role, one of the opportunities you identified was really strengthening your commercial effort. So can you just talk about what specifically has driven sort of that improvement in capture rates? And how much of that is because of those commercial initiatives?
Michael Hennigan: Yes. Thanks, Neil, for the question. I'm going to let Rick and Brian comment. But I'll -- before they do, I would say to you, we did say early on that we had three major areas that we're going to put emphasis on and we've made progress in the commercial area. We still see a lot more opportunity for us. So we're not done in that area, but we have made some progress. I'll let Rick and Brian give some comments.
Rick Hessling: Yes, Neil, it's Rick. Thank you for the question. It's one of these items where we've been looking at the pull through, and we've been seeing it the last several quarters. So it's nice that you're noticing it as well. I would start by saying earlier this year, we changed a lot. We changed processes, we change structure and culture around all things commercial that's been a game changer for us. In terms of details and how competitively, I'll be careful in what I share here, Neil. But if you look at it over were through a broad lens, we've stood up a dedicated what we call VCO team, value chain optimization team that goes from end-to-end, from feedstocks to products from purchasing or procuring to placement and we're relooking at everything we do, the why, the how, all modeling constraints, assumptions, everything was put on the table and relooked at. And so a lot of change and great positive results have come out of that, especially in the midst of the environment we're in. So every win, when you're in an environment like we're in today is exemplified with the high crack and I think you're seeing that. In addition, you're seeing a lot of the re root of global products and feedstocks happening throughout the world. And through this initiative, we've been able to take advantage of a lot of purchasing of feedstock and the placement of our feed -- clean products in a time that has been highly advantageous. So with that, I'll turn it over to Brian for more color on the clean side.
Brian Partee: Thanks, Rick. Yes, Neil, just great question. I appreciate the opportunity to kind of weigh in here. And Rick said it, but I'll double down on it. It's about one or two things. It's literally everything. We've changed. We've moved mountains and really proud of the work that the team has done. There's been a lot of progress, as Mike alluded to in his comments, there's more to get. I think foundationally, as we look going forward, one of the key components is our digital transformation that underpins a lot of the efforts we have on the commercial front. And we think leveraging our scale across our coast-to-coast platform provides us a distinct opportunity set as it relates to that digital evolution in our space. The other thing I'd say just real quick is what underpins all this? Or alignment changed everything. We fundamentally changed the organizational structure and realign people, we empowered people and we held them accountable. We have a people-centric business in the commercial space, and we're really leveraging that. And the core tenet of what we're trying to accomplish is to let our great people do great things.
Neil Mehta: Yes, that's great color. So it's showing up in the numbers. And as the follow-up is just a specific dynamic gravity stock. We've seen WCS really blow out. Historically, you guys have been one of the larger buyers of Western Canadian crude. But do you also see heavy wider in barrels like Maya and high-sulfur fuel oil. So maybe you talk about what's driving the weakness in the heavy crude and product markets and how are you optimizing your refining slate to take advantage of that?
Rick Hessling: Yes, hi Neil, it's Rick again. So great question. These markets are blowing out. We're seeing unprecedented levels again. On the heavy side, I think I looked this morning and I saw the forward curve. December was marked at minus 30, Q1, minus 27 and unbelievably stoked. 2023 Cal was 23 under, So what's driving it? Boy, it is a plethora of items. Production from the Canadian front, Neil, is pretty solid and we're entering right now blending season, as you know, the diluent blending season is slowing the pool, which is certainly helping as well. We've had some short-term shot in the arms with some maintenance in PADD 2, 3 and 5. When I say maintenance, unplanned maintenance, that's been a plug for us. And then fuel oil is really cheap. So you're seeing a lot of people substitute that for heavies in other parts of the world. So all of this is driving -- is really putting pressure on anything that hits the U.S. Gulf Coast. And lastly, I'll say, when you look at the Gulf of Mexico medium sour production, it's been healthy as well. So lately here, you're seeing Mars blow out. Certainly, you referenced the Canadians. So all of these items are stacking on top of one another and creating for a very bullish outlook here into 2023. In terms of MPC specifically, I think you are well aware, we have great access and optionality that we've built out our system over the years in PADD 2, PADD 3 and now PADD 5 and so we are going heavy. We're heavying up our slate. We're filling up our cokers as you would expect, and we'll continue to do so into Q3 as these indicators tell us to do so.
Neil Mehta: It makes sense. Thank you, team.
Rick Hessling: You're welcome, Neil.
Operator: Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Go ahead please. Your line is open.
Roger Read: Yes, thank you. Good morning.
Michael Hennigan: Good morning, Roger.
Roger Read: Let me take the diesel question that everybody wants to ask on all these calls, kind of what you're seeing across your system? Whether or not the Mississippi River issues had anything to do with what's going on in the Central part of the country and -- and just any thoughts you have on some of the policy issues that are percolating out there in terms of any risk of government intervention on the diesel export front?
Brian Partee: Yes, Roger, this is Brian Partee. I can take that. There's a couple of different things to unpack there. First on the Mississippi River. We have a really strong and capable Inland River system and team. We've got over 20 tugs and 300 barges. We largely operate on the Ohio River, but also do transit the Mississippi. And the team has been working extremely hard over the last several months making sure the product continues to flow. So I can say there's been no impact, but it's been on the heels of our team working very diligently hard and positioning the right equipment in the lower Mississippi River to make sure that we don't have disruptions. So on that front, things have been going pretty well. As it relates to the ongoing dialog with the administration, we have had frequent engagement and communication, which has been welcomed. I think it's good to share and understand each other's perspective. And as it relates to the export ban, I think that through the dialog, there's been general consensus and understanding that, that likely would be counterproductive the goals and objectives of building inventory and reducing prices. I mean, fundamentally, if you look at our 2.5 million barrels of exports in the U.S., we just don't have enough demand to back it in. We've got grade mixes. We've got logistics disconnect. So I think there's been broad understanding and engagement that, that's not the best course of action. Now all that being said, I just can't speak on behalf of the administration, I think anything is on the table at any time.
Michael Hennigan: Hey Roger, it's Mike. I'll just add to Brian, I'll give you my thoughts on it. Number one is I do think the administration understands that a ban would not have the effect that they were originally looking for and instead would decrease inventory levels, reduce refining capacity and actually put upward pressure on consumer fuel prices, which is not what they were intending. So I think given these potential outcomes, it's my opinion, that the administration would not pursue that path. But that's just -- that's my thought at this point.
Roger Read: Yes, I follow that, but then see a wish for a windfall profit tax, which would be unlikely to lower prices either based on experience. So you just don't -- never know what they might decide they want to do or feel forced to. I threw a lot into that. So I'll turn it over -- or turn it back over. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Royall with JPMorgan. Go ahead please. Your line is open.
John Royall: Hi guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So on the OpEx guidance for 4Q, I'm surprised to see it down from 3Q levels given you have more turn relative to 3Q. So anything to point to there either something from 3Q that's non-repeating or anything in 4Q in particular?
Maryann Mannen: Sure, John. It's Maryann. So in the third quarter, we had really three things that were largely equally weighted, that impacted the actual results in the quarter. The first, as you mentioned, was -- I call it a one-time. We had about a $0.13 impact from a four-year adjustment on property tax costs. Unfortunately, the state has the ability to go back and do that. So that is non-repeating. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we'll go after that and continue to pursue it. But unfortunately, when it's live, we need to record it. So that was in the quarter. Second, obviously, higher energy costs just in general, quarter-over-quarter, as I mentioned. And then the last piece, to your point, in the third quarter, given the level of back half-weighted turnaround expenses or other activities associated with that or higher. When we gave guidance for the fourth quarter, we certainly see energy costs somewhat nat gas related decline in Q3 to Q4. And obviously, the tax impact, we do not expect to repeat. I hope that addresses the question.
Michael Hennigan: John, it's Mike. Let me just add to what Maryann just said. So we try our best to give you as good a guidance as we can with the one caveat being where is natural gas price going to be? So we look at the forward curve right before we give the guidance and just reminding you the sensitivity is $0.30 a barrel for every $1 per million BTUs. So where that actually ends up in the quarter is hard to call. So we just take a look at the forward curve ahead of time and put our best number on it. So what I feel good about is the areas that we control on cost. I continue to say we have sustainable reductions that we've seen over the last couple of years, and that's good. As Maryann mentioned, we have a tax dispute that we'll follow up on. And we have this unknown as to where natural gas will actually price itself throughout the whole quarter. Hopefully, that helps.
John Royall: It does. Thank you. And then just a follow-up to Neil's question on capture rates. I think you went into some kind of the broader dynamics. But just -- just wanted to be relative to the commentary that it would be down. And I think you touched on it a little bit in the prepared remarks, but just kind of some of the moving pieces there. And then in order in 4Q, it's looking to me like it's a heavy maintenance quarter relative to 3Q and then you have price moving up -- is a total perception, should we think -- do you think about that number kind of pointed down in 4Q?
Maryann Mannen: Hey John, Maryann, I'll start and then I'll pass it to Rick and Brian to give you any incremental color. But you're right, when I provided guidance on capture for the third quarter, knowing that we had a fairly strong third and fourth quarter, frankly, but third quarter compared to the second quarter turnaround activity, we expected that we would have seen some capture impact as a result. Having said that, there were certainly some offsetting elements in the quarter. First, as you know, we actually saw prices come down a bit and those lower prices actually improved our clean product margins. Pricing actually really did benefit as we looked at the volumetric gains quarter-over-quarter. And then while secondaries were still a headwind in the quarter, they were better than what we had initially projected. Your question was a little bit tough, you were cutting in and out. But as we talk about the fourth quarter, I think, is what you were asking as well. Obviously, it will be, as you've seen from the guidance, our heaviest turnaround month of all -- excuse me, quarter of all four quarters. So we would certainly anticipate that capture in the fourth quarter could be below what we saw in the third quarter for some of those very reasons. But let me pass it to Rick and Brian to give you incremental color. I think Mike wants it too.
Michael Hennigan: Yes, before we pass to the other guys, John, I just want to remind everybody that when Q2 margins were as high as they were, we made a conscious decision to delay some activity into the back half of the year, specifically into the fourth quarter. At that time, we felt it was a good idea, provided there was no safety issues or anything to make that adjustment. So some of what's happened here is we've traded some Q2 margin for Q4 margin and we still think that was a good call, but it has loaded up a little bit more activity in the fourth quarter as far as our turnaround activity.
Rick Hessling: John, this is Rick. I'll just add to Maryann's earlier comments and make a comment on secondary product margins. So we're one month into the quarter. We'll see where the next two months go. But secondary product margins have been so volatile and trying to predict where WTI is going to go from here is anyone's guess. I would say that's one of the biggest wildcards on where our capture will end up. So -- more to come there. We'll see how the rest of the quarter plays out. And with that, I'll see if Brian has any color to add.
Brian Partee: Yes, thanks, Rick. Just one quick summary wrap-up comment. It's hard to call the ball one month into the quarter, but I will say that October from a clean products perspective, started off strong, as Mike indicated in his opening commentary, we did not see the seasonal turndown in demand. We've had weather working largely in our favor. We haven't had a Hurricane event in the country as a whole has been pretty moderate on the weather front. We did see -- we've seen strong demand throughout the month of October. And correspondingly, we've seen strong margins as well. So directionally, I think, favorable but too early to call the ball.
John Royall: Very helpful, thank you.
Brian Partee: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Go ahead please. Your line is open.
Sam Margolin: Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question.
Brian Partee: Good morning, Sam.
Sam Margolin: Wanted to ask on the renewable diesel business. You mentioned Neste brings some benefit on the feedstock procurement side. You also have the JV with Archer-Daniels. So you're covered across categories within the feedstock universe, and there's a lot of disparity between vegetable oils and waste oils right now. And so I'm just curious how you think about the feedstock picture overall, whether it's important to really have security on both sides or if you might be leaning towards one specific category of feed stock over another?
Brian Partee: Yes, Sam, this is Brian. I'll take that question. It's a great question. So, first, let me just back up and talk a little bit about what we have going on out west with Martinez. So we're well into our prefill strategy. So we've been prefielding since middle of the summer. We're currently buying from over 50 different suppliers. So we forayed into this business two years ago with Dickinson and the team has come up very, very fast in developing those relationships.
.: So we've quickly gone from not being in the business to being holistically in the business with two different plants here shortly, pretreat capacity. And we're confident, very confident in our ability to source optimal feedstocks. But it's really an optimization much like we undertake on the crude side of our business. We run an LP model. We look at unit constraints at the refinery, we look at logistics, we look at pricing and of course, CI value. So it's a broad optimization, very similar to what we do on the crude side of our business.
Sam Margolin: Okay. Thanks. And then speaking of optimization on the Refining side, maybe if we could go back in time to the MarkWest acquisition a number of years ago, a big part of that was NGL integration into the refineries or at least there was a contemplated synergy. And now we've got a pretty noteworthy NGL dislocation and specifically butane. And I wonder if that relationship is, as you imagined it at that time or if in the process of your sort of commercial transformation, if you've fenced them off or organize them differently?
Rick Hessling: Yes, hi Sam, it's Rick. So the call out is outstanding, especially in these low NGL price environments we're in right now. So when you look at the logistics of combining MWE and MPC and our total footprint, it's incredible today, especially as we optimize our octane with NGLs and heading into the butane blending season. Really, to answer your question, it's yes and yes. Yes, we saw this coming to the extent it is here today. I would say it's -- it's certainly a nice shot in the arm for us as we optimize around our system, both from specifically butane and all things NGLs tied to our -- tied to our whole system. We're seeing specific benefits certainly on the Gulf Coast with Garyville, but it's throughout our entire system. So a great call out.
Sam Margolin: Thanks so much. Have a great day.
Rick Hessling: You're welcome.
Operator: Up next, we have Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Go ahead please. Your line is open.
Paul Cheng: Thank you. Hey guys, good morning. Two questions. First, I want to go back into the [indiscernible] stock. On the -- recently that we have seen the CI adjusted pretreated soybean oil price is mainly comparable to the UCO, the Used Cooking Oil. So want to see that how you guys see that? And why do you think that may -- that has happened? And do you think that this trend is going to sustain and corresponding the impact on your feedstock strategy? So that's the first question. The second question is related to maybe that -- how the IRA and also that the timing LCFS prices that we have seen over the past four months impacting your renewable longer-term outlook and strategy? Thank you.
Brian Partee: Yes, Paul, thanks. This is Brian. I understand the question. So first on CI as it relates to soybean oil, UCO and actually even some of the other feedstocks that we look at. I would say that we're at a point or we've been at a point here in the last several months where we like ourselves and others have been in startup mode. So there's been a bit of a surge in demand in acquiring feedstocks as it relates to start-up. And the market broadly is not super-efficient yet. So it's an emerging market. Relationships matter. A lot of the sellers in this space, so whether it's UCO or rendered fats. It's a new business line for them. So there's a lot of exploration ongoing. So I don't think it's a structural change as we've seen here in the last couple of months. But I do think it's just the nature of the market evolving from a CI perspective. But as I said earlier, to Sam's question, I think logistics are going to be key. Those relationships are going to be key to make sure we get the right feedstocks, the most advantaged feedstocks into our facilities. Your second question related to LCFS. Certainly, we've seen the supply and demand of LCFS credits to gap out here over the last 1.5 years or so. The one point I'd make here is we're seeing that in California, that there's other states, other areas, Canada, Oregon that have emerging programs. So that's a new variable that's entering into the equation and calculus for us and others in terms of where you actually place the product. So we reported -- CARB reported a pretty big build for the second quarter. Credit is still a little over 1.3 million credit in the second quarter. So that surplus continues to grow. We do expect CARB, they're going through a scoping assessment now on the LCFS program. We do expect them to make adjustments to the plan going forward to really support the investments needed on the low carbon side of things. I think that will be an opportunity in 2023 to engage and discuss and probably something we see manifest in 2024. Ultimately, the economics as it relates to RV are really founded on several interrelated variables. We've had the positive side of that on the RIN and the Blenders Tax Credit. Certainly, the product pricing in California has been supportive. So that's all been on the positive side. Feedstock pricing, although stable through the third quarter has been towards the higher side as we think about this year. And then as you mentioned, the LCFS have been the lower side. But all that combined considered, we're seeing stable margin production out of our Dickinson facility, and we'd expect the same out in Martinez, just through a variety of different variables.
Michael Hennigan: Hi, Paul, it's Mike. I just want to add a comment. We've been talking about Martinez for a while now. And early on, we said that in order to have a terrific facility, we wanted to have competitive CapEx and I think everybody has seen our numbers on that. We've disclosed that. OpEx, we're in a really good position with the former refinery asset. Brian has talked about, we're pretty bullish to the logistics assets that we have set up here and the last piece of the puzzle was feedstocks that which you're asking about, and Brian just gave you some color on our side. Plus, I do want to reiterate, that was part of the driver for our partnership with Neste. We know their portfolio and see them as a global leader in this area. So it was one of the key factors that enabled us to say we wanted to JV with them. And as we said in our prepared remarks, we think there's more to come with the relationship with Neste. We're working on different things together as we feel that we've had a win-win for both sides of this but feedstock procurement is actually one of the most important parts of this and kind of the last leg of the stool after we talked about CapEx, OpEx and logistics. So hopefully, that helps.
Paul Cheng: Sure. Just curious, do you guys have any plan to add additional development plan or now the plan, sales at a next one or two years? Or that you just have the machines going to bump up and you're going to wait until that's fully ramp up. So what type of strategy that you guys have in mind?
Michael Hennigan: Yes. So we're not sure what you said. Kristina said, you thought you heard you say, are we adding alkeplants, did you say alke or?
Paul Cheng: No, I'm saying that I hear what you say about the [indiscernible] curious that now you have the renewable diesel plant in that going to come up very soon. And so what is the next step in your strategy? Do you plan to add additional new facility or new development in the area before you fully stand up on the material or that you say, okay, we just have some major investment on the space and that's run it for a couple of years before we look for the next addition?
Michael Hennigan: Okay. Understood it was RD. Yes. I think, Paul, it's more the latter. We have some things going. I'll let Dave make a few comments on some of the areas that we're looking at. But -- but we'll have Martinez started up here very shortly within a couple of months. We're going to mechanically complete at the end of the year. So it's probably a little more latter to the scenario that you played out but the whole area continues to evolve. So Dave, why don't you give a little color on some of the things that we're looking at.
David Heppner: Yes, Paul. This is Dave. So I think, as Mike stated, while we have Dickinson up and going, and we're bringing Martinez online, both Phase 1 and Phase 3 even with the Neste JV, part of our strategy, and Brian touched on a lot of it from feedstock all the way to product placement is, I won't say replicating the hydrocarbon value chain, but leveraging our core companies are strengths that we've shown in the commercial value we can extract out of participating up and down that value chain. Probably a little bit of a difference from the hydrocarbon to the renewable is we don't want to get over our skis and maybe outside of our core competencies, and we also want to hedge speed to market. Hence, the reason you're seeing our relationships, our JVs will use them, our partnerships with ADM and Neste, for example. So as Mike stated, we're going to continue to evaluate new opportunities. We look at a lot of stuff, but it needs to be capital efficient. The IRA is -- could be some tailwind as you look at this. But I still think it's a little early to see how some of those variables all play out and the actual mechanics of the IRA before we can make long-term investment strategies. Thank you.
Paul Cheng: Thank you.
David Heppner: You're welcome, Paul.
Operator: Our next question comes from [indiscernible] with Barclays. Go ahead please. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. First, I wanted to touch on your comments about demand across your system. Your earlier comments about being down in 2019. Was that specific to your assets? Or were you talking about the DOE numbers in general? And would love to get some color there. And also on the supply outlook on the product side, just given the multiple variables at play, be it Russian products rerouting ahead of the February 5 new ban or incremental Asian exports in China and ex-China potentially coming to water and hitting PADD 5 and would love to hear your views on how all of that percolates.
Michael Hennigan: Theresa, I'll start off with mine. My comments were related to the DOE data, but I'll let Brian give a little color on our specific data. But just in general, I think it's consistent that we still see a lot of demand recovery, and that's why we're so bullish at this point, and then we'll take the second part of your question in a second.
Brian Partee: Yes, thanks, Theresa, for the question. So yes, just a bit of color maybe on the system. First, to address Mike's comments around our data. Mike did quote on the DOE data. Our comps back to 2019 aren't super relevant given that we've shut down a couple of different refineries, we sold off for retail units. So we really look at the year-to-year. And I'll give you just a high-level overview for Q3. So year-on-year, distillate has been steady and strong, very stable across the platform and really flat year-on-year. Jet continues to perform well, and we're seeing that recover year-on-year about 6%, but still below 2019 across the platform. And then gasoline is probably the most interesting. We did -- we were off slightly from 2021 in Q3, about 2% and it really correlates to retail prices. So we'll start in the West and about 4% below Q1 and 2021 out West, so 4% decline that we really correlate directly to retail prices and the elasticity impact of higher retails. Midwest was about 3% and the Gulf Coast was 1%. So overall, about 2%. But kind of going back to Mike's earlier comments, we do remain optimistic as we think about demand. I mentioned October we came out of the chute really strong here for Q4. We're continuing to see COVID demand recovery. Jet travel more broadly, the halo around activity and vacations, not just Jet but marine fuel, diesel, gasoline, et cetera. And we also have moderated retail prices coming off of the summer highs. We're currently around $375 a gallon, well off of our highs in the summer. And demand continues to also be robust in South America and the Caribbean. The economies there are geared a little bit differently. We've got strong agricultural demand globally as well as mining activity. There's been some price subsidization that's occurred in South of the border here, that's also helped to prop up demand. So -- and then we're seeing pulls into Europe as well, for obvious reasons, primarily around energy security and just having access to the fuel going forward as the winter enthuse here. And the last thing I'd mention is on the supply constraint side. We've taken a lot of capacity offline globally, and we do expect a degree of friction around the Russian exports of production, hard to call the ball on how impactful that might be. Everybody is watching very closely, but we don't expect it to be positive for incremental supply. We do expect it to drag just a bit.
Unidentified Analyst: I'm sorry, the Asian export or potential exports?
Brian Partee: Yes, as it relates to a lot of -- and you enter a rumor coming out of Asia in terms of export quotas, COVID policies, really difficult for us to call. The one data point I can give you, though, Theresa, empirically on that, is we have not seen where we compete. We have not seen a step change in terms of competing with refineries coming out of Asia, specifically to China. Just it's been steady as she goes, status quo here for the last several months.
Michael Hennigan: Theresa, it's Mike. I would just add that the inventories are obviously low. The market needs additional barrels. We're doing our best to put out as much product as we can. Brian mentioned the point about we see some price elasticity when prices get too high. So I think at the end of the day, we spend as much time on what we control, and that's to run as hard as we can, put as much product into the market as we can. And whether Asia -- exports come or don't come, the market needs to supply. So I think that's why, at the end of the day, we still see this to be a pretty bullish outlook. It's just -- it's evolved over a couple of years. We think demand is going to continue to come back. Brian just gave you some specifics on our areas. I had mentioned the DOE stuff. So we believe that demand will continue to recover and then whether supply comes from China or from the U.S. market itself is the market just needs it. It's a supply-constrained recovering demand outlook that makes us have this bullish look.
Operator: Our last question today will come from Matthew Blair with TPH. Go ahead please. Your line is open.
Matthew Blair: Hey, good morning and Mike, congrats on your good health news from last month, it's great to hear. I had a question on the -- I had a question on the STAR project, which you mentioned will be complete in early 2023. I think at one point, you were hoping for about $525 million of EBITDA from the project. Has that number moved up with your expectations of a higher mid-cycle environment? And if so, could you give us a range on what that might look like? And then in terms of just how it will flow through the financials, I believe it will add 40,000 barrels a day of new refining capacity, so we should expect a volume kick but then also a margin improvement, right, from the ability to handle residuals better. And I think there might be some octane benefits too. So if you could walk through that, that would be great.
Timothy Aydt: Hey Matt, this is Tim. I'll take the first part of that question. So the remaining scope that we have will indeed increase the heavy crude capacity by about 40,000 barrels a day. It will also improve the resid upgrading by about 17,000 a day. We do still feel really good about the economic drivers of the project. I mean, obviously, you've got the current widening heavy crude differentials and you've got strong distillate cracks that have really kind of improved the project value over our original look. We also made some logistics investments that are being heavily utilized and those further improved product margins in some of these niche markets, be it domestic or foreign and then as I said in the prepared remarks, so the remaining work is going to be tied in during the turnaround in the first quarter of next year. So that's kind of where we're at on the STAR project. So kind of back over to Mike.
Michael Hennigan: Matt, you can just -- whatever numbers you want to put on, you had it right from the beginning. It's 40,000 barrels a day of additional crude times whatever number you want to put on that and 17,000 barrels a day of heavy upgrading. So whatever your outlook is, that's the math that will give you the additional EBITDA once we start this up.
Matthew Blair: Good stuff. Thanks. I'll leave it there.
Michael Hennigan: You're welcome.
Kristina Kazarian: Sounds great there. And then on that operator, I think we are done for today. So thank you, everyone, for your interest in Marathon Petroleum. Should you have any additional questions or would like clarification on topics discussed today, please reach out and our IR team will be available to help you with your questions. Thank you, everyone.
Operator: Thank you so much. That will conclude today's conference, and we thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-08-02 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MPC Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. My name is Sheila, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian, Kristina, you may begin.
Kristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com, under the Investor tab.  Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO and other members of the executive team.  We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ, and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our SEC filings.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.
Michael Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, our operational activity was driven by strong market demand for transportation fuels we manufacture. Demand remains resilient, largely driven by the removal of globally imposed mobility restrictions and the pent-up desire to travel.  Jet fuel demand continued its recovery, up nearly 20% from the same quarter last year, with the increased resumption of travel. Gasoline demand remained very resilient through the quarter in part due to the start of the summer driving season. Diesel demand after a strong beginning to the year, softened a bit in the second quarter due to lower trucking volumes.  During the second quarter, in order to meet robust customer demand, we ran our refining system at full utilization. We optimized our system to provide as much transportation fuel to the market as possible. Commercially, we optimized around our scale, footprint and feedstock slate to meet this customer demand.  This resulted in an adjusted EBITDA of $9.1 billion as we saw crack spreads this quarter respond to uncertainty in the product markets, driven by the potential for sanction impacts on top of an already tight supply and related inventory levels.  Maryann will walk you through the details of our results. But looking forward, we expect tight supply, low inventory levels and strong global demand to continue to incentivize high refining runs into the third quarter. We will continue to execute on what we can control running a safe, reliable, low-cost system, improving our commercial performance and strengthening the competitive performance of our assets.  On capital allocation, we remain committed to the 4 priorities we previously outlined. First, we're going to take care of our assets by deploying maintenance capital. We want to ensure we can safely operate our assets protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate.  Second, we're committed to a secure, competitive and growing dividend. And as we've stated in the past, once we complete the $15 billion capital return program that resulted from the Speedway sale, we will reassess the level of our dividend.  Third, we see this as a return on as well as the return of capital business. As we enter the second half of the year, our capital spending outlook remains on track.  We continue to progress our Martinez renewable fuels facility with the first phase of the facility currently targeted to be mechanically complete by year-end. Once completed, the facility is expected to be capable of bringing nearly 50,000 barrels a day of renewable diesel supply into the market.  We also expect to be able to close our JV with Neste in the coming months. The time frame for completing the facility and closing the JV are dependent upon the timing of obtaining the air quality permit. We'll continue to look for other opportunities to generate a return on capital such as cost reduction projects and opportunities that build out our competencies and increase our competitive advantages to drive returns and shareholder value.  And fourth, after executing against the first 3 objectives, we look to return capital to shareholders. In the 3 months since our last earnings call, we have repurchased $4.1 billion of shares. And today, we announced a separate and incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization.  At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann.
Maryann Mannen: Thanks, Mike. Moving to our sustainability efforts. In June, we published our annual sustainability report and our annual perspective on climate scenarios report. We continue to make progress on our greenhouse gas reduction targets. And through 2021, we have achieved a 23% reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 intensity emissions, and an 11% reduction in our absolute Scope 3, Category 11 greenhouse gas emissions.  Our perspectives on climate-related scenarios which is aligned with TCFD standards, provides insight into some of the strategic considerations we take to set meaningful objectives, dedicate resources to accomplish them and then hold ourselves accountable and demonstrate results. Our sustainability report shows continued progress on the sustainability goals that we have set for ourselves, which we have been reporting on since 2011. We believe our investors and other interested stakeholders will find that the extensive disclosures in these reports illustrate our company's financial strength, adaptiveness and resilience to climate-related risks.  Moving to second quarter results. Slide 5 provides a summary of our second quarter financial results. This morning, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $10.61. This quarter's results were adjusted to exclude a $230 million benefit related to changes in the 2020 and 2021 RVO requirements published by the EPA. Adjusted EBITDA was nearly $9.1 billion for the quarter and cash flow from operations, excluding favorable working capital changes was almost $7 billion.  During the quarter, we returned $313 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased approximately $3.3 billion of shares. Through the end of July, we have repurchased $4.1 billion of shares since our last earnings call.  Slide 6 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA, and as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from first quarter 2022 to the second quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was higher sequentially and driven primarily by an approximately $6.4 billion increase from Refining & Marketing. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 22%, resulting in a tax provision of $1.8 billion. The tax rate is higher this last quarter due to refining end marketing representing a larger component of earnings in the quarter.  Moving to our segment results. Slide 7 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. During the quarter, our R&M team was focused on supplying transportation fuels to meet market demand. Refining ran at 100% utilization processing approximately 2.9 million barrels of crude per day at our 13 refineries safely and reliably. This is the same level of throughput achieved back in 2019 pre-pandemic before the closures of Gallup and Martinez.  Capture was 96%, reflecting a strong result from our commercial team in a volatile market. Operating expenses were higher in the second quarter, driven primarily by natural gas prices, which were approximately $3 per MMBtu higher in the second quarter versus the first quarter.  While we have been able to mitigate some of the impact of higher prices, the cost increase we have seen in the first half of the year has been almost entirely driven by higher energy cost. We continue to believe the cost reductions we made to bring our structural operating costs down to approximately $5 per barrel are sustainable. With higher natural gas prices, we would expect operating costs to remain elevated in the third quarter. Distribution costs were modestly higher in the second quarter versus the first quarter due to higher refinery utilization, which resulted in higher system volumes.  Turning to Slide 8, which provides an overview of our refining and marketing margin capture this quarter, our capture results this quarter were impacted by a few key factors. Secondary products continue to be a headwind as prices lag higher light product prices. This was partially offset by strong gasoline and distillate margins as well as higher volumetric gain due to higher product prices.  Product backwardation created a headwind during part of the quarter. But during this time, we were able to leverage our robust logistics capabilities to translate a portion of our physical barrels into the market on a more prompt basis. And our ability to capture 96% of the market indicator across an incredibly volatile 3 months was in part due to our commercial responses.  Slide 9 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the first quarter of 2022. Our Midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter. Performance is underpinned by strong operations and a commitment to strict capital discipline.  MPLX remains a source of durable earnings in the MPC portfolio. As MPLX continues to generate free cash flow, we believe it will have the capacity to return significant capital to its unitholders. Today, MPLX announced an incremental $1 billion unit repurchase authorization.  Slide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. Operating cash flow was approximately $7 billion in the quarter, which excludes changes in working capital. Working capital was roughly flat for the quarter as we saw benefits from an increase in crude oil payables related to higher refining throughput, offset by a build in crude oil inventories. Since the first quarter of 2021, working capital related to increasing prices has been a source of cash flow.  Capital expenditures and investments totaled $546 million this quarter. We continue to spend on our STAR project, which is projected to increase crude capacity at the Galveston Bay refinery by 40,000 barrels per day. This project is expected to be completed early 2023. We are progressing the conversion of Martinez renewable fuel facility and expect the first phase to be mechanically complete by year-end.  During the quarter, MPC returned $313 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchased approximately $3.3 billion worth of shares. At the end of the second quarter, MPC had approximately $13.3 billion in cash and short-term investments.  As Mike mentioned earlier, we remain committed to a secure, competitive and growing dividend. Our objective has been to complete the $15 billion repurchase program no later than the end of this year. We remain on track to meet this commitment. Upon completion of the program, we will reassess our dividend level.  Since the launch of this program in May 2021, we have repurchased approximately 12.1 billion shares at an average share price of approximately $74 per share. Over this time, we have reduced MPC share count by approximately 162 million shares or over 24%. We've received the Board's approval for a separate and incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization. We'll work through our capital allocation priorities and continue to assess the market environment to determine how we might execute against this authorization.  Turning to guidance. On Slide 11, we provide our third quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of roughly 2.7 million barrels per day representing 94% utilization. Utilization is forecasted to be lower than second quarter due to higher planned turnaround activity. Planned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $400 million in the third quarter with activity spread across all 3 regions.  As we've mentioned on previous earnings calls, our planned turnaround activity is back half weighted for 2022. Turnaround activity is reflected in our third quarter throughput guidance we expect this elevated level of activity may reduce our light product yields. We'll optimize to minimize the impacts, but we think our capture rate for the third quarter could be lower than the second quarter.  In coordinating maintenance work, we'll always try to maximize turnaround and catalyst cycles to the economic optimum, but we also do not compromise on safety or asset integrity and ensure work is scheduled to achieve this balance Total operating costs are projected to be $5.50 per barrel for the quarter. We are expecting higher operating costs in the third quarter. This is primarily driven by the elevated cost of natural gas as well as slightly higher project expense work, which we normally coordinate to occur during turnarounds to limit the impact on throughput reduction.  As a reminder, natural gas has historically represented approximately 15% of operating costs. Our natural gas sensitivity of approximately $330 million of annual EBITDA for every $1 change per MMBtu. This equates to a sensitivity of approximately $0.30 per barrel of cost.  Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the third quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $170 million representing the sustained reductions that we have made in this area.  In closing, we will continue to optimize our system to provide as much transportation fuel to the market as demand requires. We remain committed to advancing our low-cost initiatives and focused on areas to drive continued commercial outperformance, and we will stay steadfast in our plan to execute against our capital allocation priorities to drive shareholder value.  Let me turn the call back to Kristina.
Kristina Kazarian: Thanks, Maryann. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, we're ready for the questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Doug Leggate: Mike, nice to see you back. I guess, Mike, in the last couple of months, we've seen Shell and PBF to restructure the ownership of their MLP. Obviously, the relative yields remain very wide between yourselves and MPLX. I know I've asked you about this before, but I just wonder if there's been any reconsideration as to be appropriate, now that you've come through the buyback more or less the appropriate ownership structure of MPLX?
Michael Hennigan: Yes, Doug, we have talked about this before. I mean we continue to look at it. It's not something that we have off the radar screen. But we continue to come to the same conclusion we have for quite some time that those other situations where people are rolling up their MLPs, we think, are in a much different situation than we are. We're pretty pleased with our MLP's performance, continues to kick cash back to MPC. The structure itself, obviously, it's going out of favor with investors for a little bit, but we think that's starting to turn around as well.  So it's something we keep looking at, Doug. But at the end of the day, we're still comfortable with the structure that we have. And we think it works for the Marathon family to have both MPC and MPLX.
Doug Leggate: Okay. I apologize. I now unpredictable, but I just wanted to get your latest thoughts on that. So thank you. My follow-up is kind of related, I guess, Mike. I mean the operational reliability that you guys demonstrated in some of your peers also, but to be able to take advantage of the environment, I think, speaks to the way you're running the business, which really gets to the issue then of a sustainable base dividend, which you haven't increased since 2020.  Now I understand the point about you wanted to get the Speedway proceeds redeployed. But today, your dividend is, I guess, about 2/3 of the distribution you get from MPLX, which basically means MPC free cash flow isn't paying the dividend at all. So I just wonder if you can give us a steer as to what you think about the right level of base dividend as a proportion? However you want to measure it consolidated cash flow or however you want to look at it? But it seems the base dividend relative to the earnings part of the business is quite dislocated, if you like. I'll leave it at that.
Michael Hennigan: Yes, Doug, it's a good question. And I know some people have been asking us on the last couple of calls where we are on the dividend. I think if I'm right or if I'm wrong, we stated that we were going to maximize the share buyback program and complete that and then reset the dividend. That's still our intention. We're $12 billion through the $15 billion program. Everybody has seen the pace at which we can execute and that's guided by our trading volume and the programs that we have in place.  So we're pretty close to talking about that in a more constructive way, we are committed, and we said this in our remarks, we're committed to a competitive dividend. We want to show the market that we'll grow that dividend. It's probably taken a little longer than everybody's patience has been as far as this return program, but it's actually been executing well in our mind.  As Maryann said in the prepared remarks, we bought back quite a bit of the shares at $74. So we're feeling pretty good about that in general. And we're not too far off of the releasing to the market where our head is on the dividend.
Operator: Our next question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta: Really terrific execution this quarter. The first question I had was actually on the crude market. It's obviously been volatile. But we've seen differentials widen out for a couple of different basins, Brent-WTI, Western Canadian crude has opened up as well. Just love your perspective from a commercial perspective of what do you think is driving some of the opening of the differentials? And do you see yourselves as well positioned to capture some of that volatility?
Michael Hennigan: Good question, Neil. Let me let Rick take that.
Rick Hessling: Yes, Neil, really great question because we are seeing a lot of volatility in both of those markets, specifically to TI first. We're seeing strong production in the Permian and both on the WTI and WTL specifically. So if you look at where MPC is positioned and with our pipeline commitments with Galveston Bay really sitting in the backyard of the Permian. There's really nobody better positioned than us to take advantage of TI and TL. And then specifically on WCS, that has widened out to 21-plus under. And that's happening, Neil, for a variety of reasons. One, we believe the SPR barrels have put significant pressure on the medium sour barrels in the Gulf Coast, and WCS needs to clear to the Gulf Coast. So it needs to compete directly with the medium sour barrel, and the early SPR releases were predominantly medium sour. So from an MPC perspective, we have historical space out of Canada. We're able to take advantage of that in all 3 regions, the West Coast, the Mid-Con and now the Gulf Coast. So we feel very good about that macro environment going forward. If those are still open, we'll be as well positioned as anyone to capture those advantages.
Neil Mehta: Yes. That's great color. And the follow-up is your views on renewable diesel. We've seen soy bean oil and vegetable oil has come off a little bit. And now there's talk of an extension of the blenders tax credit. LCFS, however, has come down. So can you talk about all the moving pieces that go into the economics of Rodeo and how that ties back into your view of the profitability of that asset?
Raymond Brooks: Okay. Neil, this is Ray Brooks, and I'll take your question on that. You're right. There are a lot of moving parts to the economics of renewable diesel some recent headwinds, LCFS price is a little lower than we would have anticipated feedstock prices across the board a little higher. And then there's some tailwinds. We've got a bigger contribution from RIN pricing, a bigger contribution from RD prices. So a lot of moving pieces in the equation. But one thing I'll tell you is when we look at like our Dickinson project, when you take all the puts and takes, the plus and minuses together, we're pretty much on par with where we expected the project to come in. And so that's our experience with Dickinson. We expect the same type of contribution with Martinez going forward. One thing that I would like to add, though, is what we really do is a lot of things I'm talking about outside of our control, whether the regulatory prices, the feedstock price is going to be. I'd really like to focus on what we do and specific to Dickinson, we pay attention to all the feedstocks and we pivoted to the most lowest cost feedstock slate, the lowest carbon intensity slate by optimizing our feedstock acquisition process. The other thing we did is even though that, that project was supposed to be 100% refined bleach deodorized soybean oil, we used our pretreatment facilities at Beatrice, Nebraska and Cincinnati to essentially bring in a fully pretreated feed slate in there. So really concentrate on the things that we can control to deliver the EBITDA. But a lot of moving parts, and we're just doing the best we can with it.
Operator: Our next question will come from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse.
Manav Gupta: Mike, you bought a lot of capital discipline to MPC. Investors really respect you for that. But we are in a different environment versus when you actually took over MPC. You have the best-in-class midstream footprint in Permian and Northeast, 2 basins where volumes are actually growing materially. We are seeing E&Ps raise CapEx in these regions. My question is for the right opportunity, organic or inorganic, would you be willing to spend more at the midstream level to benefit from the projected volume growth? .
Michael Hennigan: Yes, Manav. I think the answer to that is yes. I mean, obviously, we probably would prefer to do that at the MPLX level as opposed to MPC. But we are definitely looking and trying to figure out ways to create value in both of those basins. I mean, as everybody knows, we've said for quite some time that we're going to concentrate in the Permian and concentrate in the Marcellus area. We did announce on the call earlier today that we are advancing a couple more processing plants, one up in the Marcellus, which has been kind of a constrained area for a little bit of time now and it looks like growth is going to start to pick up there. And then we've also announced another plant down in the Permian as well. So yes, we're very attentive. Hopefully, we'll find more opportunities in both of those basins because we think they're both going to continue to grow. I mean everybody is very aware of the global natural gas situation. We remain constructive on it, and we're trying to be as involved in that growth as we can be.
Manav Gupta: My second and very quick follow-up is, again, very positive operating cost on the Gulf Coast below $4. You -- if you look at last couple of years, it's been trending down, but you actually did not close an unprofitable assets. Sometimes when you close an unprofitable asset, the cost can come down. Your cost has been coming down as the assets -- as the number of assets has remained the same. So help us understand how you're able to push through these lower OpEx numbers?
Raymond Brooks: Okay. Manav, this is Ray Brooks, and I'll take that question. I think it comes down to a couple of things. One is definitely paying attention to cost control striving to be the low cost, safe, reliable operator. And then the other key word is reliability. So when we look at the Gulf Coast for the second quarter, we ran extremely well, 1.35 million barrels a day of throughput in those 2 assets at Garyville and Galveston Bay. So best ever performance there out of those assets and they're phenomenal assets. And then the other thing is it's just concentrating on costs. We talked about this many times over the earnings calls in the last couple of years. We've got 2 refineries there that performed very well in the Solomon OpEx survey that comes out every 2 years. Garyville, historically, has been a very good first quartile refinery and Galveston Bay has improved over the past couple of years. So just strict cost discipline after we pay attention to all of our safety and maintenance cap just questioning everything we're spending there and running reliable. So even though your question was on cost in the Gulf Coast, we're really happy with 2Q with our margin performance. So I'm going to let Rick talk a little bit on that.
Rick Hessling: Yes. So Manav, so hand-in-hand with op costs goes refining margin per barrel. And we have really taken Mike's push on improving the commercial performance. We have an acronym we call CCI, continual commercial improvement, and the Gulf Coast -- and this is -- this goes for all 3 regions, but the Gulf Coast specifically, I think you're continuing to see us separate ourselves and improve quarter-to-quarter. And in simple terms, Manav, what we're doing is we are expanding the crack. We are expanding the margin from feedstocks to products. We're optimizing every day. It's a focus that is relentless within our team, and it's something truly that's been going on for years, but you're now really seeing the dividends of the optionality that the team has created, the logistical flexibility and our ability to take a feedstock into the refinery for raise team, his successful operating metrics that he's shown and proven that he's best in industry for quite some time with his toolkit.  And then taking that all the way to the end consumer, I can't stress enough how proud we are of our team and it's an initiative that's very important to us and one that I think you'll continually -- I'll ask you to continually watch because I feel confident in our performance in the quarters ahead as well.
Operator: Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.
Roger Read: Yes. Mike, good to hear you on the call, for sure. My question, coming back to the 96% capture in the quarter, your comments about the commercial operations helping. And then looking at where we are thus far in the third quarter. In Q2, we saw between the Gulf Coast and New York Harbor, quite an opening between cash markets for diesel. This quarter, it's cash markets for gasoline. So as we think about those kind of dislocations in the market, the crude diffs mentioned before, what would be a reasonable expectation for kind of capture performance this quarter?
Rick Hessling: This is Rick. So I'll take capture first. And I'll pivot back to -- before I specifically address your question, pivot back to Manav's point, one of the reasons you're seeing our capture where it's at is optionality. So optionality within our system really directly to your point, whether it's the Harbor or the Gulf Coast that blows out on diesel and gas, we are structuring our entire system to have optionality. We don't know when and where the differentials will blow out what will be favored 1 month versus the next. What I can tell you is when it happens, we have the system to take advantage of it. And that's years and years of really preparing for optionality within the system. Specifically, to your question on the Harbor versus the Gulf Coast, that's a tough call. It appears right now, as you said, gas is in favor. Where that will go will be interesting. I think part of that will be on inventories, how they play out within each of the regions as well as demand.  And from a demand perspective, we are seeing very bullish signals from the consumer right now. So we are quite optimistic on that front.
Roger Read: Okay. And then maybe pivoting back to Martinez and the error permit that's still required. Could you just help us, I mean, the 30 days obviously was provided in the release. But is there any other part of that process we need to watch in terms of other approvals required or an extension or anything like that? I mean is it 30 days and should be good on knowing what to do? Or do we have to watch other events?
Raymond Brooks: Roger, this is Ray. And I'll give you an update on Martinez. And I'll go back to the beginning of second quarter. On May 3, we were pretty excited when we got the EIR, the environmental impact report, the final one approved by Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors. So that was big and that let us with one more permit, which was the air permit with Bay Area Air Quality Management District. And so they spent the next couple of months doing a technical review and actually recently, July 22, they posted that permit for public comment, which is a 30-day comment period, which would end in August 21. So when that public comment period ends, they, along with us, providing input, will respond to any comments, and that should be the end. So what -- getting the air permit will be big deal. That allows us to start to unit up when it's ready, and it also allows us to close our joint venture partnership with Neste. So where would we see the light at the end of the tunnel coming on that one.
Operator: Our next question will come from John Royall with JPMorgan.
John Royall: So you touched on demand a bit in your opener and it sounds very strong. But I think if I'm not mistaken, I think the commentary related to 2Q. So it'd be interesting to hear what you're seeing in your system today on the demand side? And then maybe where you think we sit currently relative to pre-COVID? And anything on your outlook for the rest of the summer would be really helpful.
Rick Hessling: John, this is Rick. So going forward, it's been interesting. I'll back up and just talk about July and then where we're at today. So early in July, we had a little bit of a speed bump in and then around the 4th of July where demand was slightly below where we thought it should be. Ever since then, though, we've seen week-on-week increases and demand is picking up really across the board, but specifically in gasoline, diesel steady. And as Mike said in his opening comments around jet. Jet is 20% over quarter-on-quarter 2Q, anyways of -- from where we were a year ago, and we're getting very strong indicators from the airlines and the travel industry on domestic travel via jet. Specifically, going forward, we're seeing a very resilient consumer with a lot of pent-up demand and the trends look very promising. Now certainly, you have the headwinds of inflation, rising interest rates, et cetera. But right now, I would say the falling street price that has been permeated by the falling WTI market is winning the day. And the consumer is showing us very positive demand signals today, and we view that going forward as well.
John Royall: Great. That's really helpful. And then on utilizations, you did 100% in 2Q, 3Q guidance is 94%. Just wondering on sequencing, you obviously ran full out for the entirety of 2Q. Is the expectation of 3Q that you'll run full out in July and August and then go into some maintenance in September? Is there any work plan for the summer? Just any thoughts on the sequencing for utilizations?
Raymond Brooks: Yes. This is Ray again. So I'll take that question, John. Yes, you're right. We ran at 100% utilization in 2Q. And then in the third quarter, we're guiding to 94% utilization. And if you look at our turnaround number, up $400 million. That's because we have more turnaround plus catalyst work that's -- that we'll be doing in this 3-month period. One thing I'd like to highlight, though, is one of the reasons we ran 100% in 2Q is we really wanted to meet market demand. And so we challenge ourselves to what we could do in that regard. And just 1 example, we had 1 unit at one of our plants where a hydrocracker, we could squeeze a little bit more life out of the catalyst. And so we made a conscious decision to run through that in 2Q and do pick that work up in 3Q.  So we made those decisions. It looks like they're the right thing to do, but we do have a little bit more work coming up in the third quarter.
Operator: Our next question will come from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley.
Connor Lynagh: I wanted to ask two on capital allocation here. The first is a bit of a housekeeping question on the buyback. Just so we're understanding this cadence that you're buying back stock in the second quarter here. Is the way to think about this that you're going to continue that until the end of the initial $15 billion, and you'll revisit from there? How should we think about the timing and pacing of the $5 billion buyback?
Maryann Mannen: Connor, it's Maryann. Thanks for the question. So I think you captured it right. As we said, we are committed to completing that $15 billion no later than this year -- at the end of this year, excuse me. And you can see by the pace that we have been executing that clearly in the quarter as well, $3.3 billion in the quarter, $4.1 billion since the last time we met on the earnings call, we remain committed and on track to deliver that. As we talk about the additional $5 billion authorization that we just received, I would say it this way, you shouldn't expect that we will have that incremental share repurchase authorization complete by the end of this year. So $15 billion, again, remain firmly committed to that. As we talked about the next round of $5 billion, we'll evaluate market conditions and other opportunities that we have. But I wouldn't assume that we'll be done with that $5 billion this year.
Connor Lynagh: Okay. Understood. The second is a bit more high level. But I know you'd like to think about investing in the business in terms of banks of the river upside, downside. I guess, has there been any change in what you think of the upside in the business based on the events that have been ongoing in the refining industry over the past 3, 6 months? Is there anything that you might not have considered to be a valuable project? I'm thinking there might be some other projects like the STAR project that might not have competed for capital before, but are starting to look more interesting?
Michael Hennigan: Connor, it's Mike. I think what you're asking is, do we have a more constructive view on mid-cycle. I think the answer to that is, yes, as Rick stated before, right now, we're in a pretty constructive environment. Inventories are low. Demand hasn't gotten back to levels before COVID. So we're still recovering in that regard. So it is a pretty constructive environment. But as far as to your question of, does it change our view, I mean, I think you said it well. We do banks of the river regardless of where the mid-cycle is. We always look at a downside case and an upside case. And at the end of the day, our upside case is aggressive and our downside case is aggressive, so we can really get those banks to the river. I think our mode, and it was mentioned earlier in the call is we are a believer in capital discipline. We do want to invest in the business, but we want to be really strict about where we do that. And again, I keep saying it's a balance between return on capital when we have good opportunities and return of capital. and we've been trying to do a better job in both areas. So I don't think our bigger picture has changed. I mean what you're hearing out of us a lot today is the second quarter showed what we were supposed to do is run reliably. Ray and his team did a terrific job in that regard. That's what you're supposed to do when the margins are where they are because we don't control that side. And then Rick and his team, and Brian and his team look at how do we maximize feedstock profitability and how do we maximize product lease and profitability. And very proud of the team for what they did in the second quarter because it did show some of the discipline we've been trying to achieve because we don't control the margin environment, but we do control how reliably we run. We do control our cost, and we do control how we set ourselves up commercially. So very proud of the team to accomplish what I think was a pretty good second quarter.
Operator: Our next question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays.
Theresa Chen: First, I'd like to start off by revisiting some of the comments made about cost inflation and also your continued reiteration of the laser focus on cost controls. As we think about second half of the year and 2023 CapEx expenses, et cetera, can you provide some incremental color on how exactly you're managing this process, especially in light of costs really increasing across the board, be it energy, labor or materials, et cetera?
Michael Hennigan: Theresa, I'll start, and then I'll let Ray jump in here. We're definitely seeing the impacts of inflation, whether it's materials or anything else along those lines. It's a reality to us. And obviously, everybody can also see the cost of natural gas and where it stands and Mary gave sensitivities during the prepared remarks about where they are. So those are all important things that, again, I put them in the bucket of we don't control that. Obviously, inflation is a big global picture. But what I asked Ray and his team to do is to really focus on areas we do control and try to offset some of these natural higher-cost things that we don't control coming at us. At the end of the day, I mean, he gave a good example of ways that we can do things differently. We can manage our turnaround schedule differently than we've done in the past. We can look at the cost that we're spending in each of those areas differently. It's kind of interesting. For those who know me, I spend a lot of time on the downside, and we've had a pretty upside quarter that we've been talking about. But I think it's good discipline for us to have that reliability mode, to have a good commercial mode, as Rick said, trying to improve ourselves commercially all the time.  And then to your point, Theresa, when inflation comes at you, hopefully, you set a lot of groundwork in your thinking as to how to be disciplined to attack that rather than just complain about it happening because it's going to happen and it's going to happen later times because it's a cyclical business. But Ray and his team have done a very nice job. I'm very proud of where the cost structure of the company has come in the last couple of years.  And now I'll turn it over to him if he wants to add additional color.
Raymond Brooks: Yes. Not much more to add based on what Mike said. We don't control gas prices, labor costs. We don't necessarily control that. The one thing I will elaborate a little bit on is material cost. When we look at a lot of the work that we have coming up in the near future, whether it's Martinez, whether it's work at Garyville, whether it's Galveston Bay and STAR, most of the large equipment purchase material purchases are already on site. So we've got that, that we're able to check that off from both a cost standpoint and reliability of material supply standpoint. So we'll monitor the situations, whether it's labor or gas and adjust accordingly. But the fundamental premise that we're always looking to be the low-cost operator. We'll continue to strive for that.
Theresa Chen: And as a follow-up, right, to your comments about the Martinez project, just -- on the heels of the car public workshop, really with the recent one really scrutinizing crop-based feedstocks in general. What is your view on that as it potentially may impact your assets and feedstock procurement plans, if it does?
Raymond Brooks: Theresa, just one question for clarification. Are you referring to the LCFS plan?
Theresa Chen: Yes.
Raymond Brooks: Okay. My partner is shaking the head, yes. Essentially, what that is, we see that as a potential benefit right now where if we step back a year ago, we kind of looked at LCFS as a $200 a ton level. And most recently, we've been in a $90 a ton. But with CARB's recent announcement, and I'll say the state support for a rescoping plan, their desire is to increase the GHG reduction in the state, which at the bottom line will put more pressure on people to generate credits in the states. So we see that as a potential tailwind on from where we are right now. So what I said to an earlier question, though, is there's a lot of moving parts in the renewable diesel economics between RIN and LCFS and BTC and feedstock costs and all that. And we don't necessarily control them, but we balance between them and we feel pretty good right now definitely how our Dickinson economics are working, and we feel real good going into the Martinez project in total.
Operator: Our next question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.
Paul Cheng: Since you took over as the CEO in the company, I think, over the past 2.5 years the performance has been quite dramatic improvement the and efficiency and everything has improved. From that standpoint, and you have a good system in pay. So should MPC consider or maybe view themselves as a potential consolidator in the refining industry? We still have quite a recommended market given your strong execution in the platform that you have in pace. That's the first question. The second question is that third quarter turnaround cost is high. So that would suggest that 2022, the total turnaround cost is going to be much above the historical average. So is that partly driven by the catch-up spending from 2020 and '21? Or that it is just purely from the timing of the cycle? And should we assume 2023 will trend back down to a more normal level?
Michael Hennigan: So, Paul, first of all, thank you for the compliments. It's really been a team effort over the last couple of years. So appreciate your comment there. As far as the consolidator in refining, again, I never say never, but we have enough of a refining footprint in my mind to be effective. At the end of the day, we are believers that we're going to see these good times and bad times in refining. And as I said previously, my own mantra is I want us to be a good performer in the down cycle. And if we can do that, then I know we're going to have the discipline to be a good performer in the up cycle. So we're concentrating on how we run the business regardless of where the margin environment is. You heard Ray on cost, you heard Rick on commercial initiatives. So I think we're in a good spot there, and I think we have enough exposure. I never say never, but the chances of us increasing our footprint in refining is not high. Instead, I do -- I am a big believer in returning capital as we've been doing, but I'm also constantly looking for opportunities for us. And the word I used a lot more is adjacencies. I like to look for things that are close to our business that can make us more competitive. One of my 3 months is take the assets we have today and make them more competitive. And sometimes that has to do with adjacency build-out. Dave and his team have tried to increase the profitability at Dickinson as an example. And Ray mentioned that our feedstock flexibility there has gotten way better. We have a JV that's coming on. It's going to help us there. We've done some other things to change our feedstock flexibility. So that's probably where I spend more time thinking about how to create value than thinking about overall consolidation. So I hope that answers the first one. I'm going to let Ray take the second one.
Raymond Brooks: Yes, Paul, regarding turnaround and your comment that the third quarter is high. I'll put the caveat in there again that 2022 was back-half weighted. So we ran extremely -- the run rate for the first half was much lower than the run rate for the second half. But if we go back a couple of years, and look at 2020 and 2021, those were lower years from a turnaround standpoint. And yes, when we were in the pandemic, some of the issues we had with wanting to minimize people in our facilities, we did look to lower our turnaround work. So some of the work that we're doing, not all of it, but some of the work is deferred from that period of time. One thing I will tell you that our team really looks at and this is looking at this with -- in conjunction with Rick and Brian's team from the commercial standpoint is we really want to -- we want to do turnarounds at the -- we want to maximize our catalyst cycles. We want to maximize our turnaround cycles. And we also want to try to level the spending as much as possible. So when we look at '22 and '23 and '24, we're looking at optimizing that and trying to level that as to much our capabilities across a period of time. So to answer your question a little bit of deferral from 2021 and a little bit of back half weighted in the second half of '22 versus the first half of '22.
Paul Cheng: Just as a follow-up, should we assume 2023 as a result going to be materially lower in that than the 2022 activity level on the turnaround?
Maryann Mannen: Paul, it's Maryann. We're a little early. As you know, we typically will give you a quarter-by-quarter view of how we see turnaround expenses. So we're a bit early to give you a 2023 guidance. So not ready to call that just yet if that's okay.
Operator: And our last question will come from Jason Gabelman with Cowen.
Jason Gabelman: So you sound pretty constructive on the demand side of things, particularly gasoline, but we've seen cracks over the futures curve come down quite a bit over the past month. Do you think that aligns with what you're seeing on the ground? Or do you think this move is too far, too fast, cracks, I think, over the next year for gasoline or back below where they were prior to the Russia-Ukraine war? And then I have a follow-up.
Rick Hessling: Jason, it's Rick. It's really a great question because you're right, we have seen a lot of volatility on cracks here the last 2 to 4 weeks specifically, and we expect it to continue. I will say, fundamentally, if you look at where inventories are across the energy sector, they're either at or below 5-year averages. We're getting good demand signals from the consumer. And we're seeing really solid feedstock differentials. We're seeing a Brent TI that's $7 to $10. We're seeing backwardation that is only plus or minus $1.  So I would tell you, from a macro perspective, I think there's upside from here, but I'll pause there and be careful because -- it's a very volatile market. Oftentimes, markets go too high and then they correct and go too low. I believe there's some optimism going forward from a macro perspective really because of those key factors that I just laid out for you.
Jason Gabelman: Understood. That's helpful. And then my second question, just on the distribution update. On last earnings call, you kind of discussed that you would provide some sort of distribution framework update in the near future, and it doesn't seem like we've gotten that on this call. So I'm curious if this is kind of in line with what you're envisioning providing at this time if something changed between that last call and this call or maybe just some misunderstanding on our end?
Maryann Mannen: Jason, it's Maryann. Look, you're right. I think one of the things that we said was when we finished our $15 billion share repurchase, we would come back to you with a bit more detail. So I think we've been consistent in that, and hopefully, you see that as well. As a part of that, we said we would reassess the dividend at that particular time. We're hopeful that you see the pace at which we are moving to complete that $15 billion as consistent with that communication. So nothing has changed from our views, again, committed to the $15 billion, committed to a reassessment of the dividend at that particular time. And hopefully, the pace gives you some good indication of where that would be. I hope that addresses it, Jason.
Kristina Kazarian: All right. Sheila, Well, if there are no other questions. Thank you for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. If you have additional questions or want clarification on topics discussed on the call this morning, please reach out anytime and members of our Investor Relations team will be here to help. Thank you for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you again for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-05-03 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MPC First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. My name is Elan and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, and later we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  Please note that this conference is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina you may begin.
Kristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on the website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan CEO; Maryann Mannen CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our SEC filings. With that I'll turn the call over to Mike.
Mike Hennigan: Thanks Kristina. Before we get into our results for the quarter, we wanted to provide a brief update on the macro environment. Year-over-year demand trends have been for the most part positive and the market seems to have reached a post-COVID point of stability. Distillate remains stable, jet continues to recover and gasoline has been more resilient than we would have expected given normal seasonality and recent geopolitical events. The biggest factor outside of our control is changes in global supply and demand. At the end of 2021, Global light product inventories were already tight. Sanctions and boycotts following the Russian invasion of Ukraine have increased supply uncertainties. Product margins have risen to cover the higher cost structure of marginal supply particularly in European regions where there's a high reliance on Russian natural gas. We expect continued volatility in 2022 with an advantage for safe, reliable and low-cost operators. We are focused on optimizing our maintenance schedules to maximize uptime and allow us to do what we can to produce volumes to meet the market demand. As we do this, we remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees, and support the communities in which we operate. With this in mind, we anticipate the US refining system running at higher utilization rates in the coming quarters to meet rising demand. MPC's first quarter results reflect the continued recovery for our products and services, which supported higher margins and higher throughput across regions. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $2.6 billion. We repurchased $2.8 billion in shares in the quarter. And since our last earnings call we have repurchased $2.5 billion of shares. Through today we've completed 80% of our initial $10 billion capital return commitment. I would also like to highlight the strength of MPLX in our portfolio. Last year MPC received $2.2 billion of distributions from MPLX. As MPLX continues to generate free cash flow, we believe it will have the capacity to return significant cash to MPC and its public unitholders. Another milestone in our sustainability objectives was the joint venture agreement with Neste for the Martinez renewable fuels project. This strategic partnership with Neste enhances our Martinez project by leveraging our complementary strengths and expertise. The project will utilize existing process infrastructure, diverse inbound and outbound logistics and is optimally located to support California's LCFS goals, while strengthening MPC's footprint in renewable fuels. Our intended partnership with Neste also creates a platform for additional collaboration within renewables. We believe there will be opportunities to leverage this partnership between two industry leaders, as we pursue our shared commitment to the energy evolution and the goal of leading in sustainable energy. MPC will manage project execution and operate the facility once construction is complete. Additionally, MPLX Logistics assets support Martinez will remain owned and operated by MPLX. We are progressing through the permit process. Contra Costa County certified the Environmental Impact Report for the Martinez project and we're hopeful that the county will shortly provide final approval. We remain excited about the prospects of the project and its ability to deliver low carbon intensity fuels to support California's climate goals. Shifting to slide 5, we focus on challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy. In February, we became the first among our peers to establish a 2030 target to reduce absolute Scope three greenhouse gas emissions by 15% below 2019 levels. The new Scope three target further enhances MPC's disclosures in addition to our existing Scope one and two reduction targets. MPLX also established a new 2030 target to reduce methane emissions intensity from natural gas gathering and processing operations by 75% below 2016 levels. In the second quarter, we will publish our annual sustainability and perspectives on climate-related scenarios reports and provide updates on the progress on the goals we have previously said. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann to review the first quarter results.
Maryann Mannen: Thanks, Mike. Slide 6 provides a summary of our first quarter financial results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $1.49. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.6 billion for the quarter and cash flow from operations, excluding favorable working capital changes was $1.9 billion, which is roughly in line with the prior quarter. During the quarter, we returned $330 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased approximately $2.8 billion in shares, which takes us to $2.5 billion repurchased, since our last earnings call. Slide 7 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA, as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from fourth quarter 2021 to the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially, driven primarily by $175 million decrease from refining and marketing. The tax rate for the quarter was 19%, which reflects the benefits from the public portion of MPLX net income which is not taxable to MPC. Moving to our segment results. Slide 8 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. The business reported strong first quarter earnings with adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.4 billion. Utilization was 91% for the quarter. The sequential decline was driven by lower production, which was primarily the result of unplanned downtime in the US Gulf Coast, where we experienced two unplanned outages. In the beginning of February, the Galveston Bay refinery experienced a citywide power loss which resulted in a complete plant outage. Later in the month, as we were bringing our Garyville refinery back to service, following turnaround activities, a fire occurred near our hydrocracker unit. The unit was repaired and returned to service after about three weeks. Both of these events resulted in approximately $200 million of lost profit opportunity. Margin headwinds in the quarter were a result of the lower capture of 84% that we experienced this quarter and were primarily realized in the Gulf and West Coast.  Operating expenses were lower in the first quarter, primarily due to lower planned project expense as well as a lower average natural gas price coupled with lower energy consumption compared to the fourth quarter. Natural gas prices strengthened during the quarter, averaging over $0.70 in MMBtu higher in March than in January. In April, natural gas prices averaged $6.70 in MMBtu or nearly 80% higher than the average price in 2021.  The current forward strip for Henry Hub is around $8 for the rest of the year, so we would expect natural gas to be a headwind as the year progresses. Natural gas is an input cost for our refineries which historically has represented approximately 15% of our operating costs. Our natural gas sensitivity is approximately $330 million of EBITDA for every $1 change per MMBtu. This equates to a sensitivity of approximately $0.30 per barrel of cost. Distribution costs were lower in the first quarter due to lower product volumes. Turning to Slide 9. We want to directly address the refining and marketing capture this quarter. In the first quarter our capture result was 84%. A few factors drove the majority of the headwinds. Secondary and light product margins impacts associated with inventory builds and associated derivative views to manage volatility and to a lesser extent Gulf Coast refinery outages impacted our yields. Slide 10 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Our Midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter. Slide 11 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the quarter. Operating cash flow was approximately $1.9 billion in the quarter which excludes changes in working capital. Working capital was an approximate $600 million source of cash this quarter, driven primarily by increases in crude oil prices, partially offset by increases in crude and product inventory. In March MPLX issued $1.5 billion worth of long-term debt utilizing a large portion of the proceeds to repay the borrowings under the intercompany loan with MPC. During the quarter, MPC returned $330 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchased approximately $2.8 billion worth of shares. Now 80% complete with our initial $10 billion capital return commitment, we could begin using the $5 billion incremental authorization starting in the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, MPC had approximately $10.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. Last week, we held our Annual General Meeting which concluded our proxy season, we appreciate the engagement from our investors as we work to create shareholder value, focus on sustainability and position ourselves to deliver results in an energy diverse future. Turning to guidance. On Slide 12, we provide our second quarter outlook. We expect total throughput volumes of roughly 2.9 million barrels per day representing 95% utilization. Planned turnaround costs are projected to be approximately $155 million in the second quarter. Expected activity is relatively light and spread through all three regions. As Mike mentioned, our optimized turnaround schedule in the second quarter is expected to allow us to run our assets safely and reliably at high utilization as we remain focused on supplying the products and services markets are demanding. Total operating costs are projected to be $5.50 per barrel for the quarter. Earlier in the call, we shared our natural gas sensitivity the increase we are currently seeing for natural gas costs are reflected in our second quarter guidance, on top of our average baseline $5 per barrel of operating cost. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $170 million. As we look at the impact of inflation on full year results the two areas of focus are wages and certain supply chain inputs. However, we have identified incremental sustainable cost reductions that we are executing against to offset these costs. Notwithstanding all of that, we will continue to identify the headwind from rising energy cost to our refining system throughout the year. Slide 13 provides our capital investment plan for 2022. Once we have closed on the Martinez JV. MPC will receive $400 million and be reimbursed for 50% of the capital spent to-date. After the JV is closed, MPC will be responsible for it’s 50% share of the capital spend going forward and Neste will be responsible for its 50% share. The total cost for the Martinez refinery conversion is still expected to be $1.2 billion and MPC's net cost will be reduced to approximately $200 million. We will provide a more detailed update once we have closed the JV. As a reminder, ongoing growth projects in our Refining and Marketing segment will enhance the capability of our refining assets particularly in the Gulf Coast and also support our focus on growing the value recognized from our Marathon and Arco marketing brands. With that let me turn the call back over to Kristina. 
Kristina Kazarian: Thanks, Maryann. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions. Operator, we'll now open the call.
Operator: Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question today is from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. 
Neil Mehta: Good morning, team. The first question is around utilization. The 2Q guide at around 95% is very good. And so I was just curious if you made any adjustments to the system? And then how are you just thinking about optimizing whether its maintenance or your runs to make sure that you capture the strong current spot commodity environment? 
Mike Hennigan: It's a good question, Neil. Ray, do you want to take that? 
Ray Brooks: Sure. Thanks for the question, Neil. As we've said before, our 2022 turnaround plan was back-end loaded. So you shouldn't look at the first two quarters of the year and extrapolate the spend for the later quarters. But with current demands, we are really seeking to maximize our refining system as indicated by the second quarter guidance. What this really means Neil is that we've looked at some fixed bed catalyst changes that we had planned for the second quarter. We've determined we have a little bit as far as catalyst activity. So we've deferred that out later in the year. So our plan right now is to run really, really full -- run really hard during gasoline season this year. 
Neil Mehta: Very clear. And then it's amazing how far we've come in 1.5 years, isn't it Mike? And I look at your dividend yield now, which is call it 2.5%. And by virtue of the stock having done well, it's compressed to something well below the XLE. How do you think about when it makes sense to have the conversation about raising the fixed dividend again? And do you think recognizing it's at the discretion of the Board. 
Mike Hennigan: Yes. Thanks Neil. It's another good question and we talk about it a lot. I'll let Mary comment on it. 
Maryann Mannen: Hey Neil thanks. Yes. So, hopefully, you saw as we shared our capital allocation framework, we remain very committed to the dividend. As Mike just mentioned to you it's getting a tremendous amount of attention from the management team. It's on our conversations regularly with our Board. We recognize where the yield is. And certainly as we look at the strength particularly in the back half of the year, we'll expect to come back to you here in the very near future with our plans particularly as we are getting through our first round of share repurchase. So, you should expect us to be back to you here shortly on that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.
Doug Leggate: Good morning everyone. So, I don't know if this is for Mary or for Ray, but I think it's really a question around momentum coming into the second quarter. You guys had a lot of downtime as you pointed out. So, I'm trying to get a feel for what the underlying trend has been in this environment? And I guess specifically whether you are continuing to maximize distillate in your system or whether you are given the current relative spreads whether you will in fire pivot more towards gasoline going through the summer? 
Ray Brooks: Sure Doug. Let me take your question as far as distillate production. The answer is absolutely yes. We're working right now to maximize distillate production across our system. Just to give you a little more color on that that's something that we look at daily make sure that we're maximizing the total recoverable distillate, the endpoint and maximizing the front end of the distillate. And then the real thing is just looking at our distillate hydrotreater across the system are full. And so we're doing that across our system. It depends on the toolkit from refinery-to-refinery as far as what that percentage is Gary, but would be the highest since it has a hydrocracker distal hydrotreaters, but whether we have on distillate hydrotreater or three, we're working to maximize across the system.
Mike Hennigan: Sorry Doug I wasn't clear. So, maybe what I was -- thank you for that ray. Maryann what I was really trying to get a handle on was if you could quantify in some way that lost opportunity costs from the first quarter? And what that momentum looks like as you go into the second quarter with the system back up possible?
Maryann Mannen: Yes, certainly Doug. So, for both the Galveston Bay unplanned outage due to the power issue and then again as we talked about Garyville, we've said it's roughly about $200 million in lost profit opportunity, right? ,So that we would have shared with you through the market indicator. I think the other issue there with both of those refineries being down is the fact that as you heard Ray talk about our ability to maximize. We lost the opportunity to increase yield there which obviously, as they come back online and have in the second quarter given the momentum assuming the macro holds as we expected will and cracks, we'll be able to recover that in the second quarter also.
Doug Leggate: Thank you. My follow-up is actually also a Gulf Coast question. Folks, if you don't mind, I'm going to try and explain what I'm looking for here. It seems that Colonial is being underallocated thus the tightness in the Northeast. And from what we can tell, it doesn't seem that that's going to change much given the call on exports for distillate. So, I'm curious if you could share how you're running your system as it relates to potential Colonial allocations versus the coal and exports, because it seems to us the Northeast is going to remain fairly tighter.
Mike Hennigan: Brian, do you want to take that one?
Brian Partee: Yeah, sure Mike. Yeah. So, great question Doug. So, yeah, we definitely see the same dynamic that you're seeing. One of the factors that we look at in shipping barrels all the way up to New York Harbor is the market structure as well. So we've had a really, really strong run up here in the prompt on the front end of the cycle. So that's kind of the bid-ask dynamic ongoing right now with buyers and sellers is the sustainability of that. It certainly is starting to feel a lot more sticky as we look at imports coming into the New York Harbor starting to back off. But in the Gulf Coast, we also have really good placement opportunities not only our book but just across the overall complex, is there's more barrels being demanded in Central and South America. So, I would categorize it Doug is we're in a very, very acute pinch point here in the short-term over those market dynamics. But I think you're reading the tea leaves right as you look forward and think about less Russian exports and European complex starting to find a way to rebalance, the New York Harbor market is one that we expect to be impacted more so than other markets. And as you think about the connectivity via pipe in the Gulf Coast, we do look at that as a forward opportunity more structural and longer term.
Doug Leggate: Thanks guys. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.
Roger Read: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning.
Mike Hennigan: Good morning, Roger.
Roger Read: I guess first, Maryann, I'd like to come back to your comment about potentially hitting into the next tranche of the share repurchase during Q2 full disclosure. We've been modeling a little bit of a moderation in share buybacks. It doesn't sound like there's any reason for us to actually go forward with that. So, I was just curious how you're thinking about the cash flow coming in and the process of transitioning that into the share repo.
Maryann Mannen: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Roger. So, no, you're correct. As I shared on the -- in my prepared remarks, if you look at the pace that we've been buying back, we would expect in the second quarter that we would begin to use that $5 billion authorization. In less than 12 months, we started our program in May of 2021. We've repurchased 80% or roughly $8 billion of our initial $10 billion commitment. If we look at that result through the end of the third quarter -- excuse me, the end of the first quarter. So we end at 331, we repurchased about 113 million shares at an average price of just less than $67 a share. We use part of our process. We use a mechanism that allows us to buy back through blackout periods. And during our quarterly buybacks, there's things that we will evaluate market conditions average daily trading volumes to be exact. So, we don't think anything that you maybe seeing in this quarter is indicative of a lack of commitment here by any means. And certainly, you look at the cash flow for the last several quarters strong and you look at the cash balance that I shared is you about $10.6 billion. So, hopefully that addresses your question.
Roger Read: Yeah. It does. It helps. Thank you. I'm going to ask, kind of the opposite end of the Gulf Coast question on exports. West Coast, obviously, crack has been pretty exceptional. There aren't a lot of places that we typically see products show up on the West Coast from, except for Gulf Coast and occasionally some shipments from Europe. I was curious, as you look across the Pacific, is there anything you're seeing there? We've got lockdowns in some of those countries, so presumably some excess supply. But is there any of that that seems to be coming across the Pacific or any signs that any of that wants to try to come across given the arm?
Mike Hennigan: Brian, do you want to take that?
Brian Partee: Yes. Sure, Mike. Yes. So, Roger, in the prompt, no not really. We're not seeing any fundamental shifts on the West Coast or the Pacific Basin. We, of course, continue to watch very closely at the lockdowns happening over in Asia. But they seem to be moving through a bit quicker than expected. I mean, we've all learned to deal with COVID a little bit differently than we did two years ago. So we're not seeing anything in the prompt. But I might maybe just back up and give you some perspective on exports more broadly, I think, it might be helpful, especially on the front end of the diesel strength that we see across the market. I mean, one of the key drivers obviously is recovery in jet demand. We're seeing that domestically and also around the world. The other thing that doesn't get a lot of discussion in the prompt is. Recall back in 2020, we were moving into IMO and different marine fueling. And that did take place. So there's a new call on demand on the distillate pool from MGO that we believe is also pulling on the distillate pool. But from an overall perspective, as we look at our export program, predominantly on the Gulf Coast, we do have some limited exports out of the West Coast. As we exited the first quarter, we were about 200,000 barrels a day of exports from the Gulf Coast, primarily into Latin and South America. But we did move barrels into Europe and we see that as an increasing opportunity for us going forward. And as we look at the forward book here into 2Q, we're moving from a 200,000 barrel a day-ish program to more in the 250,000 to 300,000 barrels a day. So we are seeing continued strength and opportunity there. We certainly have the dock capacity to be able to manage that increase and we're looking forward to that optimization as we roll into 2Q and beyond. 
Roger Read: Appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Manav Gupta from Credit Suisse.
Manav Gupta: Good morning, guys and very clear from you Mike. My question here is, you did not need a partner at your Martinez facility. You obviously have a lot of cash. So -- but you did seek a partner and help us understand why you picked Neste. Why do you think they're your right partner? And how does this JV develop forward with Neste?
Mike Hennigan: Yes, Manav, this is Mike. Thanks for the comment. When we started this project out, we were very open that there were four parameters that we felt would make a very strong project; competitive CapEx, competitive OpEx, strong logistics, and then ultimately feedstocks. And for a while there we had disclosed where we stood on CapEx and OpEx and logistics, but we had not reached conclusion with Neste. So part of our thinking all along has been, over the long term, not just in the short term that we believed that the partnership between us will hit both of our strengths. They bring a lot to the table with respect to feedstocks. Obviously, we're in that market as well, but we think there's a synergistic effect from their participation. And then, at the same time, as you think about it going forward, we feel really good about capital discipline being an important part of our portfolio and having them come in at the numbers that we've already publicly disclosed was a real good win for us and a real good win for Neste as well. So, we're excited about it, Manav. I will tell you that we're talking about a lot of other stuff together. I think the two parties together can create more value together and we're going to continue to try and see if we can do that.
Manav Gupta: Perfect. My quick follow-up here is, you guys mentioned some of the reasons Gulf Coast was a little weaker. Your Mid-Con assets are very strong and that capture was also slightly weaker. Help us understand what happened during the quarter? And what I'm really trying to get to is, if you look at the cracks and we look at your historical capture rate and we go back to that in 2Q, you could have a massive 2Q Mid-Con earnings. So help us understand some of the reasons 1Q was a little weaker on capture in Mid-Con region. Thank you, so much.
Maryann Mannen: Manav, it's Maryanne. So, maybe just sort of overall, when we think about the capture and then I'll come back to Mid-Con just in general. A couple of elements that really impacted our quarter and that largely our light product and secondary product margins narrowed during the quarter. That's typical as you know in a rising price environment. And then obviously, secondary product margins certainly in this price environment as well. We also have some inventory build in the quarter. And then of course, we use certain derivatives that -- to manage that price volatility. So, there are a few things really that impacted the quarter. Mid-Con was a bit stronger than it was in the first quarter than -- excuse me the second quarter. But that's really a key driver as we look at the capture rate overall for the quarter.
Mike Hennigan: Manav, it's Mike. I'm just going to add, everybody puts a lot of emphasis on capture and everybody knows I'm not the biggest fan of that metric for a lot of the reasons that -- you start to see the volatility that happens in the quarter can down sit around a little bit. And often, we're asked the question, should we plan on about 100% capture. And one of the things I think people should keep in mind is, we're in a different environment than I'll call it normal. If crude was $70 or so somewhere in that range, the impact of secondary products would be a lot different than it crude is at $100, $110 et cetera. So, I think you've got to keep that in mind, when you look at that particular metric. Those factors come into play. Brian mentioned earlier backwardation to Doug's question on the Colonial pipeline, I mean we're seeing some very unusual times, where we're in the -- at the start of the gasoline season, yet we're seeing extreme volatility with distillate cracks where they are, backwardation where it is on the distillate side of the equation. So, all those things come into play and hit that metric. So, I'm always leery, it bounces to one number, but there's a lot of inputs to come in and out to make that number what it is.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Prashant Rao from Citigroup.
Prashant Rao: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. My first one. I wanted to ask on the crude side. Given all the shifts going on and as Russian product moves out of the market, I was curious about how the changes in feedstock availability might affect product deals. And asking that question really in the context of previous questions that have been asked already on this call, about capturing strong distillate crack. But also, when you think going forward, gasoline demand picking up into the summer driving season and how you balance max distillate versus max gasoline production, the impact that any feedstock availability changes could have on that? And maybe how that plays out or through the rest of the year if you kind of play the tape forward?
Mike Hennigan: Rick, do you want to start with the crude outlook?
Rick Hessling: Sure Mike. Yeah, Prashant. So it's an excellent question. There's a lot of moving parts in the world right now, especially around feedstocks. From our perspective though when you look at our PADD II, our PADD II and PADD V presence and the avails that we have at our fingertips, we uniquely have not seen that big of a shift in the avails that would directly affect yields, meaning we're able to get whatever Brian Partee and the marketing team are ordering up. So I'll state that as one. And two other items probably to call out related to feedstocks, Prashant is as you know we are a small. We were a small buyer of Russian crudes. And unless some of our peers, we feel that's a competitive advantage especially in this environment. So with our small presence in that Russian crude category, we have seen very, very little impact. And then lastly just to call out to the SPR release because that is incremental to the feedstock market. A couple of things on that front, we applaud the US government being proactive and for really taking quick action in a meaningful way for a prolonged period of time. We believe that will help not only the US consumer but us as buyers of feedstock. And MPC stand to be in a good position from the releases as we have two of our largest assets in Garyville and GBR really in the backyard of the SPR caverns. So I hope that gives you some color on the feedstocks front. I'll toss it over to Brian for any comments on yields and products.
Brian Partee: Thanks Rick. Yeah. So Prashant just a couple of comments as we think about the gas and distillate dynamic playing out currently. So we're, obviously, at extreme levels. But at the end of the day this is very much a normal operations environment for us as we think about value chain optimization. So whether there's a penny or a dollar differential between gas distillate yet any of the other core products we're constantly optimizing across our plan as we look out forward as we look within the month, within the week, within the day. And ultimately we're running the system to meet the demands of the market. Clearly in this environment the market is sending us a really strong signal for more distillate. Ray mentioned earlier about our distillate hydrotreater running them in max mode. That's to capture the current market structure. We do expect to see a seasonal call on demand as we look forward to the summer driving season as we would typically expect. It's not really present in the market now if you look at the market structure because we're so strong here in the prompt on distillate. But we do expect that to manifest here as we roll into the summer months. But we're constantly optimizing and I just wanted to make that point clear that it feels very normal for our teams to be doing what they're doing to optimize to meet the market demand.
Prashant Rao: Excellent. Thank you both for your answer. A quick follow-up probably for Maryanne. On working cap, overall positive in the quarter. It's pretty volatile. And I think most of us CMG inventories would be a bit of a headwind as you've called out. I was just wondering if you could give some color on how the components within that total working cap bridge shook out in R&M specifically. And then based on your quarter-to-date and current expectations, would it be reasonable to expect working cap at R&M to start to -- or the overall working cap to continue to be a tailwind as we go forward? 
Maryann Mannen: Yes, Prashant. Maryanne, thanks for the question. So as you said working capital in the quarter clearly was a source of cash particularly as we saw crude prices rising. We typically say that each dollar move in the oil price is about a $55 million impact to our working capital, right? So in a rising price environment. You already stated it, we did have some inventory impacts we would expect that not to be repeating in the second quarter when I see inventory impacts our inventory build. One of the other implications as we see prices rising quickly, sometimes it has implications in the receivables because it's not moving as fast as the payable. But in general, it's about a net 20-day payable position. So as long as prices stay where they are, we would continue to see working capital in the second quarter as the tailwind. Obviously, it would reverse as pricing would change.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. 
Phil Gresh: Yes. Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask one follow-up on the buybacks, a slightly different way. The first $10 billion had a big component of Speedway proceeds associated with it and you've obviously extended it now to the $15 billion. The second quarter run rate continues to be at a very high level. And I'm just thinking, as we move forward and we lap the Speedway proceeds component of this. Is there a way you're looking at the more normalized level, of return of capital some kind of framework percent of cash flow or management to some kind of minimum cash balance. Obviously, you still have a lot of cash in the balance sheet. So I'm just trying to think through the moving pieces there. 
Maryann Mannen: Yes, certainly. It's Maryann. So, you're right. We've got a $15 billion authorization in total right? So about $7.5 billion remaining. We stay very focused on that commitment. As you know we shared with you $10 billion, no later than the end of this year. But based on this pace I shared right, we should be complete with that here in the second quarter and working through our $5 billion secondary or second repurchase authorization. With respect to our plans going forward, we're certainly looking at a series of things that we would share with you around how we would think about in a more normalized balance sheet, as we get to that position post right using the proceeds from the Speedway sale. As you know, cash is fungible and we certainly think about it in that way. But we are looking at a series of things as we talk about our capital allocation and would expect to come back to you, with how we would allocate cash between share repurchase, dividend obviously, our growth capital along our lines of our capital allocation framework shared previously. 
Mike Hennigan: Phil, it's Mike. I just want to add that I've said many times that this business is predominantly a return of capital business and a return on capital business. And it's up to us to look at the opportunities that we have from a capital standpoint. I hope the market realizes that we're going to stay very disciplined, looking for solid returns, but we do want to grow earnings. But at the same time, we feel strongly that return of capital is a major component of what we're trying to accomplish here.
Phil Gresh: Sure. Is there a minimum cash balance Maryanne, at these types of oil price levels you're thinking about? Has there been any adjustment to that thinking? 
Maryann Mannen: Yes. We -- I think we shared previously about $1 billion is where we feel comfortable. We've looked at a lot of scenario planning. We had a lot of experience as we looked at sort of some of the toughest volatility and liquidity periods during the pandemic. At one point in time, we had initially talked about potentially holding another $1 billion, but we're comfortable right now that $1 billion should be sufficient for us going forward.
Phil Gresh: Got it. My follow-up is just on R&D fundamentals in particular LCFS prices. We've continued to see some pressure there. A lot of moving pieces on the deficit versus the credits but just any thoughts that you guys have if you kind of dug into this dynamic. 
Brian Partee : Yes, Phil, this is Brian. I'm happy to take that one. So, yes, you're probably looking at the Q4 car release late last week on the overall bank and certainly in Q4 with a tremendous build almost one million credits. The bank is at a pretty high level on the heels of slower demand in Q4 versus Q3 out in the West Coast. So, overall, demand was off about 6%. RD production in imports was up about 9%. So the total pool right now out in the West Coast you're looking at about 8% Bio, 30% R&D. And then the last factor driving the dynamics in the prompt is certainly the electric credit generation, which was up about 5% quarter-on-quarter. Now all that being said, you do have new programs coming into the market Oregon and Washington and Canada. We expect these to exert counter pressure over time to be a different placement option and alternative versus California. But that being said, Carbon is very committed to the program and having a workable program. In the very prompt at the end of the day LCFS is proportionally one of the smaller value drivers in the overall proposition if you think about the D4 value in the BTC and current D4 values in the $1.70 to $1.80 range really are helping to underpin the overall economics. It's a bit ironic if you think about the current environment with eggs and commodities flying up. At the same time, we have low LCFS pricing. We're in that operating environment with Dickinson right now and we're quite happy with what we're seeing on the return side, out of our production out of Dickinson. So I think it bodes well for the resiliency the through-cycle resiliency for RD over the long-term. 
Phil Gresh: Appreciate it. Thank you.
Mike Hennigan : Hey, Brian, Bill that was a pretty good recap for Brian. I'll just add a few points. When we look at renewable diesel, there's -- it's a multivariable equation. There's really four regulatory drivers and Brian talked about a lot of them, along with the flat price or the renewable diesel on the feedstock price. So we're trying to optimize every day at Dickinson today to maximize profitability. I will say the biggest thing that we found success in at Dickinson will take forward to Martinez as the optionality on the feedstock, the ability to pivot to the feedstock that makes the most sense for us. And we've -- at Dickinson we have pre-treatment capabilities off-site that allow us to do that at Martinez that's part of the base CapEx for that plan. So you're right, right now LCFS pressure on that, but there's a lot of things that are within our control that we'll work to optimize. 
Phil Gresh: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. 
Paul Cheng: Hi. Good morning everyone. First, I might wish you a speed in through recovery after your treatment. And also Maryann, I just want to make a request if possible. Some of your larger customers by Exxon share fund they start disclosing the timing the timing benefit or the timing malls. We need to develop different inventory in the presentation or press release in each quarter. So I think all your investors will be grateful here. That's something that you guys will consider. 
Maryann Mannen: Paul, I apologize. Your line is cutting in and out a little bit for us here. Unfortunately, we weren't able to hear that. I did hear you say something that said investors would like to see something in our financials. So maybe we could take that one off-line. And then, if you send us a note. But just so you know just go a little slower because your line is cutting in and out with your question.
Paul Cheng: Okay. Can you hear me okay now?
Maryann Mannen: Yes, that's better Paul.
Paul Cheng: Okay. So let me just repeat my request and I'm saying some of your larger customer Exxon, Shell. They've been disclosing the timing impact from derivative and inventory in their press release. And I think your investors will appreciate that if you guys consider providing those information. And in terms of...
Maryann Mannen: Thanks, Paul. It's Maryann. I'm sorry. I apologize. Please finish your question sorry.
Paul Cheng: Sure. No my question is on three-fold. One when we -- some of your -- one of your competitors has said when the product market is in backwardation that will also impact the margin capture or your ability to realize the pricing on the product screen. So just want to see that how that impact in your system when we are seeing in a backwardation curve. And also that some of your competitors seems like they all have three large inventory or derivative timing losses in the quarter. So Maryanne, you also mentioned that you have some of them. Can you quantify it? Thank you.
Mike Hennigan: Paul, it's Mike. First off, thank you for your comment. It's a multipart question. So I'm going to start and I'll let Brian talk a little bit about structure, but I'm going to repeat a little bit of what I said earlier right? I know everybody likes that metric of capture and if it wasn't for Kristina, I probably would not be a fan of putting it out there, but she keeps saying how important it is for everybody to see that metric. But there are so many things that play into that and one that doesn't normally occur to the extent that it's occurring now is the structure. And the backwardation that we've seen I mean if you look at the screen right now on distillate, since we've talked a lot about distillate, month one to month two backwardation is pretty strong, especially for this time of year. We would never normally think along those lines. So that comes into play as we're moving products and I'll let Brian talk a little bit about it. He mentioned it earlier, as far as a prompt barrel versus something that's got to travel on Colonial. And then Mayor mentioned earlier too is as flat price gets higher and higher you end up with this phenomenon where secondary products don't keep pace with flat price of crude and you end up with an impact there as well. So there's a lot of things hitting. And in this quarter particularly, as Doug mentioned earlier, it's a pretty volatile quarter. January versus February versus March was pretty sizable in volatility as to what we are seeing in the market. So anyway, let me let Brian make a comment towards structure. If you want to add there, Brian?
Brian Partee: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Happy to jump in. Yeah, there's two key elements the way I think about market structure, Paul, to your question. So the first and Mike alluded to this is really in a rising price environment which is the phenomenon that we largely saw in the first quarter. So in a rising price environment, we do see compression. We often call it out obviously in the secondary products, but it's also prevalent in the primary. So the racks effectively do not move up as efficient in a very short period of time. Now they catch up over time. And then you do enjoy the benefit on the back end of that as prices come off they'll go slower. So that's one dynamic timing element. Specific to backwardation though, with the pronounced backwardation in the marketplace here today, the way I think about it, it's effectively transit time. So from the outside looking in, you look at market price point today and I think the way most people run their models is they assume a ratable operation. And that's just not how our system or anybody else's system works. There's transit times, and moving barrels to market, whether they're going on a truck or a pipe or rail, it really doesn't matter. And in a backward market, if you're looking at a ratable program at $2 today and the market has fallen off $0.50 by the time you get it to the market, your actual realization is going to be less. So in that environment, the obvious signal is to sell in the prompt and to not sell out on the curve. And that's really the phenomenon that's been playing out in the marketplace today, particularly on distillate as there's been steep backwardation and a big call to sell more in the problem.
Paul Cheng: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Connor Lynagh from Morgan Stanley.
Connor Lynagh: Yeah. Thank you. Obviously, sustainability of the current environment is a question that most people are struggling with right now, sort of two parts to this question, but I'm going to ask them both at once here. So on the first side, there's obviously been significant disruptions in crude and product markets from events in Russia and Ukraine. Do you feel that what's happening, particularly in distillate markets is directly a result of that, or do you feel that there is a broader issue at play here in either the refinery system inability to raise runs, or substantially higher demand than expected. But the second part of that is, as we move into the summer months, the expectations are that you'll continue to see upward pressure on demand. Do you guys have any concerns, or do you have any sort of framework for thinking about demand destruction? Thanks.
Mike Hennigan: Connor, it's Mike. I'll start. First, to your point, geopolitical events always have an impact on supply and demand in the energy markets, and we're seeing it now in the current situation with Russia and Ukraine. But if you go back in time, much all geopolitical events tend to have some impact to energy. So that's an ongoing thing. The point you made about sustainability that's kind of in parallel to what's happening as well. So people are starting to think about, how do they position the portfolios as we have and put out their goals in sustainability. We're very proud. We think we're leading in that area in certain regards. And at the same time that we're trying to supply the market because, obviously, it's a very tight inventory situation. And as Ray mentioned earlier, we're pushing back some turnarounds. We're trying to maximize production as best we can in the short term. So I mean, at the end of all this counter, my word to the team all the time is, let's worry about what we can control. There's a lot of things out there that, we don't control and we stay attuned to them, but we try and bring it back to what we do control. And in the short term, what we do control is trying to maximize production into the marketplace. And that's what Ray and the team are trying to do.
Connor Lynagh: And then just on the second part of that there, on a risk demand destruction. Are you guys seeing any evidence of that based on your interaction with customers or anything like that, or is there a price at which you think that certain areas of the economy can tolerate the product pricing?
Mike Hennigan: Yeah. Brian, do you want to take that?
Brian Partee: Yeah, sure, Mike. Yeah. So Connor, maybe a couple of comments to build upon what Mike just stated. There is some fundamental support and premium in the marketplace right now, but there's also a degree of uncertainty premium based on what's going on over in the Ukraine. So I wanted to make that point that there's two things that are I think moving the market. One is just the pure fundamentals and I'll get into that in a minute. But there is a uncertainty premium right now that's penetrating the market. From an overall macro perspective though, the outlook is this. We've got really four positives working for us or tailwind. We've got the demand recovery upside coming out of COVID predominantly on gas and jet. We've got very low inventory positions both in the US and around the globe. And then we also have delayed turnaround and major maintenance on a lot of the refining system both domestically and internationally. That too will pressure utilization over the cycle here. And then also as you think about some of the closures that we've had during COVID that also is providing fundamental support to this current market dynamic. Now on the other side of that there's three, I'll call them uncertainties, new additions to refining capacity as an example. I think with supply chain disruptions, labor disruptions, the disruption economically during COVID there's a little bit more uncertainty on new addition refining capacity coming into the marketplace. I mentioned the Russian-Ukraine situation, but that's likely to pull some supply away from the market more so than the other. And then the last thing that's a bit of uncertainty and maybe specifically to your question is the global economic outlook. And certainly whether it's fuel pricing or any goods and services we've had very broad inflation and that's something that we're keeping a watchful eye on and watching the demand dynamics. But all that being said, we think there's right now a slight balance between the headwinds and tailwinds, and it's really difficult to tell which way the market is going to break. But at this 10 seconds it feels like we're pretty balanced and more optimistic than not as we look forward through the next quarter and beyond on overall demand. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Theresa Chen from Barclays. 
Theresa Chen: Hi, there. Thanks for taking my questions. First I wanted to revisit the discussion on regional balances product shifts and the general tightness in Pad 1. I believe years ago you had underwritten some pipeline expansions to move product from the Mid-Con two Pad 1 from that Eastern Ohio market eastward. And at the time, I believe it was a seasonal movement. I was just wondering given the structural tightness that we're seeing PAD1 going forward, is there an ability to eke out additional capacity along that quarter to potentially see additional tailwinds for Mid-Con capture? 
Mike Hennigan: Brian, you want to take that? 
Brian Partee: Yes, happy to Mike. Yes. Theresa to answer your question there's been a number of pipelines in that quarter that traditionally flowed out of the  into the Mid-Con that has since been reversed. And there's been some incremental capacity added here in the last year that also is helping to facilitate that move and ourselves as well as the broader market are definitely taking advantage of that capacity. The ARB is effectively wide open in the current market dynamics today to translate barrels into Western and Central Pennsylvania. We also see actually trucking opportunities. If you think about our position in Eastern Ohio to truck into the pad as far into Western New York as an example for some specialty grades. So yes, the market is working, the market is efficient and we are finding more and more opportunities to move that way. 
Theresa Chen: Thank you. And shifting to the Martinez project, I just wanted to clarify how the JV agreement works in terms of feedstock procurement. Will it be done independently between the two partners or together? And can you just explain more about the synergistic aspects of feedstock procurement there? And also Maryanne, if you could provide how much capital has been spent out of the $700 million budgeted for this year to date? 
Mike Hennigan: Theresa, it's Mike. On the feedstock question, what we said last time is we're going to provide more color on the dynamics around the feedstock and who does what et cetera. But we want to wait until we get the JV closed. We're hoping that is very shortly. As Ray mentioned, we're very close on the permitting side. And then assuming that follows through then we'll get to close JV. And at that time we'll give a little bit more color on the feedstock dynamics.
Maryann Mannen: Theresa, it's Maryann. So to answer your second question I think on the allocation of capital and how it's been spent on the $1.2 billion to date. So in 2021, we've spent roughly just under $300 million that's in 2021. If you look at 2022 in our capital plan, we estimated roughly $700 million in total. So again, depending on how all that project gets outlined for 2022. We would expect roughly half of that. So MPC would have about $350 million of that $700 million in Neste the balance obviously at $350 million. And then obviously that would give us about $200 million plus or minus remaining to complete the project in 2023.
Theresa Chen: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Jason Gabelman from Cowen. 
Jason Gabelman: Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to clarify a statement made earlier just about the backwardation impacts to your margin just the diesel backwardation that you're seeing. Was the point there that on a lot of your barrels that you're actually not receiving the diesel price that we see in the prop month but it's actually the diesel price in the month ahead? And if so, kind of what percentage of your product is exposed to that? And then my second question on the Neste joint venture, you mentioned that there's potential opportunities to grow in the future. And I wonder, if MPC would be open to participating in renewable diesel plants or other biofuel endeavors outside of the US or if your focus is just within the country. Thanks.
Mike Hennigan: Brian do you want to start and I'll fish up.
Brian Partee: Yes. Sure. Yes. Jason as a point of clarification on the backwardation. It's really dependent on the mode of delivery. So it's really about – I made the comment on the cycle time or delivery cycle time. So it's different depending on each market. Have an export as an example has a very long delivery cycle versus a spot sale. And I'll leave it at that. I won't go into the particulars of the percentage of our book and what they're under but it's – every mode of delivery is different. 
Mike Hennigan: Jason it's Mike. I would just add, obviously as sellers were trying to maximize the pump and as buyers people are trying to buy down the curve as a general rule. So you have that yin and yang going on. And like Brian said, every situation is unique. But backward markets tell you that you have tight inventories. That's ultimately what backwardation is all about. It says that inventories are tight and product availability is tight. With respect to your second question, yeah, we're not going to speculate out in time with Neste, but I will tell you that the effort to get to this partnership was long. And the team, Dave Heppner headed it up inside our shop here and worked with the Neste Group for a long period of time. And one of the biggest things that I believe is, important as a result of it was the mutual respect each company have for each other and common goals that were setting for each other. So I think it is a nice platform for us to continue to look for ways that we can do business together. And that was really important for us as we were working through this, very similar to when we've entered other partnerships. One of the things that's, most important to us is, will the partnership endure the test of time. JVs are difficult in general, and you need to be really comfortable at the start of a JV that you feel that you have the right partner. And we feel that way with Neste with respect to Martinez.
Jason Gabelman: Great. Thanks for the answer.
Operator: Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions. I would now like to turn the call back to the speakers, for closing remarks.
Kristina Kazarian: Thank you for your interest in Marathon today. Should you have additional questions or would you like clarification on topics that were discussed this morning, please reach out and the team will be available to take your calls. Thank you for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-02 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MPC Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. My name is Sheila, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.
Kristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investors tab. Joining me today on the call are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO; and other members of the executive team.  We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. References to MPC capital spending during the prepared remarks today reflects stand-alone MPC capital, excluding MPLX.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.
Michael Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina, and good morning, and thanks for joining our call.  Before we get into our results for the quarter, I wanted to provide a brief update on the macro environment. During the fourth quarter, despite the widespread surge in Omicron variant cases, gasoline demand held up well. And on diesel, we're seeing highway trucking volumes continuing to meet or exceed seasonal records. While jet demand reached post-pandemic highs in the fourth quarter, it's still roughly 15% below 2019 levels as business travel remains suppressed, but we expect to see recovery in that this year as well.  When we spoke with you in November, we were cautious about rising COVID cases this winter and the potential impact. Based on the trends over the last few months, we've become less concerned about the pace of recovery in transportation fuels demand. Light product inventories remain tight and U.S. demand continues to recover. We believe that refining margins will be well positioned for 2022.  On the aspects of the business that are within our control, this quarter, we made continued progress on our priorities. Since our last earnings call at the beginning of November, we've repurchased approximately $3 billion of shares. That puts us at approximately 55% complete on our initial $10 billion share repurchase program. Further reinforcing our commitment to return capital to shareholders, we obtained board approval for an additional $5 billion in share repurchase authorization. This brings our total outstanding authorization to approximately $9.5 billion.  Today, we announced our 2022 capital spending outlook. We expect MPC will have approximately $1.7 billion in capital expenditures, with approximately 50% of the $1.3 billion growth capital for our Martinez refinery conversion. Total costs for the Martinez refinery conversion is estimated at $1.2 billion. Approximately $300 million has been spent to date, $700 million for 2022 and $200 million for 2023. This competitive capital cost is driven by the fact that Martinez' assets are conducive to retrofit, and we can leverage existing infrastructure and logistics.  At Martinez, the project reached another milestone as a 60-day comment period for the Environmental Impact Report concluded on December 17, 2021. We remain committed to progressing the conversion to a renewable fuels facility, engineering is complete and we're ready to begin construction. Our plan is to have the first phase start-up in the second half of '22.  We've already sourced some advantaged feedstocks for the Martinez facility and are engaged in negotiations with multiple parties for the balance. Our strategy is multifaceted, including long-term arrangements, joint ventures and alliances, all of which are common in this space. A recent example of our success would be our joint venture with ADM. We're also leveraging existing capabilities that are currently supporting Dickinson to optimize between the 2 facilities. We remain confident in our progress and ability to secure feedstocks for Martinez.  On Kenai, we have been working at sales process since we last communicated. We'll be back to you when we have additional details that we can share. In 2021, we progressed all 3 of our strategic initiatives, and Slide 4 highlights this execution. On the portfolio, we completed the Speedway sale, receiving $17.2 billion of proceeds from that transaction and securing the 15-year fuel supply agreement with 7-Eleven. Our Dickinson renewable diesel facility started up, reached capacity, and we've been successfully optimizing the operation. We made 2 strategic decisions to idle our Gallup refinery and to convert Martinez to a renewable fuels facility. And this year, MPLX produced exceptionally strong cash flow, which provided $2.2 billion of contributions to MPC.  As we look at cost reduction, what began as a $1.5 billion cost-reduction initiative is being embraced by the organization and now a low-cost culture is becoming embedded in how we conduct our business.  Finally, on commercial. While I've been reluctant to share too much, I wanted to highlight a few items that have commercial significance in our portfolio. In March of 2021, we started up the Beatrice pretreatment facility, which processes about 3,000 barrels a day of advantaged feedstock for the Dickinson renewable diesel plan. In December, we closed on a joint venture with ADM, which will provide approximately 5,000 barrels a day of logistically advantaged feedstock for Dickinson when the new soybean crush plant comes online in 2023.  And in January of this year, we successfully started up our Cincinnati pretreatment facility, which will process about 2,000 barrels per day for our Dickinson renewable diesel plant. We converted this facility from its original configuration as a biodiesel plant.  Our team's execution on these 3 strategic priorities builds a foundation for continued value creation and we look forward to sharing updates each quarter as we continue to advance these initiatives.  Shifting to Slide 5. We remain focused on challenging ourselves to leading in sustainable energy. We have 3 company-wide targets on GHG, methane and freshwater intensity than many of our investors and stakeholders know well. In the coming weeks, we look forward to providing an update on our progress against these targets and some of our accomplishments in 2021.  At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann to review the fourth quarter results.
Maryann Mannen: Thanks, Mike. Slide 6 provides a summary of our fourth quarter financial results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $1.27 and adjusted earnings per share of $1.30. Adjusted earnings exclude $132 million of pretax charges related to make-whole premiums for the $2.1 billion in senior notes we redeemed in December. Additionally, the adjustments include an incremental $112 million of tax expense, which adjusts all results to a 24% tax rate.  Beginning with our first quarter 2022 results, we will be reporting our effective tax rate on an actual basis and will no longer adjust our actual results to a 24% tax rate. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.8 billion for the quarter, which is approximately $400 million higher from the prior quarter. Cash from operations, excluding working capital, was $2 billion, which is an increase of almost $300 million from the prior quarter.  Finally, during the quarter, we returned $354 million to shareholders through dividend payments and approximately $2.7 billion in share repurchases. In the 3 months since our last earnings call, we have repurchased approximately $3 billion of shares.  Slide 7 illustrates the progress we have made towards lowering our cost structure over the past 2 years. As we think about our strategy on cost structure, I want to emphasize a few things. We will never compromise the safety of employees or the integrity of our assets. And we are committed to ensure the current cost reductions are sustainable, even during periods of general cost pressures.  Since the beginning of 2020, we have been able to maintain roughly $1.5 billion of cost reductions that have been taken out of the company's total cost. Refining has been lowered by approximately $1 billion. Our refining operating costs in 2020 began at $6 per barrel. While we were able to finish 2021 with a full year operating cost per barrel that was $5. Additionally, midstream was reduced by $400 million and corporate cost by about $100 million.  However, regardless of the margin environment, our EBITDA is directly improved by this $1.5 billion. This improvement is expected to make the company more resilient in future downcycles, while having more bottom line profitability and upcycles.  Turning to Slide 8. We would like to highlight our financial priorities for 2022. First, sustaining capital as we remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets, protect the health and safety of our employees and support the communities in which we operate. Second, we're committed to the dividend. As we continue to purchase shares, we will reduce the share count and increase the potential of returnable cash flow.  Third, we continue to believe this is both a return on and return of capital business and we will continue to invest capital where we believe there are attractive returns. In traditional refining, we're focused on investments that are resilient and reduce cost. In renewables, current spend is primarily focused on our Martinez renewable fuel conversion. We believe that share repurchases can be used to meaningfully return capital to shareholders.  In order to successfully execute the strategies guided by these priorities, MPC needs a strong balance sheet as a foundation. We continue to manage our balance sheet to an investment-grade credit profile.  Moving to another key focus area. Slide 9 highlights our focus on strict capital discipline. Today, we announced our 2022 capital outlook for MPC. MPC's 2022 capital investment plan totals approximately $1.7 billion. As we continue to focus on strict capital discipline, our overall spend remains approximately 30% below 2019 spending levels. Sustaining capital is approximately 20% of capital spend, underpinning our commitment to safety and environmental performance.  Of the remaining 80% for growth, approximately 50% of this $1.3 billion supports the conversion of Martinez into a renewable fuels facility. The remainder of the growth capital is for other projects already underway. At our refineries, the growth capital is primarily for projects that enhance returns at MPC's large coastal assets with a focus on completing Galveston Bay STAR project as well as smaller projects at Garyville and Los Angeles. Going forward, we expect growth capital will continue to have a significant portion for renewables and projects that will help us reduce future operating cost.  Slide 10 shows the reconciliation from net income to adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the third quarter 2021 to fourth quarter 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was higher quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by a $354 million increase from Refining & Marketing. The adjustment column reflects $132 million of pretax charges for make-whole premiums for debt redemption during the quarter, which has also been excluded from the interest column.  Moving to our segment results. Slide 11 provides an overview of our Refining & Marketing segment. The business reported continued improvement from last quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion. Fourth quarter EBITDA increased $354 million when compared to the third quarter of 2021. The increase was driven primarily by higher refining margins in the U.S. Gulf Coast and West Coast regions.  U.S. Gulf Coast production increased by 14%, recovering from storm-related downtime last quarter and solid margin per barrel increased 31% due to higher export sales and higher sales of light product inventory. The West Coast margin per barrel increased 40% associated with increased demand and refinery outages. Utilization was 94% for the quarter, slightly improved from the third quarter. The higher Gulf Coast throughput was offset by lower throughput in the Mid-Con for planned turnaround activity.  Operating expenses were higher in the fourth quarter, primarily due to higher natural gas prices. There was also higher routine maintenance and planned project expense. Additionally, we saw natural gas prices softened during the quarter, coming off highs in the $5 to $6 range and ending in the $3 to $4 range.  Slide 12 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the third quarter of 2021. Our Midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter.  Slide 13 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow was approximately $2 billion in the quarter. This excludes changes in working capital and also excludes the cash we received for our CARES tax refund in the quarter, which was approximately $1.6 billion source of cash and is included in the income tax part of the chart. Working capital was an approximate $1.3 billion source of cash this quarter, driven primarily by reduction in crude and product inventory.  As we announced on last quarter's call, MPC redeemed $2.1 billion in senior notes in December. Under income taxes, we received approximately $1.6 billion of our CARES tax refund in the fourth quarter. We also used about $300 million to offset against our Speedway tax obligation. There is about $60 million of the refund remaining, which we expect in the first half of 2022. We paid approximately $1.2 billion for our Speedway income tax obligation. All that remains is about $50 million of state and local taxes.  With respect to capital return during the quarter, MPC returned $354 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchased approximately $2.7 billion worth of shares. At the end of the quarter, MPC had approximately $10.8 billion in cash and short-term investments.  Slide 14 provides our capital investment plan for 2022 which reflects our continuing focus on strict capital discipline. MPC's investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals approximately $1.7 billion. The plan includes $1.6 billion for Refining & Marketing segment, of which approximately $300 million or roughly 20% is related to maintenance and regulatory compliance spending.  Our growth capital plan is approximately $1.3 billion, split between renewables and ongoing projects. Within renewable spending, the majority is allocated for the Martinez conversion. Ongoing projects in our Refining & Marketing segment will enhance the capability of our refining assets, particularly in the Gulf Coast and also support our focus on growing the value recognized from our Marathon and ARCO marketing brands.  Also included is approximately $100 million of corporate spending to support activities we believe will enhance our ability to lower future costs and capture commercial value.  This morning, MPLX also announced their 2022 capital investment plan of $900 million. Their plan includes approximately $700 million of growth capital, $140 million of maintenance capital and $60 million for the repayment of their share of the Bakken Pipeline joint venture's debt due in 2022.  On Slide 15, we review our progress on our return of capital. Since our last earnings call at the beginning of November, we have repurchased approximately $3 billion of company shares. This puts us at approximately 55% complete on our initial $10 billion repurchase program commitment, leaving approximately $4.5 billion remaining. We remain committed to complete the $10 billion program by the end of 2022. And as we are ahead of pace given our recent repurchases, could foresee completion sooner than initially planned.  As part of our long-term commitment to return capital, we announced an incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization today, increasing our recent repurchase authorizations to $15 billion. We plan to continue using open market repurchase programs, although all of the programs we have previously discussed remain available to us to complete our commitment. We intend to use programs that allow us to buy on an ongoing basis, and we will provide updates on the progress during our earnings call.  As we have said many times, we believe a strong balance sheet is essential to being successful in a competitive commodity business. It's the foundation allowing us to execute our strategy. Slide 16 highlights some of the key points about our balance sheet.  MPC ended the year with approximately $10.8 billion of cash and short-term investments. But longer term, we believe that we will need to maintain about $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Additionally, we will always ensure that we have enough liquidity to endure market fluctuations.  Currently, we have a $5 billion bank revolver that is undrawn. We continue to manage our balance sheet to an investment-grade profile. At year-end, MPC's gross debt-to-capital ratio is 21% and our long-term gross debt-to-capital target is approximately 30%. As we continue to execute our share repurchase program, we will see that ratio increase. After the recent redemption in December, our current structural debt is approximately $6.5 billion, and we do not have any maturities until 2024.  Turning to guidance. Slide 17, we provide our first quarterly outlook. We expect total throughput volumes of roughly 2.9 million barrels per day. Planned turnaround costs are projected to be approximately $155 million in the first quarter. The majority of the activity will be in the Gulf Coast region. Our 2022 planned turnaround activity is back half-weighted this year.  Total operating costs are projected to be $5.10 per barrel for the quarter. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $170 million.  With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.
Kristina Kazarian: Thanks, Maryann. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions. And with that, operator, we'll open it to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Doug Leggate: Mike, Maryann, I think this is the first time you've spoken, so happy new year. Great start to the year with your earnings. But I got a couple of questions, if I may. The first one, Maryann, is maybe for you on the dividend policy going forward. And I guess the way I want to frame the question is when you're done with your buybacks, the absolute dividend burden is going to be quite a bit lower than it is today and quite a bit lower than the distribution you get from MPLX, your share. So what are you thinking -- with the yield now down around 3%, what are you thinking in terms of the appropriate payout ratio, if you like, or dividend policy going forward? How should we think of that evolving?
Maryann Mannen: So maybe a couple of things. First, as you've seen from the capital framework that we've been sharing this morning, the dividend obviously remains an important piece of the capital allocation strategy. As you look, you're right, as we continue to complete our capital program -- share repurchase program, the amount of capital that's allocated towards the dividend, obviously, will be declining. We think that's somewhere -- if you look at the current dividend versus where it's been, that's somewhere in the range of $200 million to $300 million right now.  We continue to think that share repurchase in the short term is an appropriate allocation of that. As we get to what we would consider to be a capital structure in a more normal environment, meaning we complete that share repurchase, we'll continue to evaluate the timing of any dividend change. But again, when you look at the difference in that dividend payment, we certainly think that we're providing that allocation in an appropriate manner.
Michael Hennigan: Doug, it's Mike. Let me just add a little bit to Mary's comments. One of the things that I think may be getting misconstrued is we are still committed to the dividend, as Mary just said. However, we're in a little bit of a different situation than normal operating cash flow. I mean we're sitting with about $11 billion on the balance sheet in a large return program. And as you just saw, we did about $3 billion since the last call.  So as far as order of magnitude, we're committed to returning capital. But right now, the size of the share repurchase relative to the dividend is just out of proportion until we get to a more normal balance sheet. So I don't want people to think we're not committed to the dividend. We are going to evaluate it, as Mary just said. But right now, we're putting a lot of the effort in the return into the buyback program. I hope that helps.
Doug Leggate: It does. It's just that you've got a lot of headroom to do all of the above, I guess. And I just was curious given the share price, the yield is now back at a sub-average level, I guess, you could say. So a lot of seems has a lot of headroom there, but thank you for that. My follow-up is maybe a little bit of a technical question, and I don't know if Ray is on, but -- or if one of you guys want to try this, but what I'm really interested in is we saw some structural changes 20 years ago. That reset the mid-cycle refining earnings capacity, if you like, with alkylate and with mismatch of demand supply and so on.  And what we are real interested in is what's happening with natural gas between The U.S. and Europe and the structural advantage that puts on U.S. refiners. And I'm wondering if you've given any thought to that in terms of whether you believe that if what we're seeing in Europe, let's say, or internationally currently could be another structural tailwind for realized refining margins for U.S. refiners and Marathon specifically.
Michael Hennigan: Doug, it's Mike. Let me -- I'm going to put that over to Brian on products and Rick on crude to give you a little bit of color. It's a good question. Obviously, that dynamic is occurring in Europe. So why don't you start, Brian?
Brian Partee: Yes, sure. This is Brian. Great question. So I think the short answer is too early to tell, but I think you're on to it. Maryann mentioned in her prepared comments, the volatility we've seen in natural gas over the last several months. We've gone from $3 gas to $6 down to $4, now we're peaking back up to 5. So directionally, yes, very supportive relative to the cheap natural gas position we have that we believe is certainly sustainable over the long term in The U.S. But ultimately, these are long-term decisions for anybody that has that exposure overseas to higher natural gas prices. But yes, directionally, we do see it as supportive. It's just a little bit too early to tell. But if we stay in this $5 to $6 gas range, it will absolutely put pressure on those that have that exposure, and we'll look for upside. But it's one of many variables.
Doug Leggate: I'm curious, have you seen any shift in imports coming from Europe as a consequence of that cost disadvantage? And I'll leave it there.
Brian Partee: Yes. No, from an import perspective, not yet. I mean, that's one thing that we're looking at, both the fundamental balance in the Atlantic Basin looking at opportunities to actually export into Europe. But the ARPS has been pretty stable. No big immediate changes here in the short term, but we're watching it very closely.
Rick Hessling: Doug, it's Rick. I'll just add on a few more comments. With Europe at $30 an MMBTU or thereabouts, there's no doubt a structural advantage. But with that being said, what we're seeing right now out of Europe is just slight run cuts at best because their margins are covering or higher up OpEx costs. So we haven't seen the impact substantially yet. If it continues, I think that's another story. So as Brian said, it's still a little bit too early to tell.  But then I'll also leave you with a couple of wild cards that we're watching closely, which could exasperate it as well in terms of nat gas costs. It's the Russian-Ukraine conflict, which we're all well aware of. And then ultimately, it's Nordstream 2 and what is the result that comes out of that. So a tailwind could get much better depending on how either 1 of these 2 plays out. It's just a little bit too early, Doug.
Operator: Our next question will come from Prashant Rao with Citigroup.
Prashant Rao: I wanted to switch to talking about renewable diesel a bit. But first, on Martinez, could we dive in a little bit to the CapEx that you've outlined specifically, what all is getting completed this year? And I guess related to that, does that sort of tie into the utilization level we see for the guidance on the West Coast? And when you talk about back half weighted turnarounds as well, is that sort of impacting that too? And I have a follow-up.
Michael Hennigan: Ray, can you give a Martinez update?
Raymond Brooks: Yes, sure. Thanks for that question. And if I start talking about Martinez and before I get into the CapEx, I kind of want to talk about where we're at with the project in regards to permitting. And so as we covered before, we completed the public comment period in December. And right now, over the last 1.5 months, we've been working really hard with the [indiscernible] to address all questions and get the permit to the finish line. And so we're really targeting the end of Q1 to have the sequel permit done and be ready to put shovels in the ground.  And with that, what I want to emphasize is we're absolutely ready to do that. Our engineering is complete for the first phase. It's nearly complete for the backup few phases. We have the equipment on site. We have the pipe, we have the pilings. We have the vessels that we need to do this project. So we're ready from that standpoint.  Now as far as what's in the project, I've talked a lot over the past couple of calls about why Martinez makes sense. And I've talked about 3 hydroprocessing units, 2 hydrogen plants. I've talked about the Cogen power generation on site. As far as what we're spending the money on, what I want to emphasize is a couple of key things in that regard. One is pretreatment. This project is really driven by -- we want to be able to process all the renewable feedstocks, and we want to be able to pretreat them ourselves.  So we've invested in pretreatment capabilities. We're really excited about the technology that we've chosen. We feel it is a good technology that we're spending money on that will have a lower CapEx, have sustainability advantages. So we feel good about that. And then the other thing I want to emphasize is we're investing a lot in logistics. Why Martinez? Martinez has scale, Martinez has optionality. And so we have optionality on truck, rail, pipe and water as far as bringing feedstocks in and products out. So I just wanted to give a little bit of color on, hey, what we're spending money on in 2022.
Prashant Rao: The follow-up -- I'm sorry, go ahead.
Michael Hennigan: Yes, Prashant, it's Mike. I just want to add a little bit more color to what Ray said. So if you back up, the way I've looked at this project from the beginning is do we have competitive CapEx? Do we have competitive OpEx and logistics and ultimately, feedstock to make it work? So Ray has just talked a little bit about the CapEx, and we finally have disclosed that number. Part of the reason I wanted to explain that we hadn't disclosed it up until this point is because we've been working the feedstock side of the business pretty detailed and that's still in progress. So hopefully, we'll give more updates as time goes by. But we're at a point as we've negotiated with a lot of different counterparties that we felt comfortable now that we can disclose the CapEx because that's been part of all the discussions and all the negotiations that have occurred on that side of the ledger. So I think us disclosing that now, Ray, trying to give you a little bit more feel for -- we put some CapEx in that we believe is going to give us lower operating expenses over time. And I think the whole puzzle is kind of coming together is the way we thought of the project: competitive CapEx, competitive OpEx, good logistics, as Ray just mentioned. And then like I said, we're still working on that feedstock side, but we're pretty far along in what we're trying to accomplish there.
Prashant Rao: That's super helpful. And I wanted to pick up on the feedstock side and specifically the pretreatment that you highlighted. You highlighted that Beatrice that came up last year. You've got the Cincinnati project now. Pretreatment is a big part of Martinez, it sounds like. So kind of a 2-parter. One is just more broad big picture, what we're seeing in a world right now where the differentials between feedstocks are trying to -- are getting tighter. Some of that is -- could be temporary based upon timing of projects coming online and logistical issues, but some of it might be related to some shifts going on, and I think that's a bit of a debate shift going on in reflecting CI scores.  So I guess this is sort of a bigger philosophical question is the value of pretreatment or how do you pivot on what your pretreatment do or what you want to scope out as you think about how feedstock differentials might change as the supply ramp globally but specifically within The U.S. goes up. And I'll leave it there.
Michael Hennigan: Yes, Prashant, it's Mike. I'll start off and then I'll let Brian or Ray jump in if they'd like to. One of the things people have asked me about, can you talk a little bit about commercial stuff. And I've tried not to go into a lot of detail there. But the point you're making has got a little bit of portfolio and a little bit of commercial side to it. Long term, I think the point you're making is markets equilibrate and you'll see some competitiveness and we agree with that. It's part of the reason that we stress test Martinez.  But in the short term, we've got Dickinson up and running and you got to be fast in this business. You got to be quick. And I think what you're seeing through the team effort here because it's our portfolio and it's part commercial was to get this Beatrice plant up and running, get 3,000 barrels a day of really advantaged feedstock there, get a couple of thousand barrels a day of converting the biodiesel plant.  So it's partly the portfolio or the engineering team working with the commercial team. To your point, right at the moment, those feedstocks are advantaged and getting pretreated. Long term, you're right. The competitiveness will change over time. There will be more equilibrium. But at the same time, as Ray talked about, we felt having full pretreatment at Martinez was still going to be a good thing for us in the long term.  And the technology that we pick there, so there's a lot of important thoughts from an engineering and technical side that also married to what we want to try and achieve commercially. And like I said, hopefully, we'll be able to give you a little bit more color on feedstock as time goes by. But we felt it was a good enough time to explain what the CapEx number is and how we're feeling about it.
Prashant Rao: That's super helpful.
Operator: Our next question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta: Two questions for me. The first one is on refining. Capture rate, as you show on Slide 22, was very strong, 116% this quarter. And I recognize capture rates are very hard metrics to try to calibrate. But on Slide 23, you help us think through some things like other margins. So Mike, I guess the question for you is, how much of this do you think is a carryforward versus a onetime dynamic? And are some of the things that you talked about around optimizing the commercial side of the business and getting your costs down starting to show up in that capture rate number.
Maryann Mannen: Neil, it's Maryann. Let me try to give you some color there, and then I'll pass it back to Mike. So I appreciate the comments. In the quarter, as you saw, about 116% capture overall. We had a couple of things happening in the quarter. One, in general, inventory was a tailwind for us this quarter. We have inventory impacts period-to-period. You can actually look at the third quarter as an example of that. Capture was about 100%. We benefited from crude timing impacts from running some advantage third quarter inventories purchased and we ran that in the fourth quarter. And we had some seasonally strong marketing margins. So historically, I think we have been talking about a baseline for our refining capture in and about a range of 95%. And while there's volatility in the quarter -- quarter-to-quarter, we're looking right now, we think, just based on this commercial execution that we've been talking about that our baseline is more like 100%.  I'll make a couple of comments, and then again, I'll pass it on to Mike, just something specific in the quarter. We did benefit in the fourth quarter from an adjustment $62 million for the full year adjustment for the 2021 RINs. That's pretty ratable quarter-by-quarter, so 1/4 of that belongs in the quarter. And we also did see a benefit of about $39 million for the Dickinson LCFS adjustment for lower CI in the quarter. So there are a few things that benefited the quarter overall. And I'll pass it back to Mike.
Michael Hennigan: Yes, Neil, I'm going to add, but it looks like Brian wants to jump in and want to comment, and then I'll finish up.
Brian Partee: Yes, Neil, thanks for the question. This is Brian. So just commercially, we are hyper-focused on optimization and improvement. I think we've been pretty transparent and clear about that as one of our 3 key strategic initiatives. So just a bit of color. The Gulf Coast was an area here over the last quarter where we saw some nice, marked improvements in our operations commercially that help to drive a better capture.  Really fundamentally, what's helping with that for us and our business is better alignment of the team. We're getting the right resources and getting them focused in the right areas and aligned efficiently. In a couple of examples, in the Gulf Coast, just highlighting that as an example, it's really helping us drive our marketing book and our growth in and along the Gulf Coast.  And then our export expansion as well. We've been really focused on our expansion of our export book. And specific to our export book, we're really focused on more delivered cargoes. So we're moving further down the value chain, higher margin capture. So we've had a lot of success in growing that line of our business.  And then lastly, we did take in a position in the Caribbean in the fourth quarter that allows us to optimize supply both internationally and domestically, particularly into Florida as well as developing blending program in and along the Caribbean. So I just wanted to provide some color and some examples of things that we're doing to help advance our commercial initiatives.
Michael Hennigan: And Neil, it's Mike. One of the things -- happy with the progress that Brian and the team are making in some of those areas. But I do want to stay on the record that I'm not a big fan of this metric. I've said that many, many times. And the main reason is because there's other things that can drive the metric in different directions. The spread between light products and heavy products is the most dominant feature in it.  And I just want to remind people that you can have a low capture rate if you're still making a lot of money or you could have a high capture rate and not be making as much. So you got to be a little careful or you got to dig into the details because the metric itself has some flaws. Now with that said, am I glad that we're making incremental progress? Sure. I think all things being equal, we want to see the number up higher than not.  But I just keep want to caution, Kristina is tired of me saying this to her all the time that there's other factors that influence that metric that can mislead or misalign some of the activities going on. But overall, as Mary said and Brian said, good things happen should drive that in the right direction. But I just want to keep putting that caution out.  I'm still challenging Kristina and our team to come up with a better way to do it. We haven't come up with that yet, but we're working on it because I think we may be able to come up with something that might be a little better. But in the meantime, I know everybody tracks this one and is used to looking at it. So it is what it is, and I just wanted to make sure I had that caution on it.
Neil Mehta: It's been clear about that and a lot of good perspective there. The follow-up is back on Martinez. Thanks for the $1.2 billion. Is there a way to tie that into an EBITDA number, either with or without the blenders tax credit? Or is it still too early for you guys to come out there with an EBITDA number that we can then ultimately tie back into returns?
Michael Hennigan: Yes, Neil, it's a good question. It is still a little early. What I was saying earlier is we're still actively engaged in some feedstock discussions. So we can't go to that disclosure. We got to the point with our discussions that capital is now very open with everybody, so we thought we could disclose it. So that's where we are in the process. You saw in our prepared remarks, we have secured some feedstock. We're still in some discussions, but still a little premature.  But we were thinking that we could at least put the capital out there and that would give some color to some of the questions that people have been asking us. And I know it's taken a little bit of time, but part of it is we couldn't disclose it while we were still in some level of those negotiations. Now that we're past that, we can disclose that piece, but we still have some activity going on.
Operator: Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.
Roger Read: Congratulations on the quarter. Maybe to kind of take up where part of the answer to Neil's question left off. Yes, you made the comment, Mike, about capture doesn't tell the whole story. And obviously, one of the big things is the reduction in costs. So as we look at the conversion of Martinez, the closure of Gallup, we think about that in terms of the impact on costs, and we think about that as an impact on capture. What else should we be thinking about is going on? And is there any possibility you can quantify across those items to help us understand what we ought to consider as sustainable and what we ought to consider as maybe just a product of current market environment?
Michael Hennigan: Yes, Roger, it's a good question. What I'm trying to say is the metric can be driven by different factors other than what we're doing than things we have control of. Brian was mentioning some of the things that we have control of that we think are increasing our commercial capture. What I was trying to say, sometimes the spreads themselves can drive that metric in a different direction.  So the only thing I was trying to say is the metric itself has some good parts to it. It has some bad parts to it. And you usually have to drill down to really understand what's happening. Now like I just said, I'm happy with the commercial team making progress. For apples-to-apples, we want to see that number higher. But I just want to continue to caution people that there's some flaws in the metric or some other things that drive it, just like Mary said in her remarks.  So part of, like you said, cost and everything that we're doing on that side, is still a high focus. We have a lot of focus, as Brian said, on the commercial side of the business, trying to be a little reluctant to give a lot of details in that regard because of the competitive nature of it, but also listening to people saying, "Hey, can you give me some color what's going on there? So we tried to pick a few examples that we could give you a little bit of the way we're thinking about it. And hoping it helps, but I'll leave it there.
Maryann Mannen: One other small add to make, maybe as you're thinking about that cost and sustainability -- the sustainability of the cost reductions, keep in mind that as we are in the middle of this Martinez conversion, there are current operating costs included in that capture rate that you're seeing now. So those operating costs to complete the conversion, the day-to-day operating costs are already embedded in that capture rate as you're seeing it today.
Roger Read: Okay. Yes. That's -- so -- well, I'll say the follow-up on that for another time. I guess the other question I had on the commercial side, obviously, it's been a focus of the company. You had a change in leadership there and I was just curious how you see the commercial ops going forward and how that should work its way out. .
Michael Hennigan: Yes, Roger, it's Mike. I'll take that again. I would say, in general, you're referring to that we made a change at the CCO level. I do want to say, Brian was a contributor this year. He's a nice guy and a very smart guy. And commercial team has been doing some really good stuff. But ultimately, we weren't in sync on philosophy and expectations, so I thought a change was necessary.  But I don't want to diminish the progress that the team has made. I don't want to diminish Rick and Brian who are on the call here today and their teams are -- I love Brian's word, hyperfocused. I was glad to hear that. We think there is opportunity for us in this area. And like I said, we had a little bit of philosophical and expectation differences that I just thought it was -- is warranted to make a change rather than try and get that back on track. It was warranted to make a change.  But I'm happy with the progress that's been occurring. I think we have clear line of sight of some other opportunities for us. I know we frustrate people by not giving a lot of detail there, but hopefully, you'll just continue to see it in results, and we'll try to think of ways and opportunities that we can explain some things that will help you guys understand the business from our perspective a little better.
Roger Read: No, I appreciate that, and don't worry about it. We'll make sure to keep you frustrated from questions coming from the sell side. .
Operator: Our next question comes from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse.
Manav Gupta: Mike and team, my question is a little bit around the CapEx of Martinez, it's about 1.2. If my math is right, that's putting you about that $1.6 or $1.65 a gallon with a very good pre-treat. And what we are generally seeing out there is people who are trying to build really high-class pre-treats are hitting that cost of about $3.25 to $3.50. So if you can talk about your comfort level with that CapEx, what is allowing you to do it at about 50% of what others are doing? And what role has already operations at Dickinson where you are already making R&D? What are the learnings from there, which are basically kind of, I think, allowing you to bring this facility on at a highly discounted CapEx per gallon basis?
Raymond Brooks: Manav, this is Ray. Let me take another shot at talking about Martinez and your math is right. It's about $1.60 a capacity gallon for that, which we feel good about compared to the industry and why we are excited about this project. As far as why that's the case, it gets back to the toolkit that's already sitting there at Martinez, 3 hydrocrackers, hydro treaters, 2 hydrogen plants and a Cogen facility.  So what we're investing, the big thing that's new is investing in the pretreat system. The rest that we're doing is we're investing a lot in connectivity, piping to get all those units to go to the right places and logistics from that standpoint. So largely, the reconfiguring of Martinez allowed us to have a very capital-efficient project.
Michael Hennigan: And Manav, it's Mike. I just want to reemphasize something that's important and give Ray and his team some credit for. I mean, at the end of the day, we spend a lot of time thinking about this CapEx. And ultimately, to your point, it's a good number, but we actually had a lower capital case that we thought would have a higher operating expense, as Ray mentioned. And we chose to spend a little more capital.  So trying to bring a little more commerciality into the decision to assist the technical side of it, I think, has played out really well for us. Ray hasn't talked a lot about it, but the technology that we picked there was very important. And offline, we can talk to you a little bit about that, but that's a very important part of how this project has played itself out, choosing to go a little higher on CapEx even though it's a pretty good rate, just so that we get lower OpEx.  It was an important part of the discussion. The sustainability of the project and the way we set up that part of the project, we're pretty happy about. So I give -- Ray and his team connected to the commercial side of it, that's the important part that we're trying to emphasize today that it's not just engineers picking [indiscernible] there's a connectivity that has to occur between those that makes the project better.  So even in an example, and I know you're thinking, hey, it's a good number. We actually had a case that was a lower number, higher OpEx, and we went with this case because we thought it was a better long term to have that OpEx lower. And like I said, the technology and the sustainability and the carbon output of it, I think, has turned out to be really good. So we're happy to disclose it. And offline, we can give a little bit more color around some of those details.
Manav Gupta: Perfect. And Mike, my follow-up question, obviously, here is when you took over, the focus kind of changed internally to optimization, cost cuts and everything is falling in place. I mean you're almost generating $1 billion post dividend free cash on a quarterly basis. So I'm just trying to understand, when you start looking at this kind of cash level buildup, even with your buybacks, like what's the -- like what is the optimum debt level? Or is this a dry powder where you could actually go out and make a strategic acquisition at some point given the way the cash is building on the balance sheet now?
Michael Hennigan: So I'll let Mary talk about the balance sheet and debt, obviously, an important part, but I'll give you a big picture look, is part of the way we looked at this business is we want all of our assets to generate free cash. So you're pointing out something that we've been working on over the last couple of years. You make portfolio adjustments, you adjust commercial activity, do all those things so that you end up in a position where we like -- where we are right now.  And it was mentioned earlier, we haven't abandoned the dividend. We've kind of put that a little on hold as we return a lot of capital via share buybacks. But I'm still a big believer in you got to be in this position, so you got to put the business in this position so that you can then have really good discussions about return of capital and return on capital.  We do want to grow the business. We've been very selective in where we're going to put some of that money and we'll continue to be that way. And when we are selective, we'll have cash that we'll return to shareholders. When we are selective, and we think we have a good investment, we're going to put it there. And we're going to continue to challenge all of our teams to tie the technical side of this business to the commercial side of this business, such that at the end of the day, we put ourselves in a position where we have the choices that you're talking about.  So we have some thoughts going forward. I don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but at the same time, I'm happy that the team has embraced the concept, the philosophical concept of putting ourselves in a position where all assets contribute free cash, will generate that -- as you know, I've said many, many times, we don't control the market. So we're a pricetaker in a large part of refining. So that will make some of our business volatile.  And then we want to have the balance sheet in a good position as well. So I don't know if Mary wants to comment on that. But at the end of the day, I think you pointed out the good end game, which is generate a lot of cash in the business, have some flexibility and then make some good decisions on what's the best way to create value.
Maryann Mannen: It's Maryann. I'll just add maybe a few additional comments. We've been looking over the last several quarters and talking about the balance sheet. We continue to say that, that investment-grade profile for us is critically important. That means we need to stay in and around gross debt-to-capital range of about 30%. We're below that, as I shared with you today. But keep in mind, we've got $9.5 billion of share repurchase remaining and all other things being consistent as we continue to do that share repurchase, right?  We'll see that ratio improve. We've done quite a bit of work to ensure we've got the right liquidity. We'll sit with $1 billion on the balance sheet, which is somewhat lower than we had initially contemplated a few quarters ago and we think that's certainly a positive step. Mike already mentioned that returning to the more, I'll say, normal capital structure. We have outlined our capital priorities, obviously, sustaining capital, the dividend being important and then we'll use share repurchase opportunistically to return that capital as we see the outlook for 2020. I hope that helps.
Operator: Our next question will come from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.
Philip Gresh: First question, just one clarification on Neil's question around the RVO piece. Maryann, I think you said $62 million per quarter. So that -- so would I multiply that by 4 in terms of what showed up in the fourth quarter specifically? And then my real question just around your comments on maintenance being a bit more back-end loaded. I was hoping you could remind us what a normal maintenance level would be per year and/or if you're willing to comment, just if you have an annual number that we can be thinking about? .
Maryann Mannen: Yes, sure, of course. So let me be clear, the $62 million that I referred to is the annual adjustment for 2021 compliance year. So the $62 million is total adjustment or reduction, if you will, to our obligation for all of 2021. If you think about the impact on that on the capture rate in the quarter, so we were about 116. That's about 1.7 change in the capture rate, including all $62 million. My comment on a quarterly basis was just to say that it's fairly ratable. So had -- we had that RVO obligation at the beginning of the year, you would have seen roughly a $15 million benefit to the prior quarters. That's all that I was trying to say. I hope that answers that question. The second one is really around turnaround. And I guess what we would say is, yes, absolutely back half of the year, we see a greater rating, if you will, toward our turnaround expenses. We see this year, meaning 2022, slightly higher than a normal year. We tend to think normal is in range of $600 million to $700 million, as you saw from what we had this year. So we do expect that to be a higher total for 2022. I'll let Mike add any comments.
Michael Hennigan: No, I don't have anything to add.
Philip Gresh: Okay. Great. No, that's very helpful. My second one, just on the buybacks. Obviously, the pace in 4Q has essentially tripled from the 2Q, 3Q run rate. And with the increase in the authorization, recognizing it doesn't have a specific end date, is there any reason to think that the new run rate that you've been doing is not achievable or doable on a go-forward basis? Or anything in particular about the fourth quarter that you would say is nonrepeatable? .
Maryann Mannen: It's Maryann. I'd say, look, we'll look at liquidity. We certainly, as you know, committed. We were on our third quarter earnings call, to changing the cadence and hopefully, that we've demonstrated our ability to do so in the third quarter -- so from our third quarter performance. We'll absolutely look at liquidity. And as I said, we remain committed to getting that done in 2022 and given the pace that we've achieved, we're likely to be able to get that done sooner. And again, I'm talking about the $10 billion initial commitment.
Operator: We do have time for just one more question. Our last question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotia Bank.
Paul Cheng: Question, I think one is just maybe a bit of the housekeeping. I want to follow up to Maryann's answer to Neil earlier. You talked about the RVO adjustment benefit and the LCFS adjustment. Can you give us what is the benefit from the crew timing benefit and also the inventory benefit by region? So that's just a quick follow-up here. Second question is for Mike, from a commercial operation, I mean when you look back into your earlier, in your carrier, in Sunoco 20-some-odd years ago. I mean that's your pick. And when you're looking at that in the longer term, so when you look at that operation primarily to facilitate the rest of the refining and how the operation -- and MPLX operation? Or that should we also look at it as a profit center, like the model above by BP, Shell, Total, those guys. I mean, what do you envision that business really going to do? And what have already accomplished and where you think is the biggest opportunity with the potential improvement or upside that you still envision from that business over the next 1 or 2 years?
Michael Hennigan: So I'll start with your second part and I'll let Mary go back to the first part. So to answer your question, Paul, it's both. It's -- yes, it should be a separate profit center for us. Rick, Brian and the team are very committed to that. You heard some examples earlier. So that's a stand-alone. And then the other part of it is connectivity to the whole business, making sure the commercial and the portfolio side are totally in sync. So the answer is really both. You have to do both really, really well.  Again, when I started this by saying portfolio cost and commercial, they're all linked, and they all have an obligation across the supply chain. So that's one obligation, and then they all have to do excellence in their own regard. So the commercial area needs to do excellence in just the commercial area. Ray's team needs to do excellence, like I was saying earlier about picking that technology at the end of the day. That's something that goes across both and then have some excellence inside of it.  So the answer -- the short answer to your question is both. Like I said earlier, I'm trying to give you some examples of how we're approaching it. Trying not to go into too much detail, but just to give you a little bit more of the philosophy. So hopefully, that helps, and then I'll let Mary talk on the first part.
Paul Cheng: And Mike, can I just ask one question on that approach? Is your commercial operation going to be a centralized commercial operation or it be centralized? In other words, that is the trade by refinery that they're going to do on the final or the day-to-day adjustment in terms of the operation or that you have a centralized team to coordinate all the effort, which approach that you guys are picking? .
Michael Hennigan: Yes. Again, the answer is both. We have -- part of our commercial team is dedicated to the supply chain and what we're doing, and then part of it is more entrepreneurial and trying to look at it in a little bit different regards. So I think both still the right answer. .
Paul Cheng: Maryann, sorry.
Maryann Mannen: Yes. No, no worries at all. Yes, unfortunately, we really do not provide those inventory movements quarter-to-quarter on a regional basis. So not disclosed, and it's not actually something that we would typically share. .
Paul Cheng: Can I ask that on the appendix, Page 22 on your presentation, you saw a capture impact of 597, we can identify based on the RVO and the LCFS roughly 100. So the other 500 on the total sum, is that primarily driven by the favorable inventory impact and the crude timing? Or I mean you have not break down by region, can you share that what is the total system on those 2 benefits? .
Maryann Mannen: Paul, it's Maryann. Maybe we can take that offline and address all of your questions specifically. Would that be helpful? .
Paul Cheng: Yes, that would be great.
Maryann Mannen: Sounds good.
Michael Hennigan: And Paul, the only thing that I would add is, again, watch quarterly results, there's always timing from Q3 into Q4, Q4 into Q1. Some of that occurred here. And like I said, Mary can give you a little bit more offline and Kristina and the team. But just be careful when you look at 1 quarter isolate it, that tends to get a little bit misaligned if there was activity across the quarters. So just keep that in mind when you guys have the discussion.
Kristina Kazarian: All right, Sheila? Operator, are you still there?
Operator: That was all the time that we had for questions for today.
Kristina Kazarian: Perfect. Well, thank you so much, everyone, for joining our call this afternoon. If you have any questions that you didn't get addressed on the call today, the Investors Relations team is available any time, please just reach out. Thank you again.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-11-02 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MPC Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. My name is Sheila and I will be your Operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.
Kristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. The slides that acCompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investors tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO Maryann Mannen CFO, and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today, actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.
Mike Hennigan : Thanks Kristina. Before we get into results for the quarter, we wanted to provide a brief update on the business. Midway through the quarter, we were impacted by Hurricane Ida. The Ida hurricane passed over our Garyville refinery with wind speed topping 120 miles per hour. Fortunately, all of our employees in the region were safe but many of them experienced severe damage to their homes and the community around them. Our team was able to shut down our refinery in a controlled manner a day ahead of the storm and ensure operational integrity and safety of all of our employees. It took roughly a week to restore some power which enabled the first crude unit to restart over the next several days. The remainder of the refinery restarted sequentially over the next 10 days as more power became available to the facility. I'd like to recognize our refining team and our support groups for their dedication and efforts.  Our commercial teams also did an excellent job in keeping our customers in the region supplied through coordinated efforts across the Company. Maryann will cover this specific impacts when she reviews are refining results. In addition to the Louisiana Hurricane,our Los Angeles refinery with impacted by an earthquake on September 18th. Again, the major challenge was the loss of power. Once power was restored, the units were restarted, the refinery was back to normal operations in roughly 1 week. A gradual increase is in the demand for our products as mobility continue to recover. Globally, product inventories are at their tightest level in many years, and this improvement has lifted margins. In the U.S., gasoline and diesel inventories have steadily improved and are both at the low end of their 5-year averages. Jet fuel inventories have moved in at a 5-year range, although demand is still well below pre -pandemic levels, and we expect that to be a headwind for some time.  Our system is seeing gasoline demand currently 2% to 3% below 2019 levels with the West Coast still lagging at about 8% below. Diesel demand is now slightly above 2019 levels. Jet demand has improved, but still remains down nearly 15% to 20% below pre -pandemic levels. Natural gas costs steadily rose during the quarter, with an average increase of over $1 from the second to the third quarter. There's still some uncertainty as we head into the fourth quarter. But lower inventory levels and strong holiday travel could be supportive. And looking at next year of global products inventories remain tight and demand continues to recover, we would expect to refining sector to rebound in 2022. At the same time, we're watching prices to see if there is a consumer demand pull back. On the aspects of the business that are within our control, this quarter, we advanced several key initiatives. We progressed our renewables initiative with the addition of a new strategic partnership with ADM.  This JV will own and operate ADM's soybean processing complex in Spearwood, North Dakota. Upon completion which is expected in 2023, this facility will source and process local soybeans, supplying approximately 600 million pounds of soybean oil exclusively for MPC, enough feedstock for approximately 75 million gallons of renewable diesel per year. While this JV provides a locally advantaged feedstock for our Dickinson project, we continue to evaluate feedstock options for our Martinez facility in California. At Martinez, our renewable fuels facility conversion reached another project milestone when it's environmental impact report was issued for public comment in mid-October.  The process highlights our extensive effort working with the local regulators and other stakeholders. Also in October, United Airlines, Marathon and others conducted a successful test slate of a 737, which flew for 90 minutes using drop in sustainable aviation fuel. The SAF used during the test flight was 100% renewable drop in fuel made possible by proprietary technology from [Indiscernible] our wholly-owned subsidiary, which has a demonstration plant in Madison Wisconsin. And as we continue to focus on ways to strengthen the competitive position of our assets, today we announced that we are pursuing strategic alternatives for the Kenai refinery, which could include a potential sale.We often share our belief that our businesses both a return on and it return of capital business.  And this quarter we made progress strengthening our portfolio, continuing our low cost focus, and progressing our commitment to return capital to our shareholders. As of today, we've completed approximately 25% of our $10 billion share repurchase program. And we're confident in our ability to return the remaining $7.5 billion by the end of 2022. Finally, MPLX announced the Third Quarter distribution consisting of a 2.5% increase to its base distribution amount, and a special distribution amount as well. MPC will receive a total of $829 million. This announcement reinforces the strategic importance of MPLX as part of MPC 's portfolio, and its ability to return substantial cash to MPC and all unit holders. Slide 4 provides a framework around some of the ways we are challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy. Our approach to sustainability spans the environmental, social, and governments -- and governance or ESC dimensions of our operations.  It encompasses strengthening resiliency by lowering our carbon intensity and conserving natural resources, developing for the future by investing in renewables and emerging technologies and embedding sustainability in decision-making in all aspects of engagement with our people and many stakeholders. We have 3 Company-wide targets many of our investors and stakeholders know well. First, a 30% reduction in our scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 2030, second, a 50% reduction in midstream methane intensity by 2025, and lastly, a 20% reduction in our freshwater withdrawal intensity by 2030. The evolving energy landscape presents us with meaningful opportunities for innovation. We have allocated 40% of our growth capital in 2021 to help advance two significant renewable fuels projects. In late 2020, we began renewable diesel production at our Dickinson North Dakota facility, the second largest of its kind in the U.S., and we're progressing the conversion of our Martinez, California refinery through a renewable diesel facility. I'd also like to highlight a few specific updates from the quarter. We were recently awarded an ESG A rating by MSCI. We are the only U.S. based refiner that holds this rating. We continue to focus on enhancing our disclosures in this quarter, we also submitted data on our scope three emissions through CDP, and we're in the first in our refining sector to do so. We invite you to go to Sustainability section of our website and learn more about how we are challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy. At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Maryann to review the Third Quarter results.
Maryann Mannen : Thanks, Mike. Slide 5 provides a summary of our third quarter financial results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $1.09 and adjusted earnings per share of $0.73. Adjusted earnings exclude $48 million of pre -tax charges primarily related to Hurricane Ida impairments and idling costs. Additionally, the adjustments include an incremental $272 million of tax expense which adjusts all results to a 24% tax rate. Our year-to-date effective rate is just under 2%. We therefore expect to retain the tax benefits realized in 2021. We will continue to make this tax rate adjustment for the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.4 billion for the quarter, which is approximately $500 million higher from the prior quarter. Cash from operations excluding working capital and a voluntary pension contribution was nearly $1.8 billion, which is an increase of $230 million from the prior quarter. During the quarter, we paid $575 million into our pension plan.  We elected to contribute this additional amount as it was beneficial from a tax perspective. This amount covers nearly 3 years of estimated contributions and we forecast the plan would be fully funded at year-end. This also increased the Cares Act benefit to a total of $2.3 billion. Similar to last quarter, we generated ongoing operating cash flow that exceeded the needs of the business and capital commitments, as well as covered our dividend and distribution. Finally, we returned nearly $1.3 billion of capital to shareholders this quarter through dividend payments and share repurchases. Slide 6 illustrates the progress we have made towards lowering our cost structure. Since the beginning of 2020, we have taken almost $1.5 billion out of the Company's total costs. Refining has been lowered by approximately $1 billion, midstream reduced by $300 million, and corporate costs by about a $100 million. Regardless of the margin environment, our EBITDA is directly improved by this $1.5 billion.  We continue to emphasize our safe, reliable, and low cost focus across the organization. While we do not see further cost reductions of the same magnitude that we have already taken out, there are still opportunities for us to reduce cost. Natural gas prices were higher in the Third Quarter and continue into the Fourth Quarter. For every $1 change in natural gas prices, we anticipate there is an approximate $360 million impact to annual EBITDA to our R&M segment. Based on current prices, we estimate that in the Fourth Quarter higher natural gas prices have the potential to impact our business by an incremental $0.30 per barrel. As we have previously mentioned, our refining cost in 2020 began at $6 per barrel and are now trending at a quarterly average of roughly $5 per barrel for 2021. As we continue -- and we continue to believe these are structural reductions.  While our results reflect our focus on cost discipline, everyday we remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, and the communities in which we operate. As we have shared with you previously, our cost reductions should be sustainable, not impact revenue opportunities and in no way jeopardize the safety of our people or our operations. Slide 7 shows the reconciliation from net income to adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from Second Quarter 2021 to Third Quarter 2021. A djusted EBITDA was approximately $500 million higher quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by refining and marketing, but also benefiting from our strength in midstream. $48 million of pretax charges during the quarter are reflected in the adjustment column. Moving to our segment results, slide 8 provides an overview of our refining and marketing segment.  The business reported continuing improvement from last quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 billion. This was an increase of $444 million when compared to the second quarter of 2021. The increase was driven primarily by higher refined margins, especially in the Gulf Coast region, as that regions cracks improved 34% from the second quarter. As Mike mentioned, our Garyville refinery was impacted by Hurricane Ida. We estimate the cost impact was $19 million this quarter, with an additional $11 million to be incurred in the Fourth Quarter. We estimate the lost opportunity from the hurricane to be approximately $80 million. The Garyville refinery was down for about 10 days and took another 10 days to ramp back up to full production. The throughput impact was approximately 8.3 million barrels.  We also believe there was an additional $10 million of lost opportunity impact associated with the earthquake at our Los Angeles refinery which was back to the planned rate after roughly one week. Utilization was 93% for the quarter, flat with the second quarter. We saw lower utilization in the Gulf Coast compared to the second quarter due to hurricane impacts. The Mid-Con region continued its strong utilization and West Coast strengthened as reopening in California continue to increase demand. If adjusted to include capacity which was idled in 2020, utilization would have been approximately 88% in the third quarter of 2021. Operating expenses were higher in the third quarter, primarily due to higher natural gas prices. Slide 9 shows the change in our midstream EBITDA versus the Second Quarter of 2021.  Our midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter. The strong cash flow profile and lower capital spending supported the decision to return more cash to unit holders. Today MPLX announced a 2.5% increase in the partnership's base quarterly distribution, and a special distribution amount of approximately $600 million. As I mentioned earlier, this quarter our midstream assets in the region were also impacted by Hurricane Ida. We estimate the cost impact was $4 million this quarter, with an additional $7 million to be incurred in the Fourth Quarter. Slide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter. Operating cash flow was $1,765,000,000 in the quarter.  As I mentioned earlier, this excludes changes in working capital and an incremental payment of approximately $575 million into our pension plans. Also, this amount does not include changes to our cares tax receivable in the quarter, which was a $500 million source of cash and is included in the income taxes bar of this chart. Working capital was effectively flat this quarter. During the quarter, MPLX reduced its third-party debt by $1 billion funded by borrowing an additional $877 million under the MPC or Marathon interCompany loan agreement. Our income tax balances represented a use of cash primarily driven by a decrease in accrued taxes. We made a tax payment due for the Speedway gain of $2.9 billion out of a total of $4.2 billion we have accrued. We were able to offset about $400 million of the amount using our cares tax receivable.  There were about $100 million of other charges in our tax balances. During the quarter, we adjusted our [Indiscernible] tax refund up to $2.3 billion from $2.1 billion last quarter. We have identified a total of about $700 million that can be offset against our Speedway tax obligation, including the 400 million we used this quarter, and 300 million that we expect to use in the fourth quarter of 2021 to offset remaining balances for taxes due from our Speedway transaction. We received $1.55 billion of the CARES Act refund in October. There is about $60 million of the refund remaining, which we expect to receive in the first half of 2022 with respect to capital return, MPC returned $370 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchased $928 million worth of shares in the quarter using Speedway's proceeds. At the end of the quarter, MPC had $13.2 billion in cash and higher returning short-term investments, such as commercial paper and certificates of deposit.  Last quarter, we promised to continue to provide status updates on our progress deploying speedway proceeds. We have repurchased an incremental $1.5 billion in shares since the end of the second quarter. This is comprised of $928 million of repurchase in the third quarter plus additional shares purchased through the end of October. As Mike indicated, we are approximately 25% complete with our $10 billion share repurchase program. We are continuing to use a program that allows us to buy on an ongoing basis and we will provide updates on the progress during our earnings calls. To meet our $10 billion share repurchase commitment, we are progressing steps to be able to complete the remaining repurchases of approximately $7.5 billion by the end of 2022. The options we have previously discussed remain available to us to complete this objective.  Today, we also announced that we intend to redeem an additional $2.1 billion of debt. This entails two tranches of notes that mature in 2023, given the current interest rate environment as well as our cash position. It makes economic sense to redeem these notes early, and we anticipate this will lead to roughly $20 million of savings. This short-term cash management provides immediate interest payment savings, and we'll have the ability to reissue notes at the appropriate time. With this redemption, we have no maturities over the next 3 years. Our third quarter debt-to-capital ratio for MPC, excluding MPLX, was approximately 24%. The redemption of these notes will continue to lower this ratio. As we manage our balance sheet, we continue to ensure that we maintain our investment-grade credit portfolio. Turning to guidance on Slide 12, we provide our Fourth Quarter outlook.  We expect total throughput volumes of roughly 2.8 million barrels per day. Planned turnaround costs are projected to be approximately $200 million in the Fourth Quarter. The majority of the activity will be in the Mid-Con region. Total operating costs are projected to be $5.40 per barrel for the quarter. Based on the current prices we estimate that in the Fourth Quarter, higher natural gas prices have the potential to impact our business by an incremental $0.30 per barrel. As we have previously mentioned, our turnaround activity is back half-weighted this year. Other operating expenses are coordinated to occur during these time periods as well. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the Fourth Quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $170 million reflecting the approximately $100 million in costs that have been removed on an annual basis. With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.
Kristina Kazarian : Thanks, Maryann, as we open the call for your questions as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions. I will now open the call for questions, operator.
Operator: [Operation Instruction] Our first question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Neil Mehta : Good morning, team. Thanks for taking the question. The first question is around capital return. You still have $7.5 billion of stock, which is all stock to buyback by the end of '22. Based on what we know right now, is it fair to assume that you're going to be buying this back ratably at $1.5 billion a quarter or do you see yourself leaning into it and then tie that into your capital return strategy at MPLX, we saw the special dividend that came through this morning is that something that we should think of as potentially more likely to happen going forward or was that one-time in nature?
Maryann Mannen : Sure. Thanks, Neil. Let me talk about the share buyback program and your question around rate ability. Just maybe as a quick reminder, we did not get into the market until the completion of our Second Quarter earnings call. So we really didn't have a full quarter, if you will, and hopefully you've seen what we've been. doing in the remaining weeks post our earnings call as I tried to share with you. We do believe that we have opportunity as we go forward, given the timing of our earnings to be a little more opportunistic. So I would not assume in any way that ratably is the only plan that we have. I think what you can see is if that were to be the case, we certainly would have full ability to complete our program, as we say, no later than the end of 2022, but that is certainly not the only available set of opportunities for us. I will turn the call -- I will turn the question over to Mike on MPLX.
Mike Hennigan : Good morning, Neil. I'll address your second point. So I want to give you a little bit of a long-winded answer but hopefully it will get to the meat of your question. So at MPLX, one of the things that we decided to do was to move the business model such that we would have free cash after distributions and after growth capital that would put us in a financial flexibility situation where we could have options. We achieved that about the Third Quarter of 2020 and as a result of that, we now have a situation where we have capital for deployment at MPLX that can be growth capital, buybacks, additional distribution for the base as you saw us bump that up today, additional distribution amounts in the form of a special which we've talked about a little bit here, and I'll address it further. But the bottom line there is we're going to be dynamic and evaluating what's the best opportunity for us on that side of the house based on market conditions, business needs, etc. etc. An important point though from the MPC side of it is, we often get asked the question, how does MPLX provide value to MPC shareholders? Well, we tried to enumerate many different ways, but this is one other example where this is additional cash that's coming from MPLX to MPC.  So at the base distribution amount, MPC gets about $1.8 billion. And that's been pretty ratable since 2020. With this special distribution amount, it will now be $2.2 billion because it's about 400 million MPC 's take of the special that went to all unit holders. So instead of a 1.8 say EBITDA addition from MPC, you're now looking at 2.2 and we'll continue to evaluate that going forward. It's clearly our intent to grow earnings at MPLX. And as a result of that, there's going to be more cash available to come to MPC overtime, whether it's through distributions to the base or special, while we also continue to look at buybacks at MPC as well. So hopefully everybody sees this as a nice strategic importance of MPLX to MPC shareholders as part of our overall scheme here. That makes sense to you Neil?
Neil Mehta : No. That's really helpful, Mike. And my follow-up is kind of a housekeeping modeling type of stuff, which is 2 parts to it. One is, tax rate came in a little bit lower than expected this quarter, Should we think about tax rate going forward given that midstream, such a big part of the earnings, lower than the 24% effective tax rate that we've been base casing. And then just any waiver on ' 22 capex, 2 kind of housekeeping questions.
Maryann Mannen : Neil on the tax question. So you're absolutely right in the quarter, frankly, we actually recorded from continuing operations about an $18 million benefit. Part of that is driven by our ability to carry back the incremental pension contribution and some other favorable discrete items in the quarter. The second part of your question is whether or not we would actually migrate towards the statutory rate of 24%. And I think you've articulated that as we look at the amount of non-controlling interest, we would most likely not see a statutory rate of 24% but as the level of R and M continues to improve against that, we'll see that rate get higher than the 2% that you were seeing on a year-to-date basis. So we will migrate from 2% trending toward, but we would not reach the statutory rate. We have continued to make this adjustment since the First Quarter of 2020, and we will do that in the fourth quarter for consistency.  But most likely going forward beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we will not be making a tax adjustment to bring all of our earnings to 24%. I hope that -- I hope that answered the question. And then I'll address your second question around capital. As you saw, we had a significant reduction from 2020 to 2021 and we're largely on track to reach that capex number for 2021. We have not given guidance for 2022 as yet and we'll do that on our fourth quarter earnings call, as we normally do. But I think as you know, one of the key strategic pillars along with cost reduction is strict capital discipline. We've begun to outline for you the amount of capital that we are targeting or committing to renewables, and we would expect to be able to share that with you as well for when we give our guidance.
Neil Mehta : Thanks, Maryann.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we will hear from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Guys you've given a lot of every part, a lot of detail about cost reductions, price of gasoline [Indiscernible] and so on. I wonder if I could ask you to [Indiscernible] it down for us a little bit. As we transition back to, for one of a better expression, mid-cycle, What do you see as the mid-cycle EBITDA for the portfolio after all the changes, what it stands like today and I'm talking specifically the refining business at the MLP consolidation. Is that something you can quantify?
Mike Hennigan : Doug it's Mike. As you know from some of our previous conversations, I think it's very, very hard to call the mid-cycle. I often say I used the football analogy that just getting it between the 40's is tough enough, let alone trying to find mid-cycles. So -- but most importantly for me, Doug, I will tell you that the way we manage the Company is we're not concerned about calling the 50 versus the 40. I'd like to think about the 2-end zones. How do we feel about a low environment and a high environment, and how are we set up from a portfolio standpoint, whether each of those come out is because invariably overtime, as you've seen, you'll see cyclical high margin environments and then obviously we've seen some pretty low ones with the pandemic. So I don't really have a number for you. That's not something we spend a lot of time with. Obviously internally, we also like to think about, where is our balance sheet and leverage, etc.  As Maryann talked about, right now we're in a different situation than normal. We have a lot of cash on the balance sheet. We did a short-term optimization around that cash management. Ultimately, I think our leverage to a normal mid-cycle would be higher in the future. But we'll keep debating that and ultimately trying frame ourselves that we're in a good position. But at the end of the day, I don't have the crystal ball to tell you exactly what I think mid-cycle is going to be, but I do think that we're going to manage the Company such that we're prepared for either end of it and we're going to have the appropriate management disciplines and financial disciplines around those scenarios.
Maryann Mannen : And, Doug. Maryann here, maybe at the risk of repeating that. But as we always say, we're going to control the things we can and whatever that mid-cycle brings, as I was sharing, we're $1.5 billion better than we otherwise would've been from the cost reductions that we've been able to achieve. We still believe we have some opportunities in our low cost culture but certainly we're 1.5 billion better than we otherwise would have been regardless of what that market brings us.
Doug Leggate : Thank you. I was working in the office, I guess, but my follow-up -- I guess we've touched on this every other quarter, Mike, but the portfolio changes, Kenai is the latest than it seems to be these are kind of flat to be fair, or these are dribbling out over a long period of time. I'm just wondering if you could connect us maybe in a baseball analogy. Give us an idea of where you think we are in that process. And I wonder if I could also ask you to touch on whether there's any similar studies or evolution of the portfolio going on at the MPLX level. Obviously for a long time, there has been a lot of discussions over gathering and processing for that's the right fit for an NOP type of business and am hoping that.Thank you.
Mike Hennigan : Doug, to your first part, I don't know that we think about it as dribbling it around. I mean, from the portfolio standpoint, we've executed the sale of the Speedway business, which as everybody knows, took a long time to get through that process. We made early moves to idle some high-cost facilities in our refining system, converted Martinez to renewable diesel that's in progress, completed a feedstock JV, and an equity position in the feedstock situation for Dickinson. So we continue to examine the portfolio, I think we've done some things that shows the market that it is a high priority for us. It's one of my three main initiatives that I stated from the start with respect to [Indiscernible], I would tell you, Doug, normally, I'm not a big fan of announcing stuff until things are done or not, it's a general rule. But in this particular case, we've done an analysis. And the reason we disclosed it now is we're in pretty advanced discussions with several parties. And because of the timing of this call, we didn't want to have this call.  And if something progresses to closure in the near future, we didn't want everybody saying, "Hey, why didn't you tell us about it? " So we decided to go off our normal little bit and disclose that we may be able to execute something here in the short-term, but it may not happen as well. We're trying to be as open and transparent as we can be. We're evaluating it. It is advanced discussions and that's the main reason that we've decided to tell the market that's where we are. But I will tell you that we will continue to evaluate the portfolio. There's more work in our mind that needs to be done. And hopefully over time, people continue to see a pattern of us challenging ourselves to have a very robust portfolio that works in all market conditions. And ultimately, what I try and say to our team is we want all of our assets to provide free cash over the cycle of cash flows in margin environments that we hit.
Doug Leggate : Mike, I wonder if I could just press you on the MPLX start up question. I guess drip feed was the better expression you should have used, but does that extend to MPLX?
Kristina Kazarian : Yeah. Could you just say that again? Apologies. We couldn't hear you. Did you say drip feed?
Doug Leggate : I'm sorry. My point was I think drip feed was a better expression than dribble, I think was the Board [Indiscernible]. My question was those just extend to the MPLX portfolio.
Mike Hennigan : Yes it does. We've said for some time, and maybe to our detriment again, but we'd like to around transparency that we believe that there's parts of the portfolio very core and are going to continue to get capital deployment. There's parts of the portfolio that we do not think long term is core, but at the same time, we're generating free cash from those areas. And we'll continue to keep those part of the portfolio unless we see something that adds more value. The bid ask on the non-core has been wide and like I say, maybe no good deed goes unpunished. The fact that we've been open about that option, I think has lead people to try and low-ball us as far as some of the bids, but we know what the value of the assets are in our mind. We're not going to move them for numbers less than that.  We're happy with the execution of the assets at this point. So we're in what I call a good position. We're generating free cash. The portfolio is working for us. We'll look for an opportunity if it makes sense, at some point to divest something that we think can be more useful to somebody else in the long term. But if not, we will manage the capital into those areas and continue to generate free cash and deploy capital where we think there's more longer-term value. So long answer to your question, but yes, the portfolio is obviously something that matters at both MPC and MPLX.
Doug Leggate : Okay. Thank you very much.
Mike Hennigan : You're welcome, Doug.
Operator: Thank you.Next we will hear from Phil Gresh with JP Morgan your line is open.
Phil Gresh : Yes. Hey, good morning. My first question is just around the balance sheet in the past, you've talked about. Parent leverage of I think 1 to 1.5 times. Obviously, you have a lot of cash coming in the door. The macro was looking more and more like mid-cycle faster. Does this impact in any way the way you're thinking about the right level of consolidator or parent leverage that you want to maintain moving forward?
Maryann Mannen : It's Maryann. I'd say no, it does not. We are certainly as I tried to share, committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings on both MPC and MPLX. Our decision in the short term on the incremental debt is really based on the $20 million worth of interest rate savings. As I mentioned on the call, we're sitting at about 24% debt-to-cap that will lower that obviously as we take that incremental debt out. But it's short-term. We'll continue to look at the cash position. And then of course as we complete the share repurchase, we'll see that leverage move up a bit as well. But this in no way changes the way that we are thinking about the optimal capital structure for MPC and MPLX. We remain comfortable, if you will, we've been talking about 4 times at the MPLX. And as John mentioned on the call earlier this morning, we're sitting at about 3.7 at the end of this quarter.
Phil Gresh : But just to clarify, Mike
Mike Hennigan : , I just want to add to what Maryann said because I want to make sure that the market doesn't over-interpret this short-term move. We have cash sitting on the balance sheet. The market has moved such that we can take out that a little earlier in such a way that we can put $20 million in our pocket. The interest rate that we're getting on the cash in the short-term, obviously is small basis points compared to put in $20 million in our pockets. So as an optimization, we look to take that debt out, but don't read into it, which I'm concerned that's what you are doing. Don't read into it that that's where we think our debt should be on a long-term basis. Does that make sense to you?
Phil Gresh : It does. I just want to make sure Maryann did I clarify or qualify that correctly at 1 to 1.5 times for the parent leverage as well, or just sort of make sure I'm thinking about that the right way.
Maryann Mannen : Yeah, I think that's a fair assessment, so yes.
Phil Gresh : Okay. And then my second question. Again, with all the cash flow improvements here with the macro environment, does Marathon have a way that's thinking about its dividend framework, living forward post Speedway. I don't know if it's percent of cash flow, or something where you're trying to think about not only the buybacks which are reducing the dividend burden, but also the potential for dividend growth. Thank you.
Mike Hennigan : Yeah. Phil,It's Mike, so we're having a lot of internal discussions around the dividend level. But in the short term, our priority is to buy back the shares through the program we have. We're not going to make a change on the dividend while that program is in place, but we are looking at what's the appropriate level going forward especially considering how much cash that we're generating at both MPC and MPLX. And like I mentioned earlier, now the amount of EBITDA that's coming from MPLX into MPC for at least for this year is considerably higher than what it's been in the past. So it is something that's on our radar screen, but while we are reducing shares, we're going to concentrate on that program first before we make any further comments on the dividend.
Phil Gresh : Okay. Thank you.
Mike Hennigan : You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question will come from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. You may proceed.
Manav Gupta : Hey, Mike. given the cash build which we're seeing quarter-over-quarter, I know since you have taken over, you have been very focused on cost reductions, what you can control and optimizing the portfolio. But just because the cash is building, is there a possibility you could accelerate your renewal fuel development through more JVs or actually acquire some assets under development, or even other forms of renewable energy. I'm just trying to understand if that part of the portfolio can be accelerated here to inorganic means, is that something you could be open to?
Mike Hennigan : Yeah. We're certainly open to it. We have a team of people that's constantly looking at the opportunities that are out there inorganically. Obviously, we don't count on that in our base plan and we count on the things we control as you mentioned, but yeah, we have a whole team of people both on the MPC and the MPLX side looking for opportunities in renewables, and as well as all the other alternative energy options. In the short-term, we have not found anything that we think is worthy of deployment, but we'll continue to look at it. Some of these other technologies, I think, are going to develop over time, and I think we're going to get some opportunities into the future but up until this point, we haven't found anything that we thought was worthwhile. But we're certainly open to it. And like I said, we have a lot of people looking at all the different parts of this energy evolution that's going to continue to evolve over time.
Manav Gupta : And a quick follow-up here is during the quarter in refining, obviously the widening sour differentials were a meaningful tailwind for you. Obviously, what I think it's $150 million quarter-over-quarter, we are seeing opaque raise some volumes there, we're seeing some widening of the Canadian differentials. So if you could help us understand the outlook for medium and heavy sour differentials there and how that plays into MPC. Thank you.
Rick Hessling: Yes. Hi, Manav. It's Rick Hessling, I can help you there. So you're absolutely correct, here in the near term medium sours, heavy differentials have widened, so You're seeing that in the marketplace. Going forward, what I would share is there's a lot of puts and takes out there in the marketplace. We've certainly got the opec plus decision here, that's expected on Thursday that we'll pivot the market certainly a bit. We've got political intervention, ie, as SPR releases that always way in the outlook. So it makes it very tough to truly take a position above and beyond that you've got production. You've got Gulf or Mexico production, Canadian production recently, looking robust. but then on the flip side, you certainly have consumer demand. Where will that go? How will the demand play out? And then lastly, several other wildcards on how it will affect these differentials which is line 3 and Capline reversal here in a few months. So a lot of puts and takes Manav really hard to call going forward.
Manav Gupta : Thank you so much.
Rick Hessling: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Roger Reed: Thank you. Good morning.
Mike Hennigan : Good morning, Roger.
Roger Reed: Good morning, guys. Just dive into its here, First one on the Martinez conversion. Just to make sure you talked a little bit about feed stock earlier, how you're looking at where you are relative to secured feed stock and how that would compare to the normal process. In other words, if you don't have a 100% that's not a surprise because we're still what, 2 years away essentially from full run rates are year-and-a-half. And then are there any specific regulatory hurdles remaining permitting, etc that needs to go on there.
Mike Hennigan : Mr. Roger, I will let Ray talk about the regulatory side and then I'll come back on the feed stocks.
Roger Reed: Good morning, Roger hey the big hurdle for us. The first hurdle was the environmental impact report was actually issued for public comment a few weeks ago on October 18th, and that's a 60-day comment period. I want to emphasize this. This is a major milestone for us and not an insignificant piece of work. It's a 450 page answered-the-questions and scenarios and so forth. There are initially was a little bit of miss interpretation. that, but I was very pleased to see that some of our key stakeholders, particularly CARB, came out in strong support for our projects. So that's encouraging. And we'll monitor any comments that we receive over the next 60 days and address those accordingly. At the end result, we are hopeful to get a land-use permit and that's the big deal because what that does is that allows us to go ahead and start construction. And what I want to emphasize is the project is ready for that phase 1. We're done with the engineering, we've got material stage and we're ready to put the building trades to work on getting phase 1 going. As far as our outlook on it, we remain where we've been in the past, where second half 2022 phase 1 of the renewable diesel project is online.
Mike Hennigan : And Roger it's Mike, I'll just add to with Ray saying first off on your question on feed stocks. So we continue to have commercial discussions around that. We have kept that kind of close to the vest for now and we'll keep it that way while we're having some of these discussions. But what I wanted to point out the is like Ray said. We're at an important point in the project. We're out for public comment like Ray said, we're ready to go to construction. I know the market has been asking us to disclose the capital. We're looking forward to doing that. We've been holding that back to get through this regulatory process. Once we're through that, then hopefully we'll be able to give you a lot more color with respect to capital and feed stocks and everything else as to where we are. But this important part of this process, as Ray just mentioned, will play itself out. And then hopefully by the next time we talk, we'll be able to give you more color.
Roger Reed: I appreciate that. The other question I had, just to go the opposite direction of the discussion earlier on potentially coming up with a different solution for the Kenai Unit, lot of units are for sale out there from various operators on refining, and I was just curious, you did a big transaction shortly before you took this role, understandable, you'd want to clean up some of what you bought and some of what you already had but as you look out over the next 3 to 5 years, is there any interest in expanding the refining footprint or you look at the issues with cafe standards, EVs, etc, and you say generally speaking, we're probably shrinking refining from here? I'm just curious how you're looking at it strategically.
Mike Hennigan: Yeah, Roger it's Mike again, so I'd like to -- I never say never, but it's not a high priority for us to increase our refining position. I think the higher priority for us is to increase our opportunities in the energy evolution. You see us doing some things in renewables. We've gotten a few other ideas that we're percolating on that hopefully in time will advance the portfolio. But probably in general, as a general rule, we're looking to balance the portfolio and head a little bit more leaning in towards where things are going to be growing over the next couple of decades if we get the right opportunity.
Roger Reed: Alright, great. Thank you.
Mike Hennigan: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Prashant Rao with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Prashant Rao: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. If I could follow-up on Martinez a bit, like you talked about where you are with feed stocks and obviously I appreciate keeping that close to the vest right now. But perhaps viewed another way, could you help us out with maybe thinking about the CI score or a range of CI scores or sort of bandwidth you're looking at that's feasible, or realistic for what's going to be produced out of Martinez. And maybe if I could tie that into some recent news, and some movement we've had here on sustainable aviation fuel, where it looks like, not only is the blenders tax credit higher, but it ties in an emissions reduction factor. Is that also sort of on the table that given where we are in, it will be coming on-stream. You'll have at [Indiscernible] BTC credit as well. So does that how does that change how you think about purposing the asset?
Mike Hennigan : Prashant, I'll start off and then I'll let Ray give you a little bit more color on SAF, etc. The first item is when we sanction this project, we assumed a 100% soybean so we assume the highest CI in theory, worse feed that we could imagine here, because over a long period of time, the market will [Indiscernible]. Obviously in the short-term, we are looking to provide some better opportunity on the feed stock side for Dickinson and for Martinez. But as I said, we're going to keep that discussion a little close to the vest right now while we get through this whole regulatory period, as far as SAF, we are open to the opportunity for us, but it comes with some puts and takes and I'll let Ray give you a little bit more color on that.
Roger Reed : Sure, Mike. I just want to emphasize in the first portion of the Martinez's project, phases 1, 2, and 3, SAF isn't in the base scope for what we are engineering and building. However, having said that, we believe that SAF will be an opportunity for Martinez. And to support that, we're currently doing engineering work at Martinez as far as what the CapEx would be to add that to the portfolio. I think everybody knows that SAF economics will compete with renewable diesel. We believe that the economic drivers for SAF are not there right now, but they will be there eventually as regulatory and product demand. Support builds for this. And so that's why we're evaluating that Martinez. But I just want to emphasize in our, in our near-term, our next two-year focus at Martinez. We're not building for SAF, but that's definitely a future enhancement to the plant.
Prashant Rao: Thanks. That's very helpful. And my second question, just to touch back and I think Mike and Maryann, you both talked about this in answering previous questions on this call, but I just wanted to take a different tack on those on the capital allocation, [Indiscernible] group potential for one, you are making great progress on the debt. The buyback is 25% through on the Speedway proceeds, now. I guess, and I know I've asked this before and others have to eventually can we expect that there should be a framework for return to shareholders out of organic cash flows. And in I'm just timing of when that might get announced. What do you need to see to be able to give us a bit, bit better definition on that. Do you need I mean, well is it something that you need to be maybe midway through the Speedway proceeds buyback and with a good view into 2022 right now or would you look to maybe get through the 10 billion first and then it becomes more of a 2023 or further out of question. I know it's -- a bit specifically, you can help us think about gauging our expectations on that. I think that'll be helpful. Thanks.
Maryann Mannen : Sure. Thanks for the question. Maybe just a couple of things to just state here, you're right, 25% of that share repurchase as we shared of that $10 billion, we're on our way to complete no later than the end of 2022. And hopefully as you've heard, in terms of the debt reduction consistent with what we've been sharing with you, and certainly short-term in nature. I think what we've been discussing and what we've tried to share with you is we'd like to see more progress around our $10 billion share repurchase completed, before we begin to provide a little more structural content on how we think about the remaining use of that cash. We'd want to get a little bit further along in that $10 billion before we give you any more specifics around that, I'll pass it back to Mike and I think you want to add a little more color for you.
Mike Hennigan : And I think Maryann just said it very well. We're just trying not to get ahead of ourselves in the program. [Indiscernible] or we're looking at some opportunities that maybe are inorganic. We continue to look at that. We definitely have excess cash to the point that was opening in the call. As margins recover, we hope to be continuing to generate more cash through our business. So we're just trying not to get in front of ourselves. We know we have cash beyond the commitment we've made today, we know there's going to be opportunities and I understand your question, but we just don't want to get too ahead of ourselves because we're in a good spot, and we have some time here to continue to execute the program. And as we move along, we'll disclose more and more. Obviously, we want to grow earnings, so we're looking for opportunities.  I keep saying it's a return of and a return on capital business. We want to balance those were very committed to the return of as, as you've seen us, It's executing now, we'd like to see some more opportunities in return on as we continue to look for opportunities to grow earnings. So it's just that balance as we move forward and just not trying to get ahead of ourselves while we have the time to execute.
Prashant Rao: Makes sense. Thank you both for the time.
Mike Hennigan : You're welcome.
Maryann Mannen: Welcome.
Operator: Our next question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Your line is open.
Theresa Chen : Hi there. First I want to follow up on the discussion about Kenai. Mike is your expectation that once the transaction happens that Kenai will remain as a petroleum refinery or is the operating environment so difficult out there leading to me your own decision to exit that it could be used for a different purpose once it changes hands.
Mike Hennigan : Yes. Theresa, I don't want to get ahead of the discussions that we're having, so I'm going to have to plan on that question.We're just -- like I said earlier, we're just in such advanced discussions with a couple of different interested parties that have different views of the marketplace that we just didn't feel that it was right to just ignore it on today's call in case something comes to closure. I will tell you that again, everybody knows this when you're doing deals even in advanced discussions, it may happen, it may not happen. We'll see how it plays out. And if it does, we'll have -- try to give you some insight to it and then we'll be able to talk a lot further about it if it does happen. If it doesn't happen, obviously we'll come out and say that as well. But it's just the timing of the call and where we are in the discussions that we felt it was worth given some disclosure.
Theresa Chen : Got it. And going back to Rick's earlier comments about Line 3, and the cap line reversal current rate line-filling, I believe in fully coming on in a couple of months. So as part owner and who is operator at the system, the initially reversed capacity was pretty low, and I was just wondering if you have expectations that it will grow over time on the heels of the Line 3 replacement, bring 300,000 incremental barrels per day to Patoka. And what do you think it could run rate as in the repurchase differential from that?
Rick Hessling: Yes. Hi, Theresa. It's Rick again. So to your point, a lot of the answer truly depends on what grades are put on the line. Capline can move heavy or light and those and truly the volumes are going to vary significantly. From our perspective, we're excited about Capline. We obviously have Garyville sitting on the coast of the Eastern golf and it can be a recipient. But truly, volumes will be based on demand from us and others, econ. And then lastly, grayed, as I've already stated.
Theresa Chen : Okay. Maybe if I could just clarify. So the initial reverse I believe with re-configuring 3 out of the 16 pumps. If you had to reconfigure more to laugh for more volumes, can that be done pretty quickly.
Rick Hessling: I would have to defer to MPLX on that Theresa.
Mike Hennigan : Theresa, it's Mike. Yeah, we have the ability to ramp up if the expansion is required, so I'll give you my take on top of Rick's. The whole genesis of the project is that Eastern Gulf is looking for more grades as Rick mentioned. Over time, my personal belief is there's going to be more interest there. The issue is supplying the pipe, whether it comes from the north, as you know, there was a project coming out of Cushing that doesn't look like it's going to go forward at this point, but whatever can get supply to that pipe I think is going to be advantageous to get more optionality down to the Gulf Coast. As Rick mentioned, our facility in Garyville is interested in some of the grades. The rest of the Eastern Gulf refining area would be interested in different types of opportunities as far as grade selection as well. So on the personal believer that over time, we're going to get the bottleneck and get more availability of crude into that system. And I do believe over time it is going to expand.
Theresa Chen : Thank you.
Mike Hennigan : Your welcome.
Operator: Our next question will come from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Connor Lynagh: Thanks for squeezing me in, and I've got 2 questions, but I think they're relatively related, so I'll just ask them at once here. So 1 question that we've been trying to figure out is you guys obviously have significant savings that you flagged already from OpEx. But I think you've also flagged some operational improvements as well that might flow through more in terms of the capture rate or throughput margin, however, you want to define it. Do you have any framework for how people can think about it? I know you don't want to go to the mid-cycle framework, but just any thoughts on improvements that we should look for over the next year or two here. And the related question is, given that you have a lot of capital freeing up, here, are there any major upgrades or enhancements to your legacy refining business that you're considering over the next couple of years here?
Maryann Mannen : Hey, Connor. It's Maryann, maybe I'll start here. I think what you're referring to is the commercial opportunities that we've been sharing as part of those 3 pillars, we've done a lot of great work as we've said, on cost reduction, strict capital discipline, hopefully you see that Kenai as another example of our asset optimization. I think when we continue to look forward, we still believe that there are opportunities for us to improve on the commercial opportunities, you mentioned capture being one of them. And as we've shared, we're a little bit, I'd say we keep that close to the vest for competitive reasons. What we intend to demonstrate to you as we go forward quarter-by-quarter is the actual realization of those efforts that have been ongoing by the commercial team. And you'll see those appear, and we obviously will call those out as they manifest through the earnings in the coming quarters.
Roger Reed : Connor this is Ray. I'll briefly address your second question regarding refining spending probably the biggest thing that we have out there is a project that you've heard before, the Galveston Bay Star project. We still have some remaining spend on that that will go into '22 and '23 to complete that modification to the refining -- refineries, specifically, the remaining scope dealing with the reset hydro-cracker and one of the crude unit is the sour crude unit, but that's the biggest thing in refining on the go-forward plus at this point.
Connor Lynagh: All right. Thanks for that. I'll turn it back.
Kristina Kazarian : Operator, are there any other questions in the queue?
Operator: We are showing no further questions at this time.
Kristina Kazarian : Well, thank you, everyone for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or would you like clarification on topics discussed this morning? Please reach out and our IR team will be available to take your calls. Thank you so much for joining us today.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you again for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-08-04 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MPC Second Quarter 2021 earnings call. My name is Sheila, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session.  Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.
Kristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO; and other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there, as well as in our filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.
Mike Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Before we get into our results for the quarter, we wanted to provide a brief update on the business. During the second quarter, we saw gradual improvements in the demand for our products as the rollout of COVID vaccinations and removal of mobility restrictions have led to more economic activity and increased demand for transportation fuels. That said, we're close to the end of the summer driving season, which is typically our strongest part of the year. Gasoline demand is currently 2% to 5% below 2019 levels with the West Coast still lagging at about 10% down. Diesel demand continues to hold up well and is flat to 2019. Despite the growing levels of personal passenger traffic, we continue to see an absence of the longer haul international flights and business travel. Overall, jet demand remains down nearly 30% below pre-pandemic levels. The full return of aviation fuel demand will likely still take some time, particularly with the recent increasing spread of the COVID-19 variants. As we head into the second half of the year, we remain hopeful, but cautious in the recovery. And so we'll remain focused on the elements of our business within our control. Slide 4 highlights progress on our strategic priorities for the quarter. First on May 14, we closed the sale of our Speedway business to 7-Eleven. In conjunction with the close, we announced our plans to return $10 billion of sale proceeds to shareholders through share repurchases. As part of our commitment to quickly return capital, we immediately launched a modified Dutch auction tender offer in which we're able to repurchase nearly $1 billion worth of shares. As we shared in our release this morning, we are proceeding with the next steps in our plan to complete the remaining $9 billion return of capital over the next 12 to 16 months. Second, we continue to take steps to reposition our portfolio. Dickinson reached full design capacity during the quarter at approximately 180 million gallons per year, Dickinson is the second largest renewable diesel facility in the United States. At Martinez, we're progressing detailed engineering and permitting to convert that oil refinery to a renewable diesel facility. Based on our progress and discussion with feedstock suppliers, we're confident in the timeline we have set to begin producing renewable diesel in the second half of 2022 with approximately 260 million gallons per year of capacity. Additionally, we expect to reach full capacity of approximately 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023. Third, we continue to keep a diligent focus on cost and capital in a challenging commodity business such as ours, being a low-cost operator ensures we will remain competitive. We have continued to challenge ourselves to examine all aspects of spend, and as a result, have delivered incremental progress. In the first half of 2021, our operating results reflect our goal to reduce overall refining cost structure by $1 billion. Importantly, I want to note that in June we published our two annual ESG related reports. Our sustainability report provides an in-depth look at the company's sustainability approach and performance consistent with the reporting guidance from SASB and GRI. Our perspectives on climate related scenarios follows guidance from TCFD and analyzes the company's resiliency relative to climate scenarios put forth by the IEA. On Slide 5, I'd like to take a moment to go over some of the ways we're challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy. From a strategic standpoint, our focus is to balance the needs of today while investing in a sustainable energy diverse future. That includes strengthening resiliency by lowering our carbon intensity and conservative natural resources, developing for the future by investing in renewables and emerging technologies and embedding sustainability and decision-making in all aspects of engagement with our people and many stakeholders. We currently have three company-wide targets, many of our investors know well. First, a 30% reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 2030. Second, a 50% reduction in midstream methane intensity by 2025. And lastly, a 20% reduction in our fresh water withdrawal intensity by 2030. The evolving energy landscape presents us with meaningful opportunities for innovation. We've allocated 40% of our growth capital in 2021 to help advance two significant renewable fuels projects. In late 2020, we began renewable diesel production, our Dickinson North Dakota facility, second of its kind in the United States and are progressing the conversion of our Martinez, California refinery tool, renewable diesel facility. Finally, to demonstrate our focus on making sustainability pervasive in all we do for executives and employees, we link a portion of the annual bonus program to an ESG metric. We recently introduced a diversity equity and inclusion component to these metrics as well, making us the first U.S. independent downstream company to link improving diversity to compensation in the same way we led the industry in linking GHG intensity reductions to our compensation last year. Safety in our operations is another key to sustainable operations. In 2020, our teams demonstrated strong safety and environmental performance, including a nearly 40% reduction in the most significant process safety events and a 40% reduction in designated environmental incidents over 2019. Our personal safety performance continues to be better than industry average for the U.S. refining and midstream sectors. At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Maryann to review second quarter results.
Maryann Mannen: Thanks, Mike. Slide six, provides a summary of our second quarter financial results. This morning, we reported an adjusted earnings per share of $0.67. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.194 billion for the quarter. This includes the results from both continuing and discontinued operations. Cash from continuing operations, excluding working capital, was $1.535 billion, which is approximately $1 billion increase from the prior quarter. And for the first time in nearly 18 months, we generated ongoing operating cash flow that exceeded the needs of the business, capital commitments, as well as covered our dividend and distributions. Finally, we returned nearly $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders this quarter through dividend payments and share repurchases. The close of the Speedway sale marked a significant milestone in our ongoing commitment to strengthen the competitive position of our portfolio. So we wanted to call out some of the key points on Slide 7. We received total proceeds for the sale of Speedway of $21 billion; based on our tax basis our cash taxes current and deferred will be approximately $4.2 billion, which is lower than our original $4.5 billion estimate. We have accrued for this on the balance sheet. In addition, we had closing adjustments of approximately $400 million. Therefore, the after-tax proceeds from the sale will be $17.2 billion. To be clear this number is higher than our initial $16.5 billion estimate. On Slide 8, we present an overview of the use of the proceeds. Since the close of the transaction we have reduced structural debt by $2.5 billion and purchased approximately $1 billion of stock. In the post tender period we did not repurchase any incremental shares in light of a couple of regulatory constraints; First, a post tender cooling off period, and second, our routine quarterly restricted period in the lead-up to the release of our earnings information. That said not repurchasing during that limited window is not indicative of any deviation from our commitment to complete within 12 to 16 months. Consistent with that commitment as Mike mentioned earlier, we are commencing the next steps to complete the remaining $9 billion return of capital. Specifically, we are entering into an open market repurchase program that will allow us to buy for a period of time, including when the company may have information that otherwise precludes us from trading. And we will provide updates on the progress during our earnings calls. Slide 9, illustrates the progress we have made lowering our cost structure. Since the beginning of 2020, we have made a step change in our refining operating cost and decreased our overall cost profile by approximately $1 billion. While there is quarter-to-quarter variability, our refining operating cost in 2020 began at $6 per barrel and are now trending at a quarterly average of roughly $5 per barrel for 2021. We have applied the same cost discipline framework that we use for refining operating costs to our corporate cost as well. There may be variations in these corporate costs quarter-to-quarter we believe we have lowered our overall cost structure by more than $100 million. And we are committed to challenging ourselves every day on ways to reduce expenses. As you know, natural gas is a variable cost in operating a refinery, these costs have recently increased nearly $1 per MMBtu, and we anticipate this being a headwind for the third quarter. While our results reflect our focus on cost discipline, every day we remain steadfast in our commitment to safely operate our assets and protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, and the communities in which we operate. As we have shared with you previously, our cost reductions should be sustainable, not impact revenue opportunities and in no way jeopardize the safety of our people or our operations. Slide 10 shows the reconciliation from net income to adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from first quarter 2021 to second quarter 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was more than $600 million higher quarter-over-quarter driven primarily by refining and marketing. As we previously mentioned, this quarter's results include the impacts of closing the Speedway sale. Here you can see the $11.7 billion pretax gain on the sale reflected in the adjustments column of $11.6 billion, which includes other adjustments of $79 million for impairments and transaction related costs. The $3.7 billion financial tax provision, excuse me, financial tax provision reflects the net impact of cash taxes and deferred tax impact. The resulting $8 billion gain on sale is reflected in our quarterly net income. Slide 18 in our appendix walks through the specific impacts of the Speedway sale across the three financial statements. Moving to our segment slide results; Slide 11 provides an overview of our refining and marketing segment. The business recorded the second consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA since the start of the COVID pandemic with adjusted EBITDA of $751 million. This was an increase of $728 million when compared to the first quarter of 2021; the increase was driven primarily by higher refining margins, especially in the Mid-Con region as that region's cracks improved 57% from the first quarter. Also contributing to the improved results was higher utilization, which was 94% for the second quarter versus 83% in the first quarter. It's important to recall that we idled two high cost refineries in 2020. If adjusted to include that capacity, idled in 2020 utilization would have been approximately 78% in the first quarter of 2021 and subsequently increased to 89% in the second quarter of 2021. Operating expenses were relatively flat with the previous quarter, despite the increase in utilization, reflecting the team's commitment to cost discipline despite rising variable cost. Slide 12 shows a change in our midstream EBITDA versus the first quarter of 2021. Our midstream segment continues to demonstrate earnings resiliency and stability with consistent results from the previous quarter. Here again, the team continues to make excellent progress executing on the strategic priorities of strict capital discipline, lowering the cost structure and portfolio optimization. By the end of 2021, we estimate that MPLX will have decreased their structural costs by $300 million. Slide 13, presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. It reflects both our continuing and just continued operations. We have also specifically called out items related to the Speedway close. Within continuing operations, operating cash flow before changes in working capital was $1.5 billion in the quarter. Changes in working capital were flat this quarter increasing crude prices provided a source of more than $500 million, which was mostly offset by the large receivable balance with Speedway becoming a third-party customer and typical seasonal refined product inventory builds. During the quarter, MPC decreased debt by $3.3 billion. Additionally, MPLX reduced third-party debt by approximately $800 million during the quarter. With respect to capital return MPC returned $380 million to shareholders through our dividend and repurchased $981 million worth of shares using Speedway proceeds. At the end of the quarter, MPC had $17.3 billion in cash and higher returning short-term investments, such as commercial paper and certificates of deposit. Turning to guidance on Slide 14, we provide our third quarter outlook. We expect total throughput volumes of roughly 2.8 million barrels per day. Planned turnaround costs are projected to be approximately $195 million in the third quarter. The majority of the activity will be at our Robinson and Mandan refineries in the Mid-Con region. As we have previously mentioned, our turnaround activity is back half weighted this year. Other operating expenses are coordinated to occur during these time periods as well. And so you are seeing the impact in our guided costumes for the third quarter. Total operating costs are projected to be $5.05 per barrel for the quarter. Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $175 million consistent with the second quarter and reflecting the approximately $100 billion – $100 million, excuse me, in costs that have been removed on an annual basis. With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.
Kristina Kazarian: Thanks, Maryann. As we open the call for questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up, if time permits we will be prompt for additional questions. We will now open the call to questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Neil Mehta: Good morning, team, and nice results here this quarter. The first question I had was just about the execution of capital returns. As you said, you have $9 billion to return to capital – capital to return back to shareholders here over the next 12 to 16 months. Is it fair to say it's going to be in the form of a buyback? And will you be executing it just ratably in the market? Just talk a little bit about how you plan on executing it? And is there any consideration of anything other than a buyback for the capital returns?
Maryann Mannen: Sure, Neil. Hi. it's Maryann and good morning. Yes, we are planning on commencing what we would call our open market repurchase program and that will begin here immediately after the call. We have all of those options that we've shared with you in the past, all of the tools, ASR and open-market purchase, including the possibility for a tender. Those still remain all viable options for us, but we believe right now that the best way for us to achieve that commitment and as we reiterated here on the call, in the next 12 to 16 months and to return that remaining $9 billion would be through an open-market purchase program right now.
Neil Mehta: And Maryann, as you guys think about that repurchase, is the view that you would want to do it ratably? Or do you want to be opportunistic? Do you believe that the right approach to share repurchases is cost averaging in over the next 12 to 16 months or to be opportunistic on volatility? Just talk about your strategy around execution?
Maryann Mannen: Sure, Neil. I think, look, the reason why we're using an open-market repurchase program is we believe we have some control over that and certainly using an opportunistic approach over this time period is the approach that we believe is best for us during this time period. So certainly, we would be using an opportunistic approach during this time period.
Neil Mehta: All right. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. You may proceed.
Doug Leggate: Yes, thank you. Good morning, everybody. Mike, there is – I guess, there's murmurings that the Biden administration could take a hard look at partnership structures for MLPs. I'm just curious if you can offer any perspective on how it might change your thoughts around your ownership structure and the current strategy around MPLX, if something like that plays out?
Mike Hennigan: Yes, Doug, it's a good question. So obviously, with the administration change and with the agenda that they have out there, they're looking for ways to pay for the programs that they have in place. So we're aware of the potential there. Obviously, there's a couple bills that are involved with that dynamic. I would tell you, right now, our thinking though, is that we would stay in the MLP structure because we don't think it's going to change. We don't know for sure. Obviously, if it did lose its tax status, it would change our dynamic. But right now, Doug, if you're asking what's the probability, I think we are on the side of – we don't think it is going to change, and we think the partnership will still maintain its tax status. So obviously, for the size of the MLP that we have, if all of a sudden, it was a taxed entity you're looking at around $800 million to $1 billion of cash flow that would be lost. And I know others have asked this in the past. I mean, it's predominantly the number one reason why we maintain the partnership structure as compared to converting to a C corp. There's two dynamics that come into play. One is an immediate tax impact to all unitholders, of which MPC is the largest, obviously. And then, more importantly is to the ongoing cash flow change that would occur at MPLX. So we understand some of the pros and cons of the structure. At the same time, we think having that cash flow keeps us in the MLP mode. So obviously, if the rules change, if the administration does something different, we'll adapt accordingly. But in the short term, we still support the structure because it gives us that additional cash flow as opposed to a tax burden.
Doug Leggate: Yes, presumably, you're not aware of any discussions that you've had then with the administration around this particular issue.
Mike Hennigan: No, I mean, we know that there's some advocacies for it and some that are against it. Our intel is that we think at the end of the day, the partnership status will stay the way it is. But I'm not trying to call politics here, Doug. Whatever happens, we'll adjust to it, but for right now, we think the MLP structure will stay the way it is. 
Doug Leggate: Thank you. Mike, my follow-up is, I guess, as a follow-on to the question on buybacks just to kind of put some numbers to you that I'm sure you're very familiar with. Your market capitalization, obviously, mid-30s, you strip out your share of the publicly traded value of MPLX. And what you're left with there's a value of around $15 billion, $16 billion, which implies that the remaining buyback would be more than half of the current market capitalization. Clearly, that's impactful. I'm just wondering if you can frame for us how you would intend to tackle a buyback of that scale when you think about it that way? I know you've touched on that a little bit, but when you put microchip in context, is it big enough. Just curious how you think about moving that forward over the next 16 months.
Mike Hennigan: Yes, Doug, I would say it's a good problem to have. We are committed – as Maryann said in her remarks, we are committed to returning capital. At the end of the day, we – for a long time, we were saying about $16.5 billion. I mean, now that we've closed and worked through some of the details, it's a little over $17 billion. We have prioritized the balance sheet. We've taken out some debt there. We've maintained some dry powder to see how things continue to play out, and we've committed to $10 billion. So throughout the time from the announcement to close, we reiterated to investors that we wanted to do it as quickly and efficiently as possible. To meet our commitment of quickly, we offered a Dutch tender. The market spoke and said $1 billion as opposed to what we had offered out as far as the total liquidity. Now we are, as Maryann said in the remarks, we're going to go more opportunistic and be in an open market environment. So some of the questions that we get from people is are we still committed to that? And as Maryann said, we want to reiterate, we are committed to that. Nothing has changed in our thought process there. It is going to take time. To your point, it is a large number. We are limited by the amount of trading volume we have and the liquidity that we have in our shares. So that is part of the constraint that we have, but we are committed to returning it. And we're going to go into this program, and obviously, each quarter, we'll update the market on the results.
Doug Leggate: Thanks, Mike, for taking my questions.
Mike Hennigan: You're welcome, Doug. Thank you.
Operator: Next, we will hear from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Roger Read: Yes, thank you. Good morning. Let me take a quick detour over to the renewable diesel side of the business. Obviously, you've got the North Dakota Dickinson facility up and running. I was curious is it running off soybean oil? If you could give us any incremental views on its contribution to the Mid-Continent profit that we saw improve this quarter? And then, on the start-up in Martinez, what do you expect the feedstocks to be there?
Mike Hennigan: So it's a good question, Roger. I'm going to let Ray give you some specific on Dickinson? Go ahead, Ray.
Ray Brooks: Good morning, Roger, this is Ray Brooks. Just want to talk a little bit about Dickinson and how it's running. As you alluded, Dickinson is up and running now. During the second quarter, we did reach our design capacity of 180 million gallons a year, good news, and we're happy about that. The other thing operationally is we did reach the yields of renewable diesel we were seeking to get in the mid-90s, and so we're happy about that. As far as feedstocks, the design for Dickinson was basically an 80:20 mix of soybean oil and distilled corn oil. And as you probably know, the soybean oil economics are challenged right now. What I'm really proud of the team is doing is we're seeking every day to optimize a few things. First, optimize the operation of the facility to get to the lowest carbon intensity from our operations, and then, we're also optimizing the feed slate within the – from the design basis and we're having some success in that regard. So that's really how Dickinson is running. And right now, it's – like I said, it's up running, and it's the second-largest renewable diesel plant in the United States.
Mike Hennigan: Roger, it's Mike again. I was just going to say to your second question on Martinez, we're not going to disclose at this point what we're thinking about as far as the feedstocks. That's still in discussion with many players. So I can't really comment on that other than what we said in our prepared remarks that the engineering is going well, the permitting is going well. We still feel really good about the project from a lot of aspects. So we'll give you more color on that as time goes by.
Roger Read: Okay, great. And then, a follow-up question, maybe for you, Maryann, just because you made the comment about natural gas prices being up. Are there any other inflationary aspects we need to watch for in the R&M sector here? I know you've got your overall goal to cut costs and some progress there, but there's always an offset unfortunately. I was just curious what else may be pushing against you there, recognizing, of course, that natural gas can go down about as quickly as it goes up. 
Maryann Mannen: Yes, you're right. And certainly, as we see it right now, we're looking at it as a tailwind that is natural gas to the third quarter. I would say to your first question around any other specific inflationary aspects, there's nothing – obviously, we didn't point to anything. There's really nothing of significance that we see at this juncture that would have a negative impact on the third quarter.
Roger Read: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Manav Gupta: So Mike, first, congratulations. I know you took over during the pandemic, but one thing which you took over when you stressed was everything has to be free cash flow in the portfolio and refining was free cash flow positive. I think, you made about $500 million or $600 million in free cash, so congratulations on achieving that goal.
Mike Hennigan: Thanks, Manav. 
Manav Gupta: My question here is on those lines. If I look at your current dividend obligation about $1.3 billion and then, I look at the cash that MPLX is giving you about $1.8 billion, and you look at the corporate and expenses of like $175 million a quarter, like essentially, where we are in the equation? Even if refining only contributes like $100 million to $200 million to overall free cash flow, you can meet your dividend obligation. And once you do execute this buyback there's like $320 million or so dividend obligation reduction. So what I'm trying to get to is, not that refining will not make a positive free cash flow but you actually do not need a positive refining free cash flow to meet the dividend obligation. Am I thinking about these parameters correctly?
Mike Hennigan: Yes, Manav, you are in general. I think, one of the things that sometimes people miss is our relationship with MPLX as you're pointing out. So at the current distribution level at MPLX, we do get that $1.8 billion coming back into MPC. So I think you're right. It's one of the uniquenesses that's a positive of the structure that we have. Right today, MPLX is generating excess cash flow beyond capital and distribution as well. So financial flexibility is increasing at the partnership as well. So I think, we're in a pretty good position from that standpoint, and I think you're thinking about it right.
Manav Gupta: Okay. And the quick follow-up here is, I mean, you have done a – the team has done a very good job of lowering OpEx per barrel. It is about 25% down year over year. So besides the closure of the two assets, Gallup and Martinez, which are the other assets or part of the portfolio in the refining, whether it was Galveston Bay or wherever, where these material reductions have come in, which is allowing you to push the OpEx per barrel down? 
Mike Hennigan: Yes, Manav, it's really occurred across the whole portfolio. Ray and the refining team have done a really nice job on that side. All the support functions on the corporate side have done as well. So it is part of my DNA to be very, very conscious about cost. The team knows that's going to be a high priority for us all the time. In fact, if anything, Maryann just mentioned, as refining runs have come back up kind of with the recovery, variable costs have come up, but we've been able to maintain a pretty consistent level of OpEx there. So that's been a good story for us. We do have, again, natural gas potentially going up. But overall, we're going to continue to challenge the portfolio, both on the refining side of the business, also in the midstream side of the business. For those who listened to the MPLX call, we had originally stated about $200 million of cost reductions at MPLX. We've now increased that to about $300 million, about another $100 million that we feel pretty comfortable that we can take out of that business as well. So it's going to continue to be an area of focus for us. That's never going to change. We'll look for opportunities for us to optimize our system where we can. And back to your original point, we did have a couple closures. They were our highest cost facilities, but we're going to continue to evaluate the portfolio. I've said a couple times to people that I want to get out of this pandemic environment to see what things look like afterwards, but we are still evaluating all assets of the portfolio. And to your point, and I'm glad you remember that is I am a driver that all of our assets need to generate free cash flow. That's a mantra that I believe in, and we're hoping that we have that in our portfolio at all times. 
Manav Gupta: Thank you so much for taking my questions.
Mike Hennigan: You're welcome, Manav.
Operator: Our next question will come from Phil Gresh with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Phil Gresh: Yes, hi, good morning. First question, just one additional one on the buybacks. The proceeds, as you noted, were $700 million higher than expected. I think, you still have a $2 billion-plus tax refund coming here in the third quarter. So how should we think about the ability over time to potentially exceed the $10 billion buyback target? Or perhaps another way of asking the question is, are there other uses you would see for the cash besides returning capital to shareholders, given what you've said about the balance sheet in the past?
Maryann Mannen: Hey, Phil, it's Maryann. Thanks for the question. Yes, as you know, as we've been sharing with you the use of proceeds, we've really just been focused on the $10 billion capital return. As you state very clearly, we know we have roughly $2.1 billion coming back from the CARES Act. We continue to expect to receive the lion's share of that in and about the third quarter – late in the third quarter, frankly, is our expectation. So you're right, we will have the remaining proceeds, as well as the incremental $2 billion that we'll continue to evaluate and make good decision really around whether or not that would go in the form of capital return. But we've not really declared beyond that initial $10 billion right now as we continue to look at the balance sheet. I think, you know the – obviously, our intent also was to ensure that we maintained investment grade as you hopefully you've seen the three rating agencies did reconfirm that. So we do have investment grade again on – by all three of those agencies. We certainly will continue to focus on the balance sheet and be sure that that maintains a nimble, if you will. But again, that use of proceeds will continue to evaluate as we go forward.
Phil Gresh: To clarify, there's no change to the absolute debt or cash balance targets you've set in the past?
Maryann. Mannen: That’s right. Right, now for MPC, we've got about $9 billion of long-term debt. As we shared with you initially, we took $2.5 billion off immediately, frankly, as you saw in the quarter; we actually did a bit more than that a little over 800. We really cleared in anything that was sitting on our revolver as well. We'll continue to evaluate that. But at this point, we as you know, we were trying to be efficient about that. So we've not moved anything beyond that initial $2.5 billion of debt reduction.
Phil Gresh: Got it. Okay. A follow-up, just one more on the operating cost equation. With $5 a barrel of OpEx here in the third quarter and the fact that OpEx is lower 2021 over 2020 despite higher throughput and higher Nat gas. Where do you feel we are, I guess this is for Mike in the cost reduction journey here? Particularly as you benchmark to peers there are obviously regional differences to consider across portfolios, but how far along do you think we are when you look at what peers are doing?
Mike Hennigan: Yes. So how far along is, is always a tough question because like I said earlier it's a never ending game. So we're going to continue to challenge ourselves. We'll look for incremental improvements from here. Obviously we've gotten the lion's share of book. We originally targeted to get, but it's something that we're going to continue. It's going to be part of our DNA, that we're going to look at every opportunity, every chance we get to continue to push that down. I am a believer that in this business, we need to be a low cost operator. The team deserves a lot of credit to get after that. And we've made some meaningful change, but we're not done. I'll quote Ray from the last call, we're not in the first inning and we're not in the ninth inning. So the game is still being played and it'll continue to be played. And we'll just obviously challenge ourselves all the time to see where we can run ourselves at as lean of opportunity as we can without sacrificing safety; that's another really important mantra. We're not going to put anybody at jeopardy, but we're going to run as lean as we can. And I just, my guidance to you is keep watching our results and keep talking about it. And as we have additional disclosures to tell you what's happening, we'll bring those up quarter-to-quarter. Like I just mentioned earlier midstream has just moved from a sustainable $200 million down to $300 million down. So we feel good about that. We're now telling people that we were comfortable with that number. Still challenging it in the midstream space as well; so we're going to keep the eye on the ball as far as our costs, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to be as lean as we can be.
Phil Gresh: Yes. Thanks for the thoughts.
Mike Hennigan: You're welcome, Phil.
Operator: Our next question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Your line is open.
Theresa Chen: Good morning. I wanted to maybe first ask about the refining macro landscape given that demand has recovered completely on the diesel front and mostly on the gasoline front; and with the utilization that you achieved in the second quarter as well as the guidance for the third quarter, it seems to indicate a relatively optimistic outlook for the near-term. So would you agree with that? And just generally, what are your views on refining profitability in the second half? And related to your comments about jet demand being off 30% or so, still is that what's capping the utilization guidance from here?
Mike Hennigan: Yes. Theresa, sorry, I'll let the other guys jump in. I guess the term we use was hopeful, but cautious. So we are hopeful that we are recovering and continue to do so. What we've seen obviously, over the last year has been a very tough environment that we're coming out of particularly in the U.S. The reason we're still cautious, however, is the Delta variant is spiking up in a lot of areas. Outside the U.S. is a much more difficult environment than inside the U.S. today. And then you pointed out a couple of things. Jet fuel is still lagging in our view, and that'll continue to lag for some time, but eventually it will come back. But for right now, it is still lagging, and the other one that we pointed out was the west coast is still lagging. So we're going to have to see Theresa, to be honest with you, we're going to have to see how the COVID, plays itself out into the second half of the year. And as we approach another winter season if, if there continues to be increased infection, obviously there's going to be some restraint on the demand as a result like we've seen before. Hopefully not, hopefully people are seeing this variant spread and vaccination rates will increase from where they are today. I think there was a good responses originally, but I think it needs to go to another level. So we're obviously hopeful that people will take caution and get vaccinated. But in general, I mean, we have the same outlook that I think you and others have is that's why we use the word hopeful that we're recovering; coming out of this, but cautious that we still have some road to plow. And anybody wants to add. Nobody wants to add.
Theresa Chen: Fair enough. And my second question is related to the Martinez conversion and following up on something that came up in a midstream call about housing some of the assets within MPLX, just in light of the midstream entity throwing off good free cash flow with healthy balance sheet currently, and needing to insulate its own terminal value. When we think about some of the bigger ticket items that you have to spend on such as the pre-treatment unit, or even the conversion of from the processing units, would it – would you have the flexibility to decide between MPLX participating at cost or dropping down once fully cash flowing. Is there a preference at this point between the two? If that is the fast-forward and just on the ladder, if you drop things down once fully cash flowing thinking, I think this is, I believe, your previous strategy with cap line and keeping that upstairs until it is fully reversed. Because when you boil it all down for Martinez, I imagine this would really didn't leave like a pretty meaningfully different amount of capital that MPLX could contribute to fund the project?
Mike Hennigan: That was a long one there, Theresa. Let me see if I can break it apart. I think that the main message that you're asking is we do have a unique structure that enables us to look to create value for both MPC shareholders and NPLS unit holders. So there is no rule of thumb to what you stated earlier, it's case by case basis. There's a lot of specifics to go into it. The dynamics of each of the individual opportunities, but we do have that ability to sit down and figure out how we can create value on both sides. So, obviously it's our goal to create value at MPC and MPLX and having the flexibility between the two structures, enables that. But I do want to leave you with, there's not a rule of thumb. There's not a, hey, this is the way we do this. Every instance gets its own debate and discussion, and we decide what we think is the best to create the most value.
Theresa Chen: Thank you.
Mike Hennigan: You're welcome.
Operator: Next we will hear from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is open.
Kristina Kazarian: Hey Paul, are you there with us today? Are you on mute by any chance, Paul? All right. Operator, let's move to the next caller and then we can have Paul re-prompt if you're with us, Paul.
Operator: Thank you. Next, then we will hear from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.
Sam Margolin: Good morning. Thank you.
Mike Hennigan: Good morning, Sam.
Sam Margolin: Question on Martinez and the initial start-up; I just wonder how you're thinking about its performance in the period before the pre-treatment unit starts-up and I'll contextualize it with something, when your peer said, which is that there's an expectation that feedstock might eventually price itself on CI score, similar to the way that within the refining complex commodities price on sort of their end market value. And so I was just wondering if you're thinking about that as a possible outcome, and whether that may make operations before the PTU starts up a little easier? Or whether the expectation is really that Martinez shouldn't enter kind of a run rate profitability until that PTU is going?
Ray Brooks: Hey, Sam, this is this is Ray, and I'll take your question. You're right. As we develop the Martinez project and it comes on and phases – the different phases will have a different feedstock mix. And so Phase I essentially as we come on with the initial hydroprocessing unit that is going to be without the pre-treatment system. I don't want to get, like Mike said; I don't want to get into too much of the feedstock slate. What I would like to emphasize though is, is we have a lot of optionality around how we receive feedstock between truck and rail and water and ability without having to pre-treatment system still to optimize that – optimize that mix? The other thing I'll talk about Martinez, whether it's Phase 1 or Phase 2, Phase 3 is we did our – when we looked at this project, we looked at it with different feedstock capabilities and the most conservative feedstock availability, and for Phase 1. And we still feel good about the project, even with a – if it was a very strong soybean oil-based slate, but like said we're going to work to optimize around all the logistics assets, the capabilities that Martinez offers us. 
Mike Hennigan: Sam, its Mike. I'm just going to add to what Ray said. I mean, I know your question is depending on where the market goes? But the thing that makes us feel really good about Martinez is several factors. One, we think we have a really competitive CapEx and OpEx situation, and that was one of the major drivers when we looked at this. Second as Ray just mentioned, we have really, really strong logistics; pipeline, rail, water, truck, we have a lot of opportunity there to provide value. And then the ultimate logistics is we're in California, where we're sitting on the demand. So location also matters. So regardless of what happens in the marketplace and it will ebb and flow just like every other commodity market? The reason we're so bullish on our Martinez asset is those factors that are in place day in and day out. The OpEx that we're going to run, the CapEx that it takes to get there, the logistics that we have, the location that we have, all of those play to our favor regardless of how the commodity move day-to-day; I hope that makes sense.
Sam Margolin: Yes. Understood. And then just to follow-up on RINs and the RVO. MPC's advantaged because you satisfy your D6 obligation through blending, but there's some elements of that that are hard to follow in terms of realizations because marketing outcomes have different RINs effects embedded in them. So I was wondering if there's anything you can share about just sort of the net effect of blending on the gasoline side and how you navigate it. Just the volatile RINs environment and maybe what that means on sort of a go-forward basis? Thanks.
Brian Partee: Yes, Sam, this is Brian Partee. I can take that question. So, first thing I would do is actually zoom out just a little bit and think about a blended sale is actually further down the value chain. So it's naturally going to be a higher margin sales and say a bulk sale that doesn't have a rant or a blend component to it. So we've stated publicly that we're in that 70% to 75% from blend perspective from an RBO. So we're just naturally further down the value chain. I think you hit on a couple of things, though. The volatility is important. So the RVO is a 12 months compliance window, and it's really how you execute your compliance strategy. And it's the volatility in – actually in the high RIN environment that we're in now provides opportunities for probably an outperform or an underperformed depending on the execution of your compliance program and we meet those obligations. So that is something that's probably not been as transparent to the marketplace as we are historically around in nickel, or so. On RIN that now in this environment, it does provide an opportunity. Its high risk high reward, but we feel confident with our ability to execute both from a blended perspective of what we blend, but also on the compliance program?
Sam Margolin: Thanks so much.
Brian Partee: You bet.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Your line is open.
Jason Gabelman: Yes. Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I'll actually try to ask the question, Sam just asked a little differently, which is I've you seen the value proposition for blending biofuels change in this environment relative to where it was in 2018, 2019, or is the value benefits still there, meaning that it blending offsets the financial costs of having to go out and buying RINs because it's been suggested that the value proposition has changed a bit for various reasons.
Brian Partee: Yes. Jason, this is Brian Partee, and yes, I can take that. I think the great debate is the pass-through of the rant and the RFS costs, and it's very difficult to empirically point to that as a pass through. So, again, I'll fall back on the execution side of things. And I think that's really where the performance live, but it's very difficult to pinpoint any difference between the data points that you referenced back in 2018 to today, till today, It really gets boiled down to the execution side of thing?
Jason Gabelman: Okay. and then just a quick account question. There was about an $82 million benefit from other income, other income, excuse me, and refining a marketing margin that appears like the first time it's been there. Can you just discuss what drove that?
Maryann Mannen: I'm sorry, Jason, its Maryann. Could you repeat your question again? You're saying an $82 million benefit in the, in the quarter. I'm sorry, I'm not following you question.
Jason Gabelman: Yes. For the quarter, and the line item other income included in refining a marketing margin.
Maryann Mannen: Yes. Jason, we'll take a look at that for you and we'll come back to you. How's that?
Jason Gabelman: Okay, All right. That's great. Thanks.
Maryann Mannen: Yes.
Operator: Thank you. 
Kristina Kazarian: All right, Sheila, if there are no other questions in the queue today, we wanted to thank everyone for joining us. If you do have any outstanding questions, please feel free to reach out to our team at any point in time, and we will be here to help. Thank you everyone for joining our call today and have a great day.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-04 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MPC First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. My name is Sheila, and I will be your operator for today’s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  Please note that this conference is being recorded.
Kristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation’s first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com, under the Investors tab. Joining me on the call today are: Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO; and other members of the Executive Team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our SEC filings. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Mike.
Michael Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina, and thank you for joining our call this morning. Before we get into our results for the quarter, we wanted to provide a brief update on the business. During the first quarter, our industry continued to struggle with reduction in global economic activity and demand for transportation fuels that resulted from the mobility restrictions related to COVID-19 pandemic. As we started the second quarter, with the rollout of vaccination, we still see industry-wide gasoline demand down around 5% from historical levels and jet demand down around 25% to 30%. To the extent that a pent-up desire to travel starts to brighten the macro-outlook for our business, our team and our assets are poised to take advantage of these opportunities. But in the meantime, as the challenging backdrop holds, we’ll continue to concentrate on the elements of our business that are within our control. Our near-term priorities remain the same. Each quarter, we’re focused on strengthening the competitive position of our assets, improving our commercial performance and lowering our cost structure. Slide 4 highlights some of our actions around our strategic priorities this quarter. First, we’re close to completion on the sale of our Speedway business. Second, we continue to take steps to reposition our portfolio. Our Board of Directors approved our plans to convert our Martinez assets to a 48,000 barrel per day renewable facility. We expect commissioning of Martinez to begin in the second half of 2022 with approximately 17,000 barrels per day of capacity. Additionally, we expect to reach full capacity of approximately 48,000 barrels a day by the end of 2023. In line with our commitment to lowering the carbon intensity of our operations and products, we’re planning to install wind turbine generators at Dickinson facility. Sourcing electricity from wind will lower the carbon intensity of the renewable diesel product at that facility. We’ll continue to seek out the right opportunity for investing and partnering on renewables and evolving technologies.
Maryann Mannen: Thanks, Mike. Slide 8 provides a summary of our first quarter financial results. This morning, we reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.20. Adjusted EBITDA was $1,552 million for the quarter. This includes results from both continuing and discontinued operations. Cash from continuing operations, excluding working capital was $613 million, which is a nearly $500 million increase since the prior quarter. It’s also marked the first time since the start of the pandemic that cash from continuing operations has been above our quarterly dividend payments, which was $379 million. Slide 9 shows the reconciliation from net income to adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from fourth quarter 2020 to first quarter 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was nearly $650 million more quarter-over-quarter driven primarily by higher earnings in refining and marketing. As a reminder, both the fourth and first quarter results reflect Speedway as a discontinued operation. Moving to our segment results, Slide 10 provides an overview of our refining and marketing segment. The business reported positive EBITDA for the first time since the start of the COVID pandemic with first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $23 million. This was an increase of $725 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase was driven primarily by higher refining margins, which were considerably improved across all regions in the first quarter, as compared to the fourth quarter. Total utilization for refining was 83%, which was roughly flat with the fourth quarter utilization of 82%.
Kristina Kazarian: Thanks, Maryann. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and a follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions. We will now open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from Doug Leggett with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Doug Leggett: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Mike, I wonder if I could ask about the return of cash. I know it’s kind of a routine question that comes up for every quarter. But you talked about the appropriate level of leverage. I’m wondering if that’s – how that’s changed or what the latest thinking in there as to what the outlook is like. And then, as a as a kind of follow on to that, when you think about buybacks, how big of a consideration is lowering the dividend burden on the ex-Speedway refining and midstream business? So I’m just, well – so, basically, debt level and buybacks, I realize MPLX’s share price has  , so that’s probably off the table anyway.
Michael Hennigan: Yeah, thanks, Doug. I’ll start and I’ll let Maryann jump in. So throughout this process, we’ve been getting a question about what those appropriate leverage mean. When we pick a metric, we’ve been saying 1 to 1.5 times mid-cycle. And then everybody says, well then what do you think about mid-cycle? And my standard answer is, I don’t think about the 50 yard line, I think about the banks of the river. And I try and do scenario planning around what we think could be good times and bad times. Obviously, everybody is excited about vaccine rollouts and getting recovery here, and certainly the market is moving in that direction. At the same time, Doug, in our prepared remarks, we said, gasoline demand is still 5% lower year-on-year overall. The West Coast is still considerably down compared to the other areas.
Maryann Mannen: Doug, I think Mike covered it quite comprehensively. Just a couple of other additions, as we continue to say it was our objective and continues to be to maintain an investment-grade balance sheet, as you’ve seen and Mike talked about. Fitch has already confirmed that. So another key variable that we will continue to consider, we want to be sure that the debt repayment is efficient. But other than that, I think Mike has covered the comments quite well. And that, so the only other thing I’d add is, we have committed, we’ve restated it many times that once we get too close, we’ll provide some more details. We’re getting really close. And hopefully that’s not too far away from now. But we’ve been resistant to doing it ahead of time. So we’re just – soon as we get close, we’ll give a little more color to the market and then continue to communicate the way we have been, I think.
Doug Leggett: So, Michael, just for clarity, to be clear on my point about dividend, we’re obviously losing substantial cash coverage for dividend. Should we expect some kind of accelerated buyback to accelerate the reduction in that dividend burden, or how are you thinking about that?
Michael Hennigan: Yeah, big picture, Doug, we believe in our dividend and we think we have a competitive dividend. Obviously, we’re going to reduce share count as a result of this. How that gets reduced is still to be seen, as far as you know the way this lays itself out and where the share price is over time. But we are committed to a competitive dividend. That’s something that we’ve had in our mind all throughout this process. We’ll see at the end of the return, where we end up as far as share count, and then kind of evaluate where we are. But hopefully, the takeaway that you’ve seen from this is we’re committed to our dividend, we do believe in returning capital, we have a nice opportunity here that’s unique as a result of this sale, and that return of capital will be a little bit of a differentiating factor for us for some time here.
Doug Leggett: Today – well, thanks for that, Mike. My follow up, I want to be respectful to everyone else. I’ll be real quick here. The cost structure, most likely you’re making big holes or big strides in getting your cost down. But you haven’t talked much about the broader portfolio review or restructuring. One of your competitors suggested the other day that if the RFS doesn’t get resolved one way or the other we could see further rationalization of refining capacity. So I just wonder if you could bring us up to date with the overall portfolio review and stickiness of the cost reductions you’ve achieved so far. Thanks.
Michael Hennigan: Yeah, Doug, on the portfolio, we decided very early on that 2 two facilities that we idled, we did not see being long-term assets for us. We do have an ongoing portfolio assessment. But we did pause a little bit, because we want to kind of get through this pandemic, and see what the other side looks like and what the new normal looks like. So, we still have ongoing work internally on portfolio, nothing that we’re ready to disclose yet, but a conscious decision on our part to kind of pause, as we went through this pandemic, and start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. And I know everybody’s anxious to get this behind us. And hopefully, we’re getting really close. The vaccine rollouts have gone very well. We’ll get a little better sense of what a new normal looks like and kind of do a final check on what we think about the portfolio in general. But so, in the near-term nothing to announce right now. We’ll get through this new normal. We’ll see what that looks like. But I will tell you, Doug, it’s going to be an ongoing effort on our part, to continue to ask ourselves all the time, where is our cost structure, how’s it evolving, what are the assets that we have in the portfolio, because we are believer that over time this energy evolution will continue to play itself out. And as it does, we’re going to be adapted to the market. And obviously, one of the high priorities that we put on ourselves was to get our cost structure down, so that in our base business, we were in a much more competitive position. And I think we’ve done that to some extent. And that’s not going to be an effort that we give up on. We’re going to continue to do that. In fact, I often get asked the question, what inning are we in in that regard? And, overall, you know, I think, Ray and his team on the refining side are going to continue to look at it. In fact, I’ll let Ray make a comment as to where we are on cost as well. So hopefully, that answers you on portfolio. But let me let Ray make a comment on cost.
Raymond Brooks: Yeah, Mike brought up about what inning we’re in. And I’d have to say we’re not in the first inning and we’re not in the ninth inning. So we challenge ourselves every day. What can we do to take more discretionary cost out of our system? Hey, the biggest thing that we did early on, and you kind of alluded to that is we took some of our high cost facilities out of the system. And on the West Coast, you have seen that quarter-over-quarter as we idled the Martinez refinery as an oil refinery. And through the subsequent quarters, we completed a majority of the idling costs. And, going forward, Doug, we just continue to look at efficiency cost savings every day, while maintaining our emphasis towards safe and reliable operations for our assets. Those are non-negotiable. Discretionary spending is negotiable.
Doug Leggett: Thanks, guys.
Michael Hennigan: You’re welcome, Doug.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Neil Mehta: Good morning, team. I just want to build on some of your comments in the prepared remarks on the Speedway transaction. Mike, it sounds like you’re really close and just want to get some clarity. What really close means from your perspective? Are we talking days? Are we talking months? Are we talking quarters? And in terms of the gating factors, just maybe you talk about what are the things we should be monitoring from a closure perspective?
Michael Hennigan: And that’s a good way to frame it. I think the best way to answer it is exactly the way you set it up, is what we believe at this point is that we’re in weeks, not months. We’re not days, it’s not going to be tomorrow, the next day, but we think we are down to weeks. And, what we’ve tried to do in this process is to be an intermarried communication tool, because it’s really between the FTC and 7-Eleven. Obviously, we’re at the table trying to understand if we can help the process at all. But, I guess, the best way to describe it is the FTC communicated to us that we’re in the final stage of the process. So with that in mind, we think we’re within weeks. I guess that’s the best way to give you our sense of it. We don’t think we’re months. We don’t think we’re days. But we think we’re very, very close. And that’s why we chose the word close to completion. I hope that helps you. And I know everybody’s anxious for us to get the next set of disclosures relative to this. We’re also anxious to do that. This has been a process. It’s taken a long time. I’m hoping the market appreciates that we tried to be as transparent as we can. We thought for a long time there, we thought we were going to hit by the end of the quarter. That kind of came and went a little bit, process takes a little bit longer sometimes when you get into the details at the end. But we are very, very close. And hopefully, we’re talking within weeks.
Neil Mehta: Yeah, that conviction comes through, so thank you, that’s great, Mike. And the follow-up is on Martinez. Maybe you could just step back and talk about the renewable diesel project. And if you could level set us sort of how you think about the total capital associated with the project to the extent you can provide it? I think you’ve given the guidance for $350 million of renewable spend this year, but just sort of the total spend associated with the project? And how should we think about the returns associated with this project? And there are a lot of moving pieces, but the biggest fear, I guess, is the soybean prices continue to move higher, so how do you manage the feedstock flexibility to ensure this is a good through-the-cycle investment?
Michael Hennigan: Yeah, it’s a great question, Neil. And obviously, we’ve communicated that we’ve gotten full Board support for this project. So I’ll let Ray start off, give you some color on how we’re thinking about it. And then, let Brian and Dave jump in as needed on feedstock, et cetera. So go ahead, Ray.
Raymond Brooks: Sure, Mike. From a project standpoint, I’d like to give a little bit of color on where we stand from a timing schedule standpoint. At this point, Phase 1, we’re targeting completion in the second half of next year 2022. And that would be for 17,000 barrels of renewable fuels coming online. And then, that would be followed up by pretreatment in 2023. And then, finally, the rest of the facility, the back half at 2023 for a total of 48,000 barrels for renewable diesel, renewable fuels production. Now, if I go back to Doug’s comment or question before as far as OpEx, I commented that Martinez was a very high cost oil refinery. But there are some real gems at Martinez that make it a very good project for us from a renewable fuel standpoint, 300 processing units, 2 hydrogen plants, the infrastructure that provides us the ability to have a very cost competitive Brownfield project. And so, I can’t give a lot more CapEx guidance. And you’ve already alluded to, but we’re very excited about this project. And just what we’ve done in the last quarter in Q1, we progressed our engineering work toward the end of definition engineering, and have also made a lot of progress on our permitting efforts with regards to getting the environmental impact report kick-started and out for review in the near-term.
Michael Hennigan: Yeah, Neil, I’ll turn it over to the commercial guys in a second. Just I guess one way to think about it is there are 3 major hurdles the way we think about this project, do we have the right location and logistics. And obviously, Martinez is sitting on the demand. Dickinson on the other hand is very close to supply. So we like our location and our renewables facilities. Ray just mentioned, the second big hurdle is capital, operating expense, basically, what do you think of the hardware. And Ray just described it, the full asset facility was relatively high cost. But the real gem, as he mentioned, was in the hydroprocessing area. So, it became obvious to us that the best use of this asset was to put it in the service. And then the last piece of the puzzle is the one that’s ongoing and that’s feedstock optimization. And that’ll continue, so I’ll let the guys comment a little bit on that.
Brian Davis: Okay, hi, it’s Brian Davis here. So maybe just picking up the feedstock question, I think the first thing here is that Ray and his team have done a good job in creating sufficient optionality there through onsite pretreatment over time, but also the capability to receive feedstock by rail as well as by water. So that opens our commercial flexibility quite considerably. We’re evaluating a portfolio of options to give us the right mix of feedstocks, which will deliver value over the life of the project. We have a number of commercial negotiations underway with a wide range of suppliers. And we’ve been leveraging our existing capabilities and relationships, because we have been buying these feedstocks for a period of time for our existing biodiesel, and now more recently for Dickinson.
Neil Mehta: Okay, thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
Michael Hennigan: You’re welcome, Neil.
Operator: Our next question will come from Phil Gresh with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Phil Gresh: Yes, hi, good morning. My first question just be on the OpEx results on the West Coast. The OpEx per barrel there was even lower than it was in 2019 despite the fact that utilization is still pretty low here at this point. So maybe you could just, obviously, Martinez, I think is probably out of those numbers now. So maybe that’s the biggest factor. But any other things that we should think about as to the drivers of lower OpEx and how you think about the potential there as utilization ramps back up?
Raymond Brooks: Okay. I’ll go ahead and take this question. This is Ray. You’re right, Martinez is largely out of the OpEx number. There still is some residual OpEx for tank cleaning and work that we’ll carry on to this year. So there is a little bit of Martinez spend. I will say on the West Coast, Q1, quarter one was a challenging OpEx quarter, primarily because the energy costs put a big demand on us in the last part of February and early March. I will say, on the West Coast, we were partially able to mitigate the impact of those natural gas price spike, by reducing our natural gas purchase requirements to close to balance by producing more internal fuel from our operations. I think this was a real key for us, as far as managing the winter storm, not just in Texas, but across all of our operations. And I really got to give a shout out to our commercial group. Close coordination with our commercial group and the refineries really allowed us to pivot quickly. And on the day one natural gas went up by 100 fold, and adjust our operations, reduce our demand requirement for natural gas, and have as minimal of an impact on our OpEx as possible. So, that was across all of our system. It really was impactful on the West Coast as well. Aside from that, I’ll just go back to what I said earlier, as far as, every day we challenge ourselves, discretionary spending from got-to-do-stay-in-business type of spending. And that’s starting to show in the numbers.
Phil Gresh: Okay, great. That’s helpful. Thank you. My follow-up on renewable diesel, I guess, I’ll just try to glue these together very quickly. If you could just talk about how you feel things are going with the startup, so far Dickinson, what you’ve learned from that startup process? And then, just on the feedstock side of things, would you consider signing up for some kind of joint venture or something like that for soybean crush capacity, like we’ve seen from one of your peers? Is that one of the things you’re considering? Thank you.
Raymond Brooks: Okay, this is Ray again, and I’ll start off with the first thing as far as what we learn from startup. One of the things we learned, we already knew is that startups are hard. You don’t just push a button and everything works perfectly. But I will tell you, in the first quarter, we achieved 90% of our design capacity at Dickinson. And we also qualified and got a provisional score for our renewable feedstocks, which is soybean oil and corn oil. And, that’s a lower number than the temporary score that we start off with. But as you know, we’re not seeking to get to 90%. We want to get to 100% of capacity and get lower carbon-intensity score. So work has continued in that regard. We work with our licensor for the process and catalyst on a new catalyst formulation. We just actually did that work and it’s come back up. So we’re working towards getting better, getting toward a 100% yield, and exactly what we want from the project.
Brian Davis: Yeah. And, Phil, it’s Brian here. On your question about soybean crush capacity, et cetera. We’re looking at all options here. Clearly, we’re targeting advantage feedstocks as much as possible, but we think we’ll also – the industry will need to use soybean oil and its production as well. So, there are certainly considerations for putting in the commercial mix as we understand the right balance between gaining access to the right stage at the right price with security of supply.
Michael Hennigan: Yeah, Phil, it’s Mike. The only thing I’ll add kind of segue into what Neil had asked is, we really liked the project, Ray describes it well, we think we got really advantage hardware from CapEx and OpEx. We’re concentrating on the feedstock side of the equation now. We’re open to a lot of things, as Brian said, but we’re anxious to get this project online, we think it’s going to be a nice addition to our portfolio. And it really does optimize the assets that were available to us at Martinez, where we’re going to use the really strong ones for hydro processing, and then take out a lot of costs that were part of the facility from a crude processing standpoint.
Phil Gresh: Great. Thanks.
Michael Hennigan: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Roger Read: Thank you, and good morning.
Michael Hennigan: Good morning, Roger.
Roger Read: Just come back and take a shot here at the core refining business. So, like Doug mentioned earlier, the RFS, most of your peers have talked about it as being, RINs are general being quite the headwind to capture. Your capture was actually pretty good, I know, as Speedway is being separated, you’re trying to maintain as much as the owning capacity as possible. I’ll just curious if you could kind of break out maybe how your exposure to RINs is today, either pre or post the spin, and what impact you believe it had on Q1?
Brian Partee: Yeah, Roger, this is Brian Partee, I can address that question. So consistent with the past, we self-generate about 70% to 75% of our RIN through either   generation or biofuel refining asset. So Q1 was pretty similar to that historical average, as it relates to the separation in Speedway, no real impact there. The RIN is something that’s pretty transparent in the marketplace, it’s a real expense. We all have to deal with it. It’s not something we can control. We think of it like a commodity, we deal with commodity prices that are volatile and move dramatically up and down. And the one thing I’d leave you with on the RIN and the RIN expense, I know, there’s a lot of hyper focus on it and appropriately right now in the environment that we’re in. But, there’s also really good opportunity to optimize in that space, so depending on how you’re modeling and what you’re looking at, you have to think about RIN in terms of true obligated volume, obviously, not all gains are obligated. So if you think about stripping off exports, jet as well as some other   fuels. And for us, Alaska also is not an obligated state from an RVO perspective. The other thing that I think played out interestingly in the market in the first quarter was the year-on-year carry-in. So you can meet obligations in the prompt here with up to 20% of carry-ins from prior year. And, we think there’s far less carry-in from 2020 to 2021, largely due to the uncertainty around the election last fall. So, and then the last part about the commercialization in the RIN space is how you buy and when you buy, I would presume, maybe from a modeling perspective, assume kind of a ratable purchase for RIN. And that could be a strategy. And we try to be very commercial on this space and try to optimize, and obviously, the higher the RIN value gets the more opportunity there is to outperform in conversely underperforming that space.
Roger Read: Okay. Thanks. Another question I had, again, kind of sticking with the refining side of things. We’re hearing that some of the maintenance in Canada may not happen on quite the same pace, because of the COVID issues up there, which I guess might imply it’s a little more drawn out. But if you think about light, heavy, whether it’s in when U.S. or coastal U.S., what sort of updates can you offer there in terms of crude availability? What you’re seeing expectations on crude differentials?
Rick Hessling: Yeah. Hi, Roger. This is Rick Hessling. So the intel you’re getting in Canada or from Canada is spot on, we’re hearing the same thing. They’ve experienced some startup issues at a couple – with a couple of their maintenance projects, as well as we’re hearing 1 of the producers specifically is having some COVID issues. So that’s certainly not good for production in Canada. So we’ll continue to watch that specifically to Canada. In terms of differentials in Canada, I would point you towards, I still think, probably, your general rule of thumb is the forward market there, which is plus or minus $12. And the incremental barrel in Canada is moving out via rail, the pipes are full, so we expect that to continue. When you look worldwide and more so on the Gulf Coast, a lot of – there’s a lot of conversation around OPEC and the barrels that they’re releasing into the market. I’m a little more measured on OPEC, and what we might expect on the Gulf Coast than others. Quite frankly, when you look at what OPEC has done in the last several months, they’ve been very measured on how they’re managing their production with demand. And currently today, as you know, we’ve got a tug of war. There’s a little bit of slight optimism coming out of the West. And then there’s a lot of the fear of the unknown, which is well publicized in India, so we’ll just have to see how that plays out.
Roger Read: Great. Thank you.
Michael Hennigan: You’re welcome.
Operator: Our next question will come from the Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Manav Gupta: Hi, in your prepared remarks, you did indicate that while the demand is recovering, it’s the recovery – the pace of recovery is lower on the West Coast. I think, California is going for a full reopen around mid-June. So I’m just trying to understand going forward, do you see an improved demand recovery based on a full reopen in California?
Brian Partee: Yeah, Manav, this is Brian Partee, I can take that one. So, what I would say, it’s kind of reiterate Mike’s points that he made in his opening remarks. We have seen gasoline demand really grind back across the entire portfolio certainly the West Coast has lagged. In the East, we’ve been running over the last several weeks 2% to 5% off of 2019 comps. In the West, it’s been more in the 18, call it, high teens to low 20s. But we have seen a gradual grind back from the early part of this year, and you’re spot on, yes, California is prepared to reopen here mid-June. And just looking at some of the vaccination data and just anecdotal discussions in the market, we do expect meaningful recoveries through the summer months to what extent is very difficult to estimate. COVID has been a very dynamic environment for us, California has been very aggressive. So I’m really hesitant to make a call on where we expected to go. But we’ve seen favorable trends in other markets, as we’ve gotten back off and opened up the economies, we’d expect to see a degree of the same out in the West Coast.
Michael Hennigan: Manav, it’s Mike. The other thing that I would add is kind of what I said earlier is, once we get through this, and a lot of these states open up, I mean, California, as Brian just mentioned, a major indicator as to where you know that that market is going to be. But, Florida, New Jersey, New York, some other big gasoline consuming states are also in the process of reopening. The question becomes, where do we end up after that point? One of the things that I think we still need to see is there potential pent-up demand, is that one of the things that we’re going to see coming out of this, is there going to be a new normal with the way people operate as far as working remote operations, et cetera, et cetera. So, we’re excited that it continues to get better. But we’re also cautious as to what it’s going to mean, once we get to the other side of this. If anything, I would say, the way we try to think about it is, at the end of the day, vaccines are rolling out well, states are opening up, things are heading in the right direction to what absolute number is Brian just mentioned, where that ends up is still to be played out. And to your point, June, like you said, it’s going to occur in June, it’s essentially the second quarter will be over, we’ll be talking about results here, where we still don’t really have as much insight yet. So I think, it’s still going to play out a little bit more time, understand that pent-up demand, how much of it is robust to stay long-term, and how much of it is just short-term for people trying to get out from under the lockdown condition. So still a lot to learn, like I said, we concentrate on what we control, we’ll keep an eye on what we don’t control, and try and learn as much as we can as to what the new normal looks like.
Manav Gupta: Mike, 1 quick follow-up here, we saw you’re putting in some wind turbines on the Dickinson refinery to lower the carbon intensity. Clearly, you guys are focusing a lot on carbon intensity, and one on some of what your peers and others are doing is carbon capture and sequestration. Is it something which the MPC could look at potentially to further lower the carbon intensity of both gasoline and diesel that is producing in its refineries?
Michael Hennigan: Yeah, Manav, I think, I’ll let Brian and Dave jump in there. But, we are obviously cognizant of the value of lowering the carbon intensity of the operations of the product, et cetera. The wind situation is their concern, right, if you want to give a little more color there, or Dave if you want to give a total color on lowering carbon.
Brian Davis: Yeah, just to give you a little bit more detail on Dickinson and what we’re doing with the carbon intensity. The first thing that you mentioned is wind turbine, so that’s a project that we’re planning to go ahead with in 2022, to put enough wind turbines in there to provide about 50% of our electricity demand via renewable electricity, and that lowers the carbon intensity. The other thing that that we’re doing is we’ve got feed pretreatments now down at Beatrice, and that plant has started up that material has made its way to Dickinson. And so we now have pretreated corn oil that’s significant from a carbon intensity standpoint, that one it’s pretty treated, so it processes better. Secondly, it’s significantly lower carbon intensity than soybean oil.
David Heppner: Yes, this is David Heppner, just another comment would be, whether it be wind turbines or carbon capture and sequestration, those are all additional complimentary technologies to increase the value of the Dickinson project by lowering in CI. There’s other technologies such as renewable natural gas, solar and other technologies, we’re continuing to evaluate and will implement those if and when they make sense for us.
Manav Gupta: Thank you. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is open.
Paul Cheng: Hi. Thank you. Good morning, guys.
Michael Hennigan: Good morning, Paul.
Paul Cheng: I have 2 questions. If we’re looking at your cost structure, what are you put refining OpEx, the distribution costs and the corporate costs together or individually? They work really well in the first quarter. And you have done a great job there. I just curious that when I looking at your total throughput guidance is higher? Natural gas cost is lower in the second quarter, is there any reason, you said just being conservative or does a someone of reason why the second quarter unit cost upon in your refining actually going to be higher, and your OpEx costs and the distribution cost is also going to be higher? So that’s the first question. The second question is that going back into the ESG with the energy transition, what’s the longer term plan or objective? Are you going to take the initiative, essentially just trying to lower your own emission in CI, or that you’re looking at it as an opportunity for you to expand and perhaps that even create a new line of business, and also on the renewable on the pit stop, and your – one of your largest competitor, put all their renewable diesel into a joint venture and partner with someone expertise in the feedstock supply? Why that’s not a good idea for you guys? Thank you.
Maryann Mannen: It’s Maryann, let me try to address your first question around the second quarter guidance and certainly as compared to the first quarter. Just maybe as a bit of a reminder, we are expecting volumes to be up slightly from the first quarter about 2.7 million barrels per day, as you spoke about the distribution costs 1.25 is the expectation for the second quarter again up slightly, we are expecting some higher product demand and therefore obviously some higher costs to transport product, but overall, fairly flattish if we look at the increase in the expectation for throughput. And then, similarly, when you look at total operating costs really on a per barrel basis, when you consider that there are about flattish Q1 to Q2. So, hope that helps to address your questions there around the nature of the second quarter guidance. Mike has cleared for you sort of how we’re thinking about the second quarter, obviously, things can play out just depending on how the demand and recovery happens. But hopefully that addresses your question, Paul.
Paul Cheng: Maryann, I’m sorry, but that your unique cost is actually higher in your guidance in the second quarter. That’s even on the distribution side on the distribution costs comparing to the first quarter. And that’s why I’m not sure you said we have some one-off issue that’s why that you expect the unit cost on a per barrel throughput going higher, because one would imagine that with their higher throughput volume and lower energy costs that per unit cost should be going lower, not going higher.
Maryann Mannen: Yeah, Paul, it’s Maryann again. So you’re right, when we talk about total operating costs based on that demand, it’s about $5.20 versus the quarter, which was about $5.16. I was saying about flat, but you’re right, that there is a slight kick-up as we think about those total operating costs. And then distribution costs, hopefully, I tried to address the key elements there that were drivers to the higher cost.
Michael Hennigan: Paul, it’s Mike. On your second point, I think, it’s a combination of cost and portfolio. As Ray mentioned earlier, one of the things that we accomplished to kind of got, 2 birds with 1 stone is, Martinez was 1 of our highest cost facilities, Gallup was 1 of our highest cost facilities. So we want to have when we’re processing fossil fuels, a very competitive low cost system, because it’s going to be around for a long time. And we want to make sure that we create value in that regard. At the same time, the energy evolution is going to kick into renewables and other technologies as they develop. So we found a nice opportunity. We’re very pleased with the effort that’s going on at Dickinson. And as Dave just mentioned, once we’re in that both, we’re going to try and do everything we can to increase the profitability, whether it’s lowering the carbon intensity, the operation, the product of feedstocks, it was Brian mentioned. And I’ll let Brian comment, as like I said earlier is, location is in a good spot for us, CapEx is in a good spot for us, OpEx is in a good spot for us. Ray’s going through some learnings on the startup on the 1 facility, which will help us on the next facility. And then the last piece to your fossil was feedstock. And I’ll let Brian reiterate, but I will tell you, we’d like our base plan, we feel very comfortable that we have a really good project in front of us. But we are continuing to challenge ourselves, is there a way to increase value there?
Brian Partee: Sure. Thanks, Mike. Yes, as we build out the feedstock procurement strategy and create more options, we’re certainly looking at partners along the entire value chain, all the way from the procurement of feedstock onwards. And we are considering where we can do more with partners than just only commercial arrangement. But I think, we still want to let those discussions play out. And whatever we do needs to make sense for them, and obviously makes sense for us as well from a value perspective.
Paul Cheng: And, Mike, you also address that on the longer term, do you see the energy transition. We create a new line of business for you? Or that you’re looking at all the initiative is just to reducing your emission in CI for your own existing operation?
Michael Hennigan: Yeah, I don’t think of it as either, Paul, I think of it is somewhat both, we’re going to have an opportunity as this transition, I like to call it evolution evolves. There’s going to be some technologies that we can implement in our existing fossil fuel facilities that will be helpful. There’s going to be some technologies didn’t get implemented in truly renewable facilities. So I think in time, you’re going to see us grow both, and at the end – what’s the end game is what you’re asking, and I don’t know how long you’re thinking out in time. But, the end game is, for us to have a very competitive refining offering of fossil fuels in a very competitive offering on renewable fuels, and continue to look for ways to grow our earnings. Dave mentioned it, we’re looking at a lot of different things right at the moment, we’re going to act on them, and once we believe that they will give a good return for us, some things I think are a little ahead of their time right at the moment, the technology still needs to develop a little bit. At the same time, there’s some things like Ray just mentioned, we’re going to implement some – wind support to our Dickinson facility as early as next year. So some things are on the immediate side, some things are on the watch side and evaluate, we’re going to have a very robust look at through all this. One of the things that everybody keeps asking me, and hopefully, you’ll get to see it through results is what are we doing commercially? It’s one of my goals is to improve our commercial performance. And it’s not something that we’re going to talk about in the forecasting of it, but hopefully, we’ll point out things, as we go along, and Ray mentioned a couple today, that happened in the first quarter that helped us minimize our impact around the winter storm. So I think you’re going to see the answer to your question is really both, there’s going to be some opportunities on both sides of the business as we change the portfolio over time, and that was asked earlier today, you’re going to see some more changes in the portfolio as time goes by. And as we get to evaluate that will give disclosures as quickly as we can survey knows, which way we’re pointing the company.
Paul Cheng: Thank you.
Michael Hennigan: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Prashant Rao with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Prashant Rao: Hi, thanks for taking the question. My questions are both on R&M, and specifically on CapEx. First on Martinez, I know, you can’t disclose an overall cost. But Mike, I was wondering, in terms of cadence at $350 million this year. And it sounds like you do the first diesel hydrotreater next year. And then the 3 other hydros in the pretreat come on in 2023. So, is it right to think about it as sort of a stair step that the CapEx for that, and therefore the R&M growth CapEx kind of steps up in terms of renewables next year, and in 2023 years, it’s sort of more evenly spread out. And sort of related to that, just wanted to check that, would that be funded purely from internally generated cash or would you be looking to, I think, what are your financing sort of options if you – how you fund the project? And then I have a follow-up.
Michael Hennigan: Yeah, Prashant, I think you’re thinking about it, right. It is a phased approach to the activity out there, but it kind of dovetails to what Paul just asked. So when you step back and think about it, roughly some-40% let me around half of the growth capital that we have in this year is directed towards renewables. But then also half of it is directed towards our fossil fuel business. So we still think there’s going to be continuing moneys that we can spend in that business. So like what Paul was asking, I was trying to say, we’re going to do a little bit of both. But I think you’re also seeing the way we’re approaching this project, which is in a phased approach. So as Ray mentioned, we’ll get it online early next year, pretreatment comes on full capacity comes on. So there will be some stair stepping and capital in that area. At the same time, we’re still looking forward to the $450 million that we’re investing in the base business. We still got some activity going on down on the Gulf Coast, with our STAR project that we want to get to the finish line as well. So, kind of dovetail to your question, the same as Paul’s, is that – we’re going to have activity occurring in both areas, we’re committed to both sides of the business, because it’s going to be a long evolution, it’s not something that’s going to happen very quickly. But it’s something that we’re going to be very attentive to, as to where we deploy capital, I’m hoping everybody’s getting a feel for us that we’re going to have a strict capital discipline, that’s a mantra that we’re going to continue to push and challenge ourselves through all this scenario planning that we do is to what’s the best use of that capital, whether it’s in our existing facilities and fossil fuels or in renewable facilities or, as Paul mentioned, if we come up with something that we think is a little bit more of a step out. So we’ll try and give everybody as much disclosure as we can, as time goes by. We’re looking forward to the opportunity, as the evolution continues, and we think it’ll provide us some value opportunities to increase value for the shareholders.
Prashant Rao: Great. And then, sort of related to, I guess, the second part of my question there was on, how you expect to fund projects, because it sounds like this is going to be a very large facility at Martinez. But you also have a ramp here in terms of cash flow generation, potentially internally generated, so I just wanted to get a sense of this, broadly speaking, expect to fund Martinez out of operating cash that you generate, or if they’re – if you were to finance it, would you look at project financing, or what would be some of the options in terms of how you fund the build on the project?
Michael Hennigan: Yeah, Prashant, so our base plan, obviously, assuming the market cooperates, as we want to fund it out of operating cash. We don’t want to get discolored with Speedway, earnings, and we’ll get more color on that, that return to capital is kind of separate. And hopefully, as everybody is anticipating as the market kind of comes back to a normal. We’ll be generating operating cash that will fund our capital program, funds our dividend, hopefully have access beyond that, that will have optionality beyond that as well.
Prashant Rao: Okay, great. And, just one last follow-up real quick, on the maintenance side, I think you guided to about $250 million this year in R&M. A little early I know to answer this, Mike, but any color on how you think about that maintenance number in R&M on a sort of a through-cycle basis? When we get volumes back up, and as we look at MPC being – the years coming ahead, is that $250 million not that far off from how you’re looking at maintenance costs, now that you’ve rationalized cost across the structure, and you will continue to do so? Or is it so you were thinking that this is sort of a low year and there should be a little bit more that we need to layer in as we think about next year and maybe beyond?
Raymond Brooks: Yeah, let me take a shot at that. This is Ray. When I talked earlier about looking at the needs versus want. So, certainly the maintenance CapEx is along that line. So we challenge ourselves every day to the point of where we are, whether it’s OpEx or CapEx, as far as really scrutinizing the spend. So, our goal is not to go grossly up on maintenance CapEx.
Prashant Rao: Perfect. Thank you very much for the time. Appreciate it.
Michael Hennigan: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy. Your line is open.
Ryan Todd: Great, thanks. Maybe just one quick one on the refining side. Your utilization guidance for the second quarter is probably a little more conservative in terms of sequential improvement relative to some of your peers. I mean, your commentary’s maybe been a little more cautious. Is that – how do you think about ramping utilization over the next couple of months? And is there a potential upside of your 2Q guidance there?
Michael Hennigan: Yeah. I think Brian alluded to it early on is, we have these states that have a lot of impact to gasoline, the West Coast being one of them. They’re all talking about going into the next phase of opening up. We just don’t know how to totally gauge what that means. Manav mentioned June for the West Coast. We’ll see if it turns out to be June or not. I mean, we got to get through the rest of May. So, I mean, we’re doing our best to try and forecast that. But I try and remind everybody that, we don’t have control of that. We’re just like everybody else monitoring the situation, and given our best assessment, but there’s a lot of key states that are saying they’re going to be opening up. I mentioned a few in New York, New Jersey, Florida, on the East Coast. Obviously, the West Coast, has been under the most restrictions. Brian mentioned 20% down year-on-year, when overall, you’re about 5%, down on gasoline. So it’s a pretty bifurcated situation right now. And we’ll just have to see how it plays out. And, obviously, we try and give you the best guidance we can. And then, as the results come in, we’ll give you kind of a post-audit of what things look like.
Ryan Todd: Thanks. Maybe a quick follow-up on Dickinson. I guess, as you think about the – I know, you have the pretreatment up and going for some of the corn oil. Do you have, I mean, is there a SOP for what you think to kind of an average mix might look like in terms of vegetable oil versus corn oil, that facility, and an estimate, and maybe what you think the average CI value of the product will be once the wind facilities are up and running?
Raymond Brooks: Sure, this is Ray. The design basis for the project is 10,000 barrels a day of soybean oil, and 2000 barrels of corn oil, treated corn oil. So that’s the goal. That’s where we’re headed to get as we get into the second quarter. Just a little bit about the CI value, the target CI value for soybean oil is going to be in the mid-50s. And take about 30 numbers off that for corn oil. So that’s the range you need to be thinking about from a carbon intensity standpoint.
Ryan Todd: And how much do you think you can – how meaningful is the wind energy in terms of – is that assuming the wind energy or can you knock a few more points off with that project?
Michael Hennigan: Brian, I would tell you, let us get that up and running, and we’ll be happy to give you some feedback after that. But we don’t want to get ahead of ourselves. We’re excited about the opportunity. But we don’t want to predetermine how effective we’re going to be there. We’re excited about it. But let us get it up and running and we’ll give you more color.
Ryan Todd: Awesome. Thanks, guys.
Michael Hennigan: You’re welcome.
Kristina Kazarian: Operator, are there any other question today?
Operator: We are showing no further questions at this time.
Kristina Kazarian: Perfect. Well, thank you all for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or would you like clarification on topics discussed this morning, please reach out to our team and we’ll be available to take your calls. Thank you so much for joining us this afternoon.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-02 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MPC Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. My name is Sheila, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.
Kristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum's fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com, under the Investors tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO; and other members of the executive team.
Mike Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by welcoming a couple new members to our executive team. First, in January, we announced the appointment of Maryann Mannen as our new CFO. She joins us having spent nearly a decade as a CFO in the energy services and manufacturing sectors. Maryann brings the financial acumen and strategic leadership expertise critical for delivering our business transformation objectives, including strict capital discipline and overall expense management to lower our cost structure. I'm excited for the perspective and business insights she will add to our executive team as we work together to continue strengthening our financial and competitive position. Yesterday, we announced Brian Davis has joined the company in our newly created role of Chief Commercial Officer. Brian has spent over three decades in the industry. His extensive commercial experience, his recent deep background in renewables and alternative energy and a track record of developing and enhancing capabilities is highly complementary to our strategic focus on improving our commercial performance. We look forward to his leadership in developing and implementing a holistic and integrated strategy for MPC's commercial business. These additions will be integral in supporting our strategic initiatives as we progress through 2021 and beyond. Before we get into our results for the quarter, I wanted to provide a brief business update. The unprecedented challenges this year created by the COVID pandemic accelerated the need for us to act swiftly and decisively to change how we conduct our business. The three initiatives highlighted on the slide focus on the aspects of our business within our control, strengthening the competitive position of our assets, improving our commercial performance and lowering our cost structure. During the year, we've been faced with many tough decisions, but our team continues to make tangible progress in all three initiatives in ways we believe will drive stronger through cycle earnings and position the company for long-term success. Slide #5 highlights some of our actions taken around our strategic priorities this quarter. First, we continue progressing the sales of Speedway business. During the quarter, we responded to the second request from the FTC and continue to support 7-Eleven in its efforts to secure antitrust clearance. Our interactions with 7-Eleven and our interactions with the FTC have gone well.
Maryann Mannen: Thanks, Mike. Slide 9 provides a summary of our fourth quarter financial results. This morning, we reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.94. This reflects pre-tax adjustments of $851 million, driven primarily by a $1.2 billion pre-tax lower of cost or market inventory benefit. These adjustments can be found in detail on Slide 29 in the appendix.
Mike Hennigan: Thanks Maryann. I'd like to take a moment to provide some comments on our responsibilities around corporate leadership. Last quarter, we discussed the recent publication of our 2020 Climate Perspectives Report highlighting opportunities in strategic planning work the company is engaged in related to climate scenarios. We also discussed our goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, methane emissions and freshwater withdrawal intensities. It's important that we set objectives for the organization to driver our continuous improvement on ESG. Our principles for leading and sustainable energy position us to deliver strong results in the space from lowering the carbon intensity of our operations and products, improving energy efficiency in conserving natural resources to increasing renewable fuels production and embracing innovation and deploying advanced technologies. We believe the goals we are setting and our transparent disclosures on how we plan to achieve them place Marathon at the leading edge of our industry. We're seeing recent improvements in our ESG ratings reflecting our hard work in the area. Slide 20 in the appendix highlights to some of these accomplishments. Our approach to sustainability also reflects our commitment to create shared value with our stakeholders, the communities where we operate, our people, our business partners and many others. How we conduct our business enhances the performance we deliver. We look forward to even further expanding our robust engagement with stakeholders and continuing to serve as a valued partner. With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.
Kristina Kazarian: Thanks Mike.  As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question a follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions. We will now open the line to questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question will come from Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Doug Terreson: Good morning, everybody.
Mike Hennigan: Good morning, Doug.
Doug Terreson: Mark, I have a market outlook question refining and specifically, it looks like inventories for both gasoline and distillate are headed towards normal levels by the end of this quarter, which may be why refining margins are returning to -- have returned to near year ago levels. And if we see OPEC raise output later in the year, which also seems likely, we could also get some help on feedstock differentials. So my question is whether you're encouraged by the trends that we're seeing in products markets and the pace of the recovery as well and also whether you think this will be sustainable?
Mike Hennigan: Yeah, thanks, it's a good question. Before I answer and I'll let some other members of the team jump in as well. I first want to say, I appreciate your insights over the years and I want to congratulate you specifically on your next steps in your career and thank you for your contributions to our industry.
Doug Terreson: Well, thank you, Mike. You guys have been easy to support for sure. The pleasure has been all mine.
Mike Hennigan: On your question as far as go forward, I think, you mentioned a lot of things that we're looking at. And I guess our term is cautious optimism. For me, specifically, I tend to try not to call the market, but really call the banks of the rivers more. And on the positive side, some of the things that you mentioned that we're clearly seeing and we have that I call it cautious optimism as a result, hopefully, vaccinations will go smooth and hopefully we'll come out of this pandemic in a robust way. So that's kind of the bull view. And then the bear case is, we saw towards the end of last year, cases were going up, restrictions started to kick in a little bit more and we saw what a lot of people anticipated, which was a tough December and into January. Now we’re approaching February and will head into the spring. So for us, there's a bull case that says things are moving in the right direction. There's a bear case that says we're not through with this pandemic yet and we got some more fuel to play through before we really see the end of it. But let me - I am going to let Tim comment on gasoline a little bit and Brian can comment on the other projects, just so we can get a sense of what we see in the market today. Tim?
Tim Griffith: Yes. Thanks, Mike. Doug, the – just to reitereate Mike’s comments, I mean, we did see a little bit of softness into the back half of the year really after Thanksgiving and really through the end of year, almost a step down with regard to demand and again a lot of it relating to higher case rates. What we'll see, we're seeing a couple of bright spots early in the year, but we're hoping for more. We think this is probably going to take some time. As Mike said, we really need to get the immunization protocol built and as a country accelerate that process to get more and more people comfortable and then ultimately get schools back in session, get people back in the office, get people back on the roads, improve discretionary travel and we think that's going to happen, but that may take some time. And I think we're going to be sort of patient over the course of the year to see that really bear fruit. But definitely better times ahead. We just think it's going to take a little bit of time to really see that. I mean, for the first quarter, I think based on the year-over-year, we're probably going to be 90% of last year's volumes at the retail gasoline level and again, hope to see improvement over the continued -- over the rest of 2021.
Doug Terreson: Okay. And then also, Mike, a few minutes ago, you talked about strategic focus and commitment to corporate responsibility as being key elements. And so that makes it kind of clear to me that your leadership team believes that we may be experiencing a paradigm shift in energy may be more so than we've had in the past. And so my question is, first of all, do you agree? And second, what are some of the things that the management team needs to do to stay on the leading-edge in the industry which I think was a phrase you used a minute ago in this new environment?
Mike Hennigan: Yes. It's a really good question, Doug. So first off, all yes, we do believe that there is a paradigm shift occurring. I like the word energy evolution. So we see that occurring. And I guess, the momentum toward the low-carbon future is obvious. We're focused on how we position ourselves. As you mentioned, I felt that we had to get some things in line relative to cost and looking at our portfolio. But our focus on cost is essential in addition to our lower carbon intensity company to remain competitive for the long-term as these scenarios start to play themselves out. As you mentioned, we have made a commitment in sustainable energy and partly that comes from lowering the carbon intensity of our assets and increasing our exposure in renewable fuels production and we can talk about that a lot more detail today, but we have our Dickinson facility up and running and raise working through the start up there. And then we're still very optimistic about what Martinez can bring to us in that area. And then we're hopeful as technologies advance that we're on top of that and commercially and responsibly put ourselves in a position for the future. So I do agree with your belief that it is a paradigm shift. I do believe there's going to be increasing momentum towards low carbon. Obviously, everybody sees that occurring through the administration’s announcements as well as many other companies coming out. And our goal is to stay focused on that change and put Marathon in the best position to be a long-term player in that energy evolution.
Doug Terreson: Thanks again, everybody.
Mike Hennigan: Thank you, Doug, and again congratulations on your next step.
Doug Terreson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Neil Mehta: Good morning, team, and congrats on some better-than-expected results here. I guess, the first question is just to build on that is, is refining cost came in certainly better than what we were expecting. And in the 2021 standalone capital spending surprised as well to the downside and that was largely at refining as well. So can you talk about both of those, the CapEx and the OpEx improvements and how much of it is cyclical given that you still are running at depressed utilization although maybe a little bit better than what we had anticipated based on the guide and how much of it is structural and that will carry forward as we recover from here?
Mike Hennigan: Hey, Neil, thanks for that question. So, obviously, we've been very focused on cost. I stated that throughout 2020 that we needed to make a step change. And in refining, particularly, Ray and his team have taken that and put some really good actions in place. So I'll let him comment in a second. But overall, I think, what you're seeing from us is trying to reset our overall cost structure whether it's in the corporate area or midstream or refining. To your point, we do expect over time as we get past the pandemic for variable cost to come up a little bit. At the same time, we believe that many of the cost reductions that we have in place are structural. They're fixed cost in nature. Obviously, we're hopeful that we have more variable cost and that the demand for our product comes back up. But I think you’ve seen, over the last couple of quarters, a pretty sustainable step change and that's what we're hoping to show the market. As far as capital Neil, what we're doing there is pivoting to what Doug just referred to as a new paradigm. We have a bunch of projects that are already in progress in refining that we'll continue to finish those out. Examples of that would be like the Star project we have going on down in the Gulf Coast. That's an important project for us. It's still going to take some time to get through, but at the end of the day, we're going to do those projects that we think are in progress and are still valued. We're going to look for projects in refining that lower our costs going forward or change the dynamic we have around this energy evolution and then obviously, pivot more into the renewable space. We've a bunch of things planned for both Dickinson and Martinez. As kind of the first step in this energy evolution, renewables is the hot topic and I think we're in a real good position to put ourselves in a good spot there. So Ray, do you have anything you want to add or…
Ray Brooks: Sure Mike, Neil, I'll just give a little bit more color on the OpEx and this should be fairly consistent with what we talked about during the last earnings call but for OpEx reductions in refining, it wasn't just one thing, it was a multitude of things, but if I had a key on two items, I would say the first is scrutinizing the number of people in our facilities. This is both contractors and employees and just looking at the number of people we have, the number of projects we were working on and so forth and not just cutting people but also consolidating contractor companies and really taking a deficiency look at that. The other thing that we really wanted to do and our procurement supply chain group did a phenomenal job of working with us is making sure that we really leverage to spend across our 2.9 million barrel day of refining system. So looking at all of our contracts, goods and services and making sure that we just had the best terms and best contracts out there, just wanted to jump on what Mike said earlier to is our goal is to make sure that these reductions are structural as possible. Early on in the pandemic, we did some deferral activity with turnarounds, but largely that was to get out of the initial period of March, April, May timeframe but since then, we've caught up on our turnaround work and going into this year we'll do more of the same. So that's just a little bit more color on OpEx.
Neil Mehta: Thanks guys and a follow-up is just on the transaction of the Speedway transaction. Can you walk us through what are the gating items to close the deal? Your conviction level that you concluded in Q1 and Mike I've asked this question so many times over the last couple months, but can you just walk through the waterfall again of how you get $16.5 billion of the cash coming in plus another $1.2 billion or so from the government and based on where your debt level is, what the ballpark ability to return capital to shareholders is to that framework? So two questions there, deal gating factors and then return of capital framework?
Mike Hennigan: Yeah Neil on the first one the major gating factor is the FTC process with 7-Eleven, so we're watching the process, we're contributing where we can as needed, but that's really a process between 7-Eleven and the FTC. What we know as of today it continues to go well and like I say, I use the word were targeting for the end of Q1 or we're hopeful that the end of Q1 is the right timing, but really the gating item is essentially that process that is not really our processes it's more 7-Eleven in the FTC. So we're supporting it where we can. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we responded to questions, we're supporting it as much as we can. The other activities that we have to get accomplished, which we're very confident we'll get done is the transition services. Obviously it's a major transaction between us and 7-Eleven and there are some services that Marathon is going to transition to 7-Eleven over time. So that's been a lot of the internal work that we've been doing recently. But the bottom line and I know everybody keeps asking about your use of proceeds, we're as anxious as anybody to get to that spot, but at the end of the day, the major gating item is we don't have control of that timing. All we can do is continue to give you the best insight we have and right now we still say we're hopeful its end of first quarter. We're targeting that. We think that's achievable based on what we know. So that our best guidance at this point. On your second issue, as far as the use of proceeds, we've tried as best we can to frame what we believe is the two main pillars that we're going to be targeting, which is getting the balance sheet back to where we want it to be and then return capital to our shareholders as quickly and as efficiently as we can and on the first issue, we've tried to make the statement that our debt situation majorities is there's about $2.5 billion the comes with your essentially minimal friction cost and we'll jump on that one right away. Right today, we have a little over $11 billion of debt. We'll continue to try and evaluate as everybody wants to know where is mid-cycle going to be etcetera, etcetera. We need to work with the agencies so our financial team, Mary Ann and Tom and the treasury team will work with the agencies as to the proper path to bring that debt down to a level that we think is the right spot. In an effort to try and give as much color as we can, we've kind of said to people that hey we don't see it going below $5 billion and that's kind of like our low refining case if you want to call that. So if you say in that regard, we have about a little over $11 billion. We don't see it going below $5 billion. So a number of the put on the piece of paper is around $6 billion depending on how well the recovery is and how quick the recovery is and working with the agencies etcetera. Absent that, we said we're going to return capital, we've talked about what's the best way to do that and the only reason we don't give additional color there is because at least in our mind, we believe right now is end of March is the targeted timeframe. So we have another 60 days to go and we'll continue to evaluate the market and the opportunities and we've been going through this internally with our board, with our advisors, with ourselves and we have a pretty good framework, but we just don't want to get ahead of ourselves in case it takes a little longer than we were expecting. So we do want to return that capital to shareholders. I personally am a believer that refining to a large extent is a return of capital business. We got to position ourselves where we're generating cash and then think about the best way to create value returning it to shareholders and we've talked about all the various ways to do that. It's predominately in a buyback type mode, that's what we're thinking about and then there's pros and cons to the various ways that you can do that and then our commitment is once we get close enough that we know we're there then we'll come on publicly and give a little bit more color as to how we think that'll affect itself, but our goal is as efficiently and as quickly and effectively as we can, we want to try and provide that return of capital.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Legate with Bank of America. You may proceed.
Doug Legate: Mike, you're going to head in for this, I am going to bleat on about the same issue of my first question and I am going to hold of Mike or Ray for this and really I want to preserve some very quick marks with you and make sure I am think about this right. So your market comp is about $30 billion, your share of MPLX two thirds is about $16 billion. So let's assume in some of the parts spaces, the value recognized for everything else is about $14 billion and you're potentially going to have a $10 billion share buyback program if our net charge is $6 billion of debt pay down. But those are pretty enormous numbers obviously. So first of all am I thinking about right and secondly, how exactly would you expect to deploy such a scale of a buyback which I guess is Neil's question and I'm thinking along the lines of what the deal regular acquisition of shares in the market, what are you actually thinking about structure and timing because those numbers are obviously pretty significant when you look at it that way?
Mike Hennigan: Doug, first of all I don’t hate you for asking the question. It's a fair question and I know you've asked a few times about do we plan to use any of the proceeds towards MPLX. As I stated before, we don't see that as in the best interest, but we do see to your point returning that capital and I think you’ve made the point, it will be a large sum of money. It will take some time to effectively do it efficiently etcetera. So that's part of what we're kicking around and a lot of things come into play. Where's the equity going to be when we actually go to do this, what's the best method pros and cons relative to that. So part of the reason that we don't get more detailed at this point, I just use this as the example is when we announce the deal, we were trading in the 30s. Now we're trading around the 40s or so and we'll see where we are in 60 days or whatever the timing turns out to be. Obviously to your point, if you're trying to convince us for undervalued we're 100% aligned with you. We think that there is a lot of opportunity in our equity, but part of the process and looking at the pros and cons is where is that equity going to be by the time we get there and what's the best way to actually go about doing things. The debt side of it I mentioned a little bit, that'll be ongoing conversations with the rating agencies. We do want to protect our investment grade rating. So that's important to us. We want to see how the pandemic continues to play itself out. As you heard Tim mentioned earlier you're feeling good and then all the restrictions and things give you a little bit of a pause, but we're feeling pretty good about that as well. So taken that all into consideration is what we're thinking about and then to your point, it'll be a large return of capital. it will deftly take some time and when we get there, we'll give as much color as we can as to what we think at that time and then there will be some ongoing dialogues to your point. The numbers are good and we're happy that we're in that position. So we think we'll be able to affect the balance sheet adjustment that's really good for us. We think we'll be able affect return of capital that's really good for us. It will take some time and the only thing they we're holding out is the method and the timing because we'll have to wait and see when that time comes. Hopefully that helps. I am trying my best to give you guys as much color as I can, but at the same time trying not to get ahead of where we're going to be when we actually receive the proceeds.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Roger Read: I just want to say I am glad to know that we on the sell side don’t have to talk to you and your stock being undervalued, that's very comforting on our side. Kidding comment for the day, to kick back into some of the stuff that's been asked and maybe to dig a little deeper on a couple of things first off I think Doug Terreson mentioned on the crack spreads, but as we know at least part of the move in the crack spreads here has been rims related and I know with the separation of Speedway you're retaining the rims inside of the R&M segment. Now I was just curious how you're looking at the impact of the increase in the rims cost and then how we should think about that flowing through the company now that we're going to have I guess essentially already have the separation in terms of how it comes through?
Mike Hennigan: Hey Roger, that's a good question on rims. I'll let Brian take that one.
Brian Partee: Hey Roger, good morning. Thank you. Yeah so great question. So rims expense is real right, it's cash out the door. We say it's an element of our industry, but no rims costs are also very transparent day in and day out. So we really believe the full consideration is given really across the entire value chain when you look at refiners and some of our producers, blenders, marketers that sit in the value chain and establishing daily prices. So that's not to say that is quote unquote in the crack. I think empirically that's very difficult to point to no different than hydrogen cost or catalyst cost being in the crack, but it's a very transparent element in the value chain that we believe is fully considered in the commercial pension across all the various players that we mentioned. Specific to Speedway, yeah absolutely zero impact. We've always treated Speedway as a third-party customer and our contracts across our entire book really gets full consideration for rims cost and value. So really no impact, no shift in value when you think about between segments as result of the separation. The last point to make on this really is because their entire book, we have extensive terminal network and a pretty robust marketing platform the least of which is into the Speedway book of business. So historically or near historic, the last couple years 70% to 75% of RFS obligations one has been met really through when planning with Dickinson you can add roughly another 10% of that and you can keep doing the math and the Martinez. So we're quickly approaching 100%. So we feel like historically we're positioned well on this issue. We're positioned great today and we're going to be positioned even better into the future.
Roger Read: Okay. That's helpful thanks. And then I guess is a somewhat unrelated follow up here. I saw on the CapEx for the renewables I think I'm sorry I am going to try to find the chart here, I was flipping around all the different pages, but I think it's 325 or 350 in renewable CapEx in 2021. Is that all Martinez I know you’ve mentioned some other things in renewables. So I was just curious what all is included in 350 and as we think about Martinez, would it be another 350 and 22 just sort of a preliminary way to think about it.
Mike Hennigan: Roger so you're right on that. Most of that is Martinez, that's the way to think about it. Little bit it's dedicated to Dickinson but mostly Martinez and that's the start of what we believe is going to be a multiphase project. So I'll let Ray give you a little bit more color on that to talk a little bit about timing and the phase approach that we have to do. We're pretty excited about the opportunity.
Ray Brooks: Thanks Mike, yeah as Mike said earlier, we are progressing the Martinez renewable fuels project and that is the bulk of the projected renewable spend in 2021. Just to tell you where we are right now, we're in definition engineering. So we're in the third phase of the engineering on the project and we're also working to progress our permit. So were working with the governmental, the regulatory, the NGO, all the stakeholders in our project for aggressive permitting efforts and our focus remains to have the first phase, the first of the hydro traders reconverted to an renewable diesel facility or diesel unit in the second half of 2022 and then we would follow that up with the remaining two hydro traders and 2023 along with the pretreatment system. So it's a stage project and the reason that we're doing the first stage in 2022 is that requires the least amount of the equipment modification to do that. So we're still in the evaluation stage, but just want to give you a little color on the project.
Operator: Our next question will come from Doug Legate with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Doug Legate: Thank you, Mike. I am so sorry my line dropped when you were halfway through your question, but I'll obviously see the answer in the transcript. So thank you for that and I apologize again everybody. My follow-up question was probably for Ray, and Ray it's actually I guess a follow-up from Mr. Terreson's question earlier on the product side, but I wanted to be a little bit more specific, it seems to us that we're seeing lots of LPG substitution in Asia full of heat related driving not the brent spreads and we're obviously the second-order effects on the gasoline fill. So I am just wondering if you can share any alterations you have specific the issue? Are we seeing gasoline products to support coming from non-transportation sources? I just want to get your color and I'll leave it there, thank you.
Brian Partee: This is Brian Partee. I think on that brent spread, we have seen some uptick in the demand over in Asia as a result of obviously the cooler temperatures over there and really the entire petrochemical complex. So we've seen some steady demand outside of the US Gulf and even beyond moving over to Asia and really moving into the petrochemical space. So I think it's been supportive to that. I don't know that that's a long-term structural shipment. In the short term we've seen that as a positive.
Doug Legate: I just confirmation of that if it was in place but with all these instruction guys and appreciate the answers.
Mike Hennigan: You're welcome Doug.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.
Manav Gupta: I wanted to focus on the Gulf Coast opening cost which was like $3.40 down about 31% year-over-year. This is one of the lowest we've in the MPC and definitely well below a number of the FBOs. So what has allowed them to achieve this? I know Mike you're very focused on cost reductions but I am trying to understand what specifically driving the Gulf cost reductions there?
Mike Hennigan: It's a good question. I'll let Ray give you some specifics there.
Ray Brooks: Hey Manav, good morning. Say on the Gulf Coast we have two refineries large refineries Gary Bell and Louisiana and Galveston and Texas and of course Gary Bell has always been a very low cost refinery for us and so the ability to get better there is somewhat limited. The big reductions that we've had in our Gulf Coast structure has been the Galveston Bay. They've made significant improvements in their OpEx and that really showed in the back half of 2020.
Manav Gupta: A quick follow-up here is on your Dickinson facility. Obviously you're spending some money right now to move the product to California, but Canada has already just talking about introducing the two standards in 2022, the location of that facility would allow you to move the products across the border. So is that something you're considering and also if possible at the Dickinson facility also the size of the market in that facility, thank you.
Brian Partee: Hey Manav. This is Brian Partee. Just to address kind of the market disposition out of Dickinson, of course we're looking for the highest valued markets, the design for Dickinson and the expectation in and around placement is certainly in California and that really has proven to be the most lucrative markets out of the box, but we're having active dialogue with outside of really the West Coast in California and including Canada and we'll continue to chase that high-value placement. But with our position in the Portland area and the Pacific Northwest, we really feel optimally positioned with the wet physical position to be able to move product into Canada and even export as well as into Californian and we also think long-term with the contemplated project that Martin is really complementary to having an robust position out on the West Coast. And the last thing I would say beyond just Canada, there's a lot of different contemplated low carbon fuel standards in the US as well as with a load out on rail, we have really ultimate flexibility only limited by the rail infrastructure in the US which is quite robust. So along with a way of saying, we really feel like we've got a good -- we're in a great position logistically to optimize the placement of the product out of Dickinson.
Manav Gupta: And let's consider pretreatment at Dickinson also.
Mike Hennigan: We have pretreatment options for Dickinson, but that would be at our facility with Beatrice pretreated corn oil. So that is in progress.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is open.
Paul Cheng: I think the first question I have is for Brady . The average cost in refining and the distribution cost is really impressive. So at this point if it's the bulk of whatever it is you're doing that you're think you already captured it as you say that is limited upside or that I am sure that you continue to drive the cost down, but when that function changed from this point on that we can expect or that this is a pretty good phase and any improvement would be pretty limited. So that's the first question. The second question is probably for Mike and Brian. Brian when we look at your oil  they're far more aggressive in the commercial trading and everything. So when we're looking at Marathon, do you have to raise systems getting paid and also the right person to have for your organization or that's really if only the first staff and you're really going to take some time for you to build it out and where do you see the most opportunities for the improvement in return and earning from that operation and where is the risk and are we going to see that increase the risk?
Mike Hennigan: So Paul I'll start on both in a minute and I'll let Ray and Brain chip in. So on the cost, we've made a significant move as you noted, we're going to challenge ourselves in '21 and beyond to continue to look at each part of our portfolio and where we're spending money whether it's in refining or on the corporate side etcetera. So I don't want to ever say that we're done and at the same time, I do appreciate acknowledging that it was a pretty significant move. We decided when I put out the three initiatives that cost would be a major part of what we were doing in 2020. So that's why it got a lot of attention, but it continues on. It's not something that's over just because we've come to the end of the year whatever. So I'll let Ray comment a little bit more on refining and then on your second question relative to commercial and systems one of the things if you look at in our disclosure on capital is we are spending some money at the corporate level to try and improve ourselves from a digital standpoint. Doug mentioned we were moving in the low carbon future. The business has also become much more strategic from a digital standpoint and our new Chief Digital Officer has a lot of good thoughts that will help our commercial teams advance the ball. So we're going to try and deploy capital in that regard and put ourselves in a much better position from an information standpoint so that you we can act on it better commercially, but I'll let Ray jump in and Brian if he wants to add something there.
Ray Brooks: On the OpEx, I'm prepared to ask that because Mike actually ask that to me all the time, are we done yet? Is there more to do? What I'll tell you is with $1 billion of cost taken out of the system, we took a big bite out of the apple in 2020, but what I'll tell you is that the culture is there and as far as questioning everything we do, whether it's a person replacement, whether it's a project need to do or whatever, there's definitely the mentality and refining the question everything that we do from a cost standpoint. The one thing that I want to emphasize though is the one thing that's not in play is anything that would impact the safety of our environmental performance of our refineries. Mike in his opening comments talked about 2020 being the safest environmental performance that we had. So that always is the key thing, but with our team really is questioning everything we do beyond that.
Paul Cheng: In September we guys have a restructuring and so 1,000 people from McKinsey and also we people that are gone. So that already into the fourth quarter or we have another breakup in the first quarter that we receive the benefit of the companies.
Mike Hennigan: On that one Paul you'll see some of the benefit occurring in the first quarter. We did the restructuring in the back end of 2020 but you'll actually see the benefit in the first quarter, but before I turn it over to Brian Partee, since we have two Brians, you may have been asking relative to Brian Davis who has just joined us, but Brian Davis is not on the call for us today but I'll let Brian Partee talk a little bit from products and I'll let Rick kick in with a little bit from crude and by our next call, Brian Davis will be with us and will be able to get his insights as well.
Brian Partee: Just to answer your question on people and systems and commercial opportunity, the short answer is absolutely yes. We've gone through a massive transformation over the last several months realigning on the clean product side of the business, our marketing, supply and trading. our international book as well as into one unified organization. So I think just ordered structure loan will help unleash opportunities. As Mike indicated, we're spending quite a bit of time building out for a massive system to integrate the back office and that's in-flight and underway and really long-term see great potential and we're starting to see the benefits of that already and when we think about commercial performance it's not just revenue, it's looking at the expense and distribution cost as you called out earlier, inventory positions as well. So it's really the full deployment of capital across the value chain, not just on the revenue side, but I am extraordinarily encouraged with we're at and we're really pivoting Paul to be quite honest with you from really a legacy as more of an operational focus with refining over the last decade running full capacity and utilizing physically infrastructure and arms to maximize value to system that we're in today, which is requiring a little different playbook and more commerciality. So were excited to work with the team to bring out to bear and we're seeing benefits already. We'll continue to build on that here over the next year.
Paul Cheng: Mike I'll just sneak in a really quick question. Should we look at over the next several the CapEx for 2021 would be sort of the base and you're not going to be substantially higher than that?
Mike Hennigan: Yeah Paul on capital we're not given guidance beyond that, but I give you my general philosophy is like I mentioned earlier, we're going to obviously finish the projects that we have in progress. So some of those are going to go in '21 into '22. So that's ongoing. As far as investment in refining, asking Ray to look at ideas that reduce cost and put ourselves in a position for low carbon future. So energy intensity as an example is something that still matters a lot in the energy evolution. Looking at putting ourselves in a position where we check both of those boxes of cost and carbon emission reductions etcetera are going to be top of mind for us. At the same time we're pivoting to investment into renewables and some of the other areas, which will give you some more color as time goes on, but I think that's the general philosophy of it. As far as the absolute spend, we will obviously give guidance as we progress, but I think just in general, I think that's the philosophy that you should be thinking about and it kind of started off with the way Doug asked the question. We do think there's a paradigm shift occurring and our reaction to that is get our cost down be very conscious of the new environment and trying to check off two birds with one stone, put ourselves portfolio wise in a position where our refining assets are in a good spot for many decades to come. That's obviously the goal for us and position ourselves so the products we're making are with the demand in the market. So that's kind of our overall philosophy and we'll continue to challenge what we're doing in that area and we tried to give you a little bit more color with that breakdown of capital. So hopefully that helps people get a sense of what we're thinking philosophy wise.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Benny Wong with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.
Benny Wong: My first question is really on your outlook on the gasoline market. I think over the next couple of years we're going to see almost a million barrels of capacity come offline. Arguably half of that is going to be gasoline and if look at the imports over the last five years, we've been making 5,000 barrels per day. If the math kind of rounds back up to more of a normal environments, could we get back to more of an importing scenario for US? Is that kind of a reasonable way to think about it or how do you guys think about that?
Mike Hennigan: So I'll start off and I'll let other guys jump in. So one of the things Benny that I think everybody is obviously trying to understand is what does the supply-demand look like post-pandemic and we obviously are seeing in the short term the demand reduction supply rationalizations in progress, but how that all plays itself out at the end of the day is still an unknown. We tend to like I said earlier, we look at the banks of the river, we anticipated some challenges on the supply demand coming into the decade as part of the reason why we wanted to focus on cost reductions. But the question of where does the supply-demand you end up after the pandemic after the demand settles to a new normal wherever that's going to be after the rationalization settles out to where that's going to be, I think that's still the question that we're all trying to get our arms around. For us like I keep saying is we’re trying to look at it from the banks of the river standpoint and then we'll assess it as time goes on. I don’t know if you guys have anything to add, they're shaking their head. So I think that's the best we can give you at this point.
Benny Wong: Thanks Mike, that's very helpful and can you just remind us like if we look at NPC system what's the ability to flex your gasoline deal and how different is that from the US complex? Is it more or less or is relatively alive?
Mike Hennigan: Are you asking Benny liked flex between gasoline and diesel, is that what you're asking?
Benny Wong: Like how high can you get your yield in terms of gasoline output overall?
Ray Brooks: Benny this is Ray. We typically will have like a 10% swing that we can swing between our gasoline and diesel and we'll do that based on the economics that we see and what I'll tell you in the last year and the pandemic you've seen us do it both ways, you’ve seen this all the way to diesel and challenging ourselves how much more diesel and we come back the other direction.
Unidentified Company Representative: Benny this is Rick, just one thing I'll add to that to raise comments on yield, a lot of that is driven by econ and a lot of that is driven by the sweet sour spread, the heavy to light spread. So as we've stated many times, we have great flexibility by region as you'll continue to see as we pivot from suites to sours from heavy to lights. We often say one third, two third, but that varies by region and that gives us the flexibility to really turn that yield now.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Prashant Rao with Citi Group. You may go ahead.
Prashant Rao: First one Mike, I wanted to touch back on the leaning into renewables, we've talked about it several times on this call, so wanted to take a big picture view, ultimately how do you think about your ambitions here and would you think about at some point maybe as we go forward holding that out either as a separate earnings stream or a separate segment, I think some of the peers in the space are starting to allude to or are starting to do that and I was helping the analysts and investors to quantify that and sort of gauge where the progress is. So that's my first question any within that too sort of a tag along is on the carbon capture. I know you’ve talked about in carbon emission reduction and energy intensity earlier in this call, I was curious there is opportunities of that in carbon capture on LCFS programs that are fairly attractive. So wanted to sort of ask on that and then I just had a follow-up on the cash flow statement after that thanks.
Mike Hennigan: Prashant on your first one as far as the renewables and segment results, we do have that on the radar screen. At some point we think that may be appropriate for us. As you know, we just started up Dickinson, so we don't even have a full quarter yet. So once we get Dickinson up and running and are generating results and then we have Martinez coming behind that, then we'll have more of a significant discussion point on actual results as opposed to where we are today which is anticipating those results. So I can see that at some point. I would say one of the things that we've worked with Kristina and her team is trying to be very consistent so people can get a good insight into the things that we're doing today, but at some point in the future, I think you could see some changes from us and we'll give you obviously heads up when we're thinking of doing that. Second question was carbon capture and I'll let Ray jump in on this as well is I mean right now in all of the areas of low carbon future or climbing areas, there's a lot of things on the plate. Obviously renewable diesel as you mentioned is kind of at the top of the list because we're executing on that as we speak, but there's a lot of different items that we haven't talked a lot about technologies, different areas that we think we can drive our carbon footprint down and there's different ways whether it's capture or many other areas that we have on the radar screen and we're looking at it. We want to make sure that what we're thinking about is economical for us, going to create value for the shareholders or I guess if we can hit two birds with one stone, that's the best of all world. So I'll let Ray comment specifically on capture.
Ray Brooks: Yeah what I just had on capture is that something that's on the radar screen. We're looking at opportunities there and I'll just emphasize that the capture part is the easier part. The sequestration is a little bit more of the challenging part. So you have that opportunities within hydrogen plants and some of our other operations to do capture and sequestration. I'll just say that it's on the radar screen. We're looking at it, but nothing more incremental there to really say at this point.
Prashant Rao: Okay. Appreciate all the color and than just a quick follow-up on the financial statements particularly on the cash flow. Working capital is a good tailwind and the quarter sort of a two-parter, one how to think about that here in 1Q as that hold on towards that if what we see a bit a reversal and secondly, within the Speedway portion of discontinued is working cap also assuming it's concluded in that, was that also sort of positive there as well?
Mike Hennigan: Prashant, on working capital as we've said in the past is there's a rule of thumb that as flat price moves we have a essentially a net 20 days exposure to that. So as flat price moves itself up, that's a obviously a source of capital for us in a flat price where it comes down like we saw in the early part of 2020 then it's the use of capital. So the part of that that you're going to see is dependent on where crude price is and product prices are, but as a general rule, we're about a net 20 days exposure there.
Prashant Rao: Okay. And then fix this and that Speedway number in the discontinued also included working capital as well that's not just to clarify that's not an ex-working capital number correct?
Mike Hennigan: I don’t know if I am understanding your questionnaire there.
Prashant Rao: The working capital, there will be cash flow from ops from Speedway that was in the discontinued portion. I just wanted to just clarify that that includes any working capital impacts the Speedway and the discontinued portion of cash flows that makes sense. I am just trying to flush out how much, the comments was of working capital impact is still in MPC after Speedway, but I can take the question offline as well Mike.
Mike Hennigan: Okay try better to take it offline.
Operator: Thank you. That is all the time that we have for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Kristina Kazarian for closing remarks.
Kristina Kazarian: Sounds great. Thank you, everyone for joining the call today. If you have any follow-ups after the call, our team is available to help out with that. And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you again for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-11-02 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MPC Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. My name is Sheela, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session  Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.
Kristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com, under the Investors tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Don Templin, CFO; and other members of our Executive Team.
Mike Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina, and thanks for joining our call this morning. Slides 3, highlights our company's three strategic areas of focus in the near-term. Building and executing on these three strategic pillars will enable us to position the company for long-term success and through cycle resiliency. As we continue to navigate the challenges created by COVID-19, for both our company and the industry, we've remained focused on the aspects of our business within our control. This includes, strengthening the competitive position of our assets, improving our commercial performance, and lowering our cost structure. On Slide 4, we provide a quick update on actions taken around those three strategic priorities this quarter. First, we're making good progress on the sales of Speedway business and continue to target the first quarter of 2021 to close the transaction. The Speedway and 7-Eleven teams are very focused on completing the activities required to successfully close the transaction. Additionally, our interactions with the FTC have been constructive. We also wanted to provide more color around the use of proceeds from the Speedway sale, since we have continued to receive questions about an MPLX buy in. As you know, we ran a comprehensive midstream review process that began last year, and we announced the results of that review earlier this year. Our conclusion from that process has not changed. We've remained committed to using the sale proceeds to strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to MPC shareholders, and do not intend to buy an MPLX with cash from the Speedway sale. As it relates to MPLX, however, we continue to position MPLX towards free cash flow after distributions and capital, in order to proceed with unit buybacks which have now been authorized by the MPLX Board. One of our most important priorities as we evaluate the use of proceeds is our commitment to defending an investment grade credit profile. We expect to target in MPC alone debt-to-EBITDA leverage metric of 1 to 1.5 times. Given the significant and stable distributions from MPLX, we don't envision an MPC balance sheet with less than $5 billion of debt on a true cycle basis. As a reminder, we also expect to increase the cash component of our core liquidity position, by an additional $1 billion to offset for the loss of cash flows from Speedway. Within this framework and based on our current assessment, we expect that the remaining proceeds will be targeted for shareholder return. We are evaluating the form and timing and we'll share our plans closer to their transaction close.
Don Templin: Thanks Mike. MPC's adjusted EBITDA was $1 billion for the third quarter of 2020. In addition to the adjustment for turnaround costs, adjusted EBITDA excludes net pre-tax charges of $525 million recorded in the third quarter, which are summarized on Slide 5. We recorded $348 million of restructuring expense related to the indefinite idling of our Martinez and Gallup facilities, as well as costs associated with our announced workforce reduction plan.
Mike Hennigan: Thanks, Don. I'd like to take a moment to provide some comments on our responsibilities around corporate leadership. We recently published our 2020 perspectives on climate related scenarios report, highlights of which can be found on Slide 17 in the appendix. This is the fourth year we have published our TCFD compliant report, which highlights the opportunities and strategic planning work the company is engaged in related to climate scenarios. As a result of continued refinements of our ESG perspectives, we want to mention two additional and important initiatives we have established, incremental to our announcement earlier this year to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity to 30% below 2014 levels by 2030. First, we've established a 2025 goal to reduce methane emissions intensity from our natural gas business to 50% below 2016 levels. Second, we're focusing on conserving and managing our use of water. Through our efforts in this area, we have reduced our freshwater withdrawal intensity by over 10% since 2015, and we expect to further reduce it by an additional 10% by 2030.
Kristina Kazarian: Thanks, Mike. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If time permits, we will re prompt for additional questions. We will now open the call to questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question will come from Doug Legate with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Doug Legate: Well, thank you. Good morning, everybody. Mike, I appreciate the clarity on recent statement on MPLX, however, I wonder if I could ask you to elaborate a little bit on the justification. And just to remind you and I'm sure you know, we have a 15% yield versus MPC at a little under 8%. And obviously the question is over what happens after the election as it awaits for the relative tax advantage are probably going to be something that that you may want to comment on as well. But just a justification as to, why buying an MPLX does not make sense for MPC at this point?
Mike Hennigan: Hey. Good morning, Doug. So I'll give you couple of comments. Number one, we stated continuously that our goals have been to put the balance sheet back in order and return capital MPC shareholders. So, we still believe that that's our first priority here. And as you look at what we've done over the last couple of months, we've enhanced our base case on shareholder return with the change from a spin of Speedway into a sale of Speedway, which I do believe is a win-win for both ourselves and for 7-Eleven. But as we look at the equities, I mean we certainly acknowledge the argument the people have made about, like you said, a 15% yield or so around MPLX. At the same time, we view both equities are very undervalued. Particularly we view the MPC considerably undervalued compared to where we think it should be long-term. And if you dovetail that with our commitment to returning capital to shareholders, we think the best value is to return capital in the form of buying back units in MPC. We believe that the yield at MPLX should improve with our base plans at MPLX, which we noted today that we are going to continue to proceed into a free cash flow after distributions in capital at MPLX, and put ourselves in a position to start buying back MPLX's units with MPLX cash flow, and then we can target MPC cash at MPC shareholders in a form of buybacks. We also mentioned on the call that we still have a little bit of time before we get to closing, which we're still anticipating first quarter. But we're going to continue to look at, we've said form and timing of those buybacks is something we're continuing to evaluate, continuing to talk to our Board about. But at the end of the day, we think it's a much better value proposition for MPC shareholders, and we believe it's the right use of proceeds.
Doug Legate: Okay. I appreciate the answer. We can probably debate that, but I'm sure you continue to get questions on it. My follow-up, if I may, is on the portfolio. It looks like your operating cost reductions or at least the headcount reductions you mentioned are starting to show up in the numbers. So just wondered, if you can give us an update on how you see any specifics as to what you see are the next steps for the portfolio? I know you've been somewhat reluctant to give any specifics, but as the process is going on, I just wondered if you can offer any more clarity, and I'll leave it there. Thank you.
Mike Hennigan: Yes. Thanks, Doug. A couple of comments, on the portfolio, obviously, the most important things we've been going we've been very public about. I mentioned Speedway sale is a win-win. I think at the end of the day, 7-Eleven is getting a quality team and a group of assets that enhance their portfolio. At the same time, MPC is monetizing the retail margin by keeping the fuel supply chain, so I think that's an important portfolio step for us. We've also talked about moving into the renewable space. We can give a little more color on that as well, but we're starting up a facility up in North Dakota. We're continuing plans at Martinez. So, those are the major portfolio discussions that we have going in our public about at this time. I will tell you that, we continue to look at our portfolio and our goal is to make sure that we have a competitive set of assets that can manage through any type of tough environments, like we're experiencing today. The other thing that hopefully you are going to continue to see on a quarter-to-quarter basis, is our cost cutting efforts and time to change the cost structure of the company. One of my styles is not to get ahead of ourselves, because we continue to work at it. We're continuing internally to challenge ourselves in different areas. So the best way to stay apprised of that effort is to look at our quarterly results, as we continue to report out each quarter. And I think you'll see a sense of concentration on this area. And you'll be able to really see what we're delivering as far as costs restructuring of the company.
Doug Legate: Mike, I appreciate again the full answer, but just for clarification. There's been speculation in the market that you were looking to exit one of your assets on the Gulf Coast. Can you address that directly, and I will leave it there? Thanks.
Mike Hennigan: Yes. Doug, again, there's always a lot of rumors. We're not expecting to exit our assets on the Gulf Coast, we are expecting to evaluate all of our assets. And we're looking at ways that we can reduce our cost structure in the Gulf Coast, on the West Coast and in the midcontinent. But right now, I think, the important thing for you to think about is, look at the results that we're delivering, try and get a good assessment of where you see the costs, I'll let Don comment on that specifically. And then continue to get updates from us on a quarterly basis, and we'll try and give you as much color as we can as to how that occurred. One of the tough things in our business is, we did implement a workforce reduction. As I said, in my prepared remarks, that's a very difficult decision for us, but we thought it was necessary for the long-term viability of the Corporation.
Don Templin: Yes. Doug, I might add in Mike's comments, he talked about at the end of the first quarter, when we had our earnings call, we told you all that we were targeting two things around reducing capital and reducing our expenses. And we'd indicated that we were planning to reduce our capital by about $1.4 billion. I think we're trending probably $100 million to $200 million better than that right now. Most of that would be on the R&M side of the business, but we're also seeing some improvement on the MPLX side of the business. With respect to the - and you'll recall that that $1.4 billion of reductions was split sort of evenly $700 million for MPLX, $700 million for the rest of them MPC. With respect to the cost reductions that we were targeting $950 million that was $750 million for MPC, excluding MPLX, and $200 million for MPLX. MPLX is doing well against their target and we'll do better than they were targeting. And I think where we've really seen the difference and the improvement and the effort is around our R&M part of the business, particularly the refining part of the business. So I mentioned that our operating costs have been averaging about $1.27 billion a quarter since we made that announcement, that's about $350 million better than the first quarter of 2019. So if you just extrapolated that sort of $350 million a quarter, that gets you to - and our guidance for the fourth quarter is right in that same range, that would get you to about $1.50 billion against what was a target of $750 million. So, we feel really good about our ability to deliver that cost reduction.
Doug Legate: Great. Thanks for the full answers, fellows. I appreciate it.
Don Templin: You're welcome, Doug.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Neil Mehta: Hey, good morning, guys. And thanks for doing this, this morning. I guess just going back to the Speedway transaction, what are the hurdles and milestones we should be watching in terms of closure of the transaction? It does seem like you guys believe they'll be on track for Q1. And then as you think about the allocation of the cash to the extent that you will be executing it fill a large buyback program. Just how do you think about doing it efficiently and ensuring that you're able to reduce as much of the share count as possible? So that's more of a tactical question. That's my first question.
Mike Hennigan: Good morning, Neil. So on your first part, I mean, the process is going along as expected. We did receive a second request from the FTC. And we were expecting that, 7-Eleven was expecting that. So the teams are working through the questions that have come out of that review. Overall, I would say, in general, it just takes time to get through that process. And as a result of that, that's why we've targeted this first quarter timing. We don't see anything at this moment that takes us off of that timing. Obviously, if we did, we would communicate that. But right now the process is going I'd say as expected and the situation is such that we have not seen any surprises. Our anticipation of what the FTC would ask is very consistent with what 7-Eleven was thinking as well. So overall, I'd say the process is on target. And our expectation is still for a first quarter close. I just forgot - what was the second question, I forget.
Don Templin: It was around the process for returning shares, or share repurchase or a capital return, if you will.
Mike Hennigan: Okay. Yes. And on that, Neil, I mentioned in the prepared remarks that, we've tried to put some clarity on use of proceeds. As Doug mentioned, there was a lot of questions around MPLX buy in. And we wanted to definitively state that our goal is not to buy an MPLX with this cash, but to return to shareholders, as well as get the balance sheet in order. We're not ones, it's not in our DNA to predict what's the mid cycle going to be. But we thought, we'd give a little bit more clarity by some of our scenario planning, which basically said that we don't see the debt on the balance sheet at MPC going below $5 billion. I mean, hopefully, that gives a little more clarity as we do our scenario planning. We want to have an appropriate amount of leverage at MPC. And so we thought that that was a good disclosure for the market to understand how we're thinking about it. As far as the return, we're still in that process. We have several more months to go before we reach the closure point. Myself, Don, the Board, the whole team is evaluating with our advisors. And I think you hit it on the head, what's the most efficient way for us to return that capital? And that's exactly what we have been debating. And as you know, there's a lot of different ways that you can return that capital, there are pros and cons to each of those. And it's our expectation that as we get closer to the close, we'll give a little bit more clarity there. But that's where we are in the process at this point.
Neil Mehta: No, that's very clear, Mike and Don. And the follow-up is, there's been a lots happening on the West Coast. I just want your perspective on the medium to long-term outlook for the refining market out there, as you weigh a couple of different factors, renewable diesel, changes in efficiency standards, but on the positive side, asset closures. How do you think about the different moving pieces on the West Coast?
Mike Hennigan: Hey, Neil, I'll start and Don can jump in if he likes or Ray. One of the things that I think is occurring with COVID is it's forcing rationalization in this industry, and you don't want a faster pace that would normally be occurring in a downward cycle. So, one of the things that I think we're seeing across the board, certainly for Marathon, we've announced that we are changing the configuration at Martinez, that's our goal at this point to move it to renewable diesel as a result of its cost structure. And we've also put Gallup in a shutdown mode. So, our view is the tough challenge, whether it's the West Coast, or whether it's global worldwide, the industry is under a lot of stress right now. And the way cyclical industries get out of that stress is rationalization. And our expectation is that COVID is just accelerating that. Overall, Neil my motto is, we're going to worry about the things we can control and keep an eye on the things that we don't control. The things we do control out on the West Coast specifically is moving expeditiously the change, what we believe was a high cost asset that would not survive in the long-term, processing hydrocarbons and moving that to renewable diesel. And we have an update on that in our prepared remarks, like I said, or Ray can go into a little bit more. But that's something that we do control. So, we're moving forward with that study. At the same time, we are continuing to evaluate costs back on the West Coast, as well as the rest of the company. Don just gave you, hopefully, a lot more color on what we're doing in that area. And then again, I'll just reiterate that our style will be such that every quarter we'll try and give you an update on these major initiatives, and tell you how we're progressing with Martinez, tell you how we're progressing with our cost initiative, and any changes to the portfolio we'll be happy to update as time goes by.
Neil Mehta: Thanks, guys.
Mike Hennigan: You're welcome, Neil.
Operator: Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Roger Read: Yes, thanks. Good morning, everybody. I guess really to dive into last parts of kind of your answer to Neil's question. As we think about rationalization in an industry that's absolutely struggling here. What thoughts do you have for - I don't know, if it's magnitude, if it's timing, it's a combination of the two of what else the industry may do here? I mean, Marathon is obviously taking a big first step on your own kind of what are the expectations for the industry, as we look into, I guess, Q1 and Q2 of next year for most of the big decisions to occur between now and yearend as well?
Mike Hennigan: Roger, I think, you pointed out and like you said we addressed that a little bit on Neil's question is, at the end of the day, one of the things that the industry is struggling with is, the loss of demand that's occurred and been accelerated as a result of COVID. That demand has recovered quite a bit, but it's not back to the levels that we've seen previous to the virus. Overall, gasoline and diesel are obviously doing much better than jet fuel. But at the end of the day, this is a commodity business, it's a margin business. And to your very point, the way that the industry gets itself back into a good position is twofold, is one is demand recovers to the point of post-Coronavirus, whenever that occurs, hopefully vaccines are progressing, as we've been reading about. And I'm sure you guys have been reading about, so the expectation for that to occur sooner is great news. And that'll help on the demand side. And then on the supply side, it's purely a matter of math and marginal assets, we'll have to rationalize. If you look at some of the data, even outside the U.S. that rationalization is occurring and the bottom line is in a new world, wherever that may be, from a demand standpoint, or whatever, marginal assets will not be able to sustain themselves long-term. And the main reason that one of our key short-term initiatives is get our cost structure in a position that can manage these types of dips in commodity markets. So, one of our important goals is to make sure that we continue to progress, our cost structure changes, and I think you'll continue to see that quarter after quarter as we work on these initiatives, and position ourselves so that we're not the marginal assets. To Neil's point, whether it's West Coast-related or U.S.-related or globally-related, at the end of the day rationalization will occur, is occurring, will continue to occur and hopefully, demand comes back and the industry gets itself back on a better footing.
Roger Read: Okay. Great, thanks. And then a question for you, Don, kind of, I guess we call them somewhat non-operating cash flow questions. But working capital had a big move here in Q3, what are your thoughts as we look into the next quarter? And then on the income tax receivable side, that was discussed on the last call. I was just curious where that number kind of shakes out? And if there's any change in the expectation of cash recovery, Q2 of next year on that front?
Don Templin: Yes. So let me take sort of your second question first, Roger, in terms of a tax refund. So, we anticipate that we will have a relatively significant NOL this year, and we will have the ability to carry that back into prior years. We have not yet published our 10-Q, but I'll kind of give you sort of a preview in the 10-Q, you'll see in the cash flow statement that there's an increase in tax receivables of about a $1 billion. So right now, that will be the - what we will be having as a receivable sitting on our balance sheet related to our forecast right now of that sort of refund. Obviously, lots of things can happen between now and the end of the year. If there's a change in administration or we see a change in tax law, between now and the end of the year, there's probably some knobs that we may want to or levers that we may want to manage to make sure that we're optimizing our tax situation in 2020, and in 2021. But right now, I would say that numbers in sort of the $1 billion-ish range that will be on the balance sheet at the end of the third quarter. The other thing in terms of timing, I think realistically, the timing is probably third quarter, not second quarter. And the reason I say that is, we'll need to get everything closed, our tax returns filed, and then wait for the refund, and I just don't know how fast that will happen. But I think that it'll take some period of time into 2021 to get the tax return completed, all the things that we have to do. So, hopefully that's helpful from that perspective. And then I think you're right, in terms of the cash flow statement for the quarter, we had a fairly large working capital impact. And we highlighted one piece of that working capital impact that related to accruals that we made with respect to the restructurings that we were doing. I guess, the other piece that's in the working capital adjustment, so in the $868 million, you'll recall that we had a $256 million charge for LIFO liquidations. So that $256 million charge is showing up as a negative, if you will, in cash flow - cash flow from operations. And then the reduction in the inventory is showing up as a source of cash in the cash flow statement from working capital. So, there's a bit of - our cash flow statement probably is a little bit has some unusual items in it this quarter because of some of the charges that we've recorded. As we think forward, I mean, we were pleased with where we ended up with cash, as the quarter end was at $716 million. And if you think about sort of the change from the second quarter about $300 million change, and $200 million of that change was really because we paid down some debt at MPLX. So I think a pretty strong cash quarter for us, given the situation and the environment in which we're operating.
Roger Read: Definitely. Thanks. Just to clarify your comment on the tax receivable. The $1 billion change, was it like year-to-date? Or is that the Q2 to Q3 we should think about? And I appreciate the Q will come out later, but I'd just…
Don Templin: That's year-to-date, Roger. So that will be in the cash flow statement. The cash flow statement has not done for a quarter, the cash flow statement has done for a year-to-date period. So that $1 billion is in the year-to-date number.
Roger Read: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Manav Gupta: Hey, guys. Congrats on getting the Dickinson Refinery converted. I'm just trying to understand, can you help us understand, when you create the product in North Dakota, the logistics and the marketing involved and trying to move it to the end market where you can get the highest value, which in this case right now would be California. At some point, we hope Canada puts a similar program so the market moves closer to you. But right now, how would you get your 12,000 barrels a day from North Dakota all the way to California?
Brian Partee: Yes, Manav, this is Brian Partee. Good morning. Thanks for the question. So we've got the distribution channel all set up. We're working through the production and startup. It is a complex distribution network as you'd expect, and it's new too. So we've got transit time, so we'll be loading out the  rail. So a lot of flexibility as we hit the rail in North Dakota, and then we'll be moving it to the Pacific Northwest, where we'll be able to get to the water from there. So, both from rail domestically, as well as into Canada, we have a lot of flexibility to move, and then we'll be on the water out in the West Coast to hit as you noted, California, and frankly, wherever else we see the demand. From a marketing standpoint, as is typical, we've got a full portfolio to optimize how we sell into the market, both bulk sales. We've got committed contract sales as well as open rack sales. So we're excited to see the production come on. We're very optimistic placing into the market has not been a problem. So we've got things lined up and ready to go. In startup, though, we think probably mid to late December, so we've got oil in. Cash in is really important, obviously on the other end of thing. So we'll probably be mid to late December on that, and then really set up well for Q1 of 2021 to be rolling with the full production and full distribution.
Manav Gupta: Thanks. And I have a quick follow-up. You filed your permit for the Martinez conversion, I think October 1. You have listed various feedstocks in there. Can you help us understand the way the breakup would work between lower carbon intensity feedstocks versus higher carbon intensity feedstocks? And how do you plan to get the lower carbon intensity feedstocks to the Martinez Refinery? Thank you.
Ray Brooks: Hey, Manav, this is Ray Brooks. Thanks for the question. Our first goal has always been to complete the construction of the facility started up, and then optimize the refinery. And when I say optimize, optimize the carbon intensity of the operation, and then also the feedstock slate. And so I'm really happy to report that the plant completed construction about three weeks early, and is currently in startup as Mike said to earlier. I'm also happy that we were able to go from shovel to start up in under two years. Doing this while navigating through two North Dakota winters and a pandemic, and I just want to state that I'm really, really proud of the team for everything that they've accomplished. I was just out at the site, and it's really impressive facility, you might think that a 12,000 barrel day plant is small, but it's now the second largest renewable diesel plant in the United States. And getting to your question on the feed slate, the initial feed slate is 10,000 barrels a day of soybean oil, 2,000 barrels a day of corn oil. And we'll work diligently to make sure that we optimize that within any capabilities that we have. But I just want to say that we're really excited about the Dickinson plant being an early mover in the renewable diesel space.
Manav Gupta: Sorry, my question was more on the Martinez feedstock side. But that wasn't clear. How do you plan to run Martinez as far as lower CI versus higher CI feedstocks are concerned?
Ray Brooks: Pivoting to Martinez and I'll just talk a little bit about Martinez to give you a little bit more information you're looking for. But we're excited about Martinez from the standpoint that we have a facility with three hydro processing units, two hydrogen plants and an extensive infrastructure that gives us a very capital efficient project. And it gives us a capital efficient project from the standpoint that we will be able to run a multitude of feedstocks, whether it's soy, whether it's corn, whether it's tallow, whether it's use cooking oil. We are designing that flexibility into the program, into the project. And we're working diligently right now talking to feedstock suppliers as far as potential partners with us from the feedstock standpoint on that. The Martinez project, a little bit farther out there, while Dickinson is currently in operation. Martinez, we're working hard to get to that point. But now what we've done in the last quarter, we've submitted applications for our air permit. We've also submitted the initial study for the environmental impact report. We've completed our feasibility engineering and moved into detailed engineering. And we've also met with key regulatory, governmental and NGO stakeholders. So, we're continuing to move that along. And then part of moving that along will also be on the feedstock supply. So, we're not ready to tell you exactly what we're going to do on that, just tell you that we're working on it.
Manav Gupta: No, this is very helpful. Thank you so much, guys.
Don Templin: Hey, Manav, this is Don. One other just sort of point to raise, you'd asked about sort of the cost to move Dickinson product to the West Coast. So, you probably saw in our outlook information that distribution costs went up slightly. And that sort of slight change in distribution costs is reflective of the distribution costs related to getting the Dickinson product to the West Coast.
Manav Gupta: Thank you. Thank you, guys.
Don Templin: You're welcome, Manav.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Benny Wong with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Benny Wong: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. My first one is really around how you think about the midstream business? I think, there's expectations for lower E&P and upstream activity going forward, potentially more moderated volumes domestically. How do you guys see the environment changing? And how does that translate into how you, see an approach that part of the business?
Mike Hennigan: Hey, Benny, this is Mike. So, couple things. Number one, I'll say prior to COVID, the number one question we were getting asked was, the gas portion of MPLX in the midstream business. And since COVID, I mean, obviously, a lot of things have changed. And we're looking at a gas strip that has a three in front of it now compared to what was some pretty tough natural gas prices. So, our view longer-term, and we've kind of stated this, so I'm going to just repeat myself a little bit is, MPLX is an important part of MPCs structure. We really rely on that stable dividend that comes out or distribution that comes out of MPLX. It's an important part of our structure. At the same time, we do believe the midstream business is going to continue to grow. To you point, albeit maybe at a different pace, if the E&P business and goes to a little slower mode. But being a natural gas we think is an important thing right now, as the market continues to evolve in the energy landscape, natural gas in our view is going to continue to be an important part of growth. At the same time, as I mentioned earlier, we do believe we'll get back to normal once we get through the virus and have a vaccine and get demand back in our LMS business as well. We have a couple projects in play right now that will bring additional earnings. So, the forward growth structure there may be a little slower than originally anticipated, as a result of the E&P change. But at the end of the day, we think it's going to be a very strong contributor and continue to have growth that will continue to increase earnings, as far as even at MPLX, which continues to add value for both MPLX and MPC. At the end of the day, I'd tell you one of the things that I think has been misunderstood a little bit is, the stability of the earnings at MPLX. And hopefully, this quarter it gets to show how much we think how strong that earnings profile is, as well as it being supplemented by cost reductions that we've talked about as well.
Benny Wong: Thanks, Mike. That's very clear and helpful. My follow-up might be for Don, but obviously, could be open for anybody. I appreciate the information around the recent changes in reporting. Just going forward, just curious how you think about how you can present the company, as your renewable diesel business grows it doesn't make sense at some point breaking that out, like some of your peers? And for your refining, marketing disclosures, could some of the marketing and direct dealer business eventually broken out so your refining business can be more comparable to peers? So, essentially, just curious how you think about how you can present your performance or your business and make it easier for investors to benchmark you guys? Thanks.
Don Templin: Benny, this is Don. Thanks for that question. So, I think one of the things that we've been very focused on over let's say the last four quarters or so, with feedback from you all and from our investors, is that there was sort of a request or a suggestion that will be helpful, if we stabilized the way we were reporting the information to you all, so that it was consistent quarter-to-quarter without a lot of changes, so that you could get to a point where your models could get tightened up refined, whatever the right terminology is. So, I think we've gotten to that point. This quarter was obviously a quarter with lots of moving pieces, including the discontinued operations. And we didn't think that it was an appropriate quarter to introduce a whole bunch of other changes. Mike's talked about how we're restructuring the company, how we're optimizing it, there's a lot of changes that are still occurring. And I guess it would be our view, my view that the best time to roll out sort of a new way of thinking about how the company presents its information and operates is when we get through some of that transition, so that we can do at one time. We can recast all the prior periods. We can provide you all the data that you need to update your models timely, and avoid any sort of confusion or situations where the information isn't as clear. So yes, we are thinking about how the company should look and how we should be presenting that information. This just wasn't the right time to do that. But we will be looking for the right time to think about how we present that information. And we do welcome feedback from you all and from the investors on what's the right way to or what's helpful in terms of information that we can provide that allows you to understand our business better.
Benny Wong: Great. Thanks, Don.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is open.
Paul Cheng: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Couple of questions. The first one is probably for Don. In the third quarter, you have very good cost performance and is actually much better than your guidance. And you actually on the absolute dollar term in the refining, and you have a higher throughput. So Don, the question is, is that being just conservative in your guidance or that the performance has ended up better than what you think? And if that's the case, what's driving that better performance? Is it some one-off, or just ? And also that in California, you're $10.50 per unit on the operating costs. If those still have the personnel cost on McKinsey  or that those 0is already out? That's the first question. The second question is for Mike, for the 30% GHG emission intensity reduction by 2030, is that going to be sufficient? A lot of your larger customers, I think they are targeting by 2035 going to be net carbon zero at least in group one and two. So, is that something that you think is applicable to you? And if not, why not? Thank you.
Don Templin: So Paul, let me try to, I think dissect the question or questions that you asked around our performance. So, the first one was, our operating costs have - the team has been performing very well, I mean, very much of a focus area for us. And we're very pleased with the progress that we're making there. So, I think that on a per barrel basis, we probably not only were the absolute costs, lower than we were projecting them to be. But our throughputs were slightly higher. And you have to remember, that guidance was provided at the end of the second quarter, and there was still a lot of uncertainty around what was happening with COVID and what the numbers would be. We've I think, stabilized a little bit in terms of the utilization rates. And so our guidance that we're giving for the fourth quarter, is pretty consistent with the actual that we incurred in the third quarter. And we have a lot of confidence sort of in providing that information. I think you asked about the West Coast and the costs on the West Coast. So, in our operating costs for the West Coast, there are still some continuing costs related to the Martinez Refinery and the idling there. And so, those are obviously putting sort of pressure, if you will, on the per barrel, and there's no equivalent operations at Martinez. So that would have some upward pressure on the per barrel cost. And then I think you were interested in maybe capture rate and sort of how the capture rate was significantly higher than we've historically guided to. So, I think most people model to a 90% capture rate. I think one of the things that happens is when your margins are thin, small variations can cause the capture rate to either be very high or very low. So this quarter, a couple of the factors that impacted the capture rate, I think, for purposes of modeling going forward, I would still be focused on in a normal world, a 90% capture rate, I would then think that I would want to add something for direct dealers, so let's just say, $100 million a quarter or in that range. And then the other things, I think, move about sort of quarter-to-quarter. So, hopefully, that's helpful. But I think part of what made the capture rate look as strong as it was this quarter, was the margins were very thin.
Paul Cheng: Don. Can I just follow-up on the West Coast? What will be a reasonable target on your OpEx, or maybe this is for Ray, say in 2021 or 2022 once that you're restructuring and everything is in?
Ray Brooks: Yes. I think it's a little premature. We want to give that guidance. We know everybody wants that guidance, Paul, we gave you fourth quarter of what we expect the West Coast to do. But we're going to start tracking and providing color around what I would say is the costs to run or that the incremental costs at Martinez, that we're incurring on a quarterly basis, so that you can see that. And obviously, as we trend to a renewable diesel facility, there's going to be some period of time where we're incurring costs, but we're not incurring or not delivering any sort of throughput through that refinery. But we will be doing that kind of guidance and providing that outlook information sort of on a quarterly basis as we move into 2021.
Mike Hennigan: And, Paul, this is Mike. On your question on the greenhouse gas emissions intensity target, and whether it's enough, I think a couple points I wanted to point out. First off, we think it's more important to have kind of a mid-range goal instead of just a 2050 goal. But it's important to note that the background for our goal there is, so our goal of 30% reduction by 2030 from 2014 levels represents about a 2% reduction per year in carbon intensity, which is the slope necessary to meet the desired reductions, or aspirations of the Paris agreement by 2050. So, in order to kind of stay on track to that, we set a goal of 2030 that we believe kind of aligns with that longer-term 2040 to 2050 goal. And as time progresses, we will amend the target on a periodic basis to ensure we remain in line with those longer-term aspirations. But we thought it was more important to kind of show the slope and put a target out there that was more near in, so it was more achievable rather than so far out, that it doesn't - it gets a gets a little bit discounted. The other thing I do want to mention, Paul, aside from the greenhouse gas emissions intensity, I do want to reiterate, something we said in our prepared remarks is that we have stated, 2025 goal to reduce methane emissions intensity. And I think that's a significant ESG move on our part, as well as setting a goal on freshwater withdrawal intensity. Those are two other important areas, where we believe that we can make progress in this area and continue our commitment in the ESG area.
Paul Cheng: Thank you.
Mike Hennigan: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Prashant Rao with Citi Group. Your line is open.
Prashant Rao: Hi, good morning, thanks for taking the questions. My first one is really on the operating costs continued progress there, and now that you're talking about exceeding the $950 million in OpEx reduction savings. So, just wanted to circle back to that to get a little bit of clarity. How should we think about this kind of on a carry forward basis? I know, Mike, we had discussed in the spring, sort of the some of this is volume related and some of this is sort of just flat cost reduction that carries forward into future years. So, I just wanted to get an update on how we should think about flat and the sort of $950 million plus now? And then also the workforce reduction initiative, that restructuring, I wanted to get a sense of conceptually, is that kind of apart from the numbers that we were targeting? I know you were targeting earlier in the year. It sounds like it was but I just wanted to sort of confirm that, that sort of that really is the gap that the excess over the $900 million plus that we were talking about maybe six months ago? So, that's my first question and the follow-up on commercial ops. Thanks.
Don Templin: Yes, Prashant. This is Don. So, with respect to the guidance that we gave at the end of the first quarter, the $950 million, that at the time did not envision, that we would - I guess we'd not embarked upon the workforce reduction plan that we just initiated and implemented. So, some of those costs would have been variable costs from operating in an environment where we anticipated that utilization rates would be lower than historical. What I can say and one of the things that we have been able to deliver, I mentioned on the refining side, the whole reduction for R&M or onsite for MPC, excluding MPLX was $750 million for the year 2020. And based upon what we've achieved and what we're guiding, we're probably closer to $1.50 billion or maybe slightly higher than that on an MPC, excluding MPLX basis. So, what that means is that, yes, there's still some variable costs that would have been, might go up as we ramp up operations into 2021. But a lot of the change that we've seen so far is around fixed costs. And so that gives us great confidence going forward. With respect to the workforce reduction, so that was more than 2,000 of our employees were impacted by those actions. Some of those were focused at the Martinez Refinery and the Gallup refinery, but a lot of those were also focused across the rest of the operation. So, you should start seeing some of those costs being embedded in our future projections. And I think, several of those costs, you'll see when we give our first quarter 2021 guidance, you'll be able to see, I think, a meaningful piece of that in the guidance that we give in 2021, but we've not moved that far forward yet.
Prashant Rao: Okay. That's very helpful color. Thanks, Don. And then just a quick follow-up on to commercial operations and the improvement there. And it's hard to see in an environment like this and the numbers, so I was wondering if maybe Mike or Don you could talk about this for qualitatively, perhaps or point us to where you're seeing that improvement on a Q-on-Q basis, it looks like in your results especially that are held up, as well as not better than some of your peers? So just curious if you could talk about maybe some of the initiatives there that might be helping to bully those results in this tough macro, whether it be on the crude purchasing and logistics side or on the product placement side? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.
Mike Hennigan: Hey, Prashant. This is Mike. I'll turn it over to Brian and Rick to give a comment. Although, I just want to remind you that in the commercial area, that's probably the toughest area for us to give disclosures, just because of the competitive nature to it, but I'll let the guys give a comment if they like.
Brian Partee: Yes, thanks Mike. Prashant, good morning. This is Brian Partee. So great question, and I appreciate the recognition that we're in kind of unique environment here to optimize commercially. But just a couple of high-level comments and things to think about where we're focused. I mean, the first one is really around alignment, and that alignment being with people. So we did a pretty heavy restructuring, I have responsibility for all the clean products value chain. So aligning our marketing folks, our supply folks and our training folks into one unified team that are focused geographically, we think is a very positive step, will allow us to operate more efficiently and effectively going forward. And frankly, with the right people in the right space. The second part of focus really here in the short-term is around inventory levels. So we're operating in a different demand environment. So two things we're looking at there. One is, inventory levels and opportunities around inventory reductions, and then related distribution costs. So as Mike stated we're really focused on things that we can control. And those are two things we feel in the short to medium-term are really under our control. And the last part I'll mention before handing it back over to Rick is on the export side. So exports, we believe are foundational and fundamental to helping the business in North America clear, and we're really focused there, developing a broader long-term strategy around how to hit markets outside of the U.S., and utilize our full both production capacity as well as our logistical capacity, primarily along the Gulf Coast, but also on the West Coast as well.
Rick Hessling: Yes, Prashant. This is Rick, thank you for the question. Also, on the crude side from a distribution standpoint, we're certainly going towards more of a just-in time asset model, reducing our distribution costs, that's becoming readily apparent in our results. And in addition to that, when you look at crude avails, we've significantly shifted to light suite. You'll see that in our run rate here in the third quarter, so the adaptability the optionality the switch significantly to light suit runs throughout our operating area has been significant. And then as we look forward, we're looking at medium sours. We've come off a very, very disruptive storm season. And we're starting to see some signs of medium sours getting back to normal. And then we're seeing a little bit of a glimmer of hope from the Canadian side, when you look at the mandate that's been lifted. We're entering the diluent blending season, which will swell the pool. So we're optimistic on a few of the alternative grades, especially that we run in our midcontinent system.
Operator: Thank you.
Kristina Kazarian: Operator, I think we have time for one last question.
Operator: Excellent. Thank you. Our last question then will come from Phil Gresh with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Phil Gresh: Hey, good morning. My first question would be just around capital spending, obviously, on track or doing well on the reductions there. But as you look at, say, 2021, or more of a longer-term view on capital spending, curious how you think about that both for total company or just some kind of breakdown amongst the different business lines?
Don Templin: Yes, Phil, I mean, as I mentioned, and Mike mentioned in the early comments, we're very, very focused on managing capital right now. As it relates to 2021, we've not gotten to the position where we're providing that guidance. We'll get our budget approved later in the year and we'll provide that guidance when we get to our yearend earnings call. But what I can say is that, particularly from the R&M side of the business, we are investing or continuing the investment in projects that are ongoing or that we're completing. And we are very focused on eliminating, I'll call it sort of discretionary spending unless it is in sort of promoting our cost reduction initiatives. So, there was a time probably where our growth spending on the R&M side of the world was more about, I'll call it molecule management, and trying to take sort of, take what we're producing and upgrade what we're producing. I think right now, given the environment we're in, a lot of what we're focused on, on the discretionary spending is on allowing us to be able to manage in a very competitive, low margin environment. So, with those parameters, I think that's what we're doing on the MPC side. On the MPLX side, I mean, the same kind of discipline there. Mike talked about the fact that we feel very good about being positioned in a place where the cash flow from MPLX will cover not only distributions and CapEx, but will have availability then to have that excess cash to deploy to repurchasing units. So very, very focused. Discretionary capital needs to meet a very, very high hurdle, and it needs to be really focused on the initiatives that, Mike has laid out, which is, improving our competitive performance, or reducing our cost structure.
Mike Hennigan: Phil, it's Mike. The only the only thing I want to add to Don's comments is hopefully you've seen over the last couple quarters, the discipline that we're putting in those areas. And then I just ask you to keep an eye on the next couple quarters as we continue to work through our initiatives, that you should be able to see that we are putting a high hurdle as Don mentioned, on ourselves and putting a strict discipline on ourselves in both the OpEx and the CapEx areas.
Operator: Thank you. Go ahead.
Kristina Kazarian: Oh, perfect, Sheela.
Operator: Thank you. That is all the time that we have for questions today. I will now turn the call back over to Kristina Kazarian for closing remarks.
Kristina Kazarian: Thank you for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or clarifications on topics discussed this morning, our team will be available to take your call. And with that, thanks for joining us.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-03 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MPC Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. My name is Sheela and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session . Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.
Kristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investors tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Don Templin, CFO and other members of the Executive Team.
Mike Hennigan: Thanks Kristina. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call today. Yesterday we announced an agreement to sell Speedway to 7-Eleven for $21 billion in cash demonstrating our commitment to execute on the strategic priorities we outlined earlier this year. The sale of this business provides certainty around value realization for MPC shareholders. As I've stated before I believe this is a return of capital business and the substantial estimated after tax proceeds of approximately $16.5 billion enables us to both strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to our shareholders. At the same time the sale also creates a long-term relationship with 7-Eleven that enhances commercial performance potential through attractive fuel supply agreements and future growth opportunities. The transaction which is subject to customary closing conditions including HSR clearance is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2021. We move on to slide 4, as a follow-up to our first quarter earnings call, we're making very difficult decisions to increase profitability, create stronger through cycle earnings and drive long-term value creation. Despite the very challenging conditions in today's market we remain committed to those goals and will continue each quarter to update the market as we progress. We outlined three areas that will be priorities towards achieving our objectives. First, strengthening the competitive position of our portfolio. We need to be a leader in cost, operating and financial performance metrics need to make necessary changes to the portfolio to achieve these objectives. One of our key philosophies is that each asset needs to generate cash back to the business. We announce the decision to indefinitely idle our Gallup and Martinez refineries. Closures as a result of the tough refining business climate ahead of us have been amplified by the impact of the pandemic. At Martinez we are evaluating repurposing the refinery towards the production of renewable diesel. Facility has the ability to provide up to 48,000 barrels per day of renewable diesel. We have the unique opportunity to take advantage of the strong set of logistics assets for the area and also have three significant processing units that are an ideal fit for making renewable diesel. These advantages should drive significantly lower capital requirements compared to greenfield investments and pursued enable initial production as early as 2022 with the option to ramp up from there.
Don Templin: Thanks Mike. Slide 6 provides a summary of our second quarter financial results. This morning we reported an adjusted loss per share of $1.33. This adjustment reflects a $1.5 billion pre-tax lower of cost or market inventory benefit. Adjusted EBITDA was $653 million for the quarter. Cash from operations before working capital changes was a cash source of $172 million. Our dividend payments for the quarter were $378 million.
Mike Hennigan: Thanks Don. I'd like to take a moment to provide some comments on our responsibilities around corporate leadership. We’ve recently published our 2019 sustainability report highlights of which can be found on slide 18 in the appendix. The report is greatly expanded this year in terms of content and disclosure and outlines our commitment to provide information consistent with the many reporting frameworks that are influential in the investment community. As such the report summarizes our comprehensive efforts related to environmental, social and governance aspects of our business. On that note I wanted to touch on recent events that have impacted many of the places where we live and work. At Marathon we are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace and to partnering with organizations in the communities where we operate to encourage acceptance, tolerance and unity. Like many companies we are charting a path towards greater understanding, listening and open dialogue and we are firmly committed to continuing to make progress in this very important area. With that let me turn the call back over to Kristina.
Kristina Kazarian: Thanks Mike. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If time permits we will re-prompt for additional questions. We will now open the line to questions. Operator? 
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Neil Mehta: Thank you and congratulations Mike, Don, Kristina team on the transaction. The first topic is around cash flow. Can you talk about the pieces that go into the tax number that bridge between $21 billion and $16.5 billion and with the cash what's the framework around allocating cash; recognizing we'll get more color around this later and thoughts on debt reduction versus buybacks versus special dividends and then I do have a follow-up. 
Mike Hennigan: Hey Neil. Thanks for the comment. First of all before answering the question on use of proceeds let me just make a couple comments on the deal itself. First of all we looked at a lot of different structures and a lot of different options and then came to conclusion that this deal creates the most value and the most certainty for our shareholders.
Don Templin: Yes. Neil I guess, you asked a couple of questions, maybe let me first talk a little bit about because I think it's important around our consideration of use of proceed. Let me talk a little bit about how we think about defending our investment grade credit profile. So maybe backtrack just a month or two when we had our first quarter earnings call liquidity was probably top of mind and I think we took some very proactive actions to make sure that we had addressed that issue and as I mentioned on our comments now we have $7.7 billion or so of available liquidity. So we feel like we're well-positioned, well-situated going forward. As we think about as we look ahead, I guess that we believe that an important part of our capital structure is an appropriate level of debt. We don't think it's efficient in this environment to be under levered but we also want to make sure that we're defending our investment grade credit profile. And as I think about defending our investment grade credit profile, no one metric or factor drives that consideration. We'll look to a number of inputs that include obviously the lost EBITDA from the Speedway sale but we'll also consider the steady cash flows we have from our ownership interest in MPLX, our views around mid-cycle and through cycle EBITDA, the size of our committed credit facilities which are very significant and the cash we currently have on our balance sheet which is a billion dollars, our dividend policy going forward and various metrics such as debt to EBITDA and debt to capital but I think that all of those things will be a part of the consideration and as Mike mentioned the unprecedented macro environment makes it difficult right now to be more specific. You did ask a question about tax and so on that particular topic our tax basis and the assets that we're selling was just under $4 billion so the after tax proceeds that were showing in the release the $16.5 billion is really predicated on that tax basis.
Neil Mehta: That's very clear. The follow-up is bigger picture question which is -- in many ways you are losing your most valuable business. Now you're monetizing it at a great multiple but can you talk Mike about how you think about value creation for here and what you're left with is MPLX and refining business; how do you drive value out of those two business segments and set up the company over the long term without the stable ratable cash flow of Speedway? 
Mike Hennigan: Hey Neil, that's a good question. Let me make one comment on the Speedway deal relative to that is we still believe we're going to get the benefit of integration. That's not loss because of the supply agreement that we have and the fact that we'll continue to be using our logistics assets but to your broader question, we still have a lot of work to do in the three areas that I keep mentioning. So strengthening the portfolio is going to continue to be a theme that you'll hear from us over time as we continue to look at our assets. We're just getting into the midst of improving our commercial performance. So you'll hear more about that over time as well. As well as the cost structure. We've given some early indications for 2020 to lower our cost structure by about $950 million but we have more work to do in that area. So you have a real good question, where do we go from here and I just ask you to keep thinking about those three priorities. We're going to continue to report on those. We're certainly not done from this standpoint. We've looked at obviously a couple of assets in that regard and obviously getting the Speedway deal done was a high priority for us. And I think it does put us in a unique position to return capital shareholders as Don mentioned to get the balance sheet in the right order. So I think we're in a good position relative to the environment that we're in and we expect that to stay challenged for some time. Although we're optimistic that just like all these cycles we'll get out of it at some point and we're seeing a slow recovery which is headed in the right direction but we're just anticipating that it could take a while to get back to normal.
Neil Mehta: Thanks Mike. Appreciate it.
Mike Hennigan: You are welcome, Neil. Thanks for the question.
Operator: Thank you. Next we will hear from Doug Legate with Bank of America. You may go ahead.
Doug Legate: Thanks. Good morning everybody and Mike let me add my congrats to that great multiple on Speedway. So I have two questions if I may. The first one is actually about Martinez and Gallup. I wonder if you could just walk us through the process that got you to the conclusion that you came to -- was there an option for example for a sale. Is it an inventory liquidation event that comes out of this and maybe if you could frame for us what other assets in the portfolio today don't meet that criteria of generating positive cash flow. A - Mike Hennigan Yes Doug, also very good question. I'll start with Gallup and like I said in my prepared remarks these are very difficult decisions for us to contemplate during some really tough times. I mean COVID has had an impact on many people in many different ways but it's obviously had a real strong impact on our business and the business and climate that we're seeing going forward is especially with refining supply and demand and obviously that's more weighted towards the demand side but anyway to answer the question we had a unique niche in the marketplace there that's essentially been competed away over time. So it's much more difficult for a small refinery to be successful but to answer your direct question we did look to sell the asset. We ran a process but unfortunately we did not get something that we could execute on. So absent the process being successful, we thought the next step was to put it in an indefinite idling position but still keep the logistics assets active so that we have some other opportunities from that standpoint and then we'll see how things play itself out. On Martinez, we did not look at a sale to your question there. We're pretty excited about the opportunity of reconfiguring the asset into renewable diesel. We got some more work to do there and I know we have a lot more detail but I do want to give you at least the direct answer to your question as to whether we looked at sales. We did at Gallup. We ran a process that wasn't successful. We did not at Martinez. So hopefully that answers that question. 
Doug Legate: It does and I appreciate the color there. Maybe I don't know if you want to take the next one with my follow-up as well Mike or if you want to throw it to Don but I'd like to preface the question but I'm just taking a look at MPLX's stock price or unit price since you did the IPO, I guess about seven or eight years ago and it's still trading below that level. I realize the MPLX processes is done and dusted so to speak but when you look at the outstanding equity and the amount of cash you just brought in why would it not make sense to buy in the balance of MPLX given that the incremental cost space still seems to weigh on your refining valuation? I'll leave it there. Thanks. A - Mike Hennigan Yes Doug, it's another good question and as you refer to our midstream study, whether it's bringing it all in or actually looking at the RLFD you're finding logistics and fuels distribution. We went through a pretty exhaustive study as you're aware and you referenced and the bottom line is we came to the conclusion that we didn't want to buy in a cash stream that we were already getting with respect to the RLFD. Marathon has a unique position where we're receiving about $1.8 billion in distributions from MPLX and RLFD is about $1.4 billion of EBITDA, so again I'm saying we came to that conclusion of why would we buy in that cash stream when we're getting it essentially via distributions and instead use that capital which would be north of $10 billion in return to MPC shareholders. So that's where we came out on the subset of it as far as all in at the end of the day there is some amount of cash flow that goes to partners on the one side of the fence. On the other side of the fence we'd be paying tax to a certain extent depending on where we think the tax rates will be going forward. So at this point and we do recognize and we are frustrated at the level of equity value that MPLX has at the same time we felt or continue to feel that the amount of capital that would be needed to do that at this time makes more sense to return to shareholders as opposed to not and obviously we've concentrated a lot on the Speedway unlock of value and that's kind of where our head is for right now and as I mentioned and Don commented as well is we're going to be doing a lot of analysis between now and the close to look at what's the best use of proceeds but the highlight priorities are the balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders.
Doug Legate: All right. Appreciate again for the answer guys. Thanks.
Mike Hennigan: You're welcome Doug.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Roger Read: Hey. thank you. Good morning.
Mike Hennigan: Good morning Roger.
Roger Read: I guess maybe to follow up on kind of the whole restructuring and slide 4 where you've got the three kind of I guess guide posts I'll call it, where should we think about, where you are in the overall sort of evaluating the company, potentially restructuring the company and this is going to get back to some of the questions already been asked; do you buy an MPLX? Do you want to buy in a bunch of shares change the dividend, etc? But I'm just curious because you couldn't have known for certain about getting a sale of retail done until obviously you signed the papers even if the cash is still a few months away but now that you have certainty of that, how does that maybe affect the way and where are you maybe in terms of progress and doing an evaluation throughout the company on both sort of a current COVID basis and then on a maybe called more of a mid-cycle kind of ‘21/’22 outlook standpoint.?
Mike Hennigan: Yes Roger. So like you said on the three initiatives, we still have a lot of work to do on the portfolio. To your point we could not be assured that we would get this deal done. We were very optimistic because we believe Speedway is a really attractive asset out there. We did get significant interest and I think we concluded the deal that's in the best interest of ourselves, Speedway and 7-Eleven. As far as the portfolio though we still have a lot more work to do both on the refining side and the logistics side and the GMP side. I mean there's a lot of activity going on and the best I can give you is over time we'll continue to disclose how we're feeling about certain things. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves in the market but we want to get to a portfolio. Our goal is to get to a portfolio that generates significant free cash in any environment and for me personally I'm a protected downside. So knowing that we're going to have these down cycles we want to make sure the portfolio is very resilient during those times. As far as the other areas like I said, we're just starting to make some moves in the commercial area and that's the one area that I'm probably going to be the least disclosing about just because of the competitive nature and then the cost structure I think just keep an eye for each quarter as we continue to progress. My personal style is not to put out a big number and then try and track against it. It's more of a try to have continuous improvement in continuing to lower our costs in a lot of different ways and change our philosophy on cost and change our philosophy on capital discipline. So each of those I think Roger, each quarter we will be able to talk a little bit about how we've made progress in each of those areas and then hopefully you'll get to see over time how we're looking to maneuver the company. I hope that makes sense to you.
Roger Read: It does. You are going to make us wait. That's always the hardest thing for us. As a follow-up and I know Don, you've already tried to address the tax issue but we've been getting a lot of questions in on it. I was just curious the other refiners for the most part have discontinued ETR guidance because the current environment and the CARE Act has some real impact. So I was just curious as we think about the 21 billion the 16.5 net are there other things that may flow through here in coming quarters, whether it's a going back and capturing prior profit tax payments or something else that might allow you to whittle down the tax impact on the sale?
Don Templin: Yes Roger. In connection with sort of the effective tax rate, I mean 2020 was an unusual or is going to be an unusual year because as you look at least our book income we had significant charges related to goodwill and it has limited deductibility. So our first quarter and then year-to-date effective rate was in the sort of middle teens as a percentage really driven by that. What we spend all of our time doing is really looking hard at our cash tax position and as we disclosed in the first quarter and as we will disclose again in our second quarter 10-Q, we believe that as a result of the CARES Act we're anticipating that we will have net operating losses in 2020 given the environment and also given the significant capital expenditures that we've made in the past where we get to take the depreciation, deduction when assets are placed in service. So we expect that there will be a significant NOL and the CARES Act provides that you can carry that back up to five years and we would expect to carry back NOLs into years that -- given that five years that have a 35% tax rate. So we think that's a good thing for MPC. Our plan would be that we would work on getting our 2020 tax return filed as quickly as we could in 2021 to be able to affect that NOL carryback and the refund that would be associated with that. With respect to the sale of Speedway, obviously we will continue to evaluate that and we will look for ways to best optimize the tax position but we thought that it was appropriate for purposes of this announcement to give you that sales price minus the basis times what we believe was a normal tax rate at a relatively statutory rate.
Roger Read: Okay just one minor follow-up on that in terms of -- when you file the 2020 return and ’21, timing on a refund that's just my last data point. A - Don Templin We believe that happens relatively quickly but it who knows what the world looks like in 2021 if people are still working from home or still in their offices Roger but we believe that that's a relatively rapid transaction, not transaction a rapid result if you will. So we're going to push really, really hard to get our return filed as quickly as we can and then we would expect that the refund would manifest itself relatively quickly after that.
Roger Read: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is open.
Paul Cheng: Thank you. Good morning guys.
Mike Hennigan: Good morning, Paul.
Paul Cheng: My two questions if I could. I think earlier that you said that it doesn't make sense for you to buy  for the remaining of MPLX. So if the company considered that with far more flexibility with the cash infusion, whether that you may be open that do you want to spin off totally the MPLX? Whether that this is a consideration or that you still conclude after the exhausted evaluation that you're just going to keep the structure as it is? The second question is related to the Golden Eagle whether not shopping yet can you still one the renewable or that you want the renewable you need to shut it and in terms of the renewable how big is the business that you want that in the long haul for your business taking into consideration on one hand current margin and return are very good but on the other hand the barrier of entry is low and the margin and the demand and your sense with government mandate. So I want to see how you deal that business long haul. Thank you.
Mike Hennigan: Hey Paul. So when the first one, we don't have any other comments other than as I mentioned we're going to do a lot of analysis. We have some time to look at what's the best thing to do with the proceeds but I do want to leave everybody with the priorities that we have are the balance sheet and returning capital. So one of the obvious things that we stated from the beginning with Speedway was we did want to unlock that value realization and returning capital is a high priority. So I don't want to comment on anything other than those at this point. On your questions on Martinez and renewable I'm going to turn to Ray in a second but let me just give a couple opening comments. So first off I think Martinez is in a unique set of circumstances relative to the hardware that exists at the facility and I'll let Ray talk about that. We are believer that the renewable positioning is going to be beneficial to us because it aligns with California's low carbon fuel standards. We've also stated MPC has greenhouse gas reduction targets that we want to accomplish throughout the decade. So strategically this fits with where our thinking is and I would just give you a little bit of framework as we think about capital investment there and this was the harder decision. The expected capital that we're going to put in for the first phase assuming we go with this is about the same amount of capital that we would put into a planned turnaround for the facility. So we really hit a decision point and decided to pivot and look at renewable diesel production as opposed to refined product production. So that's kind of the decision tree if you want to call it that. There is a lot of details that go into the analysis. So I'm going to let Ray give you a little bit more detail so you understand some of the specifics around Martinez its own specifics about the facility. 
Ray Brooks: Hey thanks, Mike. Paul, I just want to give you a framework a little bit that we've actually been looking at Martinez for a long time essentially ever since we merged with Andeavor and early on we evaluated what you suggested co-processing for renewable diesel but those economics weren't nearly as strong as the conversion that we're looking at right now. The key item and Mike just hit on this is with the refinery continuing in its current form is that it has an extremely high cost structure and then we have the near-term headwinds with a heavy turnaround spend in the coming year. So we believe that transitioning Martinez to a renewable diesel plant ultimately creates value for our shareholders and there are certain unique advantages for this site. Our Martinez renewable diesel facility can provide up to 48,000 barrels per day of capacity and we expect the initial production could be online in 2022 and ramping up from there. We are continued to evaluate in more detail but the initial analysis looks extremely promising. Martinez current complexity presents a capital efficient project for us given that there are three high pressure hydro processing units. Retrofitting these units will allow for renewable diesel production equal to about one third of the current refinery's nameplate crew capacity. There are also the existing hydrogen plants, power generation and extensive inbound and outbound logistics that are all needed to produce renewable diesel. So our intention is to pivot to the production of higher value, low carbon intensity diesel for California. Martinez produces about 54,000 barrels per day of ULSD at full utilization and the conversion would produce up to 48,000 barrels per day of renewable diesel. I want to emphasize that this is not a grassroots facility. So there is an element of speed of conversion. We believe that we have an early mover advantage and we believe that there are opportunities for meaningful partnerships with feedstock suppliers. Now we fully understand that the drivers for the economics of this project are not our typical refinery project that there are regulatory drivers but at the end of the day with the unique advantages for Martinez that I talked about earlier we're just really excited to take this evaluation further.
Paul Cheng: Ray and Mike can you give us some idea that for the company as a whole long term how big a renewable diesel business that you want to be or you're willing that to get you say a ceiling or you think that no there's no really no ceiling it depends on the opportunity set and also that after the Speedway itself who is going to keep win. That's it for me. Thank you.
Mike Hennigan: Yes Paul, it's Mike. So I don't think we have a targeted number at this point but I do want to say that we're going to continue to look at the portfolio and make decisions as we go along. Martinez -- our priority as Ray said is going to be evaluating the different phases here. The other thing I would like to add for those who know me in the past, I believe joint venture arrangements can be very successful as well when you get into these types of deals. So managing the capital and achieving a better overall outcome for all parties is something else that we're looking at very hard here. So we're evaluating that approach. In general I think at the end of the day we think there's some real uniqueness here that should be beneficial. Ray gave a lot of technical stuff. I say on the commercial side we're going to talk a little bit about JV opportunities in the future. Managing the capital is one of our main criterias we want to have strict discipline. So that's another important piece of this. So I just wanted to make that comment. And I'm also going to let Brian make a comment as well.
Brian Partee: Yes Paul. To your question the last question that you snuck in there regarding the rent as it relates to the Speedway separation just wanted to address that real quick. So I think the first thing to understand and appreciate that we've always had a market-based philosophy and approach to pricing with Speedway. So as a result of the separation fortunately due to that historical philosophy there's really no step changer movement and value shift but fundamentally MPC will be the blender of record in all transactions. So we will possess the rent and retain the rent. As it relates to the value of that rent that's all always driven by market specifics which is individual market by market and the agreement fully contemplates that. When you talk about a long-term agreement like this we have to make sure that it's resilient over time and the agreement fully contemplates this for rents or anything else frankly in the future. So that's the way it's going to be handled in agreement. So I mean just wanted to make the point underlined and underscore that there is no value shift whatsoever as a result of the transaction on rents.
Paul Cheng: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Next we will hear from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. You may proceed.
Manav Gupta: Hey guys my question is on the crude sourcing side. During 2Q medium servers are very tight but as we move into 3Q we are seeing Russia and other OPEC countries raise those volumes. So do you expect more discounts or medium server crudes going in 3Q which could help your golf course results in 3Q? 
Mike Hennigan: Hey Manav it's Mike. So rick's not here today. So I'll take a shot at that. He's out of the office today. I mean in general we think directionally the crude market is going to hopefully move towards us with increased production. As you stated we're going to have a little bit of a recovery in the production side of it which hopefully will put some pressure on differentials. Right at the moment as you're very aware refining crack spreads are still very weak and it's not been a good environment for refiners but as I mentioned earlier we're optimistic but cautious as recovery continues to progress hopefully we'll get to see a recovery and then refining margins which we haven't seen yet and as crew production continues to progress to your point then hopefully we'll get to see a little bit more opening on those spreads. I would Manav this might be a good opportunity let me let Tim and Brian make a comment on where we think we are in demand recovery. So I give you a little bit of a flavor of how we're seeing the demand side. So Tim why don't you start with gasoline and then Brian can finish up with the portfolio.
Tim Griffith: Yes you bet Mike. As Don referenced we've seen a really continuing amount of recovery in gasoline demand since the early April lows in really all regions of the country as many of the states have reopened with probably the greatest strength in the midwest really through the second quarter. Recovery trends nationwide have slowed more recently with system-wide weighted same store sales volumes currently down sort of 10% to 15% compared to last year with the east coast about 5% behind the midwest and the west coast another 5% behind that. So as referenced earlier we're watching carefully the latest COVID case escalation in multiple regions and the potential for states or counties to back up on the reopening plans. Schools going back to in person is a significant wild card on the demand side as students at home will have some consequence for the ability of parents to return to their workplaces and getting people back in the road. For what it's worth we also think the increasing requirements for masks nationwide is a positive for demand as it facilitates increased mobility with more things able to be open which potentially gets people back in the road to a meaningful extent. We'd much rather see people out on the roads with masks than at home without them. With that I'll turn it over to Brian for a diesel and jet.
Brian Partee: Yes. Thanks Tim. So to continue on demand Manav I can kind of talk across our entire book. So to Tim's point we see the exit rate for July is down about 10% to 15% overall. So I can echo what Tim's seeing that just a couple of regional notes the one I guess downside note on a regionality is in the southwest. So with the resurgence in cases of COVID in the southwest we have seen a weakening here in the last several weeks in that particular region. On the bright side the midwest and Atlantic coast both recovered and they're down roughly 7% year-on-year across in total book which is a really good sign for the Atlantic coast as everybody knows that we're pretty hard hit up in the New York, New Jersey marketplace. On the diesel side we hit our low point just as a reminder in the early to mid April. We were off about 22% year-on-year. We exited July off about 10% and to Tim's point on demand profile we have seen since the fourth of July kind of a sideways motion as it relates to demand but it's been pretty stable over that period of time but somewhat in a plateaued manner. The downside regionally the great plains is off 15% to 20% a lot of that it has to do with the heavy demands up in the Bakken area that have curtailed as a result of drilling activity up in that market and then the upside regionally midwest is about 5% off and we're actually up in the southeast year-on-year on the distillate side Closing out on jet fuel in the second quarter we are off roughly 34% year-on-year a pretty big out performance relative to the market. A lot of that has to do with our sales mix. We're heavily levered to cargo sales which are really strong resurgence really since the COVID outbreak and even before that with online retailing really driving a lot of the demand in the midwest and also up in the Alaska market. July we're actually down year-on-year in the low teens. So really strong performance by our aviation team. That's really starting to see the fruits of the combination commercially with the endeavor portfolio and MPC coast to coast. A lot of the jet buyers they're levered across not only the U.S. but just globally so really been able to create richer relationships there to drive incremental capture of market share overall. Really the outlook on August is pretty flat to July. We expect to be some downside to that based on the resurgence and in both cases stay-at-home orders as well as quarantine and really the thing we're watching right now as we look at the September is what is demand going to look like in September given that a lot of schools are not returning to normal people are working from home. So there is definitely a pent-up demand of folks wanting to move around. So it's a bit of a wild card what demand is going to look like in September. You can make as good of an upside case as a downside case. We're watching it closely.
Tim Griffith: And then I'll just circle back to crude I know you asked about the gulf coast but hopefully Canadian differentials will start to widen a little bit as more production comes online into that market and then on the west coast we're starting to see some foreign economic alternatives like Russian grades, Brazilian grades, etc. etc. So it's been pretty tough sledding for refiners and I'm hoping we get a little bit of margin improvement with some of the adjustments of crew production coming on.
Manav Gupta: This is a very helpful sir. I had a very quick follow-up on Dapple. I think you're moving about 50,000 on Dapple to your midwest and midcon refineries but I think there are three offsets  and Mandan can you split up your Bakken bargain usage between Dapple and non-Dapple. I'm just trying to understand in case  does go down are there enough offsets to that 50,000 barrels so you actually may not see an earnings headwind on the refining side.
Mike Hennigan: Yes, Manav that's accurate. So we have a bunch of other alternatives other than Dapple as far as supply. So if Dapple were to not run we think we have enough alternatives on the supply side. So I think you're right on with your statement. One comment I would say though on the logistics side with respect to Dapple as well as another pipeline up in that area the high plains pipeline, I mean MPLX is a 9% owner in Dapple and then the high plains pipeline if that were to shut down as well as a result of the recent discussions about the BIA looking to have it shut down. I'll give you a couple comments that I think would be helpful to clear in the market. Number one is we believe on the BIA that an appeal has been filed at this point which triggers an automatic stay of the shutdown. So we don't think there's anything in the short term because there is an automatic stay and then we'll continue to try and advance that discussion to a good conclusion for all parties. On Dapple obviously energy transfer is taking the lead in that discussion from the legal standpoint, etc. but both of those together if they were both to shut down on the logistics side we think the impact to us would be less than $100 million if both entities were to be down. We don't think that's the likelihood case but I just wanted to give you a little bit of the logistics side of it and then to your point on the MPC supply we think we have enough alternatives that Mandan would be supplied adequately as well as our PADD II refineries.
Manav Gupta: Thank you so much for taking my questions.
Mike Hennigan: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Benny Wong with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Benny Wong: Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. My first one was wondering if you can provide some color or details around that 15-year supply agreement with 7-Eleven? Wondering if there's a value or you would assign to it and maybe give us a sense of the opportunities of growth in terms of areas and size there.
Mike Hennigan: So I'll give some comments and I'll let Benny add. I mentioned earlier one of the big benefits in the agreement is we maintain a lot of the integration benefit that we see as part of our portfolio. So I mentioned earlier it's about approximately 8 billion gallons for 15 years. So it's a long-term relationship that we're looking forward to with 7-Eleven and a lot of the integration benefit that we have is providing the logistics service and providing the transportation and trucking services. So we're going to continue to provide those services for 7-Eleven. So there'll be a benefit to us as far as using our logistics assets, using our trucking services, trying to give them the utmost and terrific service. So I think it's a win-win for both of us. We're going to capture the integrated value as far as the logistics and the supply and in 7-Eleven obviously we'll capture the margin in the retail business going forward. Another important point is that's 7.7 billion hold steady for the whole 15 years. So it's a very long-term relationship so that's one component and the second component is we plan to work hand in hand with 7-Eleven as they grow out their portfolio. They've had a stated goal to expand to about 20,000 stores. So we have a second agreement with them that I'll let Brian comment on which is to continue to supply them beyond the existing Speedway situation.
Brian Partee: Yes. Thanks Mike. Yes, it's a little tricky to talk about the supply agreement commercially for obvious reasons but maybe I'd kind of underscore a couple of the guiding principles and tenants to it and hit upon what Mike already mentioned really is it's important to know we had a market-based philosophy. So it's very difficult and tricky to develop a long-term supply arrangement but we think we've done it. We think this is a really good solid relationship that's a win-win for both parties. If you think about the history of the Speedway portfolio literally growing up over decades in and around the infrastructure. So it's important to us to preserve the integration value operationally associated with that which we've done so in the contract. At the same time providing a really compelling supply operationally as well as commercially for 7-Eleven in the transaction. So we think going forward it's really set up well for both sides from a win-win perspective and then Mike from a growth perspective historically we haven't had I'd say based on their scale 7-Eleven haven't had a huge supply relationship with them. So we think there's opportunity there especially across the broader platform that we now have coast to coast to work closely together to find more opportunities. So we think we've started down the right path. We think we've got the commercial construct to get there and we're excited about the prospects of going forward once we get to the closing table to drive incremental value not only for MPC but across both sides of the table.
Benny Wong: Great. Thanks. That's very helpful. My follow-up question, a follow-up on your decision on closing Martinez and Gallup just wanted to get your thought on the impact especially Martinez on PADD V when we get back to more of a normal environment, should we expect that region to flip to be more an important product and what you think that potentially does to the margin volatility in that region and also wanted to get a sense in terms of the change in cost structure it brings and if you think how much the price improvements from a tighter supply might bring to other assets and potentially offset the normal contributions from these assets.
Mike Hennigan: So I'll let Brian make a comment on the balance and then Ray can make a comment on the cost structure.
Brian Partee:  Yes. As it relates to the west coast balance I think taking Martinez down is certainly directionally helpful for the balance and that's an obvious statement. Hard to predict though going forward what that actually looks like as we continue to trend out of COVID but we've been able to optimize and resupply with inter network as well as with some of our trade partners in that marketplace. So directionally positive and on the diesel side I think Ray hit on it earlier if you think about the mix of diesel production out of Martinez and what we're replacing with renewable diesel going forward, we need to go one for one but the key there is renewable diesel is the demand element in the market. So it puts us in a really good position to not be the exporter in the market to really help penetrate the market with what's being demanded out on the west coast. So hard to know with complete certainty and predict the future but obviously we feel it's very directionally favorable for the marketplace.
Ray Brooks: Hey Benny, his is Ray. I'll just talk a little bit on the cost structure. When I talked a little bit earlier about Martinez I commented that it has a very high cost structure as a refined product refinery. So that going forward we'll have a much more streamlined facility with the three hydro processing units, hydrogen plants and so forth. So we'll have a much lower cost structure on an OPEC standpoint as well as I talked earlier about the CapEx conversion. So at the end of the day we really feel that we'll have a cost advantage renewable diesel opportunity.
Benny Wong: Great. Thank you very much everyone.
Mike Hennigan: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Prashant Rao with Citi Group. Your line is open.
Prashant Rao: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on the west coast there. With Martinez going down how do you think about the synergies in having sort of that coastal coverage north to south in PADD V? Does that increase or change the way the importance of or change the way that you think about Anacortes or Kenai in terms of where that fits in the portfolio and then sort of related to that too I wanted to ask a follow-up about some of the lower complexity smaller refineries in the midcon but maybe starting on that west coast synergy question and then I'll wait for the follow-ups.
Brian Partee: Yes, Prashant. This is Brian Partee. I mean absolutely yes it's a fundamental shift not only in the west coast balance but certainly to our book. So as a result it has a direct impact on how we think about medium and long term about the assets out in the west coast. So something in the west coast system today is somewhat akin to what we're used to running in the midwest with some of the flexibility we have between the plants and this really just levers that and puts us into a different gear out west thinking about logistical assets, marine assets, terminal assets and whatnot to be able to optimize the overall portfolio. We've always run the midwest as a “system”and the west coast is largely functioning in a similar manner and we see this directionally helpful to help us optimize the system overall and we believe we've got the logistical capability to do that and really feel like it puts us in a great position going forward.
Prashant Rao: Okay. Great and then just to follow-up on some of the mid-continent broadly speaking assets the less complex refineries. You mentioned that the Dickinson conversion is on target and I think would that have kind of been in the back burner in terms of market view or what we were paying attention to and so that's it's good to get an update there but when you look at some of the other assets that are there you have a few other sort of lower complexity so to speak, smaller refining assets in the midcon. Where do you think that fits into the portfolio longer term; some of those in terms of disposal versus conversion or keeping them running as is just wanted to get some sense of your thought process around those.
Mike Hennigan: Yes. Prashant like I said a couple times here all the portfolio is going to be evaluated for what we think will be the best long term. You did mention Dickinson and I'll let Ray give an update so the market has a sense of where that stands but I think the takeaway should be we've obviously looked at several of the assets. We have we have a lot more that we're having discussion about and then hopefully like I said our goal is to get to a point where the portfolio is able to generate cash in all environments. I mean the one we're in right now is obviously very difficult but if we get back to a more normal environment we want to have a portfolio that's very resilient. So Ray you want to make a comment on Dickinson?
Ray Brooks: Yes. Hey with all the challenges that we've had with COVID, very-very pleased that we've been able to progress Dickinson right along schedule and so at this point we're still targeting before the end of the year to complete construction of 12,000 barrel day renewable diesel facility and start up and have product by the end of the year. So that's still trending very well for us.
Prashant Rao: Okay. Thank you very much for the time.
Mike Hennigan: You're welcome Prashant.
Kristina Kazarian: And with that operator thank you and thank you everyone for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or would you like clarifications on topics discussed this morning our team will be available to take your calls. Thank you so much for joining us. Have a good day. 
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-05 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MPC First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. My name is Jacqueline and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct the question-and-answer session . Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.
Kristina Kazarian: Good morning. And welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our Web site at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investors tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Don Templin, CFO and other members of the Executive Team.
Mike Hennigan: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call today. As everyone is aware, the global pandemic became the focus in the quarter and that continues today, with our immediate priority on safely operating our assets to supply products to the market, protecting the health and safety of our employees and customers and supporting the communities in which we operate. The actions taken to prevent the spread of the virus has significantly reduced global economic activity and demand for our products, specifically towards the last month of the quarter. Our refining operating areas have been particularly hard hit in the upper Midwest and on the West Coast. At the same time, our midstream and retail businesses reported strong results, which offset some of the financial impact of lower refining demand and margins. As a result of this difficult situation, we're responding with prudent tactical changes in our business. First, reducing our total capital spend by $1.4 billion or approximately 30% to $3 billion for 2020. This includes approximately $700 million at MPC and $700 million at MPLX. This reduction is planned across all segments of the business with the remaining growth capital spend, primarily related to projects that are in progress or nearing completion. Second, we have reduced our planned operating expenses by approximately $950 million, primarily through reductions of fixed costs and deferring certain expense projects. This includes $750 million of operating expense reductions at MPC and $200 million of operating expense reductions at MPLX. Third, we've taken steps to maintain our financial flexibility. We’ve secured $3.5 billion of additional liquidity, including a new $1 billion 364-day revolver and issued $2.5 billion of senior notes. After taking these actions, we have approximately $6.8 billion of undrawn availability on our credit facilities. These actions strengthen our liquidity and also strengthen the through cycle earnings power of our business. At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Don to review the first quarter results in more detail. Then I'll come back and share my early focus areas as we start to implement changes at MPC going forward.
Don Templin: Thanks, Mike. Slide 5 provides a summary of our first quarter financial results. Earlier today, we reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.16. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.9 billion for the quarter. Cash from operations before working capital changes was $1.3 billion and our dividend payments for the quarter were $377 million. Slide 6 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from fourth quarter 2019 to first quarter 2020. Adjusted EBITDA was down approximately $1.3 billion quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by lower earnings in refining and marketing. Lower crack spreads due to demand destruction from the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted R&M earnings. First quarter results also included non-cash lower of cost or market adjustments to inventory, and goodwill and asset impairments totaling $12.4 billion. Moving to our segment results. Slide 7 shows the change in our midstream EBITDA versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Midstream EBITDA increased $19 million versus the fourth quarter. The increase was driven by stable fee-based earnings and sustained organic growth in the base business, overcoming headwinds from declining natural gas prices in the quarter. Slide 8 provides an overview of our retail segment. First quarter EBITDA was $644 million. Retail margins were nearly $0.33 per gallon in the first quarter. These strong fuel margins were partially offset by lower fuel volumes compared to fourth quarter, reflecting demand destruction associated with COVID-19. Same store merchandise sales increased year-over-year, despite fuel demand pressures in the quarter, reflecting the resiliency of the Speedway brand. We continue to target fourth quarter 2020 for the completion of the separation of Speedway, and we are progressing separation activities. However, the separation timing could change given COVID-19 related impacts to the business environment and access to the capital markets. Slide 9 provides an overview of our refining and marketing segment. Performance in this segment reflected the challenges associated with managing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated shelter in place orders. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $154 million, a decrease of approximately $1.3 billion versus the fourth quarter. Margins in all regions decreased compared to fourth quarter 2019, particularly in the Midcon and West Coast regions where we saw a negative gas cracks towards the end of March. Despite these challenges, our commercial team was able to capture a favorable price realizations for both gasoline and diesel.
Mike Hennigan: Thanks, Don. Obviously, the current environment is required our immediate focus to ensure our through cycle resiliency of our business. But I also wanted to briefly share my view for the future. Over the past decades, this company has grown to become one of the largest energy platforms in the country. Although, MPC has been successful in many areas, there's also a strong case for change to drive increased profitability, stronger through cycle earnings and long-term value creation. There are three areas that will be our early focus to help us achieve these objectives. First, we need to strengthen the competitive position of our portfolio. This means positioning our assets to be a leader in cost, operating and financial performance metrics. MPC has always been focused on safety and operational excellence and that will not change. However, we need to focus further on the contribution of each of our individual assets and ensure that financial performance in all cycles meets our expectations and contributes to shareholder returns. Second, we need to improve our commercial performance. We are fortunate to have an extensive fortunate to having it and extensive integrated footprint. We have an opportunity to be more dynamic to capture higher margins across the value chain. Success for our refining system starts with raw material selection, it's an area of opportunity for us to further take advantage of the refining asset capability. In addition, we have the opportunity to enhance and optimize the placement of our products across both the sales channels and the geographic marketplace. Focused enhancements to both raw material selection and product placement will increase our ability to maximize value across the entire value chain, increasing the margin we deliver to the bottom-line. And third, we need to lower our overall cost structure and be extremely disciplined in capital allocation. This means lowering our cost in all aspects of our business and challenging ourselves to be incredibly disciplined in every expense dollar we spend across our organization.
Kristina Kazarian: Thanks, Mike. As we open the call for your questions as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow up. If time permits, we will re prompt for additional questions. We will now open the lines for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session . Our first question comes from Neil Mehta. Your line is open.
Neil Mehta: Mike, good morning team. And my congratulations on the new role as CEO. My kick off question here is on the cost savings and the capital reductions that you announced. Can you put some more meat on the bones behind key line items that drove those reductions? And how should we think about whether cost and capital reductions are cyclical in response to the environment versus structurally more capital efficient approach you’re taking to running the business?
Mike Hennigan:
Don Templin: As you'll recall when we rolled out our budget for 2020, our refining and marketing budget was $1.55 billion that included $450 million of maintenance capital. So it essentially included $1.1 billion of growth capital. And when we talked about our plan originally for 2020, about 60% of that growth capital was really attributable to two primary projects; one was the continuation of the STAR Program, which we’ll run into next year 2021, so that's at Galveston Bay; and the other was the Dickinson renewable diesel project, which will complete this year. So if you think about 60% of our $600 million basically of capital, of the growth capital was those two projects, one will be completely done and the other will be in sort of a tapering mode and nearing completion. You'll see that we'll have a lot of flexibility around our capital budget next year.
Mike Hennigan: I'm going to add a little bit to the expense side. So again, back to your question, how much is variable versus structural. Obviously, with the pandemic and us reducing refining rates back to minimum, there's a portion of variable costs there. But out of the $750 million of expense reduction on the MPC side, majority of that is fixed costs that we expect to maintain at a lower level, about $500 million of it being fixed. And I'm going to let Ray kind of comment on that in that area, and then partially part of it is variable. On the midstream side, about $200 million of it mostly we said was deferred expense projects. So right now they fit in the deferred column. But as we look at that further, we're going to take a look at whether they need to be deferred or whether they actually are part of our long term plan. So let me let Ray add a little bit of color to the refining fixed costs situation.
Ray Brooks: On the fixed costs and refining, there's really three components that make that up. The first would be the turnaround segment just lower overall turnaround expenses for the year with some deferral out of 2020. And then the other categories are lower maintenance costs and expense projects, just choosing to do less work, less projects at our refineries.
Mike Hennigan: Does that answer your question, Neil?
Neil Mehta: Yes, very clear with lot of good color there. The follow up is just on Speedway. Mike, can you just talk about from your perspective as the new CEO. How strongly you believe in the strategic merit of the Speedway spin off or sale? Whether you're still targeting the fourth quarter, which you indicated in the press release and just any strategic updates around the execution of the sale, which for many investors is an important catalyst for the stock?
Mike Hennigan: So I do believe the separation is the best value proposition for MPC shareholders. So what we said in our remarks is we are still on schedule. And the expectation that we had guided before was completion in the fourth quarter, I'd say we're still scheduling and on target to accomplish that. So strategically, I still believe the separation is the best value enhancement for MPC shareholders. The only caveat that we put out here obviously is the COVID-19 situation is still very fluid and we'll have to see how that plays out as far as recovery in the business. And then the capital market access is another important part of executing that separation in a highly efficient manner. So with those two caveats, we are still committed to separation and we’re continuing on the schedule. However, we just want to be cognizant of the current environment that could implement the timing a little bit, but we'll have to see how that plays out.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Legate. Your line is open.
Doug Legate: Mike, let me add my congratulations to your new role. Looking forward to seeing what you do next. In that regard, I wonder if I could just pick off on one of your comments you made on the call about the key steps you're taking. And maybe ask a bit of a leading question. Where do you see the weak links in the remaining portfolio post Speedway? What are the areas you think need to be addressed to achieve your objectives?
Mike Hennigan: Doug, I'm not ready to disclose the term weak links. What I will tell you though is we're going to do a comprehensive look at all of our assets. And overtime, you're going to see us come out with disclosures as to where we feel we are from a competitive position on each of the assets. As I mentioned earlier to Neil's question, I'm a big believer in looking at long-term value of the assets. I'm a big believer in managing to free cash flow on an individual asset basis, so that the overall portfolio is generating cash. I mean as you're very aware, this is a lot to a large extent a return of capital business and I think we've done a good job of that in the past. And I think there's just an opportunity to do a little better in there if we really look at the portfolio. So I do think I hope to takeaway is we are going to spend a lot of time on the portfolio of all the assets. We're going to look at where we can improve the competitiveness of those assets, either from a cost standpoint or commercial standpoint, that's going to be a very high focus. So, I'm hoping to leave you with those three items that each asset in the portfolio is going to be examined our overall commercial approach. And we started in that discussion already is going to be discuss quite a bit. And then lastly, we're just going to lower the cost structure of the company. We think there's an opportunity to do that at this point and we're going to get after that as quickly as we can.
Doug Legate: Presumably that means asset rationalization is on the table, Mike?
Mike Hennigan: Yes, I think so, Doug. As I said, all the assets that we have in the portfolio are going to be examined. But yes, I think so. And I previously mentioned in the midstream space that we don't want in eight basins that's still a true statement. However, the gas business is now going through a little bit of a change. But yes, it applies to all the other assets that we have in the portfolio, whether the retail assets in the short term or the refining assets as well. So yes, a real good examination of the competitiveness of our portfolio is the first priority.
Doug Legate: My follow up is, I was going to ask you about the dividend, but you talked about return of cash to business and so I’ll leave that for someone else. What I would like to ask you guys is you’re in a unique position to monitor demand trends, couple of your competitors obviously have talked about I would call it green shoots coming out of April. I'm just wondering what you can share with us in terms of how you see things evolving in your markets. And I guess more importantly, the 65% utilization guided for the next quarter. How would you respond? How quickly would you like to step up your activity before you feel comfortable enough I guess, with the demand recovery is really underway. I'll leave it there. Thank you.
Mike Hennigan: So I'll start off on the high level macro. Obviously, there's a lot of optimism towards recovery. At a very high macro level, fiscal policy from the administration towards stimulus packages are being implemented, monetary policies at low rates, oil prices are at low rates for consumers. So there's a lot of optimism and recovery. My caution however, is we are currently in an oversupplied market. This has been a demand driven event, both globally and in the U. S. We've been particularly hard hit in our view in the upper Midwest and in even more particularly on the West Coast. So we're optimistic that we're starting to see that recovery. We'll have some comments -- I'll let Tim comment on specifically at the gasoline level as far as our same store sales to sort of give you a little bit more color there. And and then I'll let Brian give you a little color overall on the diesel market as well. So I'd say overall, optimistically that we're seeing good signs of recovery, but we still got a long way to go that we're still over supplied on pretty much crude and products across the board. So there's a lot of inventory that needs to work off. As far as when do you respond? Obviously, the market will tell us that. So it's a demand driven event. And when the demand is sufficient for us to change our strategy we'll do that. But for right now, we're staying at minimum rates. So let me let Tim comment a little bit about what we're seeing at Speedway.
Tim Griffith: Doug, at the retail level as a lot of the stay at home orders got put in place in sort of the middle and late part of March. We saw gas demand, which bottomed probably even more than 50% down. I mean, that was in sort of late March and early April. We've seen steady recovery since mid-April with 5% to 15% improvement, really dependent upon the region off of the lows. The weekly data that we're seeing in terms of sales are supportive of that trend so far. And we expect to see continued improvement as more of the states continue or start the reopening protocols over the next couple of months. I mean, the timing of a complete recovery is uncertain. It's really a function of how quickly these stay at home orders are removed and how quickly the consumer gets back out on the road. Obviously, we've got a lot of businesses where people continue to work from home and they may continue through this month but we'll watch that activity. We've certainly seen a nice creep in demand and expect that's going to continue. But we've got to get the commuters back on the roads rather they're commuting to work, rather they're taking kids to school, which we may not see until the fall, rather they're driving to locations for vacation or else wise. We've got to get consumer back on the road and hopefully get some signs of recovery. So we're seeing some nice signs but there's probably a few months before we can really give a better sense for exactly how this is going to play out. But we're definitely off the lows and seeing some nice improvement.
Brian Partee: Doug, this is Brian. Just to kind of reiterate a little bit on the gasoline side and builds off of what Tim said. We have seen really the profile of the decline. It was really the last two weeks of March, where we really seem to clip off really fast really across all geographies. You hit the bottom of the market we look week on week sales, we think this is the most relevant data points in the short-term. So the week of April 6th was really what we're calling kind of the bottom of the market. And over the last three weeks, we've seen steady week on week growth. So we see that there's an optimistic trend for some of the reasons Mike indicated earlier, some of the drivers to that. So this week is starting off solid as well. But measured optimism, this is an unprecedented event. Not exactly sure what the profile of recovery looks like. We're seeing positive trends. On the distillate side, similarly we hit the bottom of the market in the week of four and six. Very modest recovery though since then, it's been less impacted. Overall EIA call on distillate demand has been somewhat declines, it’s been somewhere in the 20% to 25%. We have not seen that across our whole book. We're off more in the 15% range currently year-on-year. Part of that is due to gearing. We're not really exposed to PADD 1. So there's been, with some of the corona depths of impact in PADD 1, we're not really exposed to that the way maybe others are. So we're up more than 50%. Recovery on the distillate side is really going to be tied to the broader economy. Traditionally, diesel demand has been driven by the health of the economy. And we believe that's going to be the case and coming out of this is, we're going to be watching economic indicators. We think that will drive the recovery on the distillate side.
Doug Legate: That’s very thorough guys. Thanks. May I just add Mike that Kristina and her team have done a great job helping us navigate this. So thanks to here, thanks to Don for getting on the phone with us when your 8-K came out. So appreciate all your help.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Manav Gupta. Your line is open.
Manav Gupta: I have a question questions, bit of a demand question on the jet fuel side of the equation. We are seeing jet fuel demand, which is very low and refined trying to compensate by blending jet mode in the diesel and that is causing the diesel inventories to move out a little. I'm trying to understand how MPC kind of work around this entire jet fuel situation. And is there something that can be done with you don't blend jet fuel into the diesel causing the diesel inventory to move out?
Mike Hennigan: And I'm going to let Ray give you some specifics there. But I would add one comment to your question and kind of what Doug was asking as well is, I think there is some belief and we have this belief that there could be slower recovery back into the jet world. But that may also be a little bit of a boost to gasoline recovery, as consumers kind of stay more towards vehicles as opposed to airplanes, as the recovery starts to happen. I think that's a phenomenon that we're going to see a little bit. But let me let Ray give you some specifics on jet and diesel.
Ray Brooks: Manav, with regards to jet fuel, we have a lot of capabilities to blend that into the diesel pool and have done so in cases where we have high sulfur jet fuel we have the ability with the excess hydro treating capacity with the slowdowns to hydrotreat that into ultralow sulfur diesel. I guess the thing I really like to communicate is it's been very fluid as far as whether distillates strong initially distillate products. And so we had the ability to put everything into the distillate pool and we really stretched the distillate pool now. We're seeing into strengthening gasoline. We're reworking those swing streams and pushing some back to gasoline. We've communicated in the past that our swing between gasoline and distillate is about in the 10% range and we've been actually exercising every bit of that during the pandemic.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng. Your line is open.
Paul Cheng: I want to add my congratulation. Couple of questions. First on the commercial improvement. If we look back say 20 years ago from the commercial side. So when you're looking at what you know about the market that maybe a while ago and how Marathon has been doing. Is there any area that you think, okay, maybe that I can change on the best practice? In other words, what is the overall -- and also do you need to relocate your operation for the commercial to be closer to maybe either Houston or that some of the commercial hub? And do you need beef up in your talent, external talent on that operation? That's the first question.
Mike Hennigan: First of all, I mean you hit it on the head. My personal background is more in the commercial area in the financial area. So it's an area where I'm going to spend a lot of my early time here. I don't want to give any real specifics. But to your second question, though, we do plan to have a bigger presence in Houston that’s something that’s on our list of things that we want to accomplish. We have not had that in the past. So Rick and his team are moving towards that. They've already had some stuff down in the Texas area. So I think you're going to see us over time you know develop much more of a presence down in that area. I'm a believer that the Houston market is the center of the oil markets in the U. S. just like New York is the center of the financial market. So having a Houston presence, I think is really important for us. As far as talent overall, it's another area that I think we're going to spend quite a bit of time, looking at where we can improve some of our talent across that area. So I guess, the good news and the bad news for my commercial team is I have a lot of background in this area. I have a lot of strong thoughts and how to approach things. So, there's going to be a good collaborative discussion about how to go about it. And I will tell you we started in that already. The immediate focus of what's happening with the markets as a result of COVID has forced a lot of discussion here. So, again due to the the competitive nature of it, Paul, I can't get into a lot of specifics here. But I can tell you as I stated earlier, it's one of my main three areas that we're going to spend a lot of time on.
Paul Cheng: Maybe can I just ask that, do you think historical data, the team is good but perhaps that they're a bit too conservative in their barometer how they look at things and not changing as maybe rapidly as the market conditions change?
Mike Hennigan: I've taken a second here to see what you were thinking there, Paul. I mean, there's some areas where I think we could be too conservative, there's other areas where there's different types of opportunities. I don't really think of it overall in that regard. I think of it more in how we approach the market, how we go about crude selection, how we use different things. I mean, we recently just saw pretty strong crude market contango and how to take advantage of that as an example, is some of the discussions that we've had recently. So I don't know if I’d use your term as the catch all for what we're doing. I think of it more as looking at what our assets do, how we position ourselves commercially, looking at how the markets are responding, where product placement is best suited. So I think having maybe a little bit more quick flexibility and reacting to markets quickly, if you're using that term to be conservative then maybe I agree with that from that perspective. But I just think, I use the word being more dynamic, more flexible, more able to adapt to market conditions quicker. And then overall, just having much more focus on what we're doing commercially to support the assets that we have in place. And I will tell you, one of the things that as a result of this COVID situation. We were having daily meetings on what was occurring in the marketplace and how we should be responding to that. And that's just one example of what the new environment will be going forward.
Paul Cheng: And the second question just for Don. Don, on the working capital management. If we looked at your two major competitors Phillips 66 and Valero, they’ve been in the same similar situation and Valero’s refinning operation in probably pretty similar size to yours but that the negative impact at least for this quarter on the cash flow from working capital is substantially less, roughly one is about half and the other one is far less than half of your impact. So can you maybe elaborate a little bit in terms of how perhaps that you guys manage differently than your peers if that's any different? Or is there any room for improvement so that we will be able to perhaps minimize the working capital swing a bit more?
Don Templin: I mean, I guess the working capital changes are really a function for us three primary things, our accounts receivable, our inventory position and then our accounts payable position. And there's lots of sort of moving pieces that impact each of those three components. What I did try to do was to give you a rule of thumb, so that you all could model changes in our business. I don't have sort of particular insight into what the amount of crude volume is in our competitor’s payables and what the amount of refined products sales are in their receivables. But what I can tell you for us during the quarter accounts receivable went down for the first quarter, went down about $1.9 billion. So that was a source of cash for us receivables went down. Accounts payable went down about $2.5 billion in the quarter and that was obviously a use of cash. And then our inventories, because we're trying to manage inventory appropriately and to capture contango in the market and those types of things, our inventories were up about $400 million. So the combination of sort of $1.9 billion on the accounts receivable side and then the inventory and AP move had a negative working capital impact of about $2 billion. We are also seeing some of that and I think we've articulated, we would have seen some of that continue in April where we started buying less crude volume. So to support 3 million barrel a day system in the first quarter, we're basically now supporting 2 million barrel a day system. So in April, you would have seen crude purchases going down from a volume perspective. But as we start to ramp up, you should see the inverse of that. We will be moving upwards. We’ll be buying more crude. And at least recently crude prices have started to increase as well. So that should also have a favorable impact on working capital.
Paul Cheng: Just a quick side question. With the new CEO, is there any plan to look at the accounting policy for turnaround in the expenses to capitalize it?
Don Templin: Mike is shaking his head. I mean, we've looked at that. I guess what we wanted to do you know, Paul, is we did provide going back about a year now. We did try to provide information that was pulling out the turnaround cost, so that you could look at sort of our adjusted EBITDA on a comparable or like to like basis. But some of our peers still actually expensed it and some of our peers obviously capitalize it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Roger Read. Your line is open.
Roger Read: I guess I'd like to get into a little bit of maybe the forward looking side, the refining restarts, particularly obviously Martinez and Gallup. As we think about the OpEx and the CapEx guidance. Is that built in there for say Q3 restart or should we presume that that's out until '21? And then what happened  CapEx, OpEx side though?
Mike Hennigan: I'll start off and then I'll turn it over to Ray. One of the things that I think everybody realizes is the different regions have been hit harder or less to some extent depending on where you are. I mean, we've been particularly hard hit on the West Coast. If you're looking at our guidance, we're at minimum across the system. But in the West Coast system, we're running at about 50% of capacity as opposed to the roughly 66-67-ish overall. So the West Coast demand drop was even more severe than I'll say the whole national average, which led us to take more action on the West Coast specifically in that area. So let me turn over to Ray to give you a little more color on both Gallup and Martinez.
Ray Brooks: Roger, as far as Gallup and Martinez, your question as far as the guidance, does it take into account the cost of Gallup and Martinez. And the short answer is yes that it does. We chose to idle our two higher cost refineries and make up that production and resupply with lower cost facilities and all the cash impacts variable and fixed are taking into account in that.
Roger Read: Yes, I understand in terms of the Q2 guidance. I guess I was just curious on a full year restart of those units. Is that also included or does the guidance presume that those assets are offline for all of 2020? That's what I was kind of getting at. In other words, we are seeing a recovery off of coronavirus. And as we look to the latter part of the year, the expectation would be we get very close to kind of normal levels. At least enough, I would think gets both those units back online. So I was just curious, is that included in the guidance? And then I had one follow up question.
Mike Hennigan: So we stated that those assets are idled on a temporary basis, and we'll have to see when the market requires them to come back online. I think the question you were asking though is, we don't see significant costs at all to bring those back up. I mean, Ray has them on hot standby, so I'll let him comment on that. So we are prepared to bring those back online when the demand in the market have requires it. We just in the short-term have seen some recovery, as Tim and Brian had alluded to earlier. But we still have a ways to go before we would be needing that asset, so to speak.
Ray Brooks: Roger, taking both those refineries down, Gallup and Martinez, it's not dissimilar from a hurricane standpoint when we take one of our refineries down. We take them down sequentially. We keep the utility systems going. We keep there are still operators and maintenance personnel looking after the equipment. So we would see a restart being fairly easy done within the time period of about a week and not a significant cost impact.
Roger Read: Okay, great. Thanks. That's helpful.
Don Templin: Roger, this is Don, sort of one other point. Achieving those capital cuts and those operating expense cuts does not require those refineries to be idle for the rest of the year. I think that was maybe the way you were asking the question. I mean, we assume that those will come back online. And so our OpEx numbers and our CapEx numbers assume we're operating at more normal levels as the year progresses.
Roger Read: I was just trying to understand within the OpEx cut guidance, obviously, the CapEx cut guidance and the other parts. And then maybe flipping back to the kind of strategic question a lot of guys have tried to get out here on the call. Mike, as you look at the company. Do you expect to do or you already doing like a large sort of call it a benchmarking survey of everything that Marathon does or doesn't do and how well it does or doesn't do it at all as you think about the 2021 and on version of Marathon, presumably separated from retail as I think we all expect?
Mike Hennigan: Roger, so we started in that analysis and obviously, I've been part of the Marathon team for a while here, so I have my own initial thoughts. The only caveat I would give you though is in the 45 days or so that I've had to home, most of our time and most of the whole senior team’s time has been dedicated to the near-term situation. So hopefully, we'll get back to normal in the health situation as far as the country and also as far as the economy and get back to normal. But we started into the process. But I would also tell you that a lot of the time recently has been dedicated to the near in situation. So started more to come and I hope to disclose more as time goes by. But I don't want to kid you that the opportunity has been limited, because of the near-term situation and our focus on trying to respond to the pandemic.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Gresh. Your line is open.
Phil Gresh: My first question just on the balance sheet. Don, you talked about the target of having investment grade credit rating. Obviously, the rating agencies have put out some of their own metrics that they're looking at. We have the Speedway spin off here that is still planned. And I'm just wondering about how that spin off. And the distribution you might get from that spin off would help you achieve the investment grade rating long-term are or not cheap and maintain it, long term in light of the downturn going through. And more broadly, are there other levers do you think you can pull to ensure that you maintain it through this down cycle? Thanks.
Don Templin: Phil, I guess I wanted to recommit to. We want to defend our investment grade credit profile, and we'll continue to defend that. I think Mike mentioned in the discussions around Speedway, one of the important things around the timing of the Speedway separation is our ability to capitalize Speedway and to be able to have a balance sheet at Speedway that allows them to take on some leverage. And that leverage will then result in cash at Speedway, which will be distributed back up to MPC. And when they distribute that cash back up to MPC, we would expect that distribution would be on a tax free basis and we would expect that we would be utilizing all of that cash to manage the balance sheet. It would either be putting cash on the balance sheet to sort of support our core liquidity position. So historically we've maintained about $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet in addition to the revolving credit facilities that we've had. And I think we articulated when we announced the Speedway separation that we thought that requirement would probably be closer to $2 billion versus $1 billion. We'll obviously relook at sort of core liquidity in total, given all the events that have transpired over the last 30-days to make sure, or 45 days to make sure that we're fully evaluating downside risk to the company. And then the incremental amounts would be used to pay down debt. It's one of the reasons why we had some debt maturities. We have $650 million of debt maturity at the end of this year in December, and we have $1 billion of MPC debt maturity in the first quarter of 2021. And we were planning on having that debt mature, and didn't try to extend it previously, because we wanted the capability to be able to pay off debt at MPC without incurring any incremental costs to do that. So the timing of those maturities was really aligned with or coincident with Speedway transaction. We did go out into the market at the end of April and issued senior notes. Once again, we were very focused on shorter tenor notes, so three years and five years. There was some demand for 10 years but we didn't really want to get into the 10 year market. That felt like that was structural debt. We wanted to put on -- we're basically, if you will, allowing ourselves the flexibility to have shorter term debt, allows us to pay it off and allows us to manage our balance sheet without incurring significant incremental costs.
Phil Gresh: I guess just the follow up would be, just as I was referencing other levers that you might be able to pull and just to continue to lower debt balances, whether it's at the parent level or at a consolidated level. So how do you generally think about the distributions, whether it's the MPC dividend, the MPLX distributions and the priority of maintaining lower leverage moving forward, particularly if we're going to lose 1.5 billion EBITDA from Speedway? Thanks.
Mike Hennigan: On dividend policy, first off as you know, it's a board decision. And we had some very robust discussion about it. We think about this in the long-term and how do we see the business, you know as far as mid cycle earnings and how we see the business in the long-term. We obviously decided we wouldn't want to make a major change in return of capital on what hopefully is a very short-term issue. So our discussion led to our highest priority was defending liquidity, as Don said, and defending our investment grade rating that was very important to us. And I would just comment that we went into this event, if you want to call it that, with a little under $7 billion of liquidity. And now we've taken the working capital pain with a reduction in crude price, et cetera. And as Don stated in his remarks, we're sitting here at about that very same level. So we still have a lot of liquidity going forward. As far as recovery in the business, hopefully, it'll be sooner rather than later. I think you're hearing from our team, there's cautious optimism that we could be coming back. Yet at the same time, as Tim mentioned, we're still pretty far down year-on-year on gasoline demand, but we'll have to see how that recovers. But overall, our return of capital is something that we obviously think is really important. I mentioned earlier, I think this is to a large extent refining is a return of capital business. So we'll have a lot of discussion with the board as to how that plays out going forward.
Don Templin: Phil, I might also add, this is Don, on the working capital side. Given sort of the low volumes that were, or the low utilization rates we’re at and the lower crude prices, it is really I call it asymmetric opportunity now. We would expect that working capital will be a source of cash going forward as prices improve and as volumes pick up as opposed to the significant use of cash over the last 60 days.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Prashant Rao.
Prashant Rao: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. And Mike, congratulations and appreciate everything you outlined at the beginning there in terms of the three areas of early focus very helpful. Mike, my question is on really return on invested capital expectations here. First, on the remaining 2020 investments after these tax reductions. Is it fair to assume that these are probably toward the higher end of the range of clearing hurdle rates or on NPV basis versus what you've deferred? That's sort of more of a housekeeping question, I suppose. But bigger picture then the second question. Given this macro shock the potential for strategic value realization at Marathon's overall portfolio as you’ve outlined in your earlier is a focus here. Could you help us out with your thoughts on hurdle rates for capital projects? How they change going forward at all? And how that might be -- you're talking about every dollar earning its return that's invested. I wanted to think about that in terms of the various end markets that you're in, the segments and what that means for thinking about maybe putting higher hurdle rates on certain types of projects or in certain end market exposures.
Mike Hennigan: Prashant, I think the easy answer to your first question is yes. And then to your second point, the approach that I believe is especially in this type of business which is very volatile and when you invest capital, you're investing for a very long time. So I think using the word strict discipline is the best way to describe it. I stress test in general how do we think about investing capital if X occurs or if Y occurs. And my own personal bias is, because this refining business is very cyclical and there are downturns, you got to make sure that you're still getting a good return, even if you're having a down cycle so to speak. So overall, I think without giving you a specific number, we will be stress testing or in your terms, raising the hurdle rate to make sure that the investment that we do is very long lasting and is going to guarantee us a good return. So in general, that will translate to a higher hurdle. Yes, without giving you a number, I would say, yes, that's correct. And I think you're going to see us have a lot more robust discussion on the strategic nature of where we invest and guaranteeing ourselves that it is long-term investment and convincing ourselves that it's a good use of capital. I mean at the end of the day, we're stewards of the shareholders’ capital and that's one of the most important things we can control. I mean, in our business and I know you guys often ask a lot of questions about our views on things that we don't control, and we're happy to give you our views. But I try to spend a lot more time on the things we do control. And obviously have an opinion of things that we don't control as far as market conditions, et cetera, et cetera. But really spend as much time as we can on the things that we actually control and having discipline about how we spend that money, whether it's organic capital, whether it's M&A, whether it's expense dollars et cetera, et cetera. I think all those deserve a lot of attention and that's part of what we will focus going forward on.
Prashant Rao: And my quick follow up it’s really on the improving gasoline cracks that we're seeing on the screen and sort of sequential I guess I’d use the term measured optimism, I like that on the product demand side. Just for our purposes to help understand, given lower -- the low utilization rates and also crude differential volatility. What are the impacts that is kind of unprecedented here, but is capture impacted, should we be thinking about some maybe of taking a grain of salt in terms of dislocations versus what you're able to capture on a realized basis versus what we're seeing on the screen, either way either that you ever capture. But just sort of trying to reconcile that, because we all kind of have an idea of what we do in more normal times, but these are obviously sort of three sigma type of period we're in right now. So just wanted to sort of get your thoughts around that.
Mike Hennigan: I'll give a couple thoughts. One is we did the term of cautious optimism that we’re seeing some recovery. But I also try and balance that with the overall inventories we still have, I don't know what the exact number is. Dave can jump in. Maybe 30 million barrels of light products, gasoline and distillates that are over the long-term average. We're still sitting on roughly 50 million barrels of crude over that same long-term average. So even though I think we're seeing demand start to recover, I still think we have ways to go to get back to some closer to normal inventory levels and normal demand levels. So, I think that's just going to play itself out. Again, that falls into the category of something we don't control. We'll try and keep an eye on the demand. We do have some insights from our marketing view and we'll try and match the supply of our products into those demands. And then we're always going to try and be opportunistic to find the best market or the best region to optimize our system.
Operator: Our last question comes from Brad Heffern. Your line is open.
Brad Heffern: I guess that was a good segue into asking about another thing that you can't control. So I'm curious about just the inland differentials that we're seeing now. Obviously, in late-March and early April, we saw these very wide differentials. Now as the shut-ins have started to increase, we're seeing relatively narrow differentials, especially for WCS. So can you give your outlook on that? And any thoughts about how sustainable it is if sort of inland cracks aren't increasing at the same time? Thanks.
Rick Hessling: On inland differentials, you’re spot on. We have seen incredible volatility, literally from one end of the spectrum to the other. Right now, what you're seeing in the marketplace is you're seeing the free market work. You're seeing North American producers and specifically U. S. producers, Canadian producers, self regulating, if you will and it's affecting the differentials. However, they've come in and they swung the other way here in the last three, four weeks versus blowing out 30 days ago. I think the offset honestly will be as the states come out of shut-ins and demand increases, you'll see some more volatility there. So predicting where they go is difficult, a lot of it is demand driven, a lot of it is producer cut driven. So, I would tell you though, when you look at the mid-cons specifically, Brad, it's very tight inventories at Cushing are extremely high as that’s well publicized, almost at maximum. So I think, you're going to continue to see incredible volatility in the mid-con, which we will be able to take advantage of.
Brad Heffern: And then as my follow up, just a question about the asphalt market. So typically when we have flat price this low, asphalt is a much greater contributor to profitability than it would normally be. Is that the case right now? And can you talk about how the demand side looks? Obviously, we have these COVID impacts, but I would imagine maybe some governments are taking advantage of this to do more road repairs than they normally would? Thanks.
Brian Partee: So currently asphalt, if you look at the inventories, we've been towards the higher side on the inventories. Part of that had to do with coming out of IMO in the first quarter. But the work log is out there. We're seeing the demand starting to pick up as we head into the season here. I don't know that asphalt has an outsize contribution at this point relative to overall contribution. We have seen steady, the benchmark we look at when we think about the asphalt market is, asphalt prices relative to TI and we've been selling over TI consistently, which is fairly typical with down market. So from a pricing standpoint, we're happy with where things are at. The work is starting to pick up. The watch out or focus really on the asphalt demand is going to be really taxes and access to funding at the local levels and cut in discretionary spending. And it's uncertain whether we see that or not, that’s unfolding as we speak. But working with our customers, the backlog is there, they're ready to go to work, we're starting to see it pick up. So, I guess it falls into the measured optimism similar to what I said on the distillate side of things. But that's kind of where we sit today on the asphalt market.
Kristina Kazarian: Great. And with that, we'll end our call today. So thank you for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or would like clarification on topics discussed this morning, our team will be available to take your call. Thank you again for joining us. Operator?
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect at this time. Have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-01-29 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MPC Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. My name is Jacqueline, and I will be your operator for today's call.  Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Doug Wendt. Doug, you may begin.
Doug Wendt: Thank you, Jacqueline. Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investors tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, Chairman and CEO; Don Templin, CFO; Mike Hennigan, CEO of MPLX, as well as other members of the executive team.
Gary Heminger: Thanks, Doug, and good morning, and thank you everyone for joining us. I too would like to congratulate Kristina and look forward to her return in a few weeks. If you please return to Slide number 3. Earlier today, we reported adjusted net income of $1 billion or $1.56 per diluted share. This quarter's performance demonstrates our continued ability to execute across all aspects of our business and capture incremental synergies at an accelerated pace. In Refining and Marketing, the team's commercial document coupled with our geographically diverse footprint drove tremendous capture results of 105%. Key drivers of capture for the quarter included strong gasoline price realizations, leveraging our integrated assets and scale to capture geographic base prices dislocations compared to broader market benchmarks and the impact of our strong synergy delivery. Our Refining team executed turnarounds, performed engineering projects, and completed major maintenance at multiple refineries. At Garyville, the crude revamp project and the first phase of the coker expansion project were commissioned, allowing us to realize higher coker unit rates from the expanded drum size. The second phase of the coker project is on schedule to be completed in the first quarter of 2020. Early operating results in the first quarter, coker, have been very positive and we have been able to achieve a 17% capacity increase, exceeding our original project expectations. We expect - anticipate the second phase of the project to achieve a similar rate increase. Our Speedway team also executed well this quarter. They delivered strong results while also exceeding our cumulative store conversion target with over 700 stores converted to the Speedway platform since the combination. In the Midstream segment, we progressed strategic long haul pipeline projects that are key to the development of our integrated Permian-to-Gulf Coast logistics system. Additionally, Northeast gathered, processed and fractionated volumes were up 18%, 14%, and 12% respectively in 2019 versus 2018, demonstrated continued growth and strong performance in this region.
Mike Hennigan: Thanks Gary. Turning to Slide 4. Today we updated MPLX's 2020 growth capital target to approximately $1.5 billion, down from the approximately $2 billion target shared last quarter. This reduction shows our ongoing commitment to high grade, our project portfolio. We are also targeting growth capital of approximately $1 billion for 2021. We continue to emphasize the growth of the L&S segment. We also remain focused on advancing our strategy of creating integrated crude oil and natural gas logistics systems from the Permian to the U.S. Gulf Coast.
Don Templin: Thanks Mike. Slide 5 provides a summary of our fourth quarter financial results. Earlier today, we reported adjusted earnings of $1.56 per share. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.2 billion for the quarter. Operating cash flow before working capital was approximately $2.7 billion. We returned $409 million to shareholders in the fourth quarter, bringing the total to $3.3 billion of capital return to shareholders in 2019, including approximately $2 billion in share repurchases. Slide 6 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from third quarter to fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was up approximately $100 million quarter-over-quarter, driven by higher earnings in all segments of the business. Fourth quarter results included a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $1.2 billion related to goodwill associated with gathering and processing businesses acquired as part of the Andeavor combination. Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 51%. This is significantly higher than our historical rate due to the effects of the non-taxable deduct - non-tax deductible midstream goodwill impairments and a biodiesel tax credit included in pretax income. Excluding these items, our overall adjusted tax rate for the quarter would have been approximately 17.5%. This adjusted rate was also lower than our normal 21% effective tax rate, primarily as a result of discrete tax benefits recognized in the fourth quarter.
Doug Wendt: Thanks Don. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions. With that, we will now open the call to questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan.
Phil Gresh: First question, Gary, you shared a lot of helpful color on your thoughts on how things are going to progress here from a macro perspective. Just wanted your additional thoughts on high sulfur fuel oil. You talked about your expectations that prices would continue to come down there and then pressure the sweet sour spreads, but obviously recently you've seen a rather strong improvement or strengthening in the high sulfur fuel oil crack. So what do you think is happening there and how do you foresee this playing out?
Gary Heminger: Yes. Phil, let me turn that to Ray Brooks. He will give you some color on this.
Ray Brooks: Hi, Phil. As far as high sulfur fuel oil, we have seen - we have seen that incentive and we've taken advantage of the fact with our system. I kind of want to break that into two pieces. The first is, our internal production of high sulfur fuel oil where we don't have coking capacity. What we've done through our investments at our coking refineries has have the logistics that essentially we're taking all back material and we're taking it to our coastal refineries with cokers and destructing that. The other thing is, we're configured for additional high sulfur fuel oil and we're taking advantage. The biggest thing thus far is out on the West Coast between LAR and Martinez, we're in the 20,000 to 30,000 barrels a day range of purchased feedstock. We talked earlier on the call about our work in the first quarter with Garyville, completing that coker work. Once that's done, we'll have similar opportunities at Garyville.
Phil Gresh: And then just from a macro perspective, maybe Gary your thoughts as to why the cracks have strengthened so much, and do you see a re-weakening of high sulfur fuel oil cracks coming?
Gary Heminger: This has really been our strategy all along that we didn't see that we will see a increase in the cracks due to higher distiller prices on the front end. We really saw it as a feedstock advantage on the front end as Ray just discussed. Now as we go forward and it appears to us, we're getting - the market is starting to strengthened and we're seeing pretty strong compliance with the shipping companies and switching over to the low sulfur fuel oil and we think that bodes well. We never expected in the first three, four weeks of January to have a acceleration in the distillate cracks. We thought this would come and we'll be stair-step into the year and that's still how we feel, Phil.
Phil Gresh: Second question would just be on the capital spending where obviously we've seen some reduction in the planned spending here. The refining growth CapEx is still fairly elevated in 2020, and I know in the past, Gary, I think you've talked about some potential for that to come down further especially as we look beyond 2020. So is that something that you would still expect? And then if I could tie in, just - the turnaround spending number is also up quite a bit year-over-year. Is this just an elevated turnaround year and is that something you would also expect to come down more in future years? Thanks.
Don Templin: Yes, Phil. This is Don. Let me address, sort of, CapEx first, and then I'll have Ray talk a little bit about the turnaround spending. So you'll recall that in December 2018 at our Investor Day, we targeted about $2.8 billion of capital for MPC, excluding MPLX, our target and we also targeted basically flat capital spending in 2020 from that $2.8 billion. So our total capital budget for MPC excluding MPLX is down. And as you rightly say, there are some projects that are multi-year projects. So about 40% of our refining growth capital is related to the STAR project. So that's the one at GBR and the Dickinson Renewable Diesel project. The Dickinson Renewable Diesel project will essentially be complete at the end of the year. So all of that capital will fall off, and the STAR project, it's spending will be substantially less in 2021 than in 2020. So your comment about some of those ongoing capital projects tapering off is absolutely correct. So let me turn it over then to Ray to talk a little bit about turnarounds.
Ray Brooks: Hey, when we did the combination back in 2018, the turnaround spend, go-forward spend was not as ratable as we would preferred. 2019, even though we did a lot of work at Los Angeles, Martinez and St. Paul Park was a little lighter than average. 2020 will be a little heavier in average, particularly in the first quarter, but we're working that our go-forward schedule is going to be more even year-in and year-out. Our biggest work is in the first quarter at 2020. We're currently in the latter stages at El Paso doing a turnaround on the south side of that refinery and then we'll follow that up with a pretty much full plant refinery at Salt Lake City, and both of these are seven year cycle ending turnaround. So not a whole lot of options to work with there. And then the other piece, that's major in this quarter, is we have the second phase of our Garyville Coker Max project, just starting in a couple of weeks, coupled with the catalyst change. So higher first quarter but when margins are low, that's when we really want to load our turnaround spend.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Legate from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Doug Legate: Gary, I have a feeling this might be your last earnings call. And so I just want to wish you all the best, but also ask you to maybe frame your outlook for the macro going forward. Specifically, is IMO playing out as you expected. I know you touched on it a few minutes ago, but it seems things are a little softer at least on the product side. And I wonder if I could have you elaborate on your confidence, let's say, that the new capacity additions going forward might be met with run cuts and less advantaged areas? And I've got a follow-up for Don please. But again, I hope to run into you again, Gary, and thanks for everything you've done over the years.
Gary Heminger: Thank you, Doug. Maybe in the future you can take me through a proper dinner. That's a long history with Doug. So Doug, the - yes, as I just stated, we think IMO is starting off like we had anticipated and we were conservative in our views on IMO, did not expect a significant run-up in crack spreads. Now, of course, this has been a bit of a downward move recently with the coronavirus, but I think that will - I think distillate demand will certainly pick up quickly the aftermath of this. But as I said, first, we are looking at feedstocks to be depressed and it gave us higher margins being able to run the feedstocks. That is happening. We are being able to eradicate all of the resid in our own system by moving it into our coastal refineries as Ray just mentioned. That's right on target of what we expected. And as I said, we never expected a immediate run up in distillate pricing. We think this is going to be more steady and stair-step over the year. And I think the most positive thing that we're seeing is what appears to be the compliance of the shipping companies. And so, yeah, I would say, Doug, it's right on target where we expected. Ray wants to add another comment.
Ray Brooks: Yes, the other thing regarding run cuts, the thing that I would offer, we talked about resid destruction, we talked a little bit about diesel. The other factor with IMO is VGO and how it plays into it. So what we've seen is a very, very strong VGO market and so we pivoted on that. So mainly in the U.S. Gulf Coast where we've taken about 50,000 barrels a day out of our cat crackers and putting that in the VGO market.
Gary Heminger: And Doug, I would say the last part --
Doug Legate: Go ahead, Gary.
Gary Heminger: Those coastal refineries of what we believe we have the highest leverage to anyone in the industry, but the coastal refineries that have the processing ability to handle the heavy resid and destroy that in our coking system. When you look across the globe, those refineries that have that processing are going to be advantaged, and we expect probably some East Coast and European refiners who do not have that capability will have a hard time competing on the front end here.
Doug Legate: I appreciate all your comments. I do not want to elaborate on this question too much, but Ray, could I just touch on your VGO comment. I mean, we've all been hoping that may happen, but do you think it's enough to perhaps cleanup the gasoline weakness that we've been seeing here in the last several quarters.
Gary Heminger: I think, Doug, I would say - I mean the thing that you're going to see immediately to clean up the gasoline inventories is the RVP changeover, that will be starting here in just a couple of weeks and that vector will accelerate anything then in VGO. Dave, do you agree with that comment?
Dave Whikehart: Yes, we get started actually out West with the RVP turn in a few days really, but additional to the RVP turn, Gary, is the shutdown scheduled coming up. That also tends to put a draw on not only Gasper diesel inventories.
Doug Legate: Well, thanks a lot of fellows. Yeah, it does indeed, Gary. My follow-up very quickly and I will hopefully keep it quick, because I've been talking a long time about the stuff already. Just the capture rates and synergies. I'm just wondering if the synergies are flowing through just obviously a little bit quicker, are we now seeing upside risk or permanent reset in your capture rates or maybe the likelihood that you are going to go out with the buying, Gary, and reset the synergies, higher sometime this year. That seems to be really

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-31 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MPC Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. My name is Amber, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.
Kristina Kazarian: Welcome to the Marathon Petroleum Corporation’s third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com, under the Investors tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, Chairman and CEO; Don Templin, CFO; Mike Hennigan, President of MPLX; Jim Moore, Lead Independent Director of MPC's Board as well other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on Slide 2 and 3. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. Now, I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger.
Gary Heminger: Thanks, Kristina. And good morning and thank you for joining our call. MPC has demonstrated a history of transformative actions to drive shareholder value. We separated from Marathon Oil in 2011, and since that time, shareholder returns have significantly outperform our peer group as well as the S&P. Over the same period of time, we have returned nearly $21 billion of capital to shareholders, including a dividend that has grown at a 23% compound annual growth rate. Now, I'll turn to Slide 5. On today's call, we plan to provide an update on our integration and execution successes from the past year and discuss our next steps to create shareholder value. We will close the call with a review of our third quarter financial results. Moving on to Slide 6. Over the past year, our primarily – primary operational focus has been integrating our two businesses, enabling us to execute and achieve our targeted synergies. Consistent with our continuous focus on transforming our business to deliver shareholder value, beginning in January this year, we embarked upon a strategic review process to identify the next steps in our value creation process. This review included Board involvement and engagement with multiple financial and other advisers. Throughout the process, we engaged with our shareholders to understand their perspectives on the company and incorporated their feedback in that review. As a result of that review, today, we announced our most recent step to create shareholder value, and that is our intent to separate Speedway into an independent company. The Board and our management are fully committed to pursuing the path that maximizes shareholder value, and we believe this separation will create two strong industry-leading companies, well positioned for long-term growth and success. So now I'll turn to Slide 7 please. The new Speedway will consist all of MPC's company-owned and company-operated retail stores, which collectively generates approximately 1.5 of annual EBITDA. We believe this business has significant growth potential, fueled by a strong loyal customer base. The direct dealer business, which primarily operates on the West Coast, will remain with MPC. This is a separately managed business within our Retail segment, which is only fuel supply with no merchandise sales. Moving on to Slide 8. As we look ahead, we are truly excited about the opportunity the separation presents to each company and will lock value and drive total shareholder return. We believe that this transaction has significant benefits for both MPC and future Speedway shareholders and has the potential to create an enterprise value at approximately $15 billion to $18 billion. On Slide 9, one of the most important aspects that drove our decision to separate Speedway today is how much we have grown the scale and earning powers – earnings power of the business. The number of stores has nearly tripled since 2011 to roughly 4,000 and the membership within our Speedway loyalty program has nearly doubled. These successes have helped grow Speedway's EBITDA from approximately $380 million in 2011 to approximately $1.5 billion this year, a nearly fourfold increase. The impressive growth of this business within MPC has created a position we are in today and our ability to unlock significant value for shareholders. Turning to Slide 10. Speedway has consistently been a top-tier performer in the convenience store industry. Historically, Speedway has had industry-leading same-store merchandise growth and fuel margins. On a profitability per-store basis, Speedway has consistently led the industry. And Speedway has built a platform positioned to deliver a strong earnings growth trajectory and exceptional free cash flow conversion which will support continued investment as a standalone company. On Slide 10, the new Speedway will be the largest U.S.-listed convenience store operator, boasting a coast-to-coast retail network and a nationally recognized brand. The platform will continue its industry – will continue to leverage its industry-leading customer loyalty program to help adapt to consumer buying trends with increased focus on digital engagement with our customers. Given the expansion of market multiples and growing size of the business, we believe any dis-synergies will now be outweighed by the potential value uplift of the separation. With the continued focus on synergies and the benefits from continuous store conversions, the new Speedway will be thriving standalone business capable of delivering strong, consistent cash generation and growth. On slide 12. Turning to the specifics of the transaction's next steps. We expect to accomplish the separation through a tax-free distribution of Speedway shares to MPC shareholders. An important step in the process is establishing a long-term market-based supply agreement between MPC and Speedway. We expect Speedway to raise new debt and pay a dividend to MPC as part of the separation process. MPC would utilize these proceeds to reduce debt. We plan to target a capital structure to maximize valuation for both sets of shareholders and position Speedway for growth. We expect the transaction to be completed prior to year-end 2020, subject to Board approval and customary closing conditions. On Slide 13, in addition to our Speedway announcement, we continue to evaluate midstream alternatives to enhance value for both our shareholders and MPLX unitholders. Unlocking value within midstream is more complex than the separation of Speedway. We have evaluated over 25 different scenarios to optimize MPLX' structure, including asset and business divestitures that we discussed on our second quarter earnings call as well as potential separation alternatives for MPLX, including the creation of an Up-C or conversion to a C Corp., among other structures. We also appreciate and consider the feedback we have received from many shareholders and unitholders over the past few months. Today, we announced the formation of a special committee of the MPC Board as the next step in our continuing process to determine the best path forward. On Slide 14, our goal has been and continues to be maximizing shareholder value over the long term. We have a track record of making bold, transformative change to drive value, and today's announcement is another step in that journey in that journey. Over the coming months, we expect to execute the separation of the Speedway business into a publicly traded company, continue optimizing MPC, progress the realization of synergies and continue evaluating opportunities to further unlock value in the midstream business. We believe these actions will result in strong, nimble and efficient businesses that are positioned for long-term growth and success. The new MPC will continue to be a best-in-class energy business, continuing our history of operational excellence with a strong financial profile that provides a compelling value proposition for shareholders. On Slide 15, let me turn to our earnings discussion. Before we get to our financial results, I would like to share some thoughts on the macro environment. Distillate inventory levels are meaningfully below the five-year average, setting the market up for strong momentum as we approach the implementation of IMO regulations. Gasoline inventories are also materially below last year's levels on the days of supply basis. U.S. turnaround activity for the fourth quarter appears in line with prior years, further supporting a positive forward outlook.  On differentials, the heavy Canadian market continues to move in our direction. The WTI to WCS spread, which averaged just over $12 in the third quarter, has widened to around $17 per barrel. Given the potential for government rail credits and easing of mandated production cuts, we expect continuing – continued widening of this differential. On the product side, the ULSD to high sulfur fuel oil spread has now widened to $38 per barrel, providing a significant tailwind for coking economics. MPC is well positioned to capture this opportunity across our major coastal refineries. At our Garyville facility, the coker upgrade project, which is occurring this quarter, is expected to increase our resid destruction capacity by 14%. As part of our ongoing preparations for the IMO fuel spec change, we have established a new retail bunker operation in the Los Angeles area to complement our operation in the Pacific Northwest. We made our first deliveries of IMO-compliant fuel from those facilities in October. Both locations are prepared to offer a variety of fuels to meet market requirements. The focus of the first year of our combination was execution to unlock realized value. We have made significant, observable progress, improving mechanical availability and operational integrity at our acquired refineries, expanding our commercial capabilities across the value chain and reducing costs. This, combined with our high-quality asset base, positions the company to be nimble and thrive in any business environment. I would like to take this time to congratulate Greg Goff for the announcement of his retirement from the company, and his 38 years in the industry have been quite impressive. Also, I want to congratulate Mike Hennigan on his promotion to President and CEO of MPLX, effective tomorrow. Mike has a deep background in all aspects of Marathon and MPLX portfolio, and we welcome his guidance as we go forward. Now I will turn the call over to Don Templin to discuss the third quarter highlights.
Don Templin: Thanks, Gary. Slide 16 provides a summary of our third quarter financial results. Earlier today, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.63. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes $164 million of turnaround costs, was $3.1 billion for the quarter. Operating cash flow before working capital was approximately $2.6 billion. We returned $848 million to shareholders this quarter. And through the first nine months of the year, we have returned approximately $3 billion to shareholders. Slide 17 shows the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from second quarter to third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter with slightly lower earnings in the Retail and Refining & Marketing segments, partially offset by higher earnings in the Midstream segment. Before reviewing the details of each segment, I would like to discuss our synergy capture for the quarter. As shown on Slide 18, we realized $283 million of synergies in the third quarter. $210 million of our synergies were in the Refining & Marketing segment. Benefits in the quarter included unit optimizations that improved distillate recovery. We also saw improvements in cat cracker yields and throughput and continued crude supply and refined product distribution optimization. In Retail, we continue to see benefits from economies of scale, our labor model and enhancement of the merchandise model across our newly converted stores. This has contributed to higher merchandise sales and margin at these locations. The $34 million in corporate synergies represents continued cost eliminations, including headcount reductions and contract renegotiations made possible by the combination. Through the first nine months of the year, we have realized $686 million of synergies, including $89 million of onetime synergies. Our execution through the first nine months gives us great confidence that we will exceed the upper end of our $600 million of gross run rate synergies targeted for 2019. Slide 19 provides additional insight into our synergy capture since the combination with Andeavor. Synergies improved capture by approximately 1.5% for the quarter. We have also delivered reductions in operating costs and overall SG&A expenses. Although these expenses may fluctuate somewhat from period to period, our team is executing on the commitment to reduce costs. Moving to segment results. Slide 20 shows the change in our Midstream EBITDA versus the second quarter 2019. MPLX EBITDA increased $31 million versus the second quarter. This increase was driven by growth across MPLX' business, which included delivering record gathered, processed and fractionated volumes. We also continued to progress the reversal of the Capline pipeline with a purge of the mainline initiated in October. In Texas, the Gray Oak pipeline is nearing completion and is expected to be placed to service by the end of the year. Slide 21 provides an overview of our Retail segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $555 million. Retail fuel margins were nearly $0.25 per gallon in the third quarter. Same-store merchandise sales increased 5.2% year-over-year, continuing the positive trend we have seen over the last year. Operating expenses increased by $47 million in the third quarter, primarily due to usual summertime seasonality. Speedway continues to execute its brand expansion strategy through store conversions. We converted 142 sites in the third quarter bringing the total number of conversions since the combination with Andeavor to approximately 550. We remain on track to reach 700 total cumulative store conversions by the end of 2019 including locations on the West Coast and in the Southwest. Slide 22 provides an overview of our Refining and Marketing segment. This segment performed very well despite declines in crack spreads in the Mid-Con and West Coast regions. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $1.4 billion, a decrease of approximately $110 million versus the second quarter, despite an approximately $5 per barrel decrease in the Chicago WTI 3:2:1 crack spread, Mid-Con margin only decreased by approximately $3 to $17.42 per barrel for the quarter. Our Gulf Coast margin was $11.26 per barrel in the third quarter, an improvement of nearly $2 per barrel versus the second quarter. Our West Coast margin decreased by approximately $2 to $15.85 per barrel for the quarter, primarily due to a $4 per barrel decrease in the West Coast ANS 3:2:1 crack spread. Capture for the quarter was an impressive 94%, a significant increase versus the second quarter. The increased capture was driven by enhanced margins through realized synergies as well as favorable price realizations. Page 30 of the appendix provides additional details on our capture for the quarter. Earlier this month, we completed turnaround work at our St. Paul Park and Gallup facilities. The Gallup turnaround was completed following a seven-year operating run, which is longer than the average five-year to six-year cycle we typically follow. As a result, during the Gallup turnaround, it was necessary to remediate numerous issues to bring the facility up to Marathon's safety and operational standards. During the St. Paul Park FCC turnaround, the refinery was able to maintain maximum crude rates by exporting gas oil, much of it to our Garyville refinery. This is the first time St. Paul Park has been able to export to this magnitude, yet another example of our commercial team's ability to leverage our larger system. Slide 23 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.5 billion. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was a $1.6 billion source of cash in the quarter. Working capital was $168 million source of cash in the quarter largely due to higher payable values, which were partially offset by higher inventory levels. Return of capital to MPC shareholders via share repurchases and dividends totaled $848 million with $500 million worth of shares acquired in the quarter. Distributions to public unitholders of MPLX were $310 million for the quarter. As shown on Slide 24, we have a strong track record of maintaining through-cycle financial discipline. At quarter end, we had approximately $28.8 billion of total consolidated debt, including $19.7 billion of debt at MPLX, which is nonrecourse to MPC. MPC's parent level debt of approximately $9.1 billion represents 1.1 times the last 12 months of MPC's stand-alone EBITDA. This ratio excludes the debt and EBITDA of MPLX, but includes the distributions MPLX paid to MPC. On Slide 25, we provide our fourth quarter outlook. We expect total throughput volumes of just under 3 million barrels per day. Planned turnaround costs are projected to be $185 million. We have planned turnaround activity at the Garyville refinery in coordination with our crude revamp and coker drum replacement projects. The project work and turnaround activities are aligned to optimize total plant downtime. We also have project work on the coker at our Los Angeles refinery. As a result, we expect higher operating cost for the Gulf Coast and West Coast in the fourth quarter for these project-related expenses. Total operating costs, including major maintenance, are projected to be $6.10 per barrel. Distribution costs are projected to be $1.3 billion, which is consistent with prior quarter guidance. For the Retail segment, we expect fuel volumes of approximately 2.5 billion to 2.6 billion gallons, and merchandise sales in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.
Kristina Kazarian: Thanks, Don. [Operator Instructions] With that, we will now open the call to questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Roger Read: Well, thank you. Good morning and Gary, congratulations on, I mean, what's been a great run across the board here. I know bumpy at times, but what you've been able to do in terms of putting this company together, given how well the Q3 results turned out and all. And then I think, setting up a really interesting strategic move here at the end, it's pretty phenomenal. I want to just say congratulations on that front.
Gary Heminger: Thanks, Roger.
Roger Read: And then could jump into the question side. I guess, really, what I'd like to talk about first is the strategic review, which I imagine was a component of the merger, but you started this at the beginning of the year, now we get the announcement on the retail front and potentially on the Midstream business as well. Just how did the whole thing come together? And I know we've had a lot of public pressure here in the last 30 days, but I can't imagine you decided to spin Retail just in the month of October. So maybe a little background on how the whole review process went?
Gary Heminger: Sure, Roger. And you're very astute in your thinking. As part of any integration process, and when we made this acquisition, it was evident as we try to bring these different business segments together and the operational components that we've talked often about the synergies. But as we go through month by month, though, working on the synergies, there's a much bigger picture that, of course, we've been looking at, and that is how do you take these assets, bring them together and how do you drive value beyond just one plus one? And so I'd say, going back, as Don commented and I commented in my remarks as well, if you go back to the early part of the year, that was just natural for us, working with the Board. Every Board meeting and in between Board meetings we would update our Board on how we were coming on a project that we call project uplift on looking at the various segments of our business and to determine the values. And we recognized, obviously, the widening of the market multiples within the retail class of trade, and we've been watching this for some time. But I think what's most important, and we recognized this very carefully in our due diligence process when we were looking at the acquisition of Andeavor that the retail component within Andeavor was set in many different modes and did not have a singular focus on how to drive value in that retail component. And we thought that, that was the first component that really made sense for us to combine the – into the Speedway brand quickly and then be able to drive synergies beyond that. And I think we are in a good way down the road in being able to accomplish that through Tony Kenney's, back when we first did the acquisition, and now Tim Griffith, carrying these synergies further, it just became evident and a compelling story that now is the time. You really look at it, Roger, since 2011, we took the EBITDA of Speedway from $381 million to about $1.5 billion, a tremendous story – tremendous execution story by all the members of Speedway.
Roger Read: No. Definitely impressive there. And another thing, kind of thinking about when you made the acquisition of Andeavor, the view here on the refining side was that Marathon was a much better overall operator refining, at least here in the third quarter, that seemed to come through. So I was just sort of curious if you could kind of help us understand a much better quarter than peers, I would say, in terms of utilization, in terms of capture here. And how much of that is something that you would say is now part of the sustainable model versus – you have maintenance one quarter, you don't have another, that always has an impact on sort of top line performance. But op costs looked a lot better, and again, capture looked a lot better. Just kind of help us understand how that process worked through.
Gary Heminger: Right. And I'll have Ray and Don go into a little more detail. I think what you're seeing is we've been asked many times by you and others, show us where the synergies are, where are the synergies showing up across the board? And I've said for the last couple of quarters, you just have to give us time. As we grow that through our integration, and you'll see that we will start to distance ourselves from the competition. That is showing up this quarter. I almost probably remiss after the first quarter and not stating, we had to go in and clean up a lot of refineries, particularly the old western refineries that needed some repair and integrity work completed, and we got that done. And so now I think that our refineries are going to be running very, very well. Let me ask Ray to go into some more of the details.
Ray Brooks: Roger, you kind of touched on the key drivers in your question. If I had to say two of them, they're high utilization and reliability of our assets during the quarter. We commented a year ago at the Analyst Day that reliability would be a key focus in our integration. If we go back to 2013 when we bought the Galveston Bay refinery, that was a key focus, and we're following that exact same game plan across all 16 refineries in our portfolio. Just to give you one example for the quarter, in the second quarter, we invested in a turnaround at the Los Angeles refinery in the cat and in the gas oil hydrotreater, but we just didn't do a turnaround. We invested in improving the reliability of the unit, and then we also invested, and we've talked about this in changing the catalyst formulation to give us better yields on the cat cracker and improve our gasoline production performance. That has worked out well for us, and into the third quarter, late in the third quarter, that really paid off handsomely for us.
Roger Read: Okay. Great. And once again, Gary, congratulations. We're going to miss you and hope everything rolls out fine for you in a, what I'm sure, will be a glorious retirement. Thanks.
Gary Heminger: Well, thank you, Roger. But you're going to have put up with me for another quarter.
Roger Read: Well, we'll suffer that. I'm just kidding. We look forward to that, and we'll definitely enjoy watching you ride on out. 
Gary Heminger: All right. Thank you, Roger. Very kind of you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Legate with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Doug Legate: Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Gary, let me echo the congratulations that Roger laid out. I was kind of hoping you and I would get a chance to do another supermarket launch in the U.K., but I guess, we'll have to leave out for another time. But for all the things that have gone on with the company in the last little while, you've put it together. And whatever value at least people think are going to come out of it, it really comes down to the vision you had when you started this whole thing. So true congratulations, Gary. And again, wish you all the very best in retirement. And with that – go on, Gary. Sorry, go ahead.
Gary Heminger: Thank you.
Doug Legate: Well deserved. Let me just ask a couple of questions, if I may, on the Midstream. I think Roger touched on it, but I don't think we've got into the weeds. You've obviously mentioned the committee without giving a lot of details. I'm just wondering if there's anything you can tell us at this early stage on how you might think about what that process looks like. What are you focusing on specifically if there's any one issue or several issues to how you think that might play out?
Gary Heminger: Sure, Doug. As I outlined in my comments, we have cases numbering 25 or more that we've looked at, many different scenarios. And Mike has really led – Mike Hannigan, has really led the analysis in and around the Midstream. And let me ask Mike to go into a little more detail here, then I can talk some more about what the committee will do going forward. So Mike?
Mike Hannigan: Hey, Doug. We're always looking at challenging ourselves on ways to create value. And just to let you know, we stated publicly back in the summer that we had been engaged for quite some time with multiple external advisers as well as our internal team on ways to unlock value in Midstream for both MPLX and MPC. Gary mentioned, we've analyzed over 25 different cases. We've looked at different structures, cash flow impacts, balance sheet impacts, tax considerations, transaction costs, liquidity and credit ratings, restructuring implications, synergies, dis-synergies, C Corp, no C Corp. All of those things play an important role in the analysis that we've done. And to date – Doug, the bottom line to date is we have not found the silver bullet to act on that would create value, and like I said, that's why we haven't announced any activity in this regard. We obviously support the Board's special committee to continue to evaluate options and look for ways to create value. But like I said, up until this point, we have not found the silver bullet.
Gary Heminger: And Doug, the committee that's going to be led by Mike Stice, who you know has a significant amount of Midstream experience, and Frank Semple, again, a lot of midstream experience and some other members of our Board, will continue to work on – work with management, but they will really drive this to a conclusion. And our goal, of course, is to come to conclusion sooner rather than later.
Doug Legate: I appreciate that answer. I understand it's early days, but I wonder if I could just follow-up with a related question. Obviously, the Midstream business was established by some pretty significant drop-downs from the Refining business. And one could argue that, that cost base increase for Refining has potentially left it somewhat volatile as a stand-alone company if you did separate out the Midstream.  So I'm just curious if you could kind of address that issue directly. Is a potential buy-in of at least part of at least part of the legacy Refining assets on the table as one of the potential options? I'm just curious how you address that residual volatility of a stand-alone Refining business. And I'll leave it there. And again, Gary, many congratulations. 
Gary Heminger: Thank you much Doug. And I’ll ask Mike to go into more detail. But you're right, and I remember discussing with you when we dropped the Refining logistics and the fuels distribution piece into the MLP. As we do this analysis, Michael will go into detail here that has been kind of a centerpiece of our analysis. So Mike?
Mike Hennigan: Hey Doug you are right on. That is one of the implications that are looked at in all these cases. As Gary mentioned, Refining logistics and fuels distribution was a major drop. We're looking at about $1.4 billion of EBITDA, and that comes into play when we look at how we would restructure to try and create value. So you're right on that, that's one of the implications. But like I mentioned previously, there's a lot of other implications that also come into play. That's one very important one that you're pointing out.  But as I mentioned, and I'm not going to repeat myself, but all those other things come into play too. No one single item was driving any of the analysis, but when you looked at everything on a whole, that's where we have come to not finding a silver bullet that would create value. And like I said, that's why we haven't announced. One thing I would say to you, though, in the midstream space, our strategic review continues to be driving the portfolio more towards the L&S segment. If you saw in our announcement, we've high graded the portfolio. And now that we've combined with ANDX, what was a $2.8 billion growth program, we've brought down to a $2 billion growth program with a lot of concentration on return on invested capital. And we are high grading the portfolio and diversifying it much more towards the L&S business and less towards the G&P business as part of our ongoing strategy.
Doug Legate: Understand. I appreciate the answers guys. Gary, if you're around for one more quarter, I hope to see you at our conference in New York in March. Good luck. Talk to you later.
Gary Heminger: Thank you for inviting me.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng of Scotia Howard Weil. Your line is open.
Paul Cheng: Hey guys good morning. Let me add my congratulations to Gary, Greg and also Mike for your new appointment. Gary, I think I perhaps know you longer than most people. Still remember that back in 1997 when you set up the Ashland and Marathon joint venture. I don't think anyone could even remotely look back, say, at the time of the super refiner that we see today. So congratulations. And also that, thank you for all the years, all the help.
Gary Heminger: Thank you.
Paul Cheng: With that, maybe then I have two questions. One, Gary, in the post-IMO world, if the economic is there, how much is the high sulfur we see or the major components that you guys can run in your system as a feedstock in your coker or the mixing with oil for the distillation tower? And when you do that, is there any economic loss or efficiency loss that you expect? Or that you essentially will be able to just replace – displacing the heavy oil by running the recede? And what kind of ratio we may be talking about? Then I have a second part question.
Gary Heminger: Well, that was kind of a three-parter there, Paul. But anyway, let me turn it to Ray Brooks. Ray has a lot of good details of what we've done to invest in our refineries. We mentioned we have the Garyville coker expansion going on right now. So let me have Ray go into these components of your question.
Ray Brooks: Sure. I'll do Gary. Paul at our coastal refineries we have the ability – the capability to bring in high sulfur fuel oil into our facilities and run it through our cokers. And when I say capability, we have both the process capability, the coking and resid upgrading and then we also have the infrastructure, the ability to receive it. So just to give you a flavor for capability on the infrastructure across our four coastal refineries with resid destruction, we have 50,000 barrels a day of capacity to resid. Now what I don't want you to do is assume that we're going to do that and just back out crude. That will all depend on the relative economics of the resid stocks that are out there and available and then in what we can do alternatively running crude oil. Now this is something that we're not just looking at, we are actually doing some of this today. Gary talked in the macro about the coker spread currently is $38 a barrel. So we're taking some of our cut resid from our Anacortes refinery, we're running it down to Martinez, running it through the coker and backing out some crude. So, it's something we have the capability to do and we're doing it today. Primarily, though, we do that through our delayed cokers.
Paul Cheng: Okay. Ray, does it make any difference between using delayed coker or fluid cooker? Hello.
Ray Brooks: Yes Paul, as far as delayed coker and fluid cokers the yield pattern we would expect to be roughly similar. What I will tell you is we don't have any – we have totally delayed cokers at our facilities, we don't have any fluid cokers. Our Martinez refinery, going back a decade ago, they did, but they actually replaced it with delayed coker and not so much for any kind of yield improvement, but from a reliability standpoint. So that's our prime mechanism for resid destruction. At Galveston Bay, we actually – I think you know this, we have a resid hydrocracker that can run 70,000 barrels a day. But primarily we'll feed that through back resid from our crude slate. 
Paul Cheng: Final question though, on the medium sour, we have seen them widening. And on the last couple of months that I think we have seen ASCI discounters are somewhat wider Mars. And so when will you guys purchase? Is it modeling to Mars or modeling to ASCI in your Gulf Coast system? 
Rick Hessling: Hi Paul. This is Rick Hessling. You're absolutely right. We're seeing the same widening you are in fact over the last couple of months we've seen a $2 or better widening. And if you look at the forward curve that continues to widen as we look out into 2020. I would tell you we feel part of that as IMO-driven. And I would also tell you that we're very bullish on the numbers and the forecasts that we're getting with the medium sour Gulf of Mexico production. So all good for MPC. Specifically to your question, I would tell you the majority of the ASCI crude and the Mars that we're running in the Gulf Coast is tied to ASCI. So that's very positive to us as we move forward, especially into 2020 and here at the end of the fourth quarter.
Paul Cheng: Do you guys run only Maya?
Rick Hessling: Right now we are balanced with our Maya receipts. Paul, we look at Maya next to our alternative, which is heavy Canadian. And we have great access to heavy Canadian. And right now we are very balanced with what we're receiving versus the optionality of the heavy Canadian that we have.
Gary Heminger: And Paul we have the ability, we could run more Maya. But every day, we're looking at what drives the best and maximizes our profitability. And due to the way our refineries are set up, we find alternatives that are better. And Ray can give you some more detail.
Ray Brooks: Yes, I just want to jump in here a little bit Paul. When we're looking at sourcing our crude, and I'm going to stick to the U.S. Gulf Coast where we have two powerhouse refineries in Galveston Bay and Garyville. We're not just looking at filling the coker, but we’re looking at filling the whole downstream suite of units. And specifically those two refineries we have a lot of reforming capacity, almost a quarter of our crude capacity is reforming at both Galveston Bay and Garyville. So we're looking for a crude slate that doesn't just fill the cokers, but it also fills the reformers. So we're looking at naphtha base – naphtha-rich crudes and resid-based crudes.
Paul Cheng: Thank you very much. And congratulations to Gary, Greg and Mike. And Gary, if you are going to be in New York, please let me know I want to take you out from dinner. Thank you.
Gary Heminger: All right. All right, I like that Paul. Thank you.
Operator: Next we'll go to Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Manav Gupta: Hey Gary, you talked about the shareholder returns since you spun off. One thing you did not talk about is the share price performance. I remember back in 2012 when I started covering MPC, you are a $30 stock. So from there to $130 [ph] adjusting for the stock split, it's a very strong run.
Gary Heminger: Well, thank you. Our team is very proud of us, and this is a team sport. 
Manav Gupta: Two quick questions, Gary. We have seen a material improvement on the capture on the West Coast. You kind of highlighted some parts of it. But if you can run us through what has changed since you acquired these refineries to this point where you are seeing a material improvement in operational and commercial operations on the West Coast, any initiatives that you have executed, which is allowing you to capture this higher margin?
Gary Heminger: Sure. Let me have Ray go into some of the operational highlights. And then I'll have Don talk about some of the synergies and how we're starting to really build our synergies quarter-on-quarter?
Ray Brooks: Sure. I'll start it off with the first few quarters of our integration, we were really focused at Martinez and Los Angeles on doing turnaround and project work, turnaround – cycle-ending turnarounds and also projects to improve our reliability. So the fourth quarter last year and the first two quarters of this year we had significant work and cost associated with that. In the third quarter we got to focus on running our assets, reaping the benefits of the reliability and the improvements that we made. So I really think that's what we're saying at Los Angeles and Martinez, we're seeing a good high utilization and reliability at both those facilities.
Don Templin: And I would say on the commercial side one of the things that we've been focused on is making sure that we, this is Don, that we maximize or optimize the system. And so a good example would be recently with the crack spreads and the economics on the West Coast have been very strong. And as we have historically supplied our growing Mexican – our growing Mexican needs from the West Coast. But we know we have the optionality and are executing on the optionality and are executing on the optionality to actually supply Mexico, the ARCO stations and the other supply that we're providing there from the Gulf Coast, so that we can optimize the realization in the California market – or West Coast market. So I think the combination of the Refining operations and the ability to have flexibility and optionality around the placement of our refined products we're really seeing some of the benefits that we anticipated that we would see and that were a driving force behind the combination.
Manav Gupta: Thanks for that. On Speedway, you have grown the business from $350 million to almost $1.5 billion now. And as you look at this business going ahead, what's the growth path here? And what can it do on a standalone basis?
Don Templin: Okay, let me turn that over to Tim, as he looks at this business.
Tim Griffith: Manav great question. I think, we think the opportunity set is very strong here. Conversion and synergy capture are certainly the near term priorities in terms of the locations on the West Coast and bringing them into the system. Introducing the Speedway model both from labor, from merchandise, food service and everything, that makes sense in the markets we're operating in. And once we're through that – and again we expect that we're going to be largely ramped up probably by mid next year on a lot of those synergies. We'll continue to watch for organic opportunities. There likely will continue to be some new to industry builds in some selected markets where we think we've got nice advantage, as well as be mindful of what may be available in the marketplace. This is still a relatively fragmented industry that we're bringing scale and size can really make a difference. So we think the opportunity set is tremendous here.
Don Templin: And one of the other things Manav if you look at Speedway we're just in the early innings of our capturing synergies in and around Speedway. And that just follows the re-identification and bringing the company-owned, company-operated stores under one brand. But as we ramp up here, we're on the cusp of really having a strong really acceleration in our synergy capture. And we're starting to see that the stores that we converted first were the stores up in Minnesota that we converted in the fourth quarter of last year. And it takes a while, but now we're seeing those sales increases mainly inside the store. We're bringing volume back out in the front court, but we're seeing those merchandise sales starting to come up outside. We're also seeing the same thing of the southwest stores that we've rebranded and brought into the Speedway family. So, not only growth, but the capital is already invested. And now you're going to see Tim your synergies to date have been how much?
Tim Griffith: Just for the quarter as Don talked about we are on track to be well over $100 million for this year.
Don Templin: And Manav so, to take my point further, we expect to grow synergies upwards of $300 million. And that's what the investment basically done. So, over the next 12 to, I'd say, 18 months, you're going to see a rapid growth in synergies with really no incremental investment, which will be a big help in organic growth for Speedway.
Manav Gupta: Yes thank you so much guys for taking my question and congrats.
Operator: Next we'll go to Benny Wong with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Benny Wong: Hi, good morning. I also want to say congrats to Gary and Greg. I've really enjoyed working with both of you. And I for one who has definitely benefited from the wisdom you've shared. My first question is on IMO 2020, which we're hearing a lot more about in the market and appreciate the helpful prepared remarks. Just wanted to dig a little deeper on what you guys are seeing in the market, particularly on the demand side, especially given a lot of other worries around a broader recession we've had for most of this year.
Gary Heminger: Yes, so let me ask Dave Whikehart – and Brian Partee. Brian runs all of our marketing, and Dave runs all of our really IMO-related logistics and planning phase. So let me have them jump in here and give you some details.
Dave Whikehart: Well, this is Dave Whikehart here. I mean, we’re certainly seeing in the last three, four months, we've seen ULSD inventories in the U.S. be drawn down probably 20 million barrels, maybe somewhere around five days of forward cover. And at the same time really firming of the diesel cracks and – which is likely to continue. Also in the Gulf Coast, we've seen our suite VGO prices increase above gasoline prices, which may open other opportunities. I mean the market is doing what it's doing. They're trying to efficiently supply this product. I think what's more interesting is maybe what Ray and Brian have to say about what we're doing about is it to capture those opportunities.
Brian Partee: Yes, thanks Dave. This is Brian Partee. Just a couple of comments. As we think about IML, I feel like the market is moving through kind of a three-step action reaction process around pricing. So the first step in that process, we saw pan out in the third quarter and it's still where we're at today is really on the fuel oil itself. As you think about the low software to high software spread moved out to about $250 a metric ton or about $38 a barrel. I mean looking ahead to the future's market, it's is very supportive to arrange very tight to that $250 metric ton range. So it feels like the bunkering market has found its footing there, which has had carry-on implications to the yield of sulfur fuel oil spread that Dave indicated, which is a core supporting coker economics, et cetera. On the inventory side, what's notable is we're not only low on this border ULSP, we're also low on fuel oil in the U.S. So both are at outside of the five-year ban. What's most interesting – and particularly in the Midwest, I'll kind of shift to diesel, we anticipated a pretty lackluster demand given a very wet spring we've had. The demand has been very resilient. Here in the third quarter as we progress to the fourth quarter, we have seen very resilient demand on the distillate side. And with lower inventory positions to support it through actually higher capture on the wholesale marketing side from a margin perspective. So it’s a strong indication of having low volume and margins the same time. And the third part of the action reaction is really on the heavy oil, high sulfur crude spreads. And those of course are widening out as well. So I think the market we're really at the operational threshold of progressing through IMO specification. I don't know that we're at peak IMO. I think we're just starting to understand that as a marketplace. But all indications are very favorable, and we feel like we're in a great spot to capture IMO. Ray talked a little bit about our operating capabilities to run heavy fuel oil. We've got the meaningful coastal refining exposure. We've got the retail bunkering business that we've continued to expand that gives us transparency to the full value chain. And lastly, we have a really strong commercial team that we've put together to manage that side of our business.
Benny Wong: Great. I appreciate those thoughts very helpful. My second question is a little more nuanced just around the timing of the Speedway spin. Just wondering if you can maybe talk about the sign post and hurdles we should keep an eye out for that process from now until the expected close at year end?
Gary Heminger: Sure, Benny. I don't know if I call them hurdles, but obviously we have a lot of work to do. We'll have to prepare the Form-10. One of the biggest things as a long-term supply agreement with – between Speedway and MPC. MPC has supplied over eight billion gallons of supply into the Speedway network. As we've talked often the integrated value of having Speedway gives that assured volume back to the Refining side of the business. So, we'll put together a supply agreement to be able to capture that over time. We will go through different financing and credit ratings, reviews, negotiate some other commercial agreements around trucking, so on and so forth. But I think the biggest part done other than the Form-10, I think that's the biggest part from a preparation standpoint.
Don Templin: Well that's an important commercial – that's a important commercial arrangement. But then that will ultimately feed we want this to be obviously a tax free spin. And so that will likely feed a private letter ruling process that does take our experiences, it does take some time. So you'll need the fuel supply arrangement as an integral part of that process around the PLR.
Benny Wong: Great. Thank you very much guys.
Don Templin: You’re welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Phil Gresh your line is open.
Phil Gresh: Yes, hi. Good morning. And Gary, I just wanted to echo everybody else's sentiments, congratulations on a great career. First question here just as we think about Speedway, versus Refining and the potential capital structure, I know maybe still some thought needs to be given here, but we and others, I think, have tried to run analyses about proper capital structures given the variability or lack thereof EBITDA at the different entities. It seems like you'd be able to maybe take Speedway to three times leverage. And I believe, with Refining, you might even have some asset sales in the next here. If you could comment on that? It seems like you could have pretty low leverage at the Refining company. So any color you might be able to share it would be helpful.
Gary Heminger: Sure.
Don Templin: Phil this is Don. I think we indicated in Gary's comments that we want to make sure that we position both companies spun Speedway and MPC, to be – that have optimal value following the separation. So we want to be able to position Speedway so that it can compete with the industry consolidators that are out there right now. So we want to make sure that they have capacity in their balance sheet to be able to do that. But we will also defend our investment grade credit profile at MPC. So, our expectation is there would be leverage on Speedway. We would pursue a capital structure that will allow them to have a high valuation in growth, that there would be a dividend from then Speedway up to MPC. And our expectations is that we would use that cash to either maintain or enhance our core liquidity and to pay down debt, so manage our leverage. So those are the things that we would expect around a transaction with the separation. But those are details, the market will continue to evolve over the next number of months, and those are details that we'll refine as we go through the process.
Phil Gresh: Okay.
Gary Heminger: Yes and to the balance of your question in and around asset divestitures or whether that's on the Refining, Midstream or Speedway side. In fact Tim just closed or was just in the process of closing some small divestitures inside the Speedway of stores that fit in a Marathon-branded model going down the road. We continue to look at some Speedway – excuse me, in some midstream assets. Mike covered those in his comments earlier. We continue to look at those, but it's obvious in and around the G&P segments right now. Some of the G&P assets are not garnering the, what I would consider to be market value, full market value for those at this point in time. We continue to look at our refining system. We're very pleased with the footprint of our refining system. But as we go down the road here, we will look at what makes the most long-term strategic sense for us as well.
Phil Gresh: Okay. Second question would just be as you think about in an ex-Speedway scenario how do you contemplate the right return of capital to shareholders? Is there a right formula to think about for the – I'm sorry, for the Refining business, the remain co? Obviously, I presume that would depend a lot on how things play out with the MPLX side? But just any thoughts you might share there would be interesting? Thanks.
Don Templin: Yes Phil, this is Dawn again. Yes, I think there's enough moving pieces that it would be hard to sort of articulate a particular strategy. What I can say is that we have a track record we think of being very good capital allocators. We've invested in our business to grow our business, but we've also been an industry leader around return of capital to shareholders. We think that's an important tenant around being an investor in MPC. And so we would expect that that commitment would continue into the future.
Phil Gresh: Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: And next we'll go to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Neil Mehta: Yes congrats Gary, Greg and Mike on all the announcements. And Gary in particular, we're going to miss your big predictions at the conference every year, always something we looked forward to. I guess the one question I had around Speedway is just sort of going back a couple of years ago we had talked about the potential dis-synergies associated with the spinning off Speedway. I think market conditions have certainly changed given the multiple expansion. But Gary, maybe you can just talk a little bit about what has changed in the calculus to make it accretive now?
Gary Heminger: Right well, Neil there are still synergies. Of course, when you supply eight billion gallons of product to a company on a ratable basis, and I would say, the dis-synergy still is on the working capital side. But what we stated is that where we see the market multiples today and the tremendous growth that we've had within Speedway over the last few years. Just today, it fully dwarfs the value, the compelling value, dwarfs that synergy value as compared to the way we reviewed it a couple of years ago. So yes, we still – we'll have some dis-synergies. But again, I say it becomes a very compelling equation today as we looked at this business and feel that, that's the right thing to do. And with the supply agreement I talked about earlier, we have done a lot of work around the supply agreement, and we're confident that we will have a supply agreement that has to be good for both parties. The supply agreement, I would anticipate it to look a mirror image, basically, of how we've been supplying Speedway over the last couple of years. And I think that in and of itself, pretty much will encapsulate the synergies that we've talked about.
Neil Mehta: That's great. And my final question is for Mike on the MPLX side, your 2020 CapEx, you did take it down pretty significantly, and I think it's a good show of capital efficiency. Can you just talk about some of the moving pieces around capital spend as we look into last year and into next year? 
Mike Hennigan: Yes sure Neil. One of the highest priorities we had when we combined the MLPs was to get a combined capital portfolio for the single MPLX that survived. So our first order of business, I'll say, in the first month that we did that, we looked at both portfolios of capital and stand-alone MLPs were about $2 billion on the MPLX side and about $600 million on the ANDX side. And as we looked on it, we thought we had a nice opportunity to high grade, take the best return as we prioritize ROIC as a top priority. So that was one thing that was driving us. The second thing that was driving us is over the last couple of years we've been strategically trying to move the portfolio much more towards L&S and less towards the G&P business. So a lot of the change that you're seeing there from about $2.8 billion of capital down to about $2 billion of capital was related to that strategy. I remind people that in 2018 we spend about 85% of our capital in the G&P business. And by 2020 we'll be targeting for about 75% in the L&S business as opposed to the G&P business. So bringing the capital expenditure from that $2.6 billion back down to $2.0 billion, I think, is a good first step. We're going to continue to look at how we can high-grade and put ourselves in a position where we are generating more free cash flow going forward.
Neil Mehta: Great, guys. Congrats again.
Operator: I'll now turn the meeting back over to Kristina Kazarian. Thank you.
Kristina Kazarian: Thank you for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions, or would you like clarification on topics discussed this morning, we'll be available to take your call. And with that, thank you, operator.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-08-01 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MPC's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. My name is Amber, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.
Kristina Kazarian: Sounds, great. Welcome to Marathon Petroleum second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investors tab. On the call today are, Gary Heminger, Chairman and CEO; Greg Goff, Executive Vice Chairman; Don Templin, CFO; Mike Hennigan, President of MPLX; as well as other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. Now I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for some opening remarks and highlights on slide 3.
Gary Heminger: Thanks, Kristina, and good morning and thank you for joining our call. Earlier today, we reported adjusted net income of $1.1 billion or $1.73 per diluted share. This quarter, we executed across all aspects of our integrated business and delivered solid results, generating $2.8 billion of cash from operations. Our impressive cash generation allowed us to return roughly $850 million to our shareholders this quarter, while also funding many key strategic investments, which we expect will continue to enhance our long-term earnings profile. Our team's execution this quarter led to strong synergy capture. Combined with our first-quarter results, we have realized $403 million of synergies year-to-date. Our progress, gives us great confidence in achieving our target of up to $600 million of annual gross run-rate synergies by year end 2019 and $1.4 billion by the end of 2021. Don will provide a detailed update around synergy capture later on the call. Our retail business had an exceptional quarter and demonstrated its ability to capture value. Strong results this quarter reflect the tremendous focus by our team and management of the day-to-day business in conjunction with the integration of the new stores. We have converted over 400 stores since the combination, putting us well on track to achieve our goal of 700 stores by the end of this year. In Midstream, we simplified our structure into one public company to high-grade commercial opportunities and progressed an impressive slate of high return projects that are expected to enhance integration across our system. Mike will speak to our execution around new projects, as well as provide an update on our overall midstream strategy shortly.
Mike Hennigan: Thanks, Gary. Turning to slide 4. We are pleased to have successfully combined MPLX and Andeavor Logistics into a single entity, creating a leading large-scale diversified midstream company anchored by fee-based cash flows. As is often overlooked, our business mix has evolved to a more stable, long-dated cash flow profile. Logistics and storage makes up approximately 60% of the cash flows for MPLX and our incremental capital programs, predominantly focused on building out our integrated crude oil and natural gas logistics systems, particularly in the Permian. In addition, we continue to move our capital investments toward the L&S side of the business. At MPLX in 2018, 85% of our capital was directed to the G&P business, in 2019 we move that ratio to about 50/50 and our expectation in 2020 is to spend the majority of our capital in the L&S business. When we think about building out our logistics systems, one of our core objective is to invest in projects that enhance MPC's integrated value. During the quarter, three examples of projects that advance this integrated strategy are Whistler, Capline and Wink-to-Webster pipelines. On Whistler, MPLX announced a final investment decision on this natural gas pipeline into securing sufficient, firm transportation agreements with shippers. This joint venture project is being designed to transport approximately 2 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas from the Permian Basin to the Agua Dulce area, in South Texas. We expect the Whistler system to eventually provide low-cost natural gas to our Galveston Bay refinery. Natural gas is a key input at our refineries and this project creates a compelling industry solution, as well as lowering the overall cost of our system where we are currently utilizing third-party infrastructure.
Don Templin: Thanks Mike. Slide 5 provides a summary of our second quarter financial highlights. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes turnaround cost was $3.2 billion for the quarter. Operating cash flow before working capital was approximately $2.8 billion. We returned $852 million to shareholders through $352 million of dividends and $500 million of share repurchases. We ended the quarter with $660 million shares outstanding. And for the year, we returned over $2 billion to shareholders.
Kristina Kazarian: Thanks, Don. As we open the call for your questions. As a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, if time permits we will re-prompt for additional questions. With that, we will now open the call to questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from Doug Terreson of Evercore. Your line is open.
Doug Terreson: Good morning, everybody and congratulations on solid results.
Gary Heminger: Thank you, Doug.
Doug Terreson: Yeah. First, my first question is execution and synergy capture seem to be improving especially in Refining and Speedway and returns on capital appear to be headed back to the historical trend. And this is all good news. And on this point, my question regards the opportunity set going forward. And specifically, while I realize we're only two quarters into the program, how would you characterize integration opportunities that you've seen so far. Do you sense that they're going to become stronger over time? And if so, in what areas?
Mike Hennigan: Yeah, Doug. I’ll let Don talk about specific synergies, Doug. But, let me just talk overall about the synergy -- excuse me, about integration. We're very pleased where we stand on integration to date, and specifically when you look through the segments on refining just listening to Don's presentation here of the turnaround activity we had at Los Angeles and at Martinez, we have some work coming up in St Paul. But what we're seeing across the refining complex is very strong integration. We're developing our team. We've transferred of people from Marathon into some of the legacy Andeavor plants and vice versa. So we see that integration and the communication between the refining coming along very strong. One of the things that we have talked about in the prior quarter, and I've talked to many investors about this, we saw this opportunity with the cat cracker at LA that we could bring in a new catalyst, a new technology and it really improve the output in yield of that plant. Don, can go into a more detail down the road here. But, that is really coming to fruition and as we're capturing -- and this was a synergy that we had not identified prior to the transaction. So I think it's just illustrates, Doug, how well, things are coming along on the integration. We just presented to our Board yesterday, a very big project. We have now defined how we're going to go forward with our SAP system at the end of the day, but how we're going to integrate all of the accounting and financial data, a big project, but we've completed. We've identified that, and we're now moving forward to be able to get that implemented here over the next 18 months to two years and will bring it on in different cycles. I mentioned retail, again, a very strong story at retail, and to have 400 stores complete to date and very much on target to hit the 700 by the end of the year. We're starting to see the improvement in the stores in the Southwest that we have already converted. We're seeing improvement in the stores up at Minnesota Wisconsin that we’ve converted. So those things are that that integration, but more so, being able to bring in one common platform that manages the stores is a big help in managing your operating costs. And then lastly on the Midstream side, it was really a big milestone to close the transaction between ANDX. Mike Hennigan has already outlined the team that they have in place a very strong team. And I congratulate Don Sorensen who is the President of ANDX, who really did an outstanding job. I would like to have kept Mike with the team. But he wanted to move on to do some other things. But they did a great job as we proceeded in being able to put this transaction together. So let me ask Don to go into some of the synergies in more detail.
Doug Terreson: Okay.
Don Templin: Yeah, Doug, as I said, we were really pleased with the performance of the team around synergies to 270 million this quarter. We did highlight a couple of one-time synergies. And when I think about one-time synergies, the way we've defined that is synergies that we're capturing in 2019, but are unlikely to continue into 2020 or beyond. And so, that $30 million or so is primarily around optimizing Tier 3 gasoline credits, and so that won't continue past this year. On the other -- in the refining sector, we did highlight turnaround cost savings during the quarter of about $60 million, obviously, that won't continue every quarter, but we're going to have turnarounds over the next three years, and we're very confident that our management of those turnarounds will allow us to continue to be able to deliver them on time and on budget. So, if I think about the $270 million for the quarter, I take out the one-time, the $30 million that gets needs. And then I think about sort of the 60 million that doesn't recur every quarter, that's a $180 million for the third quarter, $60 million a month, if you will. If I annualize that $60 million a month, that's why we get really excited about and have conviction around our view that we will get to the synergy target that we communicated at our earnings call.
Doug Terreson: Sure, looks like it, Don.
Don Templin: At our Investor Day.
Doug Terreson: Yeah. Okay. And then also Marathon Petroleum is clearly an asset-rich company, especially post the Andeavor transaction, which suggests that divestitures could expedite streamlining and optimization of the portfolio, and this could go on for years to come as well. So, my question is, while Gary you talked about this in your comments, could you expand on how you think about this opportunity. Are there areas that are likely to become non-strategic that might not have been before? And how significant could proceeds from divestitures be if you chose to pull that lever in coming years.
Gary Heminger: Sure Doug. And we announced you need to be careful when you announce asset divestitures until you have a fully baked, I would say, but this has been part of our strategy ever since we are though even before we close the transaction with Andeavor to be able to look at assets as you said, that may be non-strategic and we're looking at across the entire portfolio. It's not just one segment versus another. We are looking at across the portfolio, we have identified some assets across the portfolio. And this isn’t just a one year or a short-term thing that we're going to do, this was part of our plan all along. So, we will provide more data to the investors as we go forward. We've already proceeded with a couple of our packages on some assets, it's private at this time, but we will continue on, but this is not a short-term thing, Doug, and your question certainly pieced it up correctly. We are an asset-rich company. We look at some assets that probably have more value at somebody else's portfolio than ours and I proceed accordingly.
Doug Terreson: Okay. Thanks a lot guys.
Gary Heminger: All right Doug.
Operator: Our next question comes from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Manav Gupta: First Garry, Don, Mike in the rest of the team, thanks a lot for tons of more disclosures in reporting format. They're really helpful to the investment community, adjusted EBITDA, Slide 9 on distribution cost exactly what we needed for modeling MPC better. So, thank you for that.
Gary Heminger: You're welcome.
Manav Gupta: I have two quick questions are Gary due to the lack of heavies specifically on the Gulf Coast, what we're seeing is a trend toward running more light sweet crude. But what that is also doing is creating lot more NAFTA in NGLs, which in turn is hitting the capital rate. Your results showed relative installation from the trend, but we are seeing it in the industry. I'm trying to understand your view on this if the industry continues to run more and more light crude, will the capture to take a hit because of it?
Gary Heminger: Sure Manav and thank you for your comments on the additional disclosure information that we provided. We're going to ask Ray to -- Ray Brooks runs refining to take this question as he optimizes our all our crude slate. Ray?
Ray Brooks: Sure, Gary. Manav, we fill our crude slate to optimize our process units and when we talk about light crude, this really pulls of reformers into play and so we get ranges on our abilities to run light and heavy crude and this is all based on what the capacity of our reformers as in that regard. Now, having said that, Marathon is a net buyer across the 16 plants up NAFTA and another light component natural gasoline. The reason for this as we have really two octane generating machines across our system in Garyville and our Robinson refinery because we have multiple high-quality reformers at those facilities. So, I don't look at light crude as an obstacle. I look at it as an opportunity for us.
Manav Gupta: That's very good to hear. And one quick further question, couple of days ago. A European refinery has indicated that reduced demand for high sulfur fuel oil due to IMO won't necessarily weigh on the prices of high sulfur crudes. In MPC's view, is it possible that high sulfur fuel oil price crushers and it has no impact on Maya and WCS pricing?
Ray Brooks: I'm going to start off answering that question too and then I'm going to allow Rick Hessling to add on that. In refining, when we evaluate our crudebales , we do that based on the offered price and the value of the crude in our processes. So, the crude has a lot of sour bottoms, which is HSFO that absolutely comes into our valuation and how we -- what we're willing to pay for the crude. So, Rick, do you want to elaborate on a little bit more on the crude side?
Rick Hessling: Sure. Hi, Manav I would say it will have an impact on crude prices, especially like Maya and WCS. When you look at the world and even though I would say that it's somewhat offset by the lack of Iranian and Venezuelan barrels and OPEC barrels coming in, I will tell you that high sulfur fuel oil is not directly -- if it's not directly priced into the Maya formula, it has to be accounted for indirectly when we look at the crude makeup of Maya. So, I think you will see a shift in prices there. And I would also say the same is true for WCS. We'll value that crude based on its dispositions and its crude qualities and I think you will see that differential move as well, Manav, because it has to be accounted for.
Manav Gupta: Thanks, guys and congrats on a great quarter.
Gary Heminger: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Benny Wong with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Benny Wong: Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. My first one is really on the West Coast, which we recently saw had opportunity to host a tour and visit refineries there. It was impressive to see the level integration and talent you guys have on the ground. I really want to ask about your outlook of the margin environment for rest of the year, which has been pretty soft recently. I was also hoping you'd be able to talk about your key execution focuses on the West Coast and I think, you kind of initially touched on the cracker opportunity in that way earlier.
Mike Hennigan: Right. Let me have Ray take that, Benny. Let me start off so both but talk about. If you look at the West Coast crack spreads and how the market has fluctuated, there had been some downtime in some refineries early in the second quarter, which are resolved in a lot of imports coming in that ended up having too much inventory in the West Coast, we see that being a run down and the inventory situation coming back more into balance now. So, we think that was a temporary lull in the early part of the second quarter. But specifically, your question, Ray will talk about some of the things that we're doing.
Ray Brooks: Okay. Benny it was, it was really great to spend some time with you and some of our other investors showing -- showcasing some of our Los Angeles assets. Gary did a good job at that. Talking about the margin environment, I want to focus on the refinery. Specifically, we mentioned several times now about the catalyst opportunity on the cat cracker. But we want to make sure we optimize the asset down in California, whether it's Los Angeles or Martinez. The early indications from the cat starting up in Los Angeles look very promising versus what we were expecting. As far as areas of execution, there's two words I want to focus on reliability and cost. From a cost standpoint, we've done a lot of work in the first nine months at both Los Angeles and Martinez doing some planned maintenance work. We're very proud of our teams on how we were able to pull that ahead of schedule and under budget. Both which have cost impacts. Now the focus is on reliability, we've got that kind of a clear plan with low maintenance ahead for California and we want to focus on delivering reliable performance about those assets, so reliability and cost is what we're focused on.
Benny Wong: Great. That's great detail guys. My follow-up is really on the demand side, we've seen gasoline consumption kind of has those slow start beginning to summer rebound strongly and then at recently became soft again. Just wondering, if you can provide some thoughts on what you're seeing and what you expect given your unique perspective from refinery down to the retail pump. And if you can add any thoughts on the distillate side as well, which has been pretty weak lately as well, that'd be great.
Gary Heminger: Sure, Benny. Let's take gasoline first and you said it right, at the beginning of the summer and you recall that the entire Mid-Con was having a very, very wet early, late spring early part of the summer. It's only been kind of a last month that things are finally drive up and business getting back to normal. So, we lost a lot of the kind of front end, if you will, discretionary driving that families do across the Mid-Con early in the vacation season. But you're right, we have seen that it will be stronger until tropical storm Berry came about and dumped off a lot of weather up the Mid-Con and a little bit into the southeast. Today, we're seeing improvement in gasoline demand and as I said earlier in my comments, we think gasoline demand is going to be flat for the balance of the year. The distillate was pretty much the same story. If you look from Iowa, all the way through Ohio, on average, probably only 50% of the agricultural demand came about as because of the farmers just could not get in the fields and again about 50% of the planting, and then you have cultivating and then eventually harvesting is going to, I think continue to put some pressure, but you look at overall distillate inventories they're at the lower end. If you look at distillate inventories by exports at the lower end of the five-year average, which we believe, continues to be a positive point for our business going forward. And I think as we went to -- indicated that we're starting to see some early contributors to IMO with the incremental demand that we're expecting to see, we still think that distillate in the second half of the year is going to be strong.
Benny Wong: That's great thoughts guys. Thank you very much.
Operator: And next we'll go to Roger Reed with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Roger Reed: Yeah. Thank you and good morning. And well, not one of my questions. I do want to say, thanks for the detail on the synergies and congratulations on the progress so far. I'd like to kind of ask you though about Tier 3. Obviously, we've heard some comments from other companies about issues with naphtha and given its low octane component, difficult to get rid of in this market. So I'm just kind of curious, how you believe you set up with Tier 3 if to the extent that you can offer it maybe how that compares to the industry and then what you might be able to do in 2020 and beyond in terms of taking advantage of your own system to make more octane or acquire octane cost-effectively.
Greg Goff: Hey, Roger, this is Greg. And I'll talk about that. First, we're very well positioned with regards to Tier 3 and I am going to talk on 2019 standpoint when we came together with Endeavor, we had the flexibility from a sulfur credit standpoint to optimize that across our 16 plant system and really for this year has allowed us to run a couple of refineries more aggressively with regards to octane and sulfur standpoint. Additionally, we have two capital projects, one at Mandan, one at Galveston Bay that will be completing in the next couple of months that give us the capability going forward to meet to the Tier 3 demand for 2020. Now, your question on octane in the previous question, I mentioned that we have a lot of octane generation capacity. So we will continue to use that. We feel good with our plan for Tier 3 and don't see an octane imbalance at this point.
Roger Reed: Okay, great, thanks. And then changing gears a little bit, crude differentials all the issues, globally we could point on the heavy side and then what we've had out of Alberta as well. Just wondering what your outlook for really mostly the heavy crude, but if there is any sort of additional thoughts to add on the WTI side of it as well. Just the outlook for the back half of 2019 and I guess a little bit tie into -- I believe it was Manav's question about the impacts of IMO in terms of heavy versus light or sweet versus sour, as we go into the beginning of 2020.
Rick Hessling: Hi, Roger, this is Rick Hessling I guess I'll start with heavy crudes on the Canadian side as a reference, we ran approximately 600,000 barrels a day combined heavy and light Canadian crude and that's somewhat consistent with what we've planned in the past. When you look at us versus our competitors, I think you'll see that we have incredible pipeline capabilities and we're not married to any one crude. And so we didn't really have a significant shift change. I would tell you looking forward from a Canadian perspective, we're bullish here recently within the last week, the mandate again was reduced another 25 a day. You have the potential assignment of the rail contracts, which we believe may be married up with the deals with producers that could allow them the flexibility to produce more crude. And then if you look at the increase in rail movements month over month and the dropping of the Canadian inventories all this is a positive sign certainly, for differentials reaching that $20 a barrel mark on the heavy side. On the WTI side, what I would tell you is, you're seeing a little bit of dislocation between WTI and WTI light. We're a buyer of the light, that's a discounted crude that we're running at Galveston Bay and in then throughout our PADD II system. So we continue to see that dislocation happen. Certainly, I think it's been well-publicized at the end of this year, you're going to see a lot of volatility as increased pipes come online and the dock capacity struggles to keep up. So we'll be watching that volatility as well.
Roger Reed: Thanks. Maybe just one little add on to that, in terms of moving crude out of the U.S., is there any update on your project? I guess it's – I can't remember the exact little place and Louisiana, but down the Peninsula there, any timing updates there?
Mike Hennigan: Hey, Roger is Mike Hennigan. Yeah. So we continue to progress, LOOP is the name you were looking for. It's Louisiana Offshore Oil Port and we're trying to get more information into the market that explains LOOPs capabilities. It is the only VLCC capable port in the U.S. today. It has terrific capabilities. We've talked about the capability to load several VLCCs within a week. So we anticipate more and more opportunity there going forward and the LOOP people are trying to get the message out as to what our capabilities are. 
Roger Reed: Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next call comes from Paul Cheng of Scotia Howard Weil. Your line is open.
Paul Cheng: Hey guys, good morning.
Mike Hennigan : Hey, Paul, welcome back. 
Paul Cheng: Thank you. Two question, one relates the IMO the one related to the Philadelphia energy solution shutdown in your impact. On the IMO 1, Gary and Ray, wondering if you can talk about how easy or that how much is your capability to run the high sulfur fuel oil as a feed directly into your coker and what is the pricing need to be in order to make that economic? And also if you can talk about your post Tier 2 brand into the VLSFO as you would you intend to use primarily to VGO or are you trying to attempt directly branding the high sulfur fuel oil? And then along on that you probably have seen the pattern from Exxon and Shell and just curious is that when your legal team that how they look at and how easy or difficult just for the industry to be able to brand their compliance fee while you are finishing those pendants?
Mike Hennigan: Okay. Sure, sure Paul, I'm going to turn this over to Ray. But I am glad to see you haven't changed, you were able to get six questions in your first question. 
Paul Cheng: It's just three.
Mike Hennigan: I'll turn to Ray to answer.
Raymond Brooks: Okay. Paul, I'm going to start off with the patent portion of your question, we are continually monitoring the existing patents in the space and we are applying the appropriate and intellectual property analysis and strategies to protect our interest and facilities where we anticipate selling low-sulfur fuel oil products. Now having said that, what I want to emphasize is that this is a small part of our IMO strategy and you really hit on it with the first part of your question where you asked about high sulfur fuel oil into our Coker. It's -- for us IMO strategy, our base plan is resid destruction and asphalt sales and we've invested a lot of money in both of those systems and we look to take advantage of that. As far as high sulfur fuel oil, though we had put infrastructure in several of our refineries to not just process, our own internal material at that refinery, but some of the other material from our refineries and then third party material and to give you an example, we put receiving logistics infrastructure and a Garyville so that we can take Catlettsburg, Rougeunit pitch down and process and the Garyville Coker, similarly with our California refineries. We want to have the capability and will have the capability to process material from Anacortes and from Kenai refinery. So feel real good about that our goal is not to have to sell on a steady state basis, high sulfur fuel oil components. Now there's been a lot of discussion about how the low-sulfur fuel oil will play out, whether it will be low-sulfur vacuum gas oil blending or ULSD end of the pool. A lot of opinions out there certainly from the sulfur blending standpoint if we get -- we'll get more bang for our buck with ULSD, because it's a much lower sulfur. Having said that, we will do what the market tells us to do. We have the capability to make a lot of ULSD, we also have the capability to pivot and pull LVGO, sweet LVGO out of our cat crackers at the market says that and apply that supply that to the market.
Paul Cheng: Thank you. And that the second one Gary for Philadelphia Energy Solution bandwidth see and how that may impact how you run or plan for your Midwest operation?
Raymond Brooks: Sure. Well, let me turn this over to Dave. We just had a big discussion internally yesterday about this is, as we look at our, we have many different supply wheels and as we look at the European ORB versus the Gulf Coast ORB and how that is really changing some of the flow of the barrel. So I'll turn this over to Dave Whikecart, he can get into more detail.
Dave Whikehart: Yeah. This is Dave Whikehart. It appears that the ORB has been opened from Europe and we've seen the import volumes on gasoline come into the East Coast and July might actually turn out to be a high as import volume numbers probably for the last couple of years. So that seems to be the way that the markets are responding at this time. Interestingly, what we've seen in terms of impacts to our supplier situation is we've seen demands on the Gulf Coast actually increase. We think it's because of these barrels have been directed to the East Coast and that's really freed up some opportunities for us to use our system to export more out of the Gulf Coast.
Paul Cheng: Dave, do you have more capability or capacity in the Colonial pipeline to do it, and does it in any share will form impacting the pending there?
Dave Whikehart: Yeah. On colonial just a comment there, initially you saw the line space increase in value. I think that with the imports coming in, it's attempt that down a bit, but you would think that the shorter position in the Northeast would pull up the line space value and we would benefit from that given our position there. And just a general response Gary concerning our daily activities of trying to assess the opportunities to connect our refineries to markets, looking for those infrastructure investments that will enhance the return back to the refineries and put those supply options in position and that's an everyday activity for us and this opportunity is no different.
Paul Cheng: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Neil Mehta, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Neil Mehta: Thank you, everyone, and appreciate the incremental disclosure it goes a long way and congrats on a good quarter here. The first question I had was just on Speedway is really good quarter at Speedway and so I guess the big picture strategic question is, how is the operational integration going with the West Coast retail assets that you picked up and getting them to same EBITDA per store level as your East Coast footprint. And then the more tactical question around Speedway is should we expect a strong financial performance that you saw in Q2 to carry on here in Q3. Given what we've seen with crude prices?
Tim Griffith: Thanks, Neil, its Tim. On the integration side, things are going along nicely. You've heard about the progress on the conversions and we will probably in fourth quarter really get out on the West Coast for the conversion. The EBITDA per store per month metric is -- we'll certainly watch it, for a lot of the locations in the West Coast, they are a little bit different footprints than what we have had in Midwest. So there could be some variance to what we've seen in the Midwest as we go, but will be a big focus. I think a lot of those locations were really built and designed for fuel volumes, less so for merchandise and for store footprints. But we'll certainly evaluate those opportunities, and see where they exist and where we may want to make investments to expand that as we go forward. In terms of performance, quarter-to-quarter, obviously, second quarter benefited from fuel margins, we saw in late in the second quarter, a little bit of softness in crude prices and as you know, the retail prices are a little bit sticky and you saw a little bit of capture in that environment. It will really be a function of what that price environment and commodity prices look like into third, certainly from an operating and from a merchandising perspective, we'd expect performance as good or better, obviously, the synergy capture we reported for the quarter over 30 million and that's going to continue to ramp. I mean, a lot of the conversions correctly enable that synergy capture. So I think we'd expect performance to be as good or better on that front. Fuel margins, we'll see what the commodity price environment affords and what we're able to capture over the course of the quarter.
Dave Whikehart: Neil as you remember, the way we put the synergy capture together, Retail is really going to lag. Some of the other segments just because the time it takes us to get the stores converted and re-merchandised. But again, we're -- as Don illustrated, we're ahead of our plan within Speedway, but we expect it to have a much stronger cadence here starting in the fourth quarter.
Neil Mehta: I appreciate it. Look, the follow-up question is as it relates to the Northeast part of the mark, the legacy MarkWest assets and your MPLX business, there are a lot of questions that we're getting about the health of your customers out there and the challenges around NGL prices. So can you help again frame the commodity risk that we're thinking about as we think about this midstream business and how we should get comfortable around some of those risks that might exist out there?
Mike Hennigan: Hey Neil, this is Mike. Yeah. First off, we’re keenly aware of all the rhetoric around the Northeast Appalachia situation. What I think you're seeing from the producers, however, is a response that is positive and moving toward staying within cash flows to make sure that they have a strong financial position. A couple of our largest customers have come out and released our earnings and they're showing that they are directionally moving toward that mode. I mean, what that means for us, however, is a little slower volume up there, but that kind of fits what we're trying to accomplish. One of our goals is to diversify our asset base, very much like our Northeast position, but we're trying to diversify, a little bit more into the Permian and some other assets on the O&M side of the business, the long-haul pipelines that we've talked about previously. So to the extent that the Northeast producers live within cash flow, blow down capital a little bit, which is a little slower growth that's been there in the past that kind of fits what we're trying to accomplish. So that we can redeploy capital in another area and still enjoy strong free cash flow generation out of the Northeast. We've been putting a lot of capital to work up in that area and the fact that if it slows a little bit will put us in a free cash flow generation position. So harvesting cash out of the Northeast and deploying it in other areas, it's fitting the strategy that we want to accomplish.
Neil Mehta: Thanks everyone.
Dave Whikehart: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Phil Gresh JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Phil Gresh: Yes, hi, good morning. The first question, just following up on some of the discussion around the streamlining asset sale opportunities, the opportunities to trim capital spending, how do you think about Gary, the right long-term level of financial leverage on the balance sheet, obviously, a lot of your debt is at the MLP level, but talking -- going back to the Analyst Day, thinking about the $2.5 billion of buybacks that you have committed to and clearly executing on year-to-date, do you think that there should be some balance sheet priority at all for any potential future capital allocation? Thanks.
Gary Heminger: Sure. I will ask Don to cover that. But one of the things, Phil on -- when you look, as Don mentioned in his comments today. We think the appropriate way to look at the balance sheet leverage for both MPC and MPLX is to bring the distributions, take account of those distributions back into to MPC. Don remarked on that in his comments. And let me ask Don to go into more detail here on the leverage.
Don Templin: Yeah, so Phil, I think both on the MLP side, in that the corporate level, we're going to defend our investment-grade credit profile and when we think about defending our investment-grade credit profile. What we really look at is the risk around the cash flows and the volatility of those cash flows and the consistency that you have. So as we think about that informs our decision about how much leverage we want to have as we think about the Midstream to date, sort of that four times debt to EBITDA leverage has been one that we think is appropriate and continues to support an investment-grade credit profile and if we take a view that the risk has changes in the future. I think that will inform our view about how much leverage we want at the MLP. And the same thing as we think about what's going on at a corporate level, and I think it's appropriate to really look at MPC and think about sort of the $9 billion of debt. It's responsible for that it's not responsible for the debt of the MLPs and when I think about that $9 billion of debt and our cash flow generation capability, if you think – if you take the distributions that we get from the MLP back, it's sort of a 1.1 times kind of leverage metric, we feel very comfortable with that, especially, given the really strong performance of Speedway more than $600 million of EBITDA in the quarter. So the cash flow profile, the risk that we think is attendant to that part of the business is what's going to really influence where our leverage goes and how we manage it.
Phil Gresh: Okay.
Dave Whikecart: And Phil, a couple more comments I stated in my remarks earlier that as we look at optimizing assets, Mike Hennigan has talked about several key projects of high-grade his portfolio, we have the opportunity to use some of the proceeds to invest in those high-return projects. We certainly can reduce some debt, if that makes sense in either side of the business. So we have many options and many triggers that we can pull as we look at our capital plan going forward.
Phil Gresh: Okay. I appreciate that. My final question, Gary, I think the – a lot of the questions around the macro environment has been demand-related, there has been some cautious commentary from one of your European peers talking more kind of supply related, more refineries coming back from turnaround in the second half to perhaps some capacity additions, the offset here. Obviously, we had the situation with  just curious how you think about the supply side, the dynamics and then if I could just quickly layer in that the capture rate that you had in the second quarter, I guess this is for Don the 82% number and the normalized 90% that you've talked about with the lower level of turnarounds for yourself in the second half, is there any reason to think you shouldn't be able to kind of get back to that normalized run rate? Thank you.
Dave Whikecart: Right. And just an outlook on the market, you know the West Coast markets the day and so far, here are – well, I really should talk about the latter part of July, have been our recovering is probably the proper word stated earlier, there were some imports on the West Coast that kind of put some pressure on margins, that seems to be cleaning up and margins are improving on the West Coast in the Mid-Con the same thing there are a lot of barrels that moved into the Mid-Con due to some turnarounds as the Mid-Con margins have improved here recently. The area that has been really lagging this year has been the Gulf Coast and across the entire industry, and we're in that period of time that you're going to probably see some dislocations, as storms go through. And you have tropical depression and so on so forth. So, I think third quarter generally, gets it's stronger in the Gulf Coast. And as Dave just mentioned, with our PES closure, how some of the supply wheel is changing, is going to take some more barrels from the Gulf Coast, capture rate into the Northeast as well as some more export volume that's going to go wild. So, I would say, all in all, from a macro standpoint. I see margins being slightly positive, where they were in July. And Don is going to cover your next question.
Don Templin: Yeah, Phil, with respect to capture rate, you're right to point out that in the second quarter, there was turnaround. And that obviously impact of that. The other thing that just to remind you is that, the correlation between gas prices, gasoline prices and some of the other products that we sell. So, you know the propanes and the specialties and everything else that also impacts capture rate. So, assuming we get back to sort of a normal correlation between those, then we would expect that our capture rate will be very consistent with our historical rates. If gasoline, cracks run-up, that's good for our business, and if the capture -- if the other commodities don't keep pace with that, I'm not bothered by that, because the gasoline cracks have been running up. So, capture is important, but we are looking to try to maximize the value from all of the products that we sell. And to the extent that we see something that impacts that we will try to highlight it to you and communicated to you in advance.
Phil Gresh: Okay, thanks.
Kristina Kazarian: Great, well, we passed a little bit past the operator, hour mark, So, Operator. All right, well, thank you for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation, should you have any additional questions or would you like clarification on topics discussed this morning, we will be able to take your calls. Thank you for joining us today.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-08 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MPC First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. My name is Sheila, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.
Kristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corp.'s First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, Chairman and CEO; Greg Goff, Executive Vice Chairman; Tim Griffith, CFO; Don Templin, President of Refining, Marketing and Supply; Mike Hennigan, President of MPLX; as well as other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. Slide 2 also contains additional information related to the proposed MPLX transaction. Investors and security holders are encouraged to read the consent statement and registration statement to be filed with the SEC as well as other relevant documents filed with the SEC. Now I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for some opening remarks and highlights on Slide 3.
Gary Heminger: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, and welcome for -- and thank you for joining our call. Our integrated business generated approximately $1.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA during the first quarter, as the stability of our Midstream and Retail segments helped to offset challenging refining market conditions. The diversification of our business model and flexibility of our refining system enabled us to generate through-cycle cash flow. And despite this being a weaker quarter, we generated nearly $1.2 billion of operating cash flow before working capital. In the quarter, we returned over $1.2 billion of capital to MPC shareholders, including $885 million in share repurchases. Over the long term, we remain committed to returning at least 50% of discretionary free cash flow to investors. Beginning of the year was difficult for the entire U.S. refining industry. Inventory levels were high as the industry came off a strong fourth quarter and a seasonal lack of demand as well as several weather disruptions led to challenging gasoline margins. At the same time, medium and heavy sour crude differentials compressed substantially, given geopolitical and policy changes. As the quarter progressed, though, [indiscernible] supply reductions helped rebalance the market, and gasoline and distillate inventories are now below their 5-year averages. For April, our blended crack spread of $18.80 was more than double the first quarter average. With the sweet/sour crude spreads inside $3 per barrel, we have moved towards max sweet mode, but also continue to see the incentives to keep our coverage full. With our Midstream business, we continue to see a tremendous opportunity set. Earlier this morning, MPLX announced it had entered into a definite merger agreement to acquire ANDX. Details on the transaction were provided this morning, and we encourage you to read the deal announcement press release for more information. Looking forward, the U.S. has become the largest producer of crude oil in the world, and natural gas and NGL volumes continue to grow as well. With this increased production, we believe that our midstream business is well positioned to participate in the infrastructure build-out opportunities. Mike Hennigan will speak to some of the key project updates later in the call. On the Retail side, the strong same-store merchandise sales and legacy Speedway markets that we have seen over the last 9 months continued into April. We expect this trend to continue as we move into the prime driving season. As we look to the remainder of 2019, our positive outlook is also supported by solid economic growth and expected contributions from the 700 store conversions. And in fact, we finished our 300th conversion yesterday. Lastly, we see opportunities to drive the value creation using our technology platform. And inside the store, we continue to pursue opportunities to enhance customer interaction and drive sales. We expect positive dynamics across all 3 of our business segments to support growing cash flows throughout the remainder of 2019. One of our core objectives is to grow profitably and create competitive advantages through strategic and disciplined investments. On that front, we also continuously assess our project portfolio to ensure our investments would generate strong project returns. Based on our internal forecasts, the Garyville Coker 3 project no longer comfortably exceeds the 20% hurdle rate we typically use for our refining projects. As such, we have decided to stop the Garyville Coker 3 project after completing definition engineering and remove it from our capital spending plans. The change in the project return is primarily driven by our long-term outlook for heavy crude differentials. Geopolitical events have caused lower production of heavy crude, including lower Venezuelan production, slower Canadian pipeline development and our Iranian sanctions. In addition, more light crude is being produced as a result of continued U.S. shale growth. Having said this, our Garyville coker match project remains on schedule to complete the first phase in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the second phase in the first quarter of 2020 to take advantage of the new IMO bunker fuel requirements. Recall this project expands our capacity at the 2 existing cokers by about 14% by replacing the 4 existing 30-foot diameter drums with 32-foot diameter drums. The LARIC project at our Los Angeles refinery remains on track to be completed in early 2020 and will increase our ability to produce higher value distillates. We're also pleased to announce that for the second year in a row, Marathon was awarded the EPA ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year. This is an impressive accomplishment and tangible evidence of our commitment to driving energy efficiency through everything we do. As we look forward to the remainder of 2019, we expect improving industry dynamics of our past investments to support our growing cash flow outlook. And our team remains focused on operational excellence, achieving synergies and creating long-term shareholder value. Now let me turn the call over to Greg who will provide some comments on our integration process, strategy development and commercial opportunities.
Gregory Goff: Thank you, Gary. We have made notable progress integrating the 2 companies over the past 7 months. Multiple senior executives and other key leaders have moved to our Findlay headquarters. In April, we launched a complete redesign of our corporate website. Much of the back-office work that prompted this relaunch was driven by our aligned direction work. The focus of this work was on cultural integration and developing the framework for the company's vision, strategy and core values. Additionally, we have launched an initiative to begin the process of integrating our technology platforms. This initiative will allow -- enable us to improve efficiencies and deploy a world-class ERP system. Related to our commercial and competitive strategy, we are also very pleased with the continued success we have had growing our integrated business into new key markets. In Western Mexico, we are currently supplying 192 sites, of which 142 are ARCO-branded. We now have the ARCO brand in 5 states that include Baja, California; Sonora; Sinaloa; Baja California Sur; and Chihuahua. Recently, we held grand opening activities at our first ARCO site in Ciudad Juárez. The ARCO-branded sites in this area will be supplied directly from our El Paso refinery. In support of this ARCO growth, we continue to pursue additional Mexico supply capabilities through development of our Rosarito light products terminal in Northern Baja and lease capacity being built in Sinaloa. On the other [indiscernible], we announced our agreement to acquire a large light product in Asphalt thermal and 33 NOCO Express retail stores in Buffalo, New York from NOCO Incorporated in support of our Midwest product placement strategy. This builds upon prior investments, including Speedway's acquisition of 78 Express Mart locations in Western New York. This extension of our integrated business model is positioned to be supplied from the Midwest [indiscernible] or the New York Harbor via multiple supply routes, including pipeline, truck rail or marine.  We continue to progress additional commercial development projects related to development of our renewables portfolio, continuing to grow the reach of our integrated business model and optimizing our existing portfolio of integrated assets to create additional value for our stakeholders.  Now let me turn the call over to Tim, who will provide a walk-through of our financial results.
Timothy Griffith: Thanks, Greg. Slide 4 provides a summary of our first quarter financial highlights. We reported $7 million loss attributable to MPC in the quarter. Income from operations was $669 million. Adjusted EBITDA was nearly $1.5 billion for the quarter. This does also include the $186 million of turnaround costs incurred during the quarter. Operating cash flow before working capital was approximately $1.2 billion. Capital spending for the quarter was just over $1.3 billion. Share repurchase and dividends were over $1.2 billion in the quarter, including $885 million in share repurchases and $354 million in dividends, which is reflective of the 15% increase in MPC dividends announced in January. We ended the quarter with 667 million shares outstanding and consolidated leverage of 39% of book capitalization or 1.4x adjusted EBITDA at a parent-only basis. To allow additional time for questions, we've streamlined the information on the call for this quarter. The more detailed segment earnings walks we -- have been provided in the appendix of the presentation. The new format on Slide 5 captures our segment results and the walk of income by segment from the first quarter of 2018.  Refining and marketing segment income decreased $201 million versus the same quarter last year as the addition of Andeavor's refining and marketing system was offset by narrow crude discounts across our medium and heavy sour [Technical Difficulty] additionally, high industry gasoline inventories following fourth quarter's strong production environment resulted in weaker-than-expected gasoline margins and price realizations. Quarterly segment results were also impacted by 1 extra month of incremental cost from the February 1 drop-down transaction.  Refinery capacity utilization was 95%, resulting in total throughputs of 3.1 million barrels per day from the first quarter, which was 1.2 million barrels per day higher than first quarter last year due to the addition of the legacy Andeavor refineries. Recall, during the quarter, we completed planned maintenance work at our Robinson refinery and the Wilmington portion of the Los Angeles refinery. Looking at our Midstream segment. Income increased $341 million versus the first quarter of 2018. The increase was due to contributions of $220 million from Andeavor Logistics and $121 million increase in results driven primarily by growth across MPLX's businesses. Moving to our Retail segment. Income increased $75 million versus same quarter last year primarily due to the addition of Andeavor's retail and dealer -- direct dealer operations as well as the $24 million increase in MPC legacy Speedway segment earnings. Retail fuel margins averaged $0.1715 per gallon in the first quarter of 2019. Same-store merchandise sales increased by 5.4% year-over-year, and same-store gasoline sales volumes decreased by 3.2% year-over-year. Items not allocated to segments had a favorable impact of $14 million versus last year primarily due to $207 million noncash gain related to the exchange of MPC's undivided joint interest in the Capline system for an equity ownership in the newly formed joint venture. This benefit was partially offset by $91 million of transactions-related costs primarily associated with adopting MPC's vacation accrual policies across the legacy Andeavor employee base as well as higher corporate costs and expenses for the combined company. Interest and financing costs were $123 million higher during the first quarter of this year primarily due to higher combined debt balances as a result of the combination. Income tax has increased to $82 million due to higher income from operations as well as $36 million prior period state tax adjustment. We expect our effective income tax rate to be 2 to 3 percentage points lower than the statutory rate over the long term. Noncontrolling interest increased $68 million, primarily driven by higher earnings in MPLX and the addition of Andeavor Logistics and the allocation of those earnings to the public unitholders of both partnerships. Slide 6 presents the elements of changes in our consolidated cash position for the first quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was just under $900 million. Core operating cash flow before change to working capital was $1.2 billion source of cash in the quarter. Working capital was $470 million source of cash in the quarter largely due to the effects of rising commodity prices and the shorter terms on refined products compared to the longer terms on purchase of crude oil. Return of capital to MPC shareholders by way of share repurchase and dividends totaled over $1.2 billion with $885 million worth of shares acquired during the quarter. Distributions to public unitholders of MPLX and ANDX was $230 million in the quarter. At quarter-end, we had approximately $28 billion of total consolidated debt, including $13.8 billion of debt at [indiscernible] and $5.1 billion at ANDX. With that, let me turn the call over to Don.
Donald Templin: Thanks, Tim. As Greg mentioned, we are pleased with the significant progress we have made integrating our assets and operations. One example is the continued success we've had delivering synergies. As seen on the Slide 7, we realized $133 million of synergies in the first quarter, $89 million in refining and marketing, $29 million in corporate and $15 million in retail. We continue to have confidence in our ability to deliver on the significant opportunity set available to us, as most of these realized synergies are recurring or run rate synergies. Within the refining business, we realized approximately $55 million of synergies during the quarter. Examples include utilizing turnaround best practices to lower costs and accelerate the completion date for the Los Angeles, Wilmington turnaround; catalyst reformulation changes; and optimizing Tier 3 gasoline compliance. Crude oil supply and logistics delivered approximately $30 million of realized synergies during the quarter. The majority of these synergies were driven by our ability to again leverage our scale to optimize access to Canadian crudes at our Mid-Continent region and foreign spot crude oil purchases as a combined business. The $29 million in corporate synergies represents continued contract renegotiations made possible by the combination. Moving on to Slide 8. As we discussed at our 2018 Investor Day in December, we listened to investor feedback and are now providing R&M margin on a regional basis. An important point to note is that because of differences in our margin calculation method and different composition of our regions for the combined company, our reported margins are not directly comparable to historical margins reported by Andeavor. Some of the reasons include cost allocation between cost of sales and SG&A as well as expenses that are not allocated to any specific region such as fees paid to MPLX and ANDX. For the first quarter, our Gulf Coast refining margin was $7.82 per barrel. Our Mid-Con refining margin was $15.26 per barrel. And our West Coast refining margin was $10.94 per barrel. Slide 9 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the second quarter of 2019. As we look through 2019, we continue to expect our turnaround slate to be later than 2018. With that said, in the second quarter, we do have plant maintenance work at our Garyville, Martinez and Los Angeles refineries.  The most significant of these activities is at Los Angeles where we are nearly complete with the 50-day outage on the FCC and alkylation units. Inclusive of these events, we expect total throughput volumes of approximately 2.9 million barrels per day. Our average total direct operating cost is projected to be $8.70 per barrel, and our corporate and other unallocated items are projected to be $200 million for the quarter.  With that, let me turn the call over to Mike Hennigan to briefly discuss our Midstream business and projects.
Michael Hennigan: Thanks. We continue to see tremendous opportunity set across our midstream portfolio. We have recently progressed on several key midstream projects across our companies. First, today, MPLX announced its participation in the Wink-to-Webster crude pipeline. Although our prior project had sufficient commitments, we made the decision to join this project to enhance our capital efficiency and achieve a much higher return. Second, MPLX completed a binding open season [indiscernible] pipeline, which is partially owned by MPC, where we see significant shipper interest for both light and heavy crude, providing the opportunity to move forward with plans to start light oil deliveries in September 2020 and heavy oil deliveries in 2022. This project will allow Cushing supply to reach the Eastern Gulf and open the ability to export crude via the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port commonly referred to as LOOP.  Third, at the MPC level, the Gray Oak project, where we have a 25% ownership, remains on track to come online in the fourth quarter of this year. Last, as Gary mentioned early this morning, MPLX announced a recent agreement to acquire ANDX. We are incredibly excited about the announcement. This deepens our presence in the Permian, has natural synergies and integration with MPC's refining business, and it creates tremendous opportunity to expand the logistics [indiscernible] focused regions of the U.S. Now I'll turn it back to Kristina.
Kristina Kazarian: Thanks, Mike. [Operator Instructions]. With that, we will now open the call to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.
Philip Gresh: First question for Gary. Just looking at your guidance for the second quarter and thinking back to your guidance back in December for the full year EBITDA, how are you thinking about that today in terms of whether the macro environment that we're seeing right now kind of with 1Q in the rearview would still be supportive of your full year EBITDA guidance?
Gary Heminger: Well, Phil, as you know, the first quarter ended up dramatically different for the entire industry, not just for us. And particularly, West Coast margins were weaker than we had anticipated. But the first quarter is in the rearview mirror, and as I stated in my comments, we're bullish on the balance of the year. As I stated, our margin here quarter-to-date is $18.80, which is about twice what it was in the first quarter. And -- but I think more important and kind of following in the line with -- if you recall what I stated in the fourth quarter call, we had predicted that inventories were going to start to fall some 6 million to 7 million barrels per day, and they did. We see right now inventories are at the low end. Gasoline is at the low end.  If you look at it by region, really PADD III are the only -- is the only area that inventories are a little bit on the high side. That's also the big export region of the country, and those were also got back in line, I think, very quickly. So we're very bullish on where inventories are across the board, PADD V, PADD II, even PADD I inventories. I look at it, it's a very light turnaround year for us. Don just mentioned that we made tremendous progress. We're going to -- knock on wood here, but we're going to finish the LA turnaround ahead of schedule below budget. This is one of the key synergies that Greg and I spoke to when we talked about this combination was how we can do major turnarounds, major projects and bring in our expertise to be able to accomplish those. So I would say with first quarter being in the rearview mirror that we remain very bullish on the balance of the year.
Philip Gresh: Okay. Great. And then a second question, you made some comments in your prepared remarks about the rationale for canceling the Garyville Coker project. I had two ask questions about that. One is whether we should read into that, that perhaps you're less bullish on light-heavies, specifically around IMO 2020? Or is it more just a longer-term comment since the project doesn't come on till 2021? And then secondarily, what does this mean for capital spending at the parent company level? I think you said $2.8 billion annually in '19 and '20. And so should we see that come down ratably each year for canceling that project? Or are there other offsets?
Gary Heminger: No. As you recall, Phil, when we talked about this project to begin with, we stated it was not an IMO 2020 project. This was subsequent to the initiation and implementation, if you will, of IMO 2020. So this has nothing to do -- we're very positive about IMO 2020. And you've noticed all of the discussions in D.C. and in and around the international markets. And I specifically went over to Singapore and some Asian markets to really get a real good fix and came away very positive that even those markets are going to be in compliance with IMO 2020 going forward. So this project was clearly the -- canceling or long deferral is maybe is a better -- was clearly where we see the light-heavy spreads today. Let me turn over to the Don to give you some more color on the spreads.
Donald Templin: Yes, Phil. I mean, think I Gary explained it right. We're very bullish on IMO. So our view hasn't changed there. This was really a longer-term view around what was happening on the light-heavy differentials. And then to your comments or questions around sort of capital spending, I think we indicated at Investor Day, but this was very much back-ended in terms of the spending. 2019 was going to be primarily an engineering year. And so we had about $70 million or so in the budget in 2019 related to this project. A really big proportion of this spend was actually in 2021. So I think as we sit here, we're very comfortable with the guidance that we gave for 2019 and not being over that. And we're very comfortable with being flat into 2020. And we'll -- as we get to the end of the year, we'll give more color around our 2020 budget. But I don't think you should see a dramatic change in 2019. It wasn't a pro rata spend.
Gary Heminger: Phil, I'll just add one more thing. As we've talked several times, you've been into business with us, about capital discipline. This just illustrates how disciplined we are. Ray came to us and said, as we look at our internal forecast, the spreads weren't there, still was a good return project. But we have better projects down the road. And so we're very disciplined and said now's not the time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.
Roger Read: And let me say thanks for the additional disclosure at the regional level. I think that'll be very helpful going forward. Just jumping in here, kind of 2 main questions. One, if you could help us to understand on the synergy progress, how that compared to sort of your expectations not just in the $133 million relative to the $600 million-plus run rate by year-end, but also kind of by segment, how that's progressing? And then my other question is kind of dovetailing with that. As you generate more cash flows out of the synergies, what should be a better outlook overall for the remainder of the year, how the share repo -- share repurchase program should be thought of here? The pace we saw in Q1, maybe some deceleration to kind of match cash flows from here. Just how you're thinking about that?
Timothy Griffith: Yes, Roger, on the synergy -- I'll just start up by -- on the synergy. The $133 million this quarter is incremental to the first 3 months of operation, which we had $165 million, $166 million of synergies. So if you look at it, it's about $300 million in total. I just want to clarify, it's not $133 million by itself. You have to look at what we already accomplished. But Don can go into the details here and then Tim will talk about the share repo.
Donald Templin: Yes, Roger, it's fair to say that we are well ahead of our plan in each of the segments around the realization of synergies. So you'll recall that our original guidance was $480 million [indiscernible] the year and up to $600 million that's for end of 2019. That would imply $40 million a month at the $480 million level and higher than that at the $600 million level. We're already above $40 million a month averaging for the first quarter, and that was along all of the different business segments. So I feel very comfortable in our ability. We had a ramp in the plan anyways. It was going to grow as the year went on, and you definitely see that in things like Retail, where we're doing the conversions and you would have those synergies coming on. The other thing that happens is as we realize synergies, they enter -- they -- you get more months of capturing the synergies. So if we capture the synergy, let's say -- or realized the synergy in March, we would have only had 1 month of that synergy in the first quarter, but we're going to have 3 months of that synergy in the second quarter. So we feel really good about the positioning. And let me turn it over to Tim to talk about the share repurchase piece of it.
Timothy Griffith: Yes, Roger, thanks for the question. I mean, as we did at Investor Day, we really laid out what our commitment around return of capital is going to be, 50% of discretionary consolidated free cash flow, and we're going to be steadfast to that commitment. We had the $885 million in the first quarter, probably had a little bit of concentration to it, but we'll assess it over the course of the year. Again, we've built this metric as a direct tie to operating cash flow less the maintenance capital we need to support the business. So from that point I want to make is that we're really viewing return on the capital on par with capital by that construct. But we remain steadfast. We'll see how the rest of the year plays out to the extent that synergies result in additional cash flow through operating cash flow. It's part of that formulation. So we're -- we'll be steadfast to that commitment for the long term and will measure it over calendar period. 
Gary Heminger: And another thing, Ray, I like you to talk about -- Ray just updated us this week on the big turnaround that we're just completing at LA and some of the catalyst formulations that you will see these synergies coming in the subsequent months. But talk a little bit about what you're seeing there.
Raymond Brooks: Sure, Gary. At LA, as Gary alluded to earlier, we're completing a very large turnaround on the cat and alkylation unit at -- on the Carson side. Right now, one of the synergies that we've got pretty much in the bag, as you talked about, was from the turnaround management side. We expect [indiscernible] turnaround in close to a week ahead of schedule and under budget. So that's all working well. But where we think the real value is, is once we start the unit up, we will move to a different catalyst formulation in the cat cracker. And this is a true synergy with how we operate our Garyville refinery. We'll go to a formulation that mirrors Garyville, has the same output of that and will result in a huge yield benefit once we start that unit up. In fact, we actually are transferring about 750 tons of spent catalyst from Garyville so that when we start that unit up hopefully in a week or 2, we'll get the benefit from that immediately.
Operator: Our next question comes from Prashant Rao with Citigroup.
Prashant Rao: I wanted to pick up on that a little bit, Ray, on the LA turnaround coming out of that PADD V, gasoline price obviously very strong. Just wanted to get sort of shorter-term outlook on how we should think about capture as you come out of the maintenance period, given the healthy gasoline frac. And bigger picture, I guess, question for multiple members of the team, we're entering positions to transfer gasoline, I think, nationwide now versus where we started at the beginning of the year. I think that the mentality has changed 180 degrees. And looking forward to IMO 2020, where you think about maybe some benefits there as well. I was wondering if you could speak to the strength of the global gasoline market, maybe the U.S. overall, within that sort of your view maybe going out a few quarters. Are you more bullish now than you were maybe 3 months ago? And is there a reason to maintain that bullishness for us as we look at modeling this out?
Gary Heminger: Prashant, this is Gary first. I would say we definitely are more bullish on the global gasoline market than we were 3 months ago. Let's back up and make sure everybody understands what happened over the 6-month period. The fourth quarter was very strong due to very wide crude differentials and very strong -- or excuse me, and a very quick collapse of the crude market, which led to very wide differentials or crack spreads as well as very wide gasoline margins at the Retail. So all of those things therefore led to refineries running to pull out. Then we came over to the first quarter and we have ample inventory. Now that inventory really came back in check, not only here in the U.S., but when I look at things globally -- and one of the reasons I went to Asia to really understand what the markets were doing there. I think we're the -- the West refining industry is set up very, very well for 2 things.  We're set up very well for both gasoline. Everybody's talked about IMO and the distillate expectation. And yes, we've been running max distillate for the most of the first quarter. But I would suggest again that I think there's a good shot that we'll be seeing kind of a max gasoline mode second quarter and into the third quarter. And Ray can talk about that in more detail here. But we certainly are much more bullish, and it's certainly evident. Yes, the first quarter, PADD V margins in the first quarter were very challenged. But I look to where they have been, they got much better in February, got a lot better in March and very strong in April and month-to-date here in May. So PADD II continues to be very strong. So I think as I said earlier, PADD III is really the export market to the globe, and I think that they're going to be able to bring those inventories in check. But Ray can go over for you by pad or by region what he sees as far as a max gas or max diesel.
Raymond Brooks: Sure. Sure. And it varies as far as what region we're in and where we are with our streams. On the West Coast, back in March, we saw incentive to move to a max gasoline mode and we did that. In the Mid-Con area in early April, we saw that incentive, and we made that move to gasoline focus. The Gulf Coast is a little bit different animal. On the Gulf Coast, one, we've seen stronger diesel prices relative to gasoline, which support being at -- staying in the diesel mode. The other thing is it's not all just about diesel prices and gasoline prices. On the Gulf Coast, where we have the ability to buy and sell intermediates, that comes into play. And specifically, the weakness of the NAFTA market has driven us to remain in the diesel mode on the Gulf Coast. What I like to emphasize is that, one, it's not a 2-variable equation. And then the other thing, every day, we're looking at the prices and we're running our LP models to determine, hey, where should we be from our cut points from our gasoline focus and diesel focus? We're seeing a little bit of a change out on the West Coast. Even though gasoline has been strong, we're seeing diesel become strong relative to gasoline. And if need be, we'll pivot again on that.  So we don't have a set opinion about which way we're going to go. We're going to let the market tell us and do what's most economical. The other thing before I leave this question and follow-up to California and back what I was talking about with the LA-Carson cat cracker, that's a large cat cracker, about 100,000 barrels a day. And the catalyst reformulation was really driven to fully optimize the LARIC project that Andeavor had done. If you recall, that project actually shut down a cat cracker, but remained with two alkylation units. What we're doing with the catalyst formulation is make sure that we fully utilize those 2 alkylation units to make a very premium gasoline blend product. That's it.
Prashant Rao: Appreciate all the color. And then just one last quick one. I wanted to circle back on the Garyville Coker 3. Appreciate the color there that it's a change maybe and where we are with light-heavy differentials and expectations. Just wanted to get a sense, as we think about longer term from your view, are you -- I think maybe light-heavy differential is just a push on how tight we are right now that the widening and normalization, sort of the shape of that curve is similar, but we're just starting at a tighter point? Or is there something that in the duration of light-heavy differential volatility looking out? As we go through to 2020, that changed in your mind?
Gary Heminger: Yes. Prashant, this is a long-term project. If we thought that this was just an aberration, a 1-year aberration, we would have continued down with the project. Our concerns over some policy changes around the world, the issues going on in Venezuela that was a big supplier of heavy crude. And so therefore, it kind of leads -- the Middle East producers as the swing producer to bring heavy into this market. And so we just see that is -- I would say the latter to your point, this is going to be narrower or compressed differentials for a longer period of time. And I want to emphasize, though, that we will finish the conceptual engineering. This is done. We'll have it available to us. If we decide that the market has turned, the Canadian markets open back up, the Venezuelan situation improves, there's other heavies that come into the marketplace, we can reinstitute this project quickly. But again, I think it's -- there's just about right capital play and right capital discipline this time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta: I guess, my first question is just around earnings consistency, Gary. And if I look back over the last 5 years, so let's take the last 21 quarters, you've beaten consensus about 50% of the time, you missed consensus about 50% of the time. And the S&P large-cap average is closer to 75%. So just wanted your thoughts on what the company can do to get a more consistent pattern of earnings execution. We're not quarter-to-quarter folks, but certainly that helps with continuing to support the story when you have a more consistent earnings set of results.
Gary Heminger: Well, Neil, I'm in the same camp as you. I wish we were all perfect and -- to provide forecast that follow a simple model. But we're running a dynamic model. And in a dynamic model with -- and we're 2 quarters into this very large transaction. I applaud the team here for tremendous accomplishments to date, not only on synergy, but on integration and where we see how we are accelerating this integration from the systems and our modeling concept going forward. We provided this time information to the market here on a regional basis, which you've been asking for and rightly so, and asking for some time, which is certainly going to help with that. And I think as the market really gets more attuned, we have a huge MLP.  And with that MLP, we have assets that -- the thermal assets, the marine assets, pipeline that used to be within the R&M sector that now flow into that -- into the MLP. Therefore, that is a deduction, if you will, or an operating expense that goes through the last R&M section. I think for the most part, the MLP in the Retail side is more of a simple model to be able to forecast. But it's a multiple layer dynamic model to be able to do the whole R&M system. We're going to get better with that. I haven't done the math to be able to confirm or deny your comment of -- I think we're better than 50-50. But as I said, I haven't done that nor is that the real question. The real question is how do we get our system to be able to help you model better going forward to have the best the data that you can. But I'll take you back to the first quarter in the way we -- we're out front talking about where we thought inventory levels were going to go and see that happening and it did happen. So stay tuned. I wish we were perfect, but we're going to get better as we go forward. Don, do you want to add a few things?
Donald Templin: Yes, Neil. I mean, maybe one other comment is we're trying to provide you with information I think that allows that modeling to occur. So a little bit more color on turnarounds like we did this time, so you understand it was a cat alky. So that will obviously impact gasoline production on the West Coast. I mean, we're trying to give that kind of data, so you can build that into your model. And that's our commitment going forward is to try to give incremental color like that.
Neil Mehta: And we definitely appreciate incremental color, it goes a long way. I guess, the follow-up is the stock, the way we look at it, is so dislocated relative to its sum of the parts value. The question we consistently get is what ultimately is going to unlock that value. So going back a couple of years, there was a talk about disintegration and whether there is value in doing that. But Gary, what are your latest thoughts there? I'm just saying if there is -- if the stock is just discounted relative to its sum of the parts, how do you pull forward that value? Is MPC better together or apart?
Gary Heminger: Well, you're right, Neil, the stock is discounted when you look at it on a sum of the parts basis. But I also want you to take a strong look at the first quarter's performance. The MLP performed really, I would say, right in line. The MLP is right in line with expectations providing $908 million of EBITDA. The Retail, Retail performed a very, very well. And as we stated, the merchandise sales are running at about 4% to 5% same-store increase, which is very, very strong. Granted, in the first quarter with the rising crude price, same-store volume was on gasoline slips, because you're trying to get that gasoline price to the street. But you add those 2 sectors together and they are very, very strong sectors and now compare to those to some of our peers in the first quarter who did not -- they did not have those sectors in their portfolio. I would say for the long term, I'd rather be invested in a company that has that type of a portfolio balance. But your -- you saw here in the first quarter, we bought back a substantial amount of shares. I think it was a very smart purchase to continue to buy back shares at this low valuation rate. And as we project, the second through the fourth quarters, we expect to be, as I said earlier, bullish. And that should provide us with the capital to continue to lean into the share repurchases. And Greg? I think Greg will add a few more...
Gregory Goff: Yes, Neil. What I'd like to do is just add a couple of comments to what Gary said. I think, one, everybody needs to recognize that we just went through a tremendous change. We're only 6 months or 7 months into this big change. But I think underneath that change, when our whole idea going back many months ago, was that the power and what we were able to create by having this integrated business provides tremendous opportunities to generate earnings and cash and competitive advantages. And we're on track to be able to do that. So one of the things that I think that has an impact on the valuation at this point in time is just that we're in the early stages of developing a track record of pulling all these things together. And I think everything you've heard about, the synergies, the work in the marketing business, the retail to do the conversions that drives the integration and all that will start to deliver over time. But we are absolutely convinced that our integrated business, by taking it from where we buy our crude to how we sell it in the marketplace, is the most powerful way to run the business forward, and we'll demonstrate that over time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Manav Gupta with Crédit Suisse.
Manav Gupta: So when I go back to the days of Galveston Bay, it used to be a high-cost asset. And then you took over and crushed the OpEx over there. And I'm looking at the West Coast OpEx guidance. It looks a little high right now. And if somebody can crush it, it's you. So I'm just trying to understand what's the plan of action to bring this more to a normalized level? And by when, can we see this op cost trending down lower?
Gary Heminger: Sure, Manav. And that's a good point. If you go back to our Analyst Day, we had a couple of slides in there that depicted the difference in the Solomon index. If you look across the industry what our Solomon index is for the legacy Marathon versus the legacy Andeavor sites and specifically to LA, we took Galveston Bay from a very high fourth-quartile performing refinery. But we expect to end -- the final numbers are going to come out mid-year this year for '18. We expect to have that down to probably the top end of a first-quartile refinery on an EDU basis. The second thing to understand -- I was going to turn over to Ray, but Ray is too humble to answer this question. Ray ran Galveston Bay. We asked Ray to go run Galveston Bay. It was with our succession plan and was that Ray went in there and did a good job operating that place. He more than likely was going to run all of refining, and he did an outstanding job. He has, on LA -- our new plant manager came from a Catlettsburg, Tracy Case who ran Garyville, who ran the best EDU on a cost per barrel basis, the best refinery in the country, is looking over that refinery now. So trust me, we are very, very focused. And I think it's further illustrated in that we're going to this turnaround done early and below budget. So we're very, very focused. And lastly, the work that we just came out of -- we've now completed all of the represented refineries are complete with the negotiations of those contracts. And we cut a significant amount of cost out of the LA refinery here in our first contract negotiations. Ray, any more to add?
Raymond Brooks: Yes, I'd just like to add that your point is spot on with what our focus is. We've put for the second quarter, of course, some of that is driven by the high turnaround work that we have in California in the second quarter. But our real focus is looking at the other manufacturing costs. And when you see that differential relative to the Gulf Coast, we know California won't get to the Gulf Coast, but directionally, we can improve from where we are. So that's spot on. And it's not one thing. It's not turnarounds. It's not people. It's a combination of looking for all the efficiency knobs. And Gary talked about one of them just now as far as, hey, our contracts, we believe coming out of the first quarter, we have more efficient contracts to work with. And so we will continue to work with the California teams to just say, hey, how can -- given the landscape that we have out there, how can we get better?
Manav Gupta: And a quick follow-up, guys. On the Analyst Day, one of the slides kind of highlighted that in 2019 and '20, you expect close to $1.9 billion in cash to be kicked back from the Midstream to the parent. Given the deal announcement today morning, I did my quick math, I was still coming very close to $1.9 billion. I'm just trying to understand is that still the number that you expect the Midstream component of the business to give it back to you in terms of cash returns?
Timothy Griffith: Yes, Manav, it's Tim. The -- obviously, the guidance on distribution back was based on sort of standalone with the combination there could be some adjustments to it. And again, we're not going to sort of reguide to it, but there is certainly, by way of a combination, less distributions that would be made out of what would have been the ANDX system. So there's probably some adjustment offset by what the distribution outlook as we set that for 2020, which we're not doing at this time. So I don't think we're concerned at all about any degradation of cash flow coming from MLP distribution and its impact on MPC's capital or return plans.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Douglas Leggate: Gary, the MPLX deal address is one element of complexity one could argue. But I think in your prior conversations, prior remarks you've made about this, you remain quite unhappy with the way the overall MLP is traded by way of its yield today, which I think is still one of the highest in this space. What can you do next now that you've simplified this part of the structure? Any further thoughts on how you can improve the market reception to what is now one of the most attractive yields in this space?
Gary Heminger: Sure. Sure, Doug. The conversation for the last 6 months has been the overhang of having two MLPs and the overhang not only on MPLX, but therefore the overhang that then translates into MPC. So we just announced the transaction this morning. We will see over time here how things move. The -- we would talk with the market over time that we continue to look at does the C-corp structure make sense, does some other structure makes sense. But I think that give it some time here. This overhang should come out of the market. All the projects that Mike Hennigan outlined here on this call and earlier today on the MPLX call and this combination, we probably have the best backlog and best growth of third-party fee-based revenue in -- really in the whole MLP space. So time would tell if we get respect for these projects and respect for what we have put forth. I think we will, because it's very clean, it's very simple and performance will dictate how we recover.
Douglas Leggate: Okay. Well, I guess, we'll have a chance to chat more [indiscernible] I'm sure. My follow-up is just a quick one follow-up on the synergies question from earlier. I just wanted to be clear whether you're achieving the same synergy target quicker or if you're you finding more in terms of the overall prognosis for your synergy target? And I'll leave it there.
Donald Templin: Doug, this is Don. I would say yes to both of those. So we knew that there were opportunities and the goal was, one, to expand the opportunity set and the ideas that we have that would generate synergies. And the second was to accelerate the realization of those. And so we're really pleased actually with both. The portfolio backlog is growing and the realization rate is occurring much faster than we anticipated.
Gary Heminger: And Doug, the first quarter here, it was unfortunate that the whole industry struggled just from the commodity prices, but mainly from the big overhang in inventory and then the compression of the crude diffs. But our synergies are really masked by the downturn in the overall refining industry. But I really would like to compare this transaction, as Greg just said, we're only 7 months into this. I'd like to compare this transaction to any other major transaction that's ever been put together on how quick we're able to integrate and how quick that we're delivering these synergies. And you'll see it now that the markets are turning around, we had a little bit of noise here with some catch-ups on vacation accruals and some things that just happened in the large transaction. But you'll see it really start to accelerate and these synergies will be sticky into the earnings power going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Matthew Blair: Maybe turning back to the sum of the parts discussion. Gary, you have a pretty expansive portfolio these days. Are there any opportunities to potentially divest any underperforming businesses or noncore businesses that eventually might help your multiple?
Gary Heminger: Certainly, and we have discussed that in the past. We are looking at -- there are possibly -- and we're high-grading some of the assets and systems right now in the Midstream system. There may be some assets in certain basins that could fit some other players better than they fit us. And the market is valuing some of these assets quite lofty right now. The -- we certainly, on the Retail side, Tony -- Speedway there, they have a number of assets that aren't at the high level of performance that Speedway wants, that we've put together some package between Tony and Brian Partee here to probably divest of some of those assets into our trade eventually. We are quite pleased where we sit right now on the refining side. As we look at the refining systems and how I think we can go in and really make some improvements in the operating expense, we are quite pleased. I don't see that we make any divestitures in refining at this point, but some components within Retail, within Midstream that we are going through that process right now.
Matthew Blair: Great. And then your other operating expenses in refining picked up by about $180 million compared to Q4 levels. I think it's about $0.19 EPS impact. Could you just walk through what drove that increase? And is the $1.268 billion figure from Q1, is that a good run rate going forward?
Timothy Griffith: Yes, Matthew, it's Tim. I mean, remember that, that other category within R&M has got really the sort of cumulative effect of a lot of the drop activity that was done frankly even before the combination. So you had in first quarter an extra month of the drops that were done in February of last year. That's probably the big delta versus where we saw things in fourth quarter. But that level around between sort of $1 billion and $1.3 billion is -- there are no other big factors in there that would [indiscernible] anything unusual that suggested that, that is going to change dramatically on a going-forward basis. Again, we're not going to guide to it specifically, but there were things present in first quarter that we wouldn't expect to be present on a going-forward basis. So you've got the cumulative effect of the drops, an extra month in there from where we were in prior year. And again, I guess, the other big change here is that the -- a lot of the transportation costs within the legacy Andeavor system were captured in refining margin. So we've reclassified and remapped those costs into this category. So there is a relatively big delta on bringing those transportation costs into that category. But again, it's probably going to be around that ZIP Code on a going-forward basis.
Operator: Our next question comes from Justin Jenkins with Raymond James.
Justin Jenkins: I realize we're at the hour mark here, so I'm just going to keep it to one. Gary, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about going towards maximum light sweet on the crude side of things. Just curious how you see it playing out here with a lot more discussions on the quality of the light sweet crude being produced here in the U.S. and increasing amounts of the higher gravity material and how that's impacting operations here.
Gary Heminger: Right. Just let me turn that over to Rick Hessling who runs all of our supply function.
Rick Hessling: Very good question. If you look at a 10,000-foot level, we're running just shy of 60% sweet. And if you do a comparator to 2Q or -- that will be our 2Q number. Now if you go 2Q of '18, we're 12% up from it. So we are maximizing light sweets in and around WTI-Midland as you well can track. Those differentials are very attractive. We're the beneficiary of those differentials at an El Paso, at a Gallop, at Galveston Bay. And then throughout our Midwest system, we've got just shy of 800,000 barrels per day. We are certainly maximizing light sweet there as well as Garyville. And then last, but not least, certainly the West Coast. So we are all out light sweet where we can, where the differentials make sense. And similar to what Ray said earlier, we're running our LP models every day and tweaking them every day based on current length and/or lack of length in gas and diesel in specific regional markets.
Operator: And that is all the time that we have for questions today.
Kristina Kazarian: Thank you, Operator. Thank you for your interest in the Marathon Petroleum Corp. Should you have additional questions or would you like clarification on topics discussed this morning, we will be available to take your calls. Thank you for joining us.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-07 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the MPC Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Elan, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.
Kristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corp's fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, Chairman and CEO; Greg Goff, Executive Vice Chairman; Tim Griffith, CFO; Don Templin, President of Refining, Marketing and Supply; Mike Hennigan, President of MPLX; as well as other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statement on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks on Slide 3.
Gary Heminger: Thanks Kristina. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Earlier today, we reported an extraordinary first financial update as a combined company. And we believe these results are early indication of the tremendous value potential of this powerful combination. Earnings for the quarter were $951 million, or $1.35 per diluted share. Results included cost of $1.06 per diluted share primarily from transaction related items. Tim will walk through these costs in detail later on the call. As we review our performance for 2018, it's important to highlight that we've build a culture focused on operational excellence and safety. We received multiple awards and accolades over the last year including an Energy and EPA Energy Star Partner of the Year and VPP recognition at multiple facilities. We remain committed to a culture of continues improvement that positions our company to safely grow our earnings and create long-term value for our shareholders. This quarter we were pleased to report over $2 billion in income from operations. And adjusted consolidated EBITDA of approximately $4.1 billion with our segments performing well. Our expanded integrated business model created significant opportunities for us to capture value. We optimized crude purchases and utilized our larger logistics and diversified marketing footprint to place over 70% of our gasoline volume on a daily basis. Refining throughput was strong during the quarter at 3.1 million barrels per day. This exceeded our expectations and was impressive considering our Detroit, St. Paul Park and Martinez turnarounds during the quarter, all of which were completed on time and under budget. Our Midstream businesses both performed well this quarter. ANDX reported 2018 EBITDA of $1.2 billion, which increased $250 million year-over-year. For MPLX, 2018 marked the single largest increase in annual EBITDA since it became a public company. MPLX reported 2018 adjusted EBITDA of $3.5 billion, which increased $1.5 billion over the prior year and nearly $400 million of this increase was driven by organic growth. We have announced a number of compelling new projects within Midstream that generate third-party revenue; one of the largest projects is the Gray Oak pipeline and export terminal, and we've had inquiries of where this may reside. This project is being funded at the MPC level, and therefore, we do not plan to drop these assets into ANDX. As the opportunity set for new infrastructure remains robust, we remain committed to high-grading the project backlog toward mid-teen returns and self-funding capital spend at the MLP level. Lastly, our retail segment had a particularly strong fourth quarter. This included record quarterly earnings for MPC's former Speedway segment, while 2018 started slowly for the legacy Speedway business, it ended the year with record EBITDA driven by strong merchandise sales and fuel margins. The retail business continues to add significant stability to our overall cash flow profile. It provides an important placement option for our refining volumes and creates a counter-cyclical balance to our overall business. Considering the highlights on Slide 4, we reported approximately $160 million of realized synergies in just three months and continue to expect total annual gross run rate synergies of up to $600 million by year-end 2019 and up to $1.4 billion by the end of 2021. Don will provide a detailed update on our plan in just a few minutes. It was an impressive year with many milestones for Marathon and our integrated business model allowed us to return $4.2 billion of capital to our shareholders, which included $675 million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter. Additionally, last week, we announced a 15% increase in the quarterly dividend underscoring our confidence in our cash generation potential. As we look into 2019, we remain optimistic about the prospects for our business and our ability to deliver compelling financial results. Now, let me briefly address the current macro environment. At this time of year, there's always a lot of focus on gasoline markets. Despite what we view as normal seasonal trends, we are optimistic about the opportunities for our business this year. Demand remains strong, global economic growth continues and even with recent high refinery utilization, distillate inventories remain below 5-year averages. MPC's refining system remains one of the most dynamic in the world. We have significant flexibility in terms of switching our crude slates and optimizing our production yields. Our expanded logistics footprint creates opportunities to access export markets, and in December alone, we exported 485,000 barrels per day of refined products. With limited turnarounds in 2019, our system is poised to execute in any market environment. These trends coupled with our expected synergy capture and potentially changing dynamics of the low-sulfur fuel market all set the stage to create meaningful benefits across the MPC's integrated and diversified business model. Lastly, we continue to make progress on evaluating all options for the two MLPs. Each of the parties involved have retained advisors and our comments will be limited as we walk through a thorough evaluation process. We will provide an update to investors at the appropriate time. Now, let me turn the call over to Don for an update on synergies.
Donald Templin: Thanks, Gary. Slide 5 highlights the success we've already had delivering synergies. During the fourth quarter, we realized $160 million of synergies, $138 million of the synergies were in our refining and marketing segment. Although not all of these synergies are recurring, it has underscored our confidence in delivering on the significant opportunity set available to us. Crude oil supply and logistics delivered just over $100 million of realized synergies during the quarter. We were able to leverage our scale to optimize access to Canadian heavy crude, which contributed roughly $50 million of synergies. The other $50 million was largely a result of optimizing logistics assets utilization and foreign spot crude oil purchases as a combined business. Within the refining business, we realized $32 million of synergies during the quarter. For example, we utilized MPC's turnaround specialists and our broader access to contractors to support the turnarounds at Martinez and St. Paul Park. This allowed us to come in under budget and ahead of schedule. The $22 million in corporate synergies represents early efficiencies and cost eliminations made possible by the combination. As a reminder, our synergy targets and realizations are incremental to the synergies Andeavor realized as part of the Western acquisition. As of the date of the closing, Andeavor had achieved run rate synergies of $365 million on that transaction. Looking forward, it is our plan to provide details of realized synergies on a quarterly basis during 2019. As Gary mentioned in his comments earlier, we're not constraining ourselves to the synergies originally identified. Our teams are very focused on generating incremental synergy ideas and opportunities. For example, during the fourth quarter, we converted 170 company-owned and operated sites in Minnesota to the Speedway brand. This will support synergy capture in the retail segment going forward. With respect to refining, we've identified the opportunity to utilize sulfur credits across our refining system that will provide approximately $40 million in value during 2019. This is nearly double the value that we were projecting when we discussed this item at Investor Day. As another example, we've identified the opportunity to change the FCC catalyst formulation at the Los Angeles refinery, which should be worth tens of millions of dollars annually. The successes that we had in the fourth quarter of 2018 and our detailed implementation plan give us confidence in the increased synergy potential that we announced at our recent Investor Day. With that, let me turn the call over to Tim, who will provide a walk-through of our financial results.
Timothy Griffith: Thanks, Don. Slide 6 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. For the fourth quarter of 2018, MPC reported earnings of $1.35 per diluted share compared to $4.09 per diluted share last year. As Gary referenced fourth quarter earnings were reduced by $1.06 per diluted share or $745 million due to purchase accounting related inventory effects, expenses associated with the Andeavor combination and MPLX debt extinguishment costs. As a reminder, fourth quarter 2017 earnings included a benefit of approximately $1.5 billion or $3.04 per diluted share resulting from a change in the corporate tax rate at the end of 2017. Additionally, the transaction and our mix of earnings drove a higher income tax rate impact for the quarter. Going forward, we expect the effective tax rate to be around 22%. Slide 7 provides some additional details on the items, which impacted our results in the quarter and where they reflected on the income statement. Refining and marketing segment results include estimated costs of $759 million, reflecting the difference between recording acquired inventory at fair value on the closing date of the acquisition under purchase accounting and the cost used to value inventory at year-end. The effect was magnified as crude prices were rising into the end of the third quarter and subsequently fell rapidly through the fourth quarter. We also incurred $183 million of transaction related costs, including financial advisor fees, employee severance and other costs in connection with the Andeavor acquisition which are reflected in items not allocated to segments in the quarter. Lastly, MPLX redeemed all of $750 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.5% senior notes due in 2023, which resulted in $60 million of debt extinguishment costs, which were reflected in interest expense for the quarter. Combined total of these items had an impact of a $1.06 per diluted share in the quarter. The bridge on Slide 8 shows the change in earnings by segment over the fourth quarter last year. Fourth quarter 2017 results included a benefit of approximately $1.5 billion related to the change in corporate tax rates. Refining and marketing increased by $191 million versus last year, driven by the addition of the Andeavor operations and significantly wider sweet and sour differentials in the quarter. These benefits were reduced by the $759 million negative purchase accounting effect that I just discussed and approximately $231 million of incremental costs driven by the February 1 dropdown transaction as we don't reflect the impact of these drops in prior period results. Midstream's $546 million favorable variance was driven by higher MPLX income and contributions of $230 million from Andeavor logistics. Retail's fourth quarter results were $465 million higher than the same quarter last year primarily related to fuel margins and the addition of Andeavor's retail and direct dealer operations. The unfavorable year-over-year variance in items not allocated to segments was largely due to the $183 million of transaction related costs associated with the Andeavor acquisition and the absence of a $57 million litigation gain we recognized in the fourth quarter last year. The balance of the increase largely reflects higher corporate costs and expenses for the combined company. Interest and financing costs were $176 million higher during the fourth quarter this year due to the combined debt balances as a result of the Andeavor transaction, additional MPLX debt compared to last year along with the $60 million of debt extinguishment costs in the quarter. Higher earnings in MPLX and the addition of Andeavor logistics resulted in an increased allocation of midstream earnings to the publicly held units in the respective partnerships shown here as $135 million variance in non-controlling interests. Turning to Slide 9, our Refining & Marketing segment reported earnings of $923 million in the 4th quarter of 2018, compared to $732 million in the same quarter last year. The addition of the Andeavor refining and marketing system drove significantly higher throughput positively impacting segment results. Volume effects are shown as shaded bars on each of the relevant steps of the walk and largely reflect this impact. The US Gulf Coast, Chicago and West Coast blended industry 3-2-1 crack spread was $9.43 in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $10.83 in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our ability to take advantage of wide crude differentials provided significant benefits in the quarter. Our sour differential increased from $4.43 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $9.14 per barrel in 2018. While our sweet differential increased from $1.13 per barrel in the fourth quarter of last year to $6.52 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2018. The $330 million negative variance in other margin reflects the inventory purchase accounting effects discussed partially offset by favorable impacts from strong product margins, feedstock costs relative to the market metrics and higher refining volumetric gains. Direct operating costs for the fourth quarter were $7.92 per barrel compared with $7.21 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2017. The higher costs associated with over 1 million barrels per day of additional throughput were the primary drivers of the $924 million unfavorable impact to segment earnings. The $755 million unfavorable variance in other R&M expenses is primarily due to the fees paid to MPLX for the businesses that were dropped in February, as well as additional expenses related to the legacy Andeavor business. Slide 10 provides the Midstream segment results for the fourth quarter. Segment income was $889 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $343 million in the same period in 2017. MPLX income was up $331 million, primarily due to the drop of refining logistics and fuels distribution services as well as record pipeline throughputs and higher gathered process and fractionated volumes in the quarter. Andeavor logistics also added an incremental $230 million of income for the fourth quarter. We encourage you to listen to MPLX earnings call at 11 and ANDX's earnings call at 1 to hear more about the performance of the partnerships. Slide 11 provides an overview of the retail segment, which now includes our legacy Speedway business, and Andeavor's retail and direct dealer business. Fourth quarter segment income from operations was $613 million, compared to the $148 million of legacy Speedway only results in the fourth quarter last year. The $465 million increase in year-over-year segment results was primarily driven by the addition of Andeavor's operations along with higher merchandise sales and fuel margins across the nationwide footprint. The $204 million volume impact on the walk and the $193 million increase in operating expenses and $47 million of increased depreciation expense were almost entirely attributed to the addition of the Andeavor operations. The improvement in merchandise and fuel margins was largely related to the expanded business as well as the margin strength across the entire retail platform as well as higher same-store merchandise sales for the Speedway legacy locations. The month of January started off with positive same-store gasoline sales, but was impacted by record low temperatures in a substantial portion of our marketing area. January gasoline same-store sales in our legacy Speedway locations were down 1.5%, but we're optimistic volumes will normalize following the weather impacts. Slide 12 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.7 billion. Core operating cash flow before change in working capital was a $2.3 billion source of cash in the quarter. Working capital was a $457 million source of cash in the quarter, largely due to an adjustment for a purchase accounting related inventory effects, partially offset by the negative impacts of falling commodity prices during the quarter. We used approximately $3.4 billion of cash during the fourth quarter to fund the Andeavor and Express Mart acquisitions net of cash acquired. Return of capital by way of share repurchase and dividends totaled almost $1 billion in the quarter with $675 million worth of shares reacquired during the quarter. Looking forward, we remain committed to our disciplined strategy and returning capital beyond the needs of the business through continued share repurchases and regular dividends. We expect to return at least 50% of discretionary free cash flow to shareholders over the long term. Slide 13 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the fourth quarter. We had approximately $27.5 billion of total consolidated debt, including $13.4 billion of debt at MPLX and $5 billion of debt at ANDX. Total debt represented 2.5X last 12 months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis, or 1.3X EBITDA, excluding the debt and EBITDA of MPLX and ANDX, lower yet if the distributions from MPLX and ANDX are added to the debt service capabilities of the business. Slide 14 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the first quarter of 2019. We're expecting total throughput volumes of just under 3 million barrels per day with minimal planned maintenance taking place across our 16-plant system. Our average total direct operating costs is projected to be $8.20 per barrel and our corporate and other unallocated items are projected to be $230 million for the quarter, excluding any additional transaction related costs. With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.
Kristina Kazarian: Thanks, Tim. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we'll re-prompt for additional questions. With that, we'll now open the call to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question today is from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.
NeilMehta: Hey, thank you very much and congrats on a great quarter here. So, Gary, to kick off on the gasoline market, you made a point that Speedway same-store sales were down 1.5%, it sounds like some of that is weather related, but we've been surprised at how elevated gasoline inventories have been to start the year. So just your thoughts on whether this is seasonal or we can work our way through it. What the root cause of the issue is and what the fix is?
GaryHeminger: Sure. And that's a great question, Neil. And if you look at Speedway same-store sales, I think the majority of this is a result of the weather we've had. But on the counter to that, the weather in the refining system, especially in PADD II and in PADD IV, the Polar Vortex has really had an effect on the industry, not just Marathon, but the industry refining system. We expect, and you're not seeing it in the numbers yet, Neil, you'll see it over the next couple of weeks. But if you look at the number of refineries that have had some sort of maintenance issues, not turnaround, just maintenance issues due to the Polar Vortex, we think probably 6 million to 7 million barrels of gasoline and distillate come out of the refining system here in the month of February. Back to the first part of your question on, is the inventory is -- are we in a cycle and, we always build inventory in the first quarter to get ready for the summer grade gasoline. And so as we deplete the gasoline inventory of the winter grade, we have all the tankage and logistics setup to be able to start inventorying that gasoline. But I think the most important thing and then the number I gave you, 6 million to 7 million, that is above and beyond whatever turnarounds. It appears as though the turnarounds within the industry are going to be a little bit later in the first quarter this year, than has been normal, which I think will have an effect on gasoline inventories as well, as you know, distillate inventories are in very good shape. And, yes, we're at the top end of the four-year average if you look at that or the 5-year average, whichever one you pay attention to, we're at the top end of that, but you're going to see inventories decline. I would say rapidly because of some of the issues the industry has had, and you're going to see a later turnaround -- or later first quarter turnarounds than normal.
NeilMehta: I appreciate that Gary, and the follow-up is around capital returns, in a scenario where 2019 is tougher than you anticipate, maybe below trend because of differentials or because of gasoline markets. How committed are you to capital returns and share repurchase? In other words, should we think that the buyback commitment as a ratable number and any thoughts around the -- how aggressive you intend to be around capital returns would be helpful?
TimothyGriffith: Sure. Neil, its Tim, I think, the cap returns are going to continue to be a critical part of the overall capital allocation strategy we've got, I mean, as we laid out at Investor Day and I reinforced here this morning, we expect that we're going to be returning at least half of discretionary free cash flow through dividends, distributions from the MLPs and share purchases. And that's a commitment that we will stay with. So, I mean, certainly to the extent that there is softness in the space, things could adjust, but I don't think there's anything that changes our outlook at this point.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan Chase.
PhilGresh: Hi, good morning. Gary, first question, I'm just thinking about this first pro forma quarter that you guys logged $4 billion plus of EBITDA, so call it $16 billion plus annualized versus your guidance for 2019 of $12.9 billion, you obviously had some pretty nice tailwinds and differentials here that you called out in the bridges in your prepared remarks. But just any latest thoughts on this guidance now that you've got a quarter under your belt?
GaryHeminger: Well, it would be very nice if you could annualize things based off the fourth quarter. But as you know, the fourth quarter had some very key attributes that were a benefit to us with the drop in crude price which allowed a higher capture margin than that is normal. But I would say we're very optimistic on what we presented at Analyst Day, Neil's question that he just posed about EBITDA and share buybacks going so far, what happens if it is more of a sluggish year than we had anticipated, but we still are very bullish on the year, in fact, I think, Phil you had written some things earlier about gasoline as kind of an associated byproduct, I think you used that term, we believe, especially and unfortunately what has happened here with the Polar Vertex that has taken a number of systems down and as you build those systems back up, it's going to clean up the inventory in the system. But I think, we're going to get into the second quarter and very likely see should you be max gasoline or should be max distillate and I would anticipate will be distillate, but I think you could see that scenario and then as we go out into the second part of the year, you're going to see, I think the effects of the ultra low-sulfur diesel start to kick in the marketplace. So we feel very bullish about what we presented on our Analyst Day of $12.9 billion as you suggested, and we'll see where the balance of the year takes us.
PhilGresh: Thanks for the color, Gary. I guess my second question just to focus a bit more on the differentials side of things, hoping for your latest thoughts, both on the light-heavy differentials, in light of the Venezuela sanctions, but also even just the light inland differentials versus coastal (inaudible) obviously the Capline reversal. Do you think we might see a tightening of inland differentials as all these pipelines come up?
GaryHeminger: Let me ask Rick to talk about the crude markets.
RickHessling: Yes, hi, Phil, Rick Hessling. Good question. As we look at all the new pipelines that are slated or rumored to come online. If you look, there is a large majority of them that are looking to point to the Eastern Gulf Coast. So from our vantage point that's a positive to MPC as you all know, we have Garyville on the Eastern Gulf Coast with a large appetite for both sweets and heavies and when we look at the differentials, we see it as a positive. We will get pipeline connectivity to advantage barrels -- WTI advantage barrels as well as Canadian heavy and light in time. So we actually view the connectivity as a win for us and we are bullish production and the basins where that product -- where that crude oil will be coming from. So for us, it's a big plus.
PhilGresh: Any thoughts on light-heavy?
RickHessling: I think you're going to continue to see pressures on light-heavies as we are today. We're in a zone where obviously because of sanctions, because of the stance that OPEC has taken, the medium sours, the heavies, they are commanding a premium. We continue to see that and I guess to tag on to that, when you look at what the sanctions, speaking of Venezuela, what they have done and I think it's been very well documented in the press that we stepped away from those barrels quite a while ago quite frankly. So from a supply perspective, we're not exposed one bit whatsoever. We see those replacement barrels being AG barrels, Arabian Gulf barrels, as well as predominantly Latin American barrels. So it will continue to stay tight, but I would tell you with our added flexibility between the US Eastern Gulf Coast and the US Eastern West Coast and our West Coast facilities, our flexibility, I think as Don touched on earlier with synergies really, this plays into our hand more so than anyone in the industry that we can optimize between those plants, between grades and really drive the most value for our shareholders.
GaryHeminger: And Phil, let me ask Ray to mention here a second that even though heavies and medium sours are more expensive, we are not slacking our cokers whatsoever. Ray, you want to speak to that?
RaymondBrooks: Yes, sure Gary. Even though the heavy depths have tightened in a bit, we never met a heavy unit that we didn't like to fill. So our cokers have resid hydrocrackers or deasphalting units. We're still running those out and capturing the differentials that are out there, the balance of the crude slate, Rick goes out and his team and get us the best mix take that he can. So today we're running about 50-50 across our slate, about 50% sours, 50% sweet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Chan from Barclays Capital.
PaulChan: Hey guys, good morning. Gary, maybe that's for Rick entry on that. You currently that in the first quarter you are estimating 48% in sweet and 52% in sour and given the light-heavy defense always --, as you may see for some time, is that we should take it as the maximum flexibility you have or that you actually have more ability to swing it more to the sweets if this kind of market condition persists. And similarly, that should we look at your system and saying that your gasoline, you already maxed out in your distillate yields, so you can't really shift anymore between the gasoline and distillate comparing to what you currently have been doing?
GaryHeminger: I'm glad you asked that question, Paul, because we want to get those across to the investors very carefully. Ray, you want to take that?
RaymondBrooks: Sure, yes, a couple of questions, the first as far as the sweet/sour split and I mentioned that we're roughly 50/50 here today. We have capability and historically we've said that we're two-thirds, one-third, that we could go either way. Now with our new system with 16 plants, it's a little bit different. We can go up to 70% sweet and so we have a little bit more flexibility on the sweet side, but Paul, day in and day out, we're running our LP models at all 16 plants and we're working with Rick's team to bring the crude slate that's going to make us the most profitable across the whole system, and right now, that's where we're laying at about 50/50 percent on that. The second, the second question had as far as distillate production, we're right now distillate production about 40% -- 41% of crude for our distillate. We absolutely have everything within our control pointed to distillate production if things would change and we'd want to go to a max gasoline mode. We have up to about 10% with cut point swing streams that we could direct back into the gasoline pool.
PaulChan: Ray, I'm actually talking about the other way. Can you increase the distillate yield and reduce the gasoline further from here, not, I mean, of course that when you take out butane in the summer grade, you will reduce the gasoline yield, but other than that, is there any other flexibility that you swing even if you want to, that you can swing even more to distillate and lesser into gasoline?
RaymondBrooks: Gary would be pretty mad at me if we weren't already doing that, Paul. We've got everything pointed to the distillate pool that we can and out of the gasoline pool. Now, I'm going to take a little flip on that from the standpoint of, you're trying to say swing from gasoline to swing to diesel, the other knot that you have is less gasoline and again we take gasoline production. Again, we take -- we take our notes from what the market gives us and we saw about a month ago -- we saw the incentive that, hey, we should cut our cat crackers and, A, not buy outside gas oil for some of our cat crackers and, B, sell some gas oil where we have the opportunity and we did that when the gas oil -- sweet gas oil price was about $0.15 over the 70/30 split, we made those moves and then as economics changed, then we changed our operations accordingly. So that's not a shift from gasoline to diesel, but that was just looking at the pure economics of gasoline.
PaulChan: Thank you, Ray. And the second question, a quick one. Gary, any update about Capline reversal?
GaryHeminger: Yes, let me have Mike Hennigan cover that please.
MikeHennigan: Hi, Paul, it's Mike. So we launched a binding open season that will run through April of this year -- April 30 of this year. Our expectation is to have the line available for service September 2020. So we're in the process of purging the line, we have to do some integrity work, some pump work, et cetera. Obviously, we want to see the results of the open season and then about 18 months of construction to get out to around September. Why we're excited about it, Paul? I would tell you Ozark connects there, DAPL connects there, the Canadian system connects, we're also talking about a connection with Diamond pipeline. So getting barrels to the Eastern Gulf I think is going to be a real good opportunity for us, as soon as we get the system going.
PaulChan: Mike, are you concerned about depleting too much of the barrel at Patoka?
MikeHennigan: No, Paul, I think in the short term, there are some limitations on Canadian barrels getting into Patoka, but we think that will solve itself over time. And in the meantime, I think you're going to see some more things that people will look at, I mean we're going to look at as you know we already expanded Ozark ourselves. We're going to look at, can we do a little bit more there. That's another opportunity for Cushing barrels to get up into that area. We're anticipating some more expansion now in the Bakken region as well. So I think you're going to see more flow into the Patoka area, which should be a source of supply for Capline.
RickHessling: Yes, Paul, this is Rick, just to tag on to what Mike said. So when you look at both the Enbridge System and Keystone XL and the timing of their potential -- or their potential increases in capacity, it really lines out well with bringing an incremental barrel into Patoka to take down Capline.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Manav Gupta from Credit Suisse - North America.
ManavGupta: Hi, guys, can you talk a little bit about the retail here like MPC was doing $180 million to $200 million in run rate, Andeavor was doing $170 million to $190 million, you put those two together, that's $400 million, but you did $613 million in retail earnings alone. So I understand the weaker crude would have helped, but the results are stellar regardless, so what's driving these retail earnings besides the weaker crude?
GaryHeminger: Right, Manav. First of all, let me compliment you, you are the first out this morning with your analysis and I thought you did a good job on your quick outlook. The retail, Tony and his team had a phenomenal year -- a phenomenal fourth quarter. As you know, the year started off a little bit slow, but we saw a ramp up in merchandise sales, a ramp up in merchandise margin, but really for the most part, it was the volume through now total Speedway that we were able to capture very strong margins and across the entire sector of Speedway as well as a direct retail part of our business was very strong for the quarter. As we look going forward, and this is one of the real bright spots, when Greg and I worked on putting these companies together, one of the real bright spots was the retail side that we thought through synergies and through our marketing ability and I talked earlier about a 70% of our volume is going to our retail chains either the Speedway side or the Marathon brand or direct retail and that I think helps prop up the refining side, it helps prop up the retail side, and while we had very strong margins in the 4th quarter, I wouldn't expect them to continue at that high of a rate. But as I look through the first part of the year, we continue to perform very well across the entire retail sector.
ManavGupta: Gary, a quick follow up. We remember when you acquired Hess, you gave out a synergy target for three years, but you literally got there in one year. And now today you are indicating that $160 million in synergies in one quarter and reiterated $600 million for next year, but the way we are looking at it, the way R&M business is going and the retail business is going, it looks easy like $800 million to $900 million at least. So are you just being very conservative there again for the second time?
GaryHeminger: Well, you're being very kind Manav, but I would look at retail and we've had this discussion -- I had this discussion on Analyst Day, the synergy walk that you're going to see with this transaction is a bit different than other synergy walks. Lot of times you'll see synergies upfront and then a very long and slow tail, if you will, of synergies. Whereas these synergies are going to be more of a stair-step going forward, and the stair-step, I mean, we've already done -- Don talked about 170 stores that we have already re-ID'd and Minnesota. We're now in Southwest Texas, we are going to start in Arizona here soon, and New Mexico of re-ID'ing and developing those stores into the Speedway mark. So I was in Arizona last week and had a full market tour and there's so many opportunities there that I can -- I am holding my breath that we can get going as soon as possible. But then it is going to take a little bit longer as we go into California and some of the other western states to get things permitted. So you're going to see more of a stair-step, and I would say year two is even going to have higher synergies and year three higher synergies than the Hess model. The Hess model, we were able to get in about 18 to 24 months to get everything re-ID'ed and get tremendous synergy more on the inside of the store. Here we have to take and go and completely redo the stores to get those into the Speedway type of operations. But, yes, we are very bullish on the synergies that are there. I do believe that there can be some upside in the retail synergies and stay tuned.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
DougLeggate: Thanks, good morning everyone. Gary, I appreciate. We always appreciate your comments on the macro, but obviously a reasonable amount of focus on gasoline this morning. I wonder if I could challenge you a little bit on--whether there actually have been some structural changes and what I'm thinking is, the US is obviously running the latest ever API slate at least according to the EIA, that obviously has ramifications for gasoline yields and obviously utilization has been incentivized by crude spread. So I guess my question is, do you think that's a valid reason why we've seen so much gasoline, both productions on inventories, in which case, should we expect the industry and Marathon in particular to see maximum distillate as perhaps a new normal through the cycle as opposed to seasonally?
GaryHeminger: Well, just because of the crude differentials in the fourth quarter -- well third and fourth quarter that led people to run -- want to run more sweet. You're correct, Doug. But I would say the reason the inventories are high is everybody ran at very, very high utilizations because the differentials allowed you to do that, even though you built some inventory, which if you were on the call earlier, I think you're going to see over the next few weeks here as the EIA numbers start to come out, you're going to see a decline in gasoline inventories due to some of the operational issues caused by the weather. Don, you want to add more to this?
DonaldTemplin: Yes, I guess, Doug, if we think about particularly, you saw in the Gulf Coast, we had record exports and so. Our view is, Ray said, we're at 40% or so diesel production, that's kind of max diesel for us and we'll continue to do that. But we're really well situated from a perspective of if there is a better market -- a higher value market for the products that we're producing; we're taking advantage of that, either through the West Coast exports or through the Gulf Coast. And that's what we saw in December and the fourth quarter. I think December was 485,000 barrels a day of exports, and for the fourth quarter, I think, it was just slightly under that number and about 300,000 to 390,000 of that came out of the Gulf Coast. So we were very focused on delivering to markets where we thought there was incremental value.
DougLeggate: I know it's not easy one to answer. So thank you for that. My follow-up is a quick one, Don, it's probably also for you. You said in your prepared remarks, the synergies, not all of the Q4 synergies will be recurring, so can you give us an idea of what the annualized recurring synergies stand at right now relative to the $600 million guidance and I'll leave it there. Thank you.
DonaldTemplin: Yes. So thanks, Doug. And I was -- I wanted to get in on the last call -- or the last question as well. So if you look at our $160 million of realized synergies in the fourth quarter, a little over $100 million of it came from our crude oil supply and logistics. And that piece of it is really comprised of sort of two pieces, one is incremental volume that we're able to get through optimizing pipeline space and those type of things. And then the other piece of it is the differentials as well. As you know, the fourth quarter differentials were incredibly wide particularly around Canadian crude. And so when I'm saying it's non-recurring, the volume piece of it is recurring. The differential piece will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. Another example, Doug, would be on the turnaround. So we talked about the turnaround in St. Paul Park and Martinez, we are going to have turnaround opportunities annually but we won't always have them every quarter. So in the fourth quarter, there was a turnaround and we were able to capture that. The timing of capturing synergies around turnarounds in 2019 will be different than the timing of capturing synergies or turnaround synergies in 2018. So I think we feel very -- our original base plan was $480 million run rate, which implies $40 million a month exiting 2019. I think we feel very comfortable that we'll be above that number exiting 2019.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.
RogerRead: Sorry. Good morning. Hopefully you can hear me there. Actually, I'd like to come back real quick on the gasoline thing; I'm with you that it seems to be more higher volumes. If you look at gasoline yields from the weekly DOE data, we're down from a year ago and we're about where we've been the last, say, five-year average. So it looks like higher throughputs, and maybe Gary, if you could give us a little more detail on your thoughts about the weather impacts and how persistent the problems from that maybe, I know you talked about kind of, I think it was a 6 million to 7 million barrel product loss. But do you see that is strictly the PADD II area or is that something nationwide?
GaryHeminger: The numbers I gave you were more probably PADD II, PADD III -- excuse me PADD II and PADD IV. And I would say that another way to look at this, Roger, I should've mentioned this earlier, that because this is really a precursor to I think the inventories coming. Look at the way gasoline crack spreads have gone in the last 7 days, they're up about $7, $8 a barrel from where they were just a week to 10 days ago, and that's because of the market having to rebalance, to take care of these shortages. So you clearly are going to see this inventory come down and come more into balance here in the next few weeks. And the best metric to look at is where the gas crack in PADD II is and PADD IV today and you've seen that they've come up substantially over the last seven to 10 days.
RogerRead: Yes, it's funny how that seems to happen every year.
GaryHeminger: Yes.
RogerRead: If we could follow-up on Manav's questions about the retail side and the process of switching the MSOs over, should we look at this as a more CapEx intensive approach than say the Hess merger was as we think about switching stores over or is this a fairly straightforward re-branding that isn't too high on the CapEx side, just trying to think about what other changes need to be made and it's quite a different system, and then if I could tag on just as a separate refining question, if we look at West Coast OpEx, we know it's historically higher, but I was wondering given the moving parts in the quarter, the inventory adjustment, how much of that much higher manufacturing costs was related to that and how much of it is that's a clean number that you want to get down over time?
GaryHeminger: Okay. Roger, I'll take the first one on the retail. We put the numbers out in our Analyst Day in Tony's presentation, he had the capital numbers in there, what it is going to take us to remodel, re-ID the stores. So it's not a big number. It's pretty much in line with where we were on the Hess for the re-ID side and the remodel side as well. So, no, I do not expect it to be any more incremental capital then we already had in the plant, which is not significant to begin with. We're making very good progress on the re-ID front, one of the things we learned from the Hess side is that it is best to remodel at the same time you're doing the re-ID, so you're not back to the store twice. So while it might seem as though we're moving a little slower, we're going to capture I think incremental sales, incremental margins at a faster rate by doing both of those combined. But you should not expect to see any increase in the capital that we have already identified. Ray, you want to talk about the West Coast OpEx?
RaymondBrooks: Sure, West Coast OpEx is definitely something that's high on our radar right now. We're historically used to operating in the US Gulf Coast, Midwest and seeing numbers that are magnitude lower than what we have right now. If we look at our OpEx projection for the first quarter in the West Coast, some of that is driven by, we do have some turnaround activity going on right now at LAR, we have some turnaround in the Wilmington alky that's associated with the LAR project and so that's implied in our OpEx, but in general, we see a real opportunity and an incentive for us to want to bring that down. We talked a little bit about this at Analyst Day when we showed the Galveston Bay performance in the six years that we have had that refinery and that we brought that from a port cortile down to what we view as a midpoint OpEx refinery and we'll utilize the same Galveston Bay play book on the West Coast and look for opportunities to bring those costs down too.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Prashant Rao from Citigroup.
PrashantRao: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to circle back on the synergy detail on the crude supply and logistics, appreciate the split there, the 50/50 between the WCS and the logistics foreign spot, I sort of wanted to drive back to the Western acquisition that's already in the numbers are accounted for on the close, the $365 million. Is there a similar split that we could get or some sort of way of thinking about how much of that was maybe driven by differentials as well so that we can kind of get a sense of to combine what the run rate is going forward?
GregoryGoff: Yes, Prashant, this is Greg Goff, as far as the Western synergies that were quoted in there was through the third quarter. The amount that Don stated with through 3Q 2018, had no impact on differentials, those were -- the synergies were what had been talked about in the past and from corporate synergies, to supply, to refining operations, to the whole basket, and so there was no, nothing to do with the crude differentials.
PrashantRao: Okay, thank you. I think my second question here as we look to in the West Coast now as combined, I kind of wanted to drill down on the dynamics there, maybe some color on how maybe the California assets compared to the Pacific Northwest market and what we're seeing here in 1Q. And maybe a little bit of an update on some of the progress that -- opportunity that might be there as well in terms of anything on the synergy or integration side?
GaryHeminger: Well, Prashant, we're just getting into those refiners. Ray just had a very good discussion on what we see -- the opportunities we see at LAR, that we're going to move up the cost to Martinez and we see opportunities there on the operating expense and operational excellence side of the equation, and then move up to Anacortes as well. Ray, you want to go into some of the things you're looking at Anacortes, anything in Alaska?
RaymondBrooks: Yes, I would just say this will play into our whole synergy playbook, but we're looking at how we can better utilize, better optimize the four refineries on the West Coast; Kenai, Anacortes, Martinez, and LA. Andeavor historically had done a really good job of that. We think there's additional opportunities, I'll say with IMO coming, beginning in the next year to maybe move some of the heavy streams from the -- and I'll say from Kenai, Anacortes down to our LA refineries where we have more processing capabilities. The other thing I'll say relative to Anacortes is that refinery, it's on the West Coast but has a very good crude advantage with the Bakken and being able to bring in unit trains, and so we're really excited about what we've seen thus far with their capability from a crude processing standpoint. Kenai, a little bit smaller of an asset you know at 60,000-ish barrels a day, with more of a limited marketing presence, but we still think there's opportunities within that tool kit within the refinery configuration to optimize that a little bit going forward. As Gary said that we're four months into this, we are spending a lot of time analyzing the assets at each of the refineries and there'll be more to come at more of these earnings call, but I'd say the biggest thing that we're focused on right now is really just making sure, one, we understand the cost structure on the Pacific Coast and, two, we get a game plan how to make that lower.
RickHessling: Yes, Prashant, I'd just -- this is Rick Hessling, I'd like to add just a few comments to that. So from a crude sourcing aspect, it's an incredible synergy to have the Pacific Coast and the West Coast as part of our footprint. We're able to take Canadian now to the West Coast, to the Pacific Coast as well as Ray mentioned Bakken, and this expanded footprint gives us the ultimate flexibility to guide a barrel there, to guide barrel to St. Paul Park or to guide of barrel into PADD II for our four refineries there. And then in addition to that, our foreign purchasing strategy enables us to toggle barrels between the US Gulf Coast to those regions as well. So never before have we had this flexibility and this is as Don stated earlier, a large part of our synergy. So a true advantage for both the West Coast and the Pacific Coast.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey from Mizuho.
PaulSankey: Good morning, everyone. Gary, could I ask you the usual question about Washington please, particularly. My understanding is the Venezuelan sanctions were abrupt and surprise. I was wondering if you thought that they would be, I assume, we believe they'll be lifted if there is change of regime. And secondly, any thoughts that you have about Iran and how that might impact the market because I assume if there's enough oil out there as stated by the administration, the chances are very strict sanctions on Iran later this year and further to that, any other observations you have on the latest situation in Washington? Thank you.
GaryHeminger: Right. And I would say that Venezuela was not a surprise to us. I think the president was very clear in his messaging and administration was very clearly messaging upfront on what might come about. As Rick stated earlier, we were well prepared and had eliminated for the most part a cargo here or there, but eliminated anything from Venezuela in our steady diet. As to Iran, I think you'll continue to see the discussions and sanctions in and around Iran; you're going to continue to see, I would say the same discussions. Probably the thing to keep close eye on though, Paul, as we all read yesterday of how some of the Middle East producers and Russia are looking to kind of have a sub-pact inside of OPEC, that's probably something more important to really keep our eye on what that might mean, on how they're trying to really be able to balance the global crude market.
PaulSankey: Yes, can I just follow up on that, what are your thoughts on the NOPEC, the chance of the NOPEC deal?
GaryHeminger: I think it's too early to tell, I think this, what I just discussed and what's being written in the media a lot about Middle East producers and Russia, they are the powerful producers. I think that will be a much more powerful combination than an OPEC type of an issue.
PaulSankey: Got it, Gary. And then I've got one, left to field one, if you don't mind. We've seen exceptionally strong international earnings from, for example, like -- this quarter given that you've now presumably reached terminal scale in the US, would you consider international expansion for Marathon Petroleum? Thank you.
GaryHeminger: Not at this time, Paul, we have plenty to say grace over here. I've worked through my career, I've worked through those cycles many times and I don't see that that would be on our wish list at this time. End of Q&A
Kristina Kazarian: Perfect. Operator, thank you for everyone for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or would like clarification on topics discussed this morning, we will be available to take your calls. And with that, thank you so much for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Welcome to the MPC Third Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Elan, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is now being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.
Kristina Kazarian: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, Chairman and CEO; Greg Goff, Executive Vice Chairman; Tim Griffith, CFO; Don Templin, President of Refining, Marketing and Supply; Mike Hennigan, President of MPLX; as well as other members of the executive team. We invite you to read the safe harbor statement on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. Now I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks on Slide 3.
Gary Heminger: Thanks, Kristina. Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call. Earlier this morning, we reported another impressive quarter. Our net income attributable to MPC was $737 million, and we were pleased to report adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2 billion for the second quarter in a row. Our refining throughput was strong at slightly north of 2 million barrels per day. This was especially impressive, considering we had both our Detroit and Canton refineries in turnaround during the quarter, both of which were completed on time and under budget. Our integrated business model, together with our team's commercial and operational execution, continue to create opportunities for us to capture value, driving over $1.2 billion of cash from operations, which allowed us to return over $600 million to shareholders in the quarter. During the quarter,, we repurchased $400 million of shares, even though our repurchase ability was limited by the proxy solicitation period. Through the first 9 months of this year, we have returned $3.2 billion of capital to our shareholders and remain committed to our strategy of returning excess cash flow going forward. And we expect to resume our repurchase activity shortly as market and other conditions allow. On October 1, we closed on our transaction with Andeavor. Both sets of shareholders demonstrated overwhelming support as we are now the leading integrated downstream energy company in the U.S. As we look forward, we see extraordinary potential across our nationwide platform, including over $1 billion of annual run rate synergies within the first three years. Over the first few months, our teams will be diligently working on integrating the business, deploying the best practices and aligning the cultures. In just the first month, I'm especially impressed with the enthusiasm and energy of our commercial teams. We are already harvesting synergies and plan to report on our progress regularly, starting in 2019. As we look to the fourth quarter and into 2019, we see a lot of positive market trends for our business. Both global and U.S. economic growth continues. While risk factors and the recent market pullback have been the focal point of news headlines, the fundamentals that underpin distillate demand appears strong. Inventory levels remaining moderate and days of supply are near 5-year lows. We believe current distillate trends, combined with the impact of changing IMO regulations around sulfur content, will support strong distillate demand well into the future, and we are well positioned given the investments we have made in our business over the last decade. As you may recall, MPC now has the highest coking and hydrocracking capacity in the U.S. Despite recently weaker gasoline markets, our integrated business model allows us to both flex our yields to maximize our gasoline-to-distillate ratio as well as take advantage of export opportunities. In October, we exported approximately 370,000 barrels per day. With limited turnarounds as we head into 2019, our refining system has the opportunity to capture what appears to be sustainably wider crude differentials in many of our markets. With Detroit and St. Paul Park now out of turnaround, both plants are poised to harvest these wider WCS differentials. We expect to run approximately 500,000 barrels per day of various Canadian crudes across our new refining system. The differentials across these grades, and in particular WCS, appear to be sustainably wider, given meaningful logistics constraints relative to production levels. As we look at our optionality in crude slate, we see opportunities to maximize usage of WTI-based crudes. With the addition of 400,000 barrels per day of MidCon refining capacity, we now have over 1 million barrels per day that are very well positioned to capture the attractive crude differentials in those markets. We are currently wrapping up our fourth quarter plant turnaround for the Martinez refinery and have some minor maintenance planned at the Robinson refinery. Lastly, as you may have already seen, we announced that we are evaluating the financial business plans of Andeavor Logistics, with the intent to move toward financial policies more consistent with our approach toward MPLX. MPC plans to engage advisers and begin the process of assessing all options for the 2 MLPs, which could include MPLX acquiring ANDX or ANDX acquiring MPLX. Our comments will be limited on this as we work through our evaluation and process, and we will provide an update to investors at the appropriate time. Now let me turn the call over to Don to cover additional highlights for the third quarter and an update on our integration process. Don?
Donald Templin: Thanks, Gary. Turning to Slide 4. We reported third quarter earnings of $737 million and income from operations of $1.4 billion. Refining & Marketing delivered strong results with third quarter segment earnings of $666 million. We operated exceptionally well throughout the quarter and achieved 97% utilization across our refining system, despite having our Canton and Detroit refineries in turnaround during the quarter. Within the Midstream segment, which largely reflects the financial results of MPLX, we reported income from operations of $679 million, driven by strong pipeline throughput volumes as well as record gathered process and fractionated volumes during the third quarter. MPLX announced several new projects during the quarter, including planned investments in two long-haul pipelines as well as the acquisition of a Gulf Coast export terminal in Louisiana. We encourage you to listen in on the MPLX call at 11 a.m. this morning to hear more about MPLX's performance and the opportunities across the business. We would also point you to ANDX's call on November 7, as both partnerships will be part of our Midstream segment going forward. On the retail side, Speedway reported income from operations of $161 million. In the third quarter, gasoline and distillate margins continued to be adversely impacted by rising crude oil prices. In a rising market, there is a delay in our ability to react at The Street, which pressures margins. Our focus continues to be optimizing total gasoline contributions between volume and margin as market conditions adjust. While our third quarter earnings materials do not reflect the results for Andeavor, I would like to provide some key statistics for the quarter, which demonstrate continued strong performance in the legacy business. The legacy Andeavor refining segment had throughput of 1.1 million barrels per day, which was roughly 97% utilization. The Andeavor index was $16.03 per barrel for the quarter with a margin capture rate of 80%. Manufacturing cost was $5.50 per barrel. We look forward to reporting on a consolidated basis starting in the fourth quarter when we think the tremendous benefits to combining these two powerful businesses will be evident. As shown on Slide 5, one of the first tangible signs of integration comes from the retail segment. We immediately started converting the Andeavor company-owned and operated stores to the Speedway brand. At the end of October, roughly 90 sites in the St. Paul and Minneapolis markets have been converted, and we expect to complete approximately 200 sites by the end of 2018. These conversions are an important element in the synergy capture we are driving. We are learning each day, implementing the best practices from each organization, and while the conversions of the Speedway stores are an easy first milestone to point out, we look forward to providing more updates across our refining, midstream and retail organizations at our upcoming Investor Day. With that, let me turn our call over to Tim to provide a more detailed walk-through of the financial results for the third quarter.
Timothy Griffith: Thanks, Don. Slide 6 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. For the third quarter 2018, MPC reported earnings of $1.62 per diluted share compared to $1.77 per diluted share last year. Third quarter 2018 earnings of $1.62 per diluted share included pretax charges of $49 million related to pension settlement and transaction costs or approximately $0.08 per share. The bridge on Slide 7 shows the change in earnings by segment over the third quarter last year. The log shows a decline of $431 million in the Refining & Marketing earnings. Approximately $230 million of the variance was driven by the February 1 dropdown transaction as we don't reflect the impact of these drops in prior period segment results. The remaining variance is driven by lower crack spreads and higher turnaround costs in the quarter. Speedway's third quarter results were lower than the same quarter last year by $47 million, primarily related to lower light product margins and higher operating expenses. The $324 million favorable Midstream variance was due to the February 1 drop of refining logistics and fuels distribution services to MPLX as well as higher pipeline volumes and record gathered process and fractionated volumes compared to last year. The unfavorable year-over-year variance in items not allocated to segments was largely due to transaction costs related to the combination of Andeavor and increased employee benefit costs. Interest and financing costs were $82 million higher during the third quarter of this year due to higher debt levels at MPLX compared to last year and $45 million of pension settlement charges in the quarter. Interest and financing costs were -- I'm sorry, income taxes were a benefit as lower taxable income, combined with lower tax rate, resulted in $193 million lower taxes compared to last year. The higher earnings in MPLX resulted in an increased allocation of MPLX earnings to the publicly held units in the partnership, shown here as $103 million in noncontrolling interest variance. Turning to Slide 8. Our Refining & Marketing segment reported earnings of $666 million in the third quarter of '18 compared to nearly $1.1 billion in the same quarter last year. The LLS-based blended crack spread had $111 million unfavorable impact to segment results, largely due to lower Midwest and Gulf Coast crack spreads. The LLS blended 6-3-2-1 crack spread was $8.03 per barrel in the third quarter of '18 as compared to $8.68 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017, reflecting to some extent the wider cracks experienced during Hurricane Harvey last year. Our ability to take advantage of crude differentials provided substantial benefits in the quarter. The widening sweet/sour differential had a positive effect of approximately $283 million versus last year, with the differential increasing from $5.42 per barrel in the third quarter of '17 to $9.09 per barrel in 2018. The LSS/WTI differential increased to $4.71 per barrel, up from $3.42 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017. This wider differential drove $102 million benefit based on the WTI-linked crude in our slate. Direct operating costs for the third quarter were $6.60 per barrel compared with $6.37 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017, resulting in a $51 million unfavorable impact to segment earnings. The increase was driven by higher turnaround and maintenance spend during the quarter. The $419 million unfavorable variance in other R&M expenses is primarily due to the fees paid to MPLX related to the businesses that were dropped to MPLX in February. Prior period R&M results were not adjusted to reflect these newly constituted businesses. Moving to our other segments. Slide 9 provides the Speedway segment results walk for the third quarter. Segment income from operations was $161 million compared to $208 million in the third quarter last year. The year-over-year decrease in segment results is primarily related to lower light product margins and higher operating expenses. Speedway's gasoline and distillate margin decreased to $0.165 per gallon in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $0.177 per gallon in the third quarter of 2017, primarily due to the effects of rising crude oil prices and the lag effect at the retail level. Same-store merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes, increased by 4.9% in the third quarter of 2018 versus same quarter last year, leading to the $10 million increase in merchandise margin. Operating expenses increased $28 million year-over-year, mainly due to higher labor and benefit costs and depreciation, which was $8 million higher, primarily due to increased investments in the business. For the month of October, we experienced approximately 0.5% increase in same-store gasoline volumes versus last year. Slide 10 provides the Midstream segment results for the third quarter. Segment income was $679 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $355 million for the same period in 2017. The $361 million improvement for MPLX was favorably impacted by $230 million from the earnings of the businesses included in the February 1 dropdown. The rest of the improvement is related to higher pipeline throughput volumes and record gathered, processed and fractionated volumes. As Don referenced, we encourage you to listen in the call at 11 to hear color in MPLX's strong performance in the third quarter. Slide 11 presents the elements of changes in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was nearly $5 billion, including the approximately $3.5 billion necessary to close the Andeavor transaction on October 1. Core operating cash flow before change to working capital was a $1.6 billion source of cash in the quarter. Working capital was a $408 million use of cash in the quarter, largely due to lower volumes of net crude payables, offset to some extent by a net inventory reduction in the quarter.  Return of capital to shareholders by share repurchase and dividends totaled $607 million in the quarter. The $400 million of shares acquired was accomplished despite having a more limited window to repurchase shares, given the pending Andeavor transaction vote in closing. Looking forward, we remain committed to our disciplined capital strategy and returning capital beyond the needs of the business in a manner consistent with maintaining the company's current investment-grade credit profile and expect to resume share repurchase activity consistent with that strategy during the fourth quarter. We plan to provide an update and guidance around capital allocation strategy at the Investor Day in December. Slide 12 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the third quarter. We had approximately $18.5 billion of total consolidated debt, including nearly $13 billion of debt at MPLX. Total debt represented 2.8x last 12 months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis or 1.4x EBITDA excluding the debt and EBITDA of MPLX. Lower [indiscernible] for distributions from MPLX are added to the debt service capabilities of the parent. Moving to Slide 13. We intend to provide fourth quarter and 2019 guidance at our Investor Day in December, and we'll be suspending publication of the market data on our website until then. Given all the moving pieces, we want to provide an update to the company's 2018 capital investment plan to give an illustration of run rate capital spending for the combined business. On a consolidated basis, including the MLPs, we expect to invest roughly $6 billion this year. This combined total remains in line with prior guidance. As you can see on the slide, roughly half of the planned investment will be pursued and funded by MPLX and ANDX directly. We look forward to providing our 2019 capital outlook at our Analyst Day on December 4. We hope you can join us. With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.
Kristina Kazarian: Thanks, Tim. [Operator Instructions].
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is from Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI.
Douglas Terreson: Congratulations on close of the Andeavor transaction. And then first, Gary, in Refining, your turnaround activity was really high in the Midwest this quarter, and it seemed to be abnormally high during 2018 overall as well. And on this point -- my question is, were higher turnarounds by design somewhat, such as the company is prepared to capture benefits during the 2019, 2020 IMO period or other factors at work? And either way, what are the implications or the profile for refinery utilization given the situation over the next couple of years?
Gary Heminger: That's a very good question and kind of top on the charts of what we're working on, Doug. First of all, with the -- in combining the new companies, we are really attempting to smooth out these turnarounds so we don't have a lumpy turnaround schedule in any given period. As I look at what we just completed here, there's some work done at El Paso, St. Paul, Detroit, Canton, and we're just about completing a turnaround at Martinez. But especially when you look at those markets around the MidCon, and as I said in my script earlier, we're now going to have 1 million barrels a day -- a little over 1 million barrels a day of refining capacity in and around the WTI in Cushing-related crudes, which is a significant benefit. And we have all that work behind us, and as I say, we're going to really smooth things out going forward into '19 and '20 and believe that '19 is going to be really kind of a soft year in the turnaround space.
Douglas Terreson: Okay, good. That sounds great for utilization. And then also, Tim talked about share repurchases, and just to clarify, my recollection is that you guys were restricted from purchasing shares for about 2/3 of the quarter. So my question is, is that a good approximation? And second, with cash flows that's derived significantly with the transaction, I want to see if you could provide some more color or the plan for share repurchases for the medium term because it seems like we should see a ramp in that area.
Timothy Griffith: Yes, Doug, it's a good question. The -- you're exactly right that we were precluded during the proxy period from doing share repurchase. So actually, $400 million was a pretty good clip given the periods that we could not be in the market. I think you can expect to see that our approach on this and the return of cash beyond the needs of the business is going to be as steadfast as ever. I mean, a big part of the combination, certainly, was the incremental cash flow provided by the transaction. And as the synergies come online, the business continues to perform, I think the expectation that share repurchase will be an important part of our capital allocation is an appropriate assumption.
Operator: Our next question is from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta: Gary, I want to start off on your comment in your prepared remarks around the 500,000 barrels a day of Canadian crude that you're taking in right now. It's a big number. So can you talk about kind of what the economics of that crude that you're bringing in? I'm sure not all of it is getting the discounted heavier light barrel. And how much of a tailwind you see that being on a go-forward basis? And to frame that out, if you could just talk about your broader views on Western Canadian differentials from here.
Gary Heminger: Sure. I'm going to ask Rick Hessling to get into that in more detail. And as you know, as we visited last week, we talked a little bit about the Canadian as well. And not only are we a very large purchaser of WCS, but we're very large in the Syncrude side, which have had tremendous margins, or I should say, differentials as well. But Rick will give you some more detail.
Rick Hessling: Yes, Neil, it is a very good question. So on the heavy front, as you know, on the WCS side, it's touched $50 under TI; and Syncrude, I think, yesterday touched $32 under. So as Gary mentioned, there's a lot of upside for us. We mentioned our purchases being north of 500,000. We do not share and break down how much is fully discounted and how much isn't. What I can share, though, is that our optionality is significant amongst PADD II, especially when now, when you put in St. Paul Park into the grid, that allows us even more connectivity and optionality to really eke out the most benefit for these advantaged barrels. Going forward, Neil, on discounts, we're bullish. We sit and we see high all-time production in Canada. There are constraints leaving the basin. Rail is limited. Rail is doing slightly over 200 today, and it may get into the 3 to mid-3s in 2019. That certainly will not alleviate the constraints. So we're bullish on the differentials going forward, not only on heavy but light and medium, which we're players in all 3. And really, the relief won't happen, Neil, until you get another big pipeline out of the basin, which, by all accounts, might be lying three and that may be end of 2019 at best.
Neil Mehta: Appreciate all that color. The follow-up is just on synergies. It gets come out saying that you expect at least $1 billion, know that you've only had the Andeavor assets for a couple of weeks at this point. But just want to get your sense of your conviction around achievability of that $1 billion as most of us use some level of a discount to $1 billion, where you think there's potential upside. Sure, we'll get a little more flavor here in a couple of weeks, but any early thoughts?
Gary Heminger: Neil, we're going to give you a lot more flavor at the Analyst Day Meeting. And when I hear that people continue to discount this number, I think we're going to really be able to put that to rest at our Analyst Day Meeting because -- and you're right, we now have 31 days under our belt of operating, but we weren't sitting still in the transition period. We're really working hard at what opportunities we could see. I'm going to ask Don. Don has really led the integration team. I'm going to ask Don to give you some -- just some upfront color on what we're seeing. We're already seeing some synergies above and beyond what we had recognized in our due diligence exercise. But I have -- let Don give you some more color.
Donald Templin: Yes, Neil, we are really positive on the realization of those synergies. You talked about the $1 billion and we had a ramp that had us at like $480 million in year 1, ramping up to the $1 billion. I'm very confident about achievability, not only of the $1 billion but also of the ramp. To give you some examples, we talked a little bit about, in my prepared comments, around the Speedway conversion. You think about sort of crude acquisition, we have 10 refineries and more than 1.1 million barrels of processing capacity in the MidContinent, Midwest and all sorts of logistics assets. And as Rick mentioned, we are seeing optimization of those logistics assets that are helping us achieve those synergies at a faster pace than we'd originally contemplated when we gave you the numbers. On the refined products side, we've had opportunities to place cargoes now. If we have a customer, we can actually place cargoes from either the West Coast or the Gulf Coast, which wasn't an option before we were combined. And then on the refining side, we mentioned -- Gary mentioned, a couple of turnarounds. We were able to leverage at both St. Paul Park and Martinez. We were able to leverage having supplementing the turnaround teams with MPC employees as well as some of our key contractors. And so both of those turnarounds are coming in under budget -- or came in under budget and ahead of schedule. So I think those are sort of 4 tangible examples, retail, crude acquisition, refined product supply and what we're doing on the refining side that give us a lot of confidence about our ability to deliver.
Operator: Our next question is from Paul Cheng from Barclays Capital.
Paul Cheng: Two questions. In the integration or any merger, I think oftentimes people overlook the importance on the back office just some support, how that integration. We have seen many cases that they fell because they didn't do a good job on that. So on that basis that maybe -- I know it's early, but perhaps you guys can give us some idea that how that process has been conduct and what kind of pipeline and [indiscernible] opportunity we are seeing from that. And also that, from that standpoint, will you have the system in place so that you can help us from the outside to track and reconcile your synergy benefit back to the financial result?
Timothy Griffith: Yes, Paul, it's Tim. We certainly take the point that getting back up the systems, pulled together and integrated will be an important part, and I think we've recognized that from the outset. There are a couple of systems integration processes that are still underway within the legacy Andeavor business. We'll continue to get those complete, done right, and we will, in very short order, take up the process of evaluating exactly what the plans would be on the systems side to come into full integration. We are not in a position at this time to give you a time line over what that -- over what time period that will take, but it will be a big focus. I think importantly for the synergies themselves, though, this is not a massive component of the achievement. I mean, there's certainly a small segment of the synergies that will be part of the systems integration, but some of the items that Don mentioned are really the lion's share where those synergies are going to be driven. So it is not a gating item. It is not a critical path on the synergy achievement that we expect to see over time, but we'll clearly stay focused on it as we go in again. The -- with regard to the reporting out, I mean, I think we recognize and expect full well that we are going to be bringing and accounting around the synergies to the market on a regular basis. I mean, we'll -- again, I think we'll share some color at Investor Day and beyond, but we will be building a -- sort of a framework and reporting protocol to share exactly what the progress has been and what the color has been as we go along the way. So this is something that's high in the radar. Whether the systems integrate or not, we'll have the full ability and anticipate reporting out in our progress along the way. So appreciate the question, Paul.
Gary Heminger: So, Paul, let me add on to that. One of the things that we really want investors to understand, and it's what next week having a kind of our top 100 management team men for a full meeting, one of the things you need to recognize in a transaction like this is you need to step back and understand the scale, and you have to have a vision for how big this company has become. And the scale is going to be one of the most important parts, not only to driving synergy but to driving efficiency. And so I really want to -- we're going to strive and we're going to talk about scale a lot with investors. So that's what we're seeing already. And some of the early synergies that we're capturing that we had anticipated is that scale is very, very important. And you get the scale running down the track in the same direction. It could be a very, very positive of that with a lot of momentum behind it. So that's really the point that I want to get across to investors.
Paul Cheng: I totally agree, I mean, that the scale, I think, is going to be phenomenal in your advantage at this point. The second question, if I may, on Speedway. Historically that Marathon, using a one brand strategy, one brand in the retail, one brand in the wholesale or in the [indiscernible] market, and this legacy is multi-brand. And so how exactly that going forward that you guys going to be in the brand strategy? And how fast are you going to move on that?
Gary Heminger: Sure. Well, Paul, as we mentioned, we're already completing the turnaround of the St. Paul, Minnesota and Wisconsin assets from SuperAmerica into Speedway. We expect that to be done by the end of the year. From there, we have crews doing 7 to 8 stores every day. We're able to turn those stores that quick. And that -- when we say turn the store, that's not just putting signs out on the pumps and at the street. That's remerchandising the store and putting your backroom system and the managers, the entire store as well. And from there, we'll get those completed here in December, and then we're going to move to the west and southwest and start probably in the El Paso and Arizona market, starting to rebrand those into Speedway. Now as we go out to Southern California, Northern California, the ARCO brand is a very, very strong brand. We're continuing our analysis. We won't have the crews freed up to be able to go further west until probably mid-'19 to later '19. So we're completing our analysis on what brands we may want to use in that market. As I said, ARCO is a very strong brand. Speedway has a very strong brand and a very strong convenience store merchandising component. And then in addition, as you said, there is a potpourri of many other brands that have been used historically. It is our intent that we're going to whittle this down to either one or maybe a handful of other brands and locations by the time we complete. And then at the same time, the jobber business that you're familiar with that we have branded Marathon, there are a large number of brands that have been used on the jobber dealer side in Andeavor in the past. We will expect to take the majority of those to the Marathon brand over time. Again, it will take us a little while to finish up the analysis as we meet with some of our suppliers and as we meet with our customers as well to determine which brands, but predominant brand going forward on that side of the business will be Marathon.
Operator: Our next question is from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.
Philip Gresh: First question, just wanted to follow up one more time on the crude exposures because you mentioned 1 million barrels a day of advantaged crudes. How do you think about the Bakken exposure for the pro forma company at this point? Obviously, the differentials have widened up quite a bit. I'm just wondering how you think about your advantage access there and then just if you have a view of how much of this is temporary for maintenance versus more structural because of pipeline or real capacity constraints.
Gary Heminger: Yes, Phil, it's a good point. And you recall, when we invested in the Dakota Access Pipeline, it gives us that ability to bring Bakken crude down into our PADD II refineries. It gives us the ability to run it now in some of our MidCon refineries. As you know, Greg and his team have taken Bakken to the west of the rail and other methods of transportation. So we have tremendous optionality, to use Rick's term, on being able to move Bakken around our system. But let me ask Rick to get into the details of what he's seeing and talk about the structure of the market.
Rick Hessling: Yes, Phil, I'm really glad you brought this up. A lot of people want to talk Canadian and want to talk Midland. And really, Bakken is kind of the forgotten basin, if you will, and it's extremely important to us. Yesterday, Beaver Lodge, which is an origin point that feeds DAPL, trade at $14 -- at a $14 differential. So unheard of, by all accounts, every report we hear is that basin is flushed with barrels. Really similar to the Canadian story, Phil, it's flushed with barrels, and there's no way out. And there's no immediate relief, Phil, that we can see. Rail can only do so much. And as we head into winter, you're going to have rail constraints, the difficulties of loading rail out. So we kind of see that's the perfect storm we had in our St. Paul Park refinery now. That gives us, as Gary said, more optionality, connectivity. We have the DAPL Pipeline that feeds barrels to us right into Patoka, where we can go throughout our PADD II system, as well as we can also take their barrels to Southern Access Extension or Ozark. So we have multiple ways of getting barrels to multiple plants, and we're very bullish this differential here going forward.
Philip Gresh: And just to clarify, the Bakken is in the 1 million barrels a day of advantaged crudes that you're speaking to.
Rick Hessling: Yes, correct.
Philip Gresh: Okay. Second question would just be -- this might be a difficult one, but to the extent you can talk a little bit to the Andeavor performance in the quarter, realize you may not be able to give hard financials, but it would be helpful to at least understand since we don't have anything publicly available to us.
Gary Heminger: Sure. Greg, would you like to handle that?
Gregory Goff: Yes, I sure will. It's a good question, Phil. I would say, if I look back at the third quarter, the -- as Don stated, we had refinery utilization right around 97%, ran a little bit more than 1.1 million barrels per day, and we had a strong index for the quarter. The index for the quarter was a little bit more than $16.50 a barrel. We didn't have -- the maintenance that Gary alluded to earlier basically started in October. So we ran, from a refining standpoint, very strong in the quarter. We also successfully continued the Los Angeles project, and the cat cracker in Los Angeles that we intended to shut down is now shut down. And we've begun moving feedstocks through some of the pipelines between the 2 parts of the facility. So that project is on target, and the success there is it positions us well for IMO because, as you're aware, it allows us to run another 40,000 barrels a day or so of distillates over gasoline as the market trades distillate higher than gasoline. The marketing business performed volumes were strong, but like the comments on Speedway with the rising crude price environment, the margins were off a little bit versus our plan but overall results across the system, we had strong volumes. We continue to grow in Mexico when -- we're seeing very good success in Mexico as part of our integrated strategy for the business model. And the logistics business performed extremely well. Kind of touching upon Rick's last comment on the Bakken, we're seeing really strong growth in our crude oil system up in North Dakota. Likewise, the growth and development of the Permian system is continuing to blossom and develop, just like we expected. And with the participation in the Gray Oak Pipeline, it will allow the company to access the crude that we gather from the wellhead and take it into the system however we want to, whether Corpus Christi or other places. And so I would say overall that the business performed very, very well, and it's right on target with very strong financial results.
Gary Heminger: And, Phil, one more thing I'll add to that, and this kind of goes back to the questions on the confidence of being able to capture the synergies. When you look at how well the legacy Andeavor assets performed in the third quarter, how well the MPC assets, even though we had a couple turnarounds, how well we performed in the utilization rates while we had this major transaction going on, I think that illustrates that we can execute on big projects. As we've done in the past with all the big projects we've done over our life over the last 7 years, we execute and we complete big projects on time and usually on or below budget. I think that was represented here in how well both sides performed while we had integration process going on. And that's -- again, it gives us tremendous confidence going forward we'll be able to execute.
Gregory Goff: Yes. And I would just add to that. I know that there have been a few questions on the synergies and how the integration process is going in. I would just offer from my experience of doing this type of stuff that I am extremely confident that what we've identified as opportunities -- because at the end of the day, synergies or ideas and opportunities that people in the organization have come up with and what we identified initially, we've been able to confirm. But it's been very -- it's been interesting and exciting to see the opportunities that happen right out of the starting gate in that. And so from my personal experience and the work that I've been doing, I am extremely confident in what we're doing. And I would reinforce Don's summary of kind of the things that he said, and I just think we're going to have a very robust delivery of synergies over time that will surprise people.
Operator: Our next question is from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.
Roger Read: I guess to keep on with the theme here of crude differentials, crude capture, we've had some other companies on both sides of the border talk about apportionment issues with the pipelines. And I was just curious what you -- or how you think about your deliverability of the Canadian crudes, whether heavy or light, what kind of apportionment issues you may be seeing and whether or not the earlier comments about the advantages around the SPP unit being added helped on that front.
Gary Heminger: Yes, let me ask Rick to take that, Roger.
Rick Hessling: Yes. So, Roger, ultimately, the apportionment that Enbridge has had out of the basin has been pretty consistent, plus or minus 5%. We predicted every month and we usually come in within 1% or 2%. And to be frank, if you look at what the barrels we received in the past with what we receive in current month and what we believe we'll receive going forward, we're very confident with the numbers we've shared to date going forward. So I can't speak to anyone else's view on apportionment, but from our standpoint, it's been relatively consistent and we see it that way going forward.
Roger Read: And along those lines, thinking of the 1 million barrels total, is it fair to say it's probably about around terms 30-70 heavy, light? Or are you closer to -- not exactly but maybe closer to a 50-50 level on that if you go to full flexibility?
Rick Hessling: Yes, it would be closer to 2/3, 1/3, but I would caution you that fluctuates month-to-month. It's really all based on refinery runs, are we looking to run more gas, more diesel, and obviously, the differentials. So I would caution you not to get locked in on a specific percentage because that does fluctuate month-to-month significantly.
Donald Templin: Yes, Roger, that 2/3, 1/3 -- this is Don, that 2/3, 1/3 is really a reference to the Canadian acquisition -- or Canadian crudes that we're acquiring.
Operator: Our next question is from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Douglas Leggate: I hate to hark on about the differentials, but I'm going to do that as well, sorry. So just on -- obviously, Canadian heavy has been particularly weak here, and you guys are ideally positioned to take advantage of that. I'm just curious if you can offer your prognosis as to how you think it plays out as a huge amount of downtime in PADD II comes back online. But more importantly, Gary, your ability to move crudes around your system has been an anchor of the whole strategy you built at Marathon. I'm just wondering, when you look at the opportunities to do something around logistics and moving crudes specifically in the Andeavor network, do you see any obvious advantages? Because I'd like to say Greg had done a pretty good job on that as well. I'm just curious if you see any significant shifts in that 1 million barrels a day across the -- on a proportional basis across the combined company.
Gary Heminger: Well, Doug, I'll give you a narrative that the answer is yes. I'm not going to -- I can't share with you the individual areas that we have already seen that we can capture some additional value because it's a very competitive market there. I shared some -- a few years ago a different system, and it only took 60 days and that evaporated from a competitive standpoint. So I'm not going to get into the details, but yes, we're seeing in and around the Northern Pipeline systems. And when you step back and look at what it costs to rail, to rail out of Canada or to rail out of the Bakken to PADD I, $15, $16 a barrel, and then you back into our MidCon, PADD II, PADD IV systems today, that gives us a tremendous advantage over the next barrel that's trying to move out of that market. So I would just say we've captured very early some additional synergies, commercial synergies that we had not recognized in our initial due diligence, and I'll just leave it at that, Doug.
Douglas Leggate: I assume we can get into some of that detail in December, Gary, hopefully or not.
Gary Heminger: Okay.
Douglas Leggate: Okay. My follow-up, if I may, is just a pickup on a comment that Greg made relating to gasoline, distillate and the whole IMO situation. And I do really just -- hoping for a high-level perspective from whoever you think is best equipped to answer the question. But it seems to us that one of the big question marks is if diesel really does get the spike everyone is expecting. There's a pretty relatively easy fix in terms of cat feed as a low-cost equivalent bunker fuel. I'm just curious if you can offer your perspective as to how that might cap any diesel premium that could evolve as a result of IMO, and I'm obviously thinking specifically about the European market. I'll leave it there.
Gary Heminger: All right. Let's have Ray Brooks, who runs all refining, touch on that, Doug.
Raymond Brooks: Yes. If I understand your question, it plays into sweet gas oil as well as ULSD. And certainly, from our standpoint, we position ourselves really well across our entire 16-plant system to make a whole lot of ULSD. We also have the ability to bring in additional sour gas oil if needed and make sweet gas oil for our system. So is that really what you're getting at?
Douglas Leggate: A huge range of uncertainty and a wide range of expectations out there. What I'm really trying to understand is if gasoline is as weak as it's been, I'm thinking Brent-based tracked European refineries, this is probably the best thing to happen to them in 20 years. But it seems to us that you could cap that upside by swinging cat feed into the bunker fuel market and essentially improving the supply side of what is expected to be a tight supply dynamic. I'm just wondering if you think we're getting that wrong. Is that something you think about as well? And ultimately, what do you think the endgame would be if that was the case?
Raymond Brooks: At this point, none of our plants would have us essentially slacking our cat crackers and then blending that cat feed. Our models going forward see very good opportunities for running our cat crackers. We have taken the opportunity to change our catalyst mix and our cat crackers to swing more toward petrochemicals, but we don't have any forward look that slacks our cat cracker at this point.
Gary Heminger: Yes. Doug, you -- the equipment you have, the processing facilities you have, you absolutely maximize those to the full extent. You may change a little bit of your feedstock, but the way we are set up, whether it's cat feed, whether it's light crude or whether it's heavy crude, we will absolutely maximize the amount of diesel we can make, no matter what feedstocks are available. We will top those facilities out.
Operator: Our next question is from Manav Gupta from Crédit Suisse.
Manav Gupta: Gary, earlier in the year, you were working very closely with Washington to improve the situation on RINs, and looks like some of what you did, plus other steps, have been a big problem solver. Now a lot of people forget that MPC does have retail, but it's still exposed to RINs and -- so was Andeavor. So can you talk a little bit about how this lower RIN prices will be -- quantify how much a benefit it will be to the combined entity, MPC plus Andeavor?
Gary Heminger: You're right, Manav. And in fact, I will go back to Washington again next week to -- I don't know, to chat about this. But our big push has been to have a refresh, if you will, of the renewable fuel standard. And while that has not happened yet, you really step back and say -- and look at the numbers, RINs have gone from $1.25 back in 2016, 2017, down to $0.78 this week. So we have made a tremendous amount of progress. It has to do with lower refinery -- or small refinery exemptions and the accounting of RINs beyond that. So we have had a tremendous improvement in the cost of the RINs. I'll ask Tim to -- if he can answer your question on what that value is. But as I said, we have made a lot of progress. We're not fully where we think the market needs to go and where the administration needs to go as far as fixing this RFS problem, but we're continuing to work on it diligently. Tim, can you answer the question on the value side?
Timothy Griffith: Sure. Manav, you've probably seen and we've, I think, said this on multiple occasions over the last couple of years that we are not believers that RIN costs are -- drive differential profitability within the refining system. I think we are -- we have a pretty convicted view that as RIN prices arise, it gets reflected in the crack, and on a net basis, the system is no better or worse off than where things are at. So I'm not sure we'd highlighted an incremental benefit to the lower RINs costs. It certainly introduces a lot less noise into the market relative to -- so what the real economic cracks are, but we would not identify any natural economic benefit in total to the system related to the lower prices.
Manav Gupta: A very quick follow-up. You're cracking about 3.5 million to 4 million barrels of capacity coming from Permian to the Gulf Coast. What's your outlook for 2021 for light sweet crude on the Gulf Coast? Would the entire MPC's refining system become an advantage system just like the MidCon as all this Permian crude flows into the Gulf Coast?
Gary Heminger: Well, you've just touched on kind of our thesis, what we think is going to play out over time. As we've said in the past, Manav, we can run 70% light slate or 70% medium sour to heavy slate. With all of the light sweet crude that's being exported out of the market and with the number that Middle East producers wanted to continue to have their market share not erode in the Gulf Coast, we believe the medium sour will become kind of the crude de jure because so much light sweet crude is going to be exported, and competitively, the foreign players are not going to want to have to come and compete with that. So we believe that we are very, very well positioned, whether it's an air of life, which kind of has a gravity to more look like Mars, we believe that is going to be a very strong feedstock for us going into the future. And as I said earlier, we have the ability to run tremendous amount of medium sours, heavies, or we can keep it in the light range. The other thing that's so important that -- let me ask Mike Hennigan to just talk a second about the big pipeline projects coming out of the Permian and our strategy. Greg Goff had done the deal on Gray Oak Pipeline. Now we're looking at the Permian to Gulf Coast Pipeline. We're looking at Swordfish, example for the Eastern Gulf. So we have tremendous opportunities there that I think helps our feedstock supply as well. Mike, you want to talk about that strategy?
Michael Hennigan: Sure, Gary. So, Manav, what we've been doing on the logistics side to support MPC's refining system is what we call the Permian to Gulf Coast Pipeline, which will enable Delaware Basin and Midland Basin crudes be originated out in Wink or Crane or Midland and come down into the Houston, Texas City market as well as other markets. But one of the main drivers is the supply to Galveston Bay refinery. We've also expanded the Ozark Pipeline as well as the Wood River to Patoka Pipeline to get Cushing light material up into that area. And as Gary mentioned as well, we're also looking at what the market needs from an overall standpoint as far as exports. And we've talked to -- and we'll talk a little bit more on the later call on the Swordfish Pipeline, which is existing assets that we think is going to be very competitive and connecting that Eastern Gulf system to refineries into the export markets. So we're very attuned to the point that you made about light sweet growth. We're trying to maximize our ability to get that to markets, whether it be the refining systems at MPC or others and also into the export market.
Operator: Our next question is from Prashant Rao from Citigroup.
Prashant Rao: I guess my first one, I wanted to touch on crude sourcing. And I think you guys have touched upon this already on the call, but waterborne crude, particularly, I think, is sort of the other side of the question when you're talking about getting more domestic heavy discounted barrels than light barrels. And so just wanted to get some color on the current market. We've seen Maya differentials come in, maybe the Gulf Coast. Waterborne heavy barrels have been a little bit more difficult, they were in 3Q. So that's -- part one is sort of to ask about that in the Gulf Coast. But then also pro forma for the company if you look at PADD V as well, what we've heard from some other peers that waterborne heavier barrels were maybe a little bit more challenging compared to domestic versus ANS out there. So I wanted to get your thoughts around that, too, and maybe initiatives around sort of managing crude costs sort of more in the medium term pro forma for company in both of those regions.
Gary Heminger: Rick?
Rick Hessling: Yes, this is Rick. So first off, on the Maya piece, Maya has been extremely expensive. Its formula, as you know, follows basically WTS as well as some other domestic grades. So with everything strengthening, Maya has kind of priced itself out of the market. The good news from our front on Maya is we run very little Maya, and we are able to pivot away from Maya and have great optionality to bring in other heavies. On the market tightening, I would agree with that, that it had tightened for a period of time, but I would tell you at this 10 seconds and looking forward, we're seeing a window where the market is now the avails looks good, the economics behind the avails look good, both on heavy and air of gulf crudes as well as Latin American and crudes really throughout the -- throughout and around the globe. So we believe the pinchpoint of the tightness in the market is kind of clearing, and we believe better days are ahead, certainly, with optionality into the Gulf with all waterborne crudes.
Prashant Rao: Okay. And I guess to follow up, so a little bit more specific to the quarter and thinking it carries forward to the end of the year here. When I look at the variance year-on-year, understanding and appreciating the $230 million from MPLX, that's unfavorable. There's still $190 million or so in that minus $419 million negative variance in the other category. I know that's a mix of things. But just wanted to get a sense of if there's anything -- color you can give on that in the quarter and maybe how we should be thinking about that going forward. Sounds like in general, things are positive and we should see a strong 4Q here given the Canadian heavy barrels' turnaround season is being completed and maybe some better crack realizations. So just wanted to make sure that we're thinking about things right in terms of how we're looking at the cadence Q-on-Q and then maybe into early '19.
Timothy Griffith: Yes, Prashant, it's Tim. The -- that $419 million in other really reflects almost entirely the services being paid to MPLX for the refinery logistics assets and fuels distribution. So that is the lion's share of that delta versus last year. It's probably inappropriate assumption these on a going-forward basis because those are agreements that will be in place for an extended period of time.
Operator: Our next question is from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets.
Bradley Heffern: I'll just skip it to one given we're past the top of the hour here. But I was wondering, Gary, if you could give your thoughts on the E15 year round waiver. And I'm particularly interested in your thoughts from a Speedway standpoint as to whether you see value in having an E15 offering and sort of what your assessment of the long-term demand impact is on gasoline.
Gary Heminger: Okay. I'll just give you a very quick summary. We could talk a long time about this. But probably less than 1% of the stations in America today are offering E15. We have analyzed it in many different ways, and if you look at the -- still the biggest issue is a majority of the vehicles on the road today will not warrant anything greater than E10, unless you have a flex-fueled vehicle. So as we continue to study that, the procedures and implementation processes are not out yet from the EPA on how they would implement this. We question whether or not they really have the authority to grant this E15 waiver year round. Adding incrementally, it's 3 months beyond what's already in the marketplace today. So it's not -- we kind of look at it as being de minimis. However, E85 -- excuse me, E15, the way it's marketed, is at 88 Octane. There will be a number of issues you would have to be able to counter such as misfueling. So we continue to analyze this. We need to see, Brad, what the procedures are that come out from the EPA before we make a final determination. But I think the best thing that has happened throughout all of this, it's kind of been neutral to the overall market, but Brent prices have really continued to decline.
Kristina Kazarian: Sounds great, operator. I think we'll end there. So thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in MPC. Should you have additional questions or would like clarification on any of the topics discussed this morning, we will be available to take your calls. Operator, that's it.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Welcome to the MPC Sterling (00:00:03) Second Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Elon, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.
Kristina A. Kazarian - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum second quarter 2018 earnings webcast and conference call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, Chairman and CEO; Tim Griffith, MPC's Senior Vice President and CFO; Don Templin, President of MPC; Mike Hennigan, President of MPLX; as well as other members of MPC's executive team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. Slide 3 contains additional information related to the proposed transaction with Andeavor. Investors and securityholders are encouraged to read the joint proxy statement and registration statement, as well as other relevant documents filed with the SEC. Now, I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks on slide 4.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thanks, Kristina, and good morning to everyone and thank you for joining our call. Earlier today, we reported an outstanding second quarter. Our income from operations was $1.7 billion and we are pleased to report EBITDA of $2.24 billion, which is the highest quarter since MPC became a public company in 2011. The commodity environment and markets in which we operate were volatile this quarter, but our diversified integrated business model created opportunities and our team executed in capturing those opportunities, which drove these extraordinary results. We often talk about our commitment to creating sustainable long-term value for our shareholders and this quarter was no different. We maintained our focus on operational excellence as well as our disciplined capital strategy, which enabled the return of capital beyond the needs of our business. This quarter, we returned $1.1 billion to our shareholders, including $885 million of share repurchases. As we look to the second half of 2018, we remain very optimistic about the prospects for our business. Global demand remains strong and inventory levels are moderate, despite recently high refining utilization levels across the U.S. Additionally, crude differentials appear sustainably wider in many of our markets. In particular, as we look at our optionality in crude slate, we see opportunities to maximize usage of WTI-linked crude. The WCS market continues to face logistical constraints relative to production growth which we believe should support attractive differentials for our system to capture. We continue to optimize our exports at Galveston Bay and Garyville with the objective of maximizing profitability and we are well-positioned to benefit from the adoption of a little softer international bunker fuel regulations in 2020, given the rigid upgrading investments we have made in our business over the last decade. At the same time, we continue to be very enthusiastic about the combination of Marathon Petroleum and Andeavor into a premier, nationwide integrated downstream energy company. There are tremendous benefits to combining these two powerful businesses which will be well-positioned for long-term growth and shareholder value creation. This combination is expected to generate at least $1 billion of tangible annual gross run rate synergies within the first three years, which is anticipated to drive more than $5 billion of incremental cash generation over the first five years alone. Our team has made significant progress towards completing the combination. We recently announced the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, and have continued to advance the necessary SEC filings, including filing a Second Amendment to our Form S-4 on July 20 to proceed to our shareholder votes. We continue to expect to close the transaction in the second half of 2018. We believe MPC, supported by this great combination with Andeavor, absolutely becomes a must-own refining, marketing, and midstream company. Now, let me turn the call over to Don to cover additional highlights for the second quarter and an update on the integration process. Don?
Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thanks, Gary. Turning to slide 5, we reported second quarter earnings of $1.06 billion and income from operations of $1.71 billion. Refining & Marketing delivered strong results with second quarter segment earnings of $1.03 billion, an increase of nearly $463 million over second quarter 2017. We operated exceptionally well throughout the quarter, with record throughput volumes, and we were able to capture wider crude differentials across our system. Within the Midstream segment, which largely reflects the financial results of MPLX, we reported income from operations of $617 million and achieved record gathered, processed and fractionated volumes, as well as record pipeline throughputs. Our Midstream operations continue to grow, given both their robust organic growth investments, as well as improved utilization of existing assets. While dialogues with investors seem to focus more on one basin versus another, we continue to be encouraged by the growth prospects across all of the regions in which we operate, and in particular, by the continued growth prospects in both the Northeast and the Permian. We encourage you to listen in on the MPLX call at 11:00 AM this morning to hear more about MPLX's performance and the opportunities across the business. On the retail side, Speedway reported income from operations of $159 million. In the second quarter, gasoline and distillate margins were adversely impacted by the overall rise in crude oil. Our focus continues to be optimizing total gasoline contributions between volume and margin as market conditions adjust. We are optimistic about the second half of the year for Speedway, as we are expecting to close on the acquisition of 78 store locations in Syracuse, Rochester, and Buffalo, New York in the third quarter. These stores will enhance our existing network and expand our brand presence in key growth markets. The completion of the pending Andeavor combination will add store location to Speedway's marketing territory, establishing a coast-to-coast presence. With its industry-leading retail position and loyalty program, Speedway is well-situated to expand over this nationwide footprint. As Gary mentioned, we've made significant progress on our proposed transactions from a regulatory standpoint. At the same time, we've also made substantial progress in our integration planning. Since we announced this transaction about 12 weeks ago, we've been focused on day one. Our combined teams have worked diligently to identify key best practices across our organization with the goal of developing a bottoms-up plan to achieve our $1 billion annual run rate gross synergy target. We are currently ahead of our baseline integration plan and expect to be ready to go at close. With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk you through the financial results for the second quarter.
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thanks, Don. Slide 6 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. For the second quarter of 2018, we reported earnings of about $1.1 billion, or $2.27 per diluted share compared to the $0.93 we earned last year. The bridge on slide 7 shows the change in earnings by segment over the second quarter last year. The walk highlights the significant increase in Refining & Marketing as compared to the second quarter of 2017. The $463 million favorable variance was driven by positive Midwest and Gulf Coast crack spreads, as well as wider WCS- and WTI-based crude differentials. Speedway's second quarter results were lower than the second quarter last year by $79 million, primarily related to lower light product margins and higher expenses. The $285 million favorable Midstream variance was primarily due to the recent drop of refining logistics and fuels distribution services to MPLX, as well as record gathered, processed and fractionated volumes and record pipeline throughput volumes. The favorable year-over-year variance in items not allocated to segments includes the absence of $86 million of litigation-related expense recorded in the second quarter of 2017, offset by approximately $10 million of transactions costs recorded in the second quarter of 2018 related to the pending combination with Andeavor. The higher earnings in MPLX, which includes the impacts of the February drop, resulted in $89 million of increased allocation of MPLX earnings to the publicly held units in the partnership, shown here as the noncontrolling interests variance. Turning to slide 8, our Refining & Marketing segment reported earnings of just over $1 billion in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $562 million in the same quarter last year. The LLS-based blended crack spread had a $243 million favorable variance – favorable impact to segment results, largely due to the lower RIN prices and the resulting higher effective crack. The LLS blended 6-3-2-1 crack spread was $6.98 per barrel in the second quarter of 2018 as compared to $5.71 per barrel in the second quarter of 2017. Our ability to take advantage of crude differentials provided substantial benefits in the quarter. The widening sweet/sour differential had a positive effect of approximately $320 million versus last year. The differential increased to $9.46 per barrel in the second quarter of 2018 from $5.48 per barrel in 2017. The LLS/WTI differential increased to $5.12 per barrel, up from $2.03 per barrel in the second quarter of 2017. This wider differential drove a $180 million benefit based on the WTI-linked crudes on our slate. The favorable crude acquisition impacts of approximately $173 million captured in other margin were accentuated by our refinery utilization rate of 99.9% for the quarter, which resulted in a record crude oil throughput of 1.9 million barrels per day, as well as strong volumetric gains in the higher pricing environment. Direct operating costs had a favorable impact of $76 million to segment earnings, mainly due to the absence of costs related to the refining logistics assets that were dropped to MPLX on February 1 and are now reported in the Midstream segment. These benefits were offset by several factors, including the $219 million unfavorable variance in the product component of other margin, driven primarily by less favorable product price realizations versus spot prices used in the benchmark LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread. Also offsetting the benefits was a $385 million unfavorable variance in other R&M expenses, primarily due to the fees paid to MPLX related to the businesses that were dropped to MPLX in February. Prior period R&M results were not adjusted to reflect these newly constituted businesses. Moving to our other segment, slide 9 provides the Speedway segment results walk for the second quarter. Segment income from operations was $159 million, down $79 million from the second quarter of 2017. The year-over-year decrease in segment results was primarily related to lower light product margins and higher expenses. Speedway's gasoline and distillate margin decreased to $0.1645 per gallon in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $0.1835 per gallon in the second quarter of 2017, primarily due to the effects of rising crude oil prices and the lag effect at the retail level. Operating expenses increased $24 million year-over-year due mainly to higher labor and benefit costs, while depreciation was $8 million higher primarily due to increased investment in the business. The $6 million gain on sale of assets recorded in the second quarter of 2017 also contributed to the difference from the second quarter last year. In July, the merchandise sales have started off strong. We've seen a 5.5% increase in same-store merchandise sales compared to last July, while same-store gasoline sales volumes have decreased about 1.8%. Slide 10 provides the Midstream segment results for the second quarter. Segment income was $617 million in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $332 million in the same period of 2017. The $328 million variance for MPLX was favorably impacted by $232 million from the earnings of the businesses included in the February 1 dropdown. The rest of the improvements related to record gathered, processed and fractionated volumes, as well as record pipeline throughput volumes. As Don mentioned, we'd encourage you to look at the MPLX's earnings release and join the update call at 11:00 to get more color on the partnership's great performance in the second quarter. Slide 11 presents the elements of changes in our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was nearly $5 billion, an increase of approximately $346 million from the end of the first quarter. Core operating cash flow before changes to working capital was a $1.8 billion source in the quarter. Working capital was a $544 million source of cash, as higher crude and other payables more than offset a modest inventory build and an increase in receivables for crude oil and refined products in the quarter. Return of capital to shareholders via share repurchase and dividends totaled $1.1 billion in the quarter, including $885 million of share purchases funded primarily by after-tax cash proceeds from the February dropdown. Looking forward, we remain committed to our disciplined capital strategy and returning capital beyond the needs of the business in a manner consistent with maintaining the company's current investment-grade credit profile. Slide 12 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the second quarter. We had approximately $17 billion in total consolidated debt, including nearly $12 billion of debt at MPLX. Total debt represented 2.6 times last 12 months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis, or 1.2 times EBITDA excluding the debt and EBITDA of MPLX. Taking into account the distributions MPC received from MPLX, the same parent level metric was 1 times last 12 months adjusted EBITDA. We believe this parent level including MPLX distributions look is a more useful way to look at MPC's ongoing debt service capabilities, given the importance and stability of MPLX distributions to MPC going forward. This year and over time, the growing MPLX distributions will provide substantial funding to MPC and will continue to be a fundamental component of MPC's discretionary free cash flow. Slide 13 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the third quarter of 2018. We're expecting total throughput volumes of approximately 2 million barrels per day with planned maintenance currently taking place at our Canton refinery and downtime scheduled for the Detroit refinery in September. Total direct operating costs are expected to be $7 per barrel. As a reminder, total direct operating costs now reflect the reduction of costs associated with the drops. We'd expect the net costs related to MPLX fees reflected in the other column of the R&M walk to be approximately $340 million per quarter on a going forward basis. Sour crude is estimated to make up 53% of our crude oil throughput for the third quarter and WTI-priced crude is estimated to be about 32% of the slate. Corporate and other unallocated items are projected to be $85 million prior to any transactions costs related with the Andeavor combination. With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.
Kristina A. Kazarian - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thanks, Tim. As we open the call for questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we'll re-prompt for additional questions. With that, now, we will open the call to questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question today is from Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI.
Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI: Good morning, everybody.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Good morning, Doug. How are you?
Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI: I'm doing fine. So, Gary, the S-4s this month provide financial outlooks for both Marathon and Andeavor calculated several different ways. And when you take the most conservative projections in the document and you add in likely merger costs and benefits, it appears that the combined company has an earnings outlook that's way above the consensus, even though, you appear to be using margin projections that are both flat – or close to flat and well-below the forward curve during 2018 to 2021. So, my question is two-fold. First, is my premise correct on the combined earnings outlook in relation to the Street consensus or is there a more appropriate way to think about that information? And then second, can you confirm that the margin projections that are in the S-4 were utilized to reach those financial projections? In either way, was there a reason that they're conservative, at least in relation to the forward curve, given the fundamental and IMO 2020 outlook? So, two different questions about the S-4 information.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: No. Doug, I think you're looking at it right. And recall, the S-4 is not for guidance, it's really for our business plan, budgeting purposes. And yes, that is – those are the numbers that we used in determining the value of the two companies and for the fairness opinion. So, you know our company very well. We've always been very conservative in how we look at things into the future. And it does not necessarily mean that that is the value that we see, and with the IMO coming on and even with some upside potential in crack spreads. So this is not meant for guidance, this was meant to value the two companies.
Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI: Sure.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: And I would say that based on our outlook – and the other thing, Doug, as you look right now at inventories across the globe, we believe that inventories are in very good shape across the entire globe. And I believe that that's going to lead to upside potential as we get into the third quarter here. And as we then embark on 2019, which we think is where we're really going to start to see the upswing in the IMO effect. So those are not for guidance, those were for valuation purposes. And of course in December, we're going to have a big Analyst Meeting, and we'll get more granular at that time.
Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI: Okay. But it sounds like you're as constructive as ever on the fundamental outlook in refining and the possible positive effects on IMO 2020. Is that a good way to think about it, Gary?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Absolutely, Doug.
Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI: Okay. Okay. Thanks a lot.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, Gary and team.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: How are you, Neil?
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Doing great. So, Gary, just want to get the latest pulse check on the Andeavor transaction. You've been able to spend more time with the assets over the last couple months. What have you learned about the transaction relative to the $1 billion synergy guidance that you outlined? And does the weakness in California refining margins create any pause? Or does the fact that Midland differential, Salt Lake margins are doing well, and typically there's a lot of volatility in California. Does that not really affect the way you think about the intrinsic value of the assets that you're acquiring?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, I'll take the latter part of your question first. You're right. California, just like we've recognized here in the Midwest and the Gulf Coast in the second quarter, can be volatile. But when markets are volatile, if you operate well, have strong operational excellence programs, you can capture the optionality that's available on the marketplace as we just highlighted in the numbers that Tim went over. So, no, it doesn't change our outlook at all. California is going to have, as they would say in England, swings and roundabout. And it'll continue to have that, but we expect that. Of course, El Paso, Salt Lake, as you said, the Mid-Continent continues to be strong, and we would expect that to continue. But going back and looking at the integration and as Don reviewed, I would say, we have the bit in our mouth and we're ready to go with this integration. We have the HSR approval, waiting to finalize the S-4 and – but I've not seen any negatives, I've only seen positives. And we still have to be very careful of front running, and you can't get too detailed until you get the final approvals. But what we have seen to date is very positive, and we're looking at some opportunities just recently that we did not see in the original analysis that we had completed that are certainly upside. So I don't see any negatives from what we've looked at to date, Neil.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks, Gary. And the follow-up is, I always appreciate your views on the macro. And there are two things we've been thinking about a lot lately. For the first is, gasoline, you cited that same-store sales were down 1.8%. And so I don't know if there was some noise in the numbers or that's some indication of price elasticity. But how you see inventories and the demand picture looking? And the other is, WCS, where the differentials have widened out again, recognizing that there's some turnaround activity in the Chicago area coming up. So just any thoughts on those two topics would be appreciated, and I'll leave it there.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Sure. When you look at the Speedway same-store predictor to total gasoline demand, that metric has worked very well in kind of a flat, kind of normal market. I am not alarmed at all by the down 1.8% and that's for – that's month-to-date. In the second quarter, there was some volatility as well. But during that period of time, we've had mainly an up crude market. Recently, crude prices have been off a little bit. But in a very strong, as you say, the price-elastic market in a very accelerated crude market, you're going to deal with Speedway and where we sit trying to get that cost to the Street and being one of the leaders in trying to get that cost to the Street, it's going to cost you some volume. And – but when things simmer out, I look at where margins are on the Street right now and we're really starting to be able to reap the benefits of the position we have in the retail space. So, that doesn't bother me at all. Let me ask Mike to talk about – Mike Palmer to talk about the WCS market.
C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, Phil.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Actually, it's Neil.
C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Oh, is it Neil? Yeah. Sorry, Neil. It's – the WCS outlook continues to be really good. And from a big picture standpoint, basically what's happened is that the Canadian producers have done a nice job of increasing production, but they've outrun the capacity of the pipelines and that's – as you know, that's a difficult thing to change. It's going to take some time before the pipelines come on. In the meantime, I think that they've been working with the rails to try and clear volumes, that's fairly expensive. So, as we look forward, we continue to believe that the outlook for heavy Canadian, which WCS is the proxy for, continues to look very good.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: And Neil let me – to your point, let me add a couple other points. If you look at the U.S. stocks of both gasoline and diesel, gasoline is pretty much right on line with where we were last year, but after a little softer diesel as well as the entire distillate fuel stocks are at the bottom, if not below the five-year average, which I think bodes very, very well for the business going forward. And if you look at the turnarounds that are planned in the Mid-Continent, Mid-West here in Q2 – Q3, and then as we look at the Gulf Coast turnarounds possibly in Q4, I think inventories are going to remain for both gasoline and distillate, inventories are going to remain in check through the year, which bodes very well for the business. But as we look into 2019 and where we believe inventories will end up with the balance of this year, it should put us in a really good position moving into 2019 as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.
Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Hey, Phil.
Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: First question is just – I guess this is kind of an occasion question. As you guys are working intensely on closing the Andeavor acquisition, Gary, would you say that this would preclude you from looking at any other opportunities that might be available? And I'm thinking perhaps on the Midstream side, not necessarily on the refining side, to the extent that there are opportunities in the Midstream market. Would you be looking closely at this?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, I would say, Phil, even though we have a very large transaction going, we don't take our eye off of the entire industry and the entire horizon of what's going on in the marketplace. So, yes, we continue to evaluate almost everything that is available and a lot of things that probably aren't available. So, we will look, I wouldn't say that that means that we're running to the finish line with anything at all.
Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Second question, another capital allocation, I guess for Tim. I was looking at your 10-Q and your buybacks here in the quarter. It looks like you still have $1 billion left on the existing authorization. Your leverage levels look, as you said, well under control. So, I mean, should we be thinking that you'd probably use up the rest of the authorization this year, and you'd start using the incremental $5 billion that you've talked about on a pro forma basis shortly thereafter or how do you think about that?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, Phil, I think the approach is going to be consistent. We are – we've been I think pretty disciplined around the notion that to the extent that we've got cash and capital that are beyond the needs of the business, our inclination is to sort of get that back to shareholders. The authorization numbers that you cite, I think might be a little bit stale. I think we're probably north of $5 billion of authorization from where we sit today, in fact maybe closer to $6 billion. So, again, that authorization was one that we pursued with the board around the time of the announcement just as frankly, because we know that once this business come together, as Don referenced, and I think we're continuing to be feel very good about the incremental cash generation from the combination is going to be substantial. And so, I think a big source of where that cash is going to go is likely going to be back to shareholders and likely in the form of share repurchase. So, I think our approach from here forward frankly is going to remain consistent. There is – there will be a period of time – I think during the solicitation period, we will be precluded from that activity, but I'd call that a blip in the road as opposed to any sort of structural change. So, I think you should expect to see our approach to be very consistent. I think we've sort of – we believe in that commitment to shareholders that to the extent we've got resources beyond the needs of the business, they should be returned, and I think that will continue to be our approach.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yes. Good morning and congrats on the quarter, really well done on the refining side.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thanks, Roger.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Just digging in here, I was wondering, Gary, if we could get a little more commentary, maybe dig just a little bit deeper on kind of the outlook here in the back half? I think Q2 is going to be good across the board. Outlook for Q3, margins are a little weaker, which isn't surprising. Last year's Q3 was great. As you look at the turnaround schedule for the industry, I'm guessing that's what gives you the confidence on the positive inventory outlook as we get towards year-end or is there something else you're seeing as well?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: No. I just looked at where the inventory is situated today, knowing where the turnarounds are in the Mid-Con, Midwest in Q3. They'll start up in probably early-Q4 down to the Gulf Coast. But inventories are in check across the board, and I think – and you're right, last year, the latter part of Q3 was very, very strong due to the dislocations in the market based on the storms that hit the country. Let's hope and pray that we don't have those storms this year, but – so, we are going to be up against some pretty strong numbers from last year. But nevertheless, inventories are in good shape, turnarounds are to be heavier in Mid-Con, Midwest than probably in the Gulf Coast. I think that bodes well especially when you look at, as I said earlier, on the global macro demand picture, I think that puts us in a very good position, puts the industry in a good position.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thanks on that. And then my follow-up in the retail business, you cited higher OpEx specifically called out as an issue. I think it was labor costs mostly. What, if anything, can you do to mitigate that? Is there – is it something when you see price increases on the merchandise side or an expansion of margin there or more automation or is this just – it's a function of the business and that's what everyone is dealing with at this point?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: All right. Tony, you want to take that?
Anthony R. Kenney - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. Sure, Gary. Yeah. That is – actually, on the OpEx side, there's really two components in there. One is the wage inflation that we're experiencing as a result of the low unemployment rates that we're seeing in the country now. And that's just putting competition for that labor at the store level for us, and we're having to move hourly rates up in order to attract that labor. And I think to your question, I think what we're focused on is we look at a number of technology investments that we're making both outside and inside our store to become more efficient, so we can reduce the labor costs or control the labor costs to the point where we're competitive in that regard. And the other factor that's pushing the labor costs too is we continue to add stores to our portfolio. So, in the second quarter alone, we added 15 net stores. So, that's a net of both new and rebuilds less the closing store locations. So, there is more stores in our portfolio. And then, we're also adding more complex stores as we spend money on remodel those stores and add food service, that's going to drive operating costs to perform those functions in a more complex operating environment.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Roger, one of the things that we spoke about back when we talked about the merger with Andeavor is that our labor model and the platform that we've run all of our convenience stores, we're going to be able – in a very short order, be able to transfer and translate that type of technology into the stores when we close Andeavor. It will take some time, but that is one of the key synergies and I think key operating efficiencies that we're going to be able to really transfer into those stores. And that model or that platform that Speedway has, it manages all the inventory, and if you have a technology that can manage inventory, you don't need people counting things, but it manages all inventory in and out of the store, it manages labor, it manages day parts of labor requirements in the store to hit your peak periods. So you're going to be able to see that efficient model as we put it into the Andeavor stores, I think really be able to drive some gains in the retail into the future.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng from Barclays.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Hi, Paul.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Gary, on the integration, you guys already done quite a lot, but of course there's a limitation before you close how you can actually really fully cooperate. So what's the extent that how much you can actually do? And also, have you been able to look at across your IT system, because I mean you'll need good information in order for you to good decision. So how big is the – or that how comparable or incomparable between the two companies? How much work you need to do on those?
Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Paul, this is Don Templin. So I think the integration activities are moving along very well as I said in our comments. And one of the things that we're very focused on is delivering the synergies that we articulated when the combination was announced. We think that's a very important part of the value proposition. And you did rightly point out that there are some limitations on the information that we can look at and the Andeavor folks can look at, because we're still competitors. But one of the things that we're using is we're maximizing to the extent possible cleanroom and clean teams. So we actually are putting information into a data room, having clean teams look at that data, so that on day one – when we go to close day one, in five minutes we can go after synergies. So we feel very good about the progress that we've made. And obviously, when we have full access to information, that will reveal incremental information that will be valuable to all of our management team in terms of running the business. But we feel like we're making good progress and can go after synergies by using this methodology.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Don, have you guys been able to look at the different computer system, IT information and all that or operating system that you guys do. Is it a lot of similarity or there's a really quite big difference and it's going to take some time for the conversion?
Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. So we've been – we've looked at the IT environment. Both companies have invested significantly in IT, because we think that having a strong IT system and excellence around execution is really important. And so we have a plan to – over time, to take our IT systems and to integrate them. But we don't believe that the existing IT platform at Andeavor or the existing platform at MPC will be an impediment to us operating from day one, and that's what our teams are focused on.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Manav Gupta from Credit Suisse.
Manav Gupta - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks, guys. My question is on your page 99, Amendment Number 2, S-4. You have synergy CapEx of $98 million in year-one, $226 million in year-two, and $240 million in year-three, dropping to $0 in year-four. So if you could give us some idea on which projects do you plan to undertake in year-one versus year-two and year-three? And why is the CapEx more backend loaded and not frontend loaded? So basically, why is year-three $240 million and year-one $98 million? Why not the other way around?
Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. So if you look at – this is Don again. If you look at our synergy capture, and we were targeting roughly $0.5 billion in year-one, and that escalates or grows into $1 billion run rate in year-three. So in year-one, if you looked at sort of the components of the synergies that we are anticipating to achieve, a number of them are around cost synergies and synergies around our sourcing and procurement activities. In the backend of the synergies are typically things related to refining and systems – optimizing our system and also optimizing kind of a ramped-in approach around our retail business. So those capital expenditures are very much tailored to the type of synergy that we're expecting to capture. Cost and optimization sort of in year-one, and enhancements to the asset base that we have as we go on into year-two and three.
Manav Gupta - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. My quick follow-up is when I look at Amendment Number 2 versus 1, there are only minor differences. It kind of hints to the fact that the second set of questions that you got were not that exhaustive. Is there a strong possibility that you might not get a third round of questions at all?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. Manav, this is Tim. Again, we'll read the tea leaves the same way you do that that's generally a good sign as the questions decline. I mean, obviously, no telling how the process rolls and it could be that there are some additional questions we get, but I think we feel very good about where we're at in the process. We certainly are eager to hear back from the SEC with regard to the responses that we provided in the Amendment and we'll see. We'll move with all due speed, but I think we're – the signals, and I guess again the signs are generally pretty positive that the list of questions has been getting shorter each time, so.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Good morning, Gary.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Hi, Doug.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Gary, I guess, everybody is really trying to get to the nub of the issue which is, if I may put it this way, to what extent is the $1 billion synergy number would fully matures when you provided that at the time of the deal? Given you've had limited access, obviously, given there's limited things you can say at this point. But I wonder if you could characterize it in terms of how far you think you'd mature the synergy opportunity when ultimately you close the deal?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. To use the word matured, of course, we did as much due diligence as we could do. And again, you know how conservative we are, and in all of the discussions I've had with you, how conservative I am that we're going to put out – forecast the numbers that we're very confident that we're going to be able to achieve and beat. So, we're very confident from what we've – the work we've even done since April 30, very confident in what we have learned, what we continue to see, and I believe that we're going to see more. So, I would say, it's mature. I can't today sit down and delineate by month, but I think that we will have a rapid pace of being able to achieve these synergies. And it's incumbent upon both the Andeavor employees that would become Marathon employees and Marathon employees, we're all in this together and we're going to have a program that – to achieve these synergies, everybody in the company is going to be part of that program on how we attempt to achieve these synergies. But you're going to see us be able to, I think, embark on these very quickly.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I guess what I'm really driving at is the December Analyst Day fair to assume there's probably some upside to your assumptions?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, we have not prepared that schedule yet for the December Analyst Day, but we'll certainly give you more granularity on what we see, at that point in time, we would be through the first phase of transition to be able to I think really, with confidence, talk about some of the key parts of the synergy. But there could be, Doug, but we'll wait and see, but I'm pretty bullish on how – what we're seeing so far.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Blair from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, everyone. In your reported product yields for 2018 year-to-date, you show your refinery is producing a 16% allocation to feedstocks and special products. Could you remind us what goes into this bucket? Is it things like high-sulfur VGO or Vacuum Tower Bottoms? And in an IMO world, do you believe this part of your product slate will be advantaged or disadvantaged or perhaps no impact?
Raymond L. Brooks - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. This is Ray Brooks. Let me take a first stab at that. When you talk about our product slate that we produce, I think you're leading to how much rigid fuel oil do we make and is that going to be problematic in the post-IMO world. We make a little bit of a bunker fuel out of our Galveston Bay refinery. We're looking at ways from an infrastructure standpoint how we, in the next year-and-a-half, can minimize that. So, I don't see that being a huge impact from us. But when you talk about our product slate and I don't know exactly what you're looking at, we've got gasoline, distillate, but then LPG, aromatics, asphalt, coke and pitch products. So, that's a balance of what we're looking at.
Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. I'll follow-up there. A year ago in 2Q 2017, MPC exported 313,000 barrels a day of light products. Could you provide that number for Q1 2018 and Q2 2018 with the breakout of gasoline versus distillate, and offer any sort of comments on what you're seeing in the export markets? It seems like Mexico has been really quite strong this year on all the refinery downtime they've had.
C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. This is Mike Palmer. So, if you look at Q1 of 2018, we were at 265,000 barrels a day of total exports, and that was about 48% gasoline and 51% diesel, just a little bit of asphalt in that number, I think around 1%. And then, in quarter two, we were at 311,000 barrels a day, and that was about 29% gasoline, 67% diesel, and then about 4% other, which again is primarily asphalt I believe, so predominantly light products. The export market continues to be very good for us, and we continue to optimize our product slates. We did see with Mexico – Mexico, as you know, has brought back Salina Cruz, one of their refineries that was down last year. So, that has certainly had an impact on how much gasoline that they are importing. But across the board, I think in Latin America, things still look very good. And as I say, we continue to optimize the sales of our products and will sell into the bulk markets into the pipelines or export or sell to other domestic customers by cargo.
Operator: Thank you.
Kristina A. Kazarian - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: All right. Well, then operator, if we don't have any other questions in the queue, I'd like to thank everyone for their interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have any additional questions or would like clarifications on topics discussed this morning, we'll be available to take your calls. And with that, thank you for joining us this morning.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Welcome to the MPC's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Illan and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Lisa Wilson. Lisa, you may begin.
Lisa Wilson: Thank you, Jason. Welcome to Marathon Petroleum's Corporation fourth quarter 2017 earnings webcast and conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, Chairman and CEO; Don Templin, President; Tim Griffith, MPC's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Hennigan, President MPLX and other members of MPC's executive team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there, as well as in our filings with the SEC. Now, I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks on Slide 3.
Gary Heminger: Thanks Lisa, and good morning, and thank you for joining our call. We issued two press releases today, our usual fourth quarter earnings announcements and one announcing the completion of our previously announced strategic actions. This morning we report a strong results for the quarter and full year. The Midstream and Speedway segments each achieved a record full year performance along with a substantial increase in earnings from the Refining & Marketing segment. I will as Don to cover addition highlights for the fourth quarter and full year results. Before I move to our capital plan, I would like to take a moment to highlight two significant five year milestones for our company. February marks the five year anniversary of our acquisition of Galveston Bay refinery. The accomplishment since this acquisition are impressive. We have dramatically improved the environmental and safety performance of the refinery and advanced operational excellence all while achieving lower operating expenses. For example, we have reduced environmental incidence by approximately 80%, achieved numerous processing records including 33 monthly process unit rate records in 2017 alone and cut unplanned downtime in half. We've also lowered operating expenses nearly 25%. It's also been five years since the formation of MPLX. MPLX has delivered an impressive 20 consecutive quarters of increased cash distributions for unitholders representing a compound annual growth rate of 18.3% over the minimum quarterly distribution established at the partnership's formation. The partnership's asset base and earnings profile have been transformed over this time. In late 2015, the partnership expanded into midstream natural gas business with the addition of MarkWest. Early last year, we announced a strategic action plan to enhance value for our investors which we completed today. As part of this strategic actions, we executed dropdowns to MPLX of assets and services that are projected to generate approximately $1.4 billion of annual EBITDA adding high quality fee based streams to MPLX and further diversify the partnership's earnings. Following the dropdowns, we completed the conversion of MPC's GP economic interest in MPLX into LP units. This conversion provides a clear valuation for MPC's ownership in MPLX. This combined with the elimination of the partnerships IDR burden creates mutual benefits of positions MPLX extraordinarily well to deliver long term sustainable growth for its unitholders including MPC. Earlier this year, we're pleased to see Standard & Poor's recognized MPLX's transformation and strong credit profile by upgrading the partnership's credit rate to BBB plus. Looking forward, this morning we announced our 2018 capital investment plans for both MPC and MPLX. This plan remains focus on strengthening the sustained earnings power of the business through growth and margin enhancing projects as well as expanding our more stable cash flow businesses especially Speedway and MPLX. Our capital plan for MPC for 2018 excluding MPLX is $1.6 billion. This plan spending includes 950 million for Refining & Marketing, 530 million for Speedway and 100 million to support corporate activities and other investments. The Refining & Marketing investment plan includes approximately 400 million of growth capital focused on optimizing the Galveston Bay refinery, upgrading residual fuel oils to higher valued products, maximizing distiller production and expanding life product placement flexibility including exports. With the investments we made in the business, we are well positioned to benefit from the adoption of the low softer international bunker fuel requirement in 2020 commonly referred to as IMO. Our refinery system has de-convergent to pass as well as asphalt production capabilities. We plan to increase our production of ultra-low sulfur diesel and residual upgrading ahead of IMO through future investments which include the optimization of the Galveston Bay refinery which we referred to as the star project, the diesel maximization project in Garyville, and the Garyville Major expansion. We expect to invest $530 million in Speedway, $150 million increase from last year's plan and consistent with our commitment to aggressively grow this business and build up as industry leading position. The significant increase is targeted for construction of new stores as well as remodeling and rebuilding existing locations. MPLX also its capital investment plan for 2018 including $2.2 billion for organic growth and approximately 190 million for maintenance capital. This robust organic growth plan includes addition of eight processing plans representing nearly 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of incremental processing capacity as well as 100,000 barrels per day of additional fractionation capacity and a prolific Marcellus, Utica and Permian basins. The remaining growth capital of the partnership has planned for the development of various crude oil of refine products infrastructure include export capacity expansion at our Galveston Bay refinery. As we started the new year, I also wanted to provide some observations on the macro environment we are expecting in 2018. From a commodity perspective, we are encouraged by a more balanced supply and demand environment which should be supported by crude oil and refined product prices throughout the year. We think that creates a very productive backdrop of refining margins in additional to generating meaningful midstream development opportunities for MPLX. Inventories are more balanced than they have been for several years. On a days of supply basis including exports, December U.S. gasoline inventories were the lowest they have been since 2006 and U.S. distiller inventories were the lowest since 2013. Additionally, the U.S. crude inventory surplus is largely gone. From a crude differential perspective, we expect the brand WTI spread to be volatile but to generally trade a couple of dollars at either side of $5 per barrel. These are based on our view that pipe are pushing to the gulf will be relatively fold and the differential should generally reflect transportation cost and quality differentials although always subject to changes due to domestic operating and geopolitical events. We also expect favorable Canadian crude oil differentials both heavy and light over the course of 2018. We believe that pipelines into the U.S. will be fold and the incremental barrels of Canadian crude will have clear by rail. This should keep every differentials wider in 2018 than we experienced in 2017. We also believe the global endues macro picture remains solid and expect that good underlying economic growth will continue to support strong demand for our products. We expect demand from export markets to remain robust. MPC continues to be well positioned to take advantage of export opportunities of both Galveston Bay and Garyville. In the fourth quarter, we exported 314,000 barrels per day or about 17% of our nameplate capacity. Complementing our outlook for the business is a recent tax reform legislation. The reduction of the corporate tax rate is a catalyst for incremental investment in the business. Additionally, the reduction in the cash burden on MPC and are high confidence in the long term cash generation of the business help support our board's support to increase the regular quarterly dividend by 15% to $0.46 per share earlier this week. During the quarter, we returned 945 million of capital to shareholders including the $750 million of share repurchases and $195 million in dividends. For full year, we returned over $3 billion of capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases which were supported impart our proceeds from the dropdown transactions completed during the year. Since MPC became a separate company in 2011, we have returned over $13 billion to shareholders. Importantly, 3.7 of that 13 billion was in the form of regular quarterly dividends which have grown by 26.5% CAGR since MPC became an independent company. Return of capital to shareholders continued long term investments in the business and maintaining an investment grade credit profile will remain fundamental elements of MPC's capital allocation strategy and will continue to drive a very attractive value proposition for our investors. As I ramp up, I wanted to highlight our recent publication of a report called Perspectives on Climate Related Scenarios. This document enhances our disclosures around climate related strategies, risk and opportunities using the framework recommended by the taskforce on climate related financial disclosures. The report has been very well received by investors and as pointed to as an example for others in the industry to follow. As investors who care about environmental stewardship and a welfare of future generations, we can be proud to invest in MPC. With that let me turn the call over to Don to cover additional highlights for the fourth quarter. Don?
Donald Templin: Thanks Gary. Turning to Slide 4. We reported fourth quarter earnings of $2 billion or $4.09 per diluted share and full year earnings of $3.4 billion or $6.70. Fourth quarter and full year earnings reflect the net benefit of $1.5 billion related to tax reform. The Midstream segment which largely reflects the financial results of MPLX reported record financial results in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2017. This record setting performance was primarily driven by gathered, processed and fractionated volume growth resulting in high plant utilization. After the closing of today's dropdown and the elimination of IDRs, MPLX is among the largest diversified master limited partnerships in the energy sector with a very competitive cost of capital going forward. Given its robust portfolio of organic projects in the Marcellus, Utica, Permian and Stack, as well as a diversified suite of logistics assets, we believe MPLX is very well positioned to be a source of significant long term value for its unitholders including MPC. I would encourage you to listen in on the MPLX call at 11 AM this morning to hear additional color on the partnerships performance and opportunities. Speedway achieved record full year performance in 2017. This was driven by strong earnings from light product sales, an increase of 1.2% in same store merchandize sales, lower operating expenses and contributions from its travel center joint venture. This is Speedway's sixth straight year of record results and second consecutive year generating $1 billion of annual EBITDA reinforcing the strategic value of this high performing, stable cash flow business. Turning Refining & Marketing, we delivered strong results with full year segment earnings of $2.3 billion, an increase of nearly $1 billion over 2016. We operated exceptionally well throughout the year and we're able to capture strong crack spreads and wider crude differentials across our system. Additionally, we achieve numerous monthly process units and production records in the fourth quarter and throughout 2017 including monthly records for crude throughput and gasoline and distiller production. As a result, we are now the second largest refinery in the U.S. on a crude throughput basis and Galveston Bay and Garyville are the second and third largest refineries respectively. With that let me turn the call over to Tim to walk you through the financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year.
Timothy Griffith: Thanks Don. Slide 5 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. For the fourth quarter and for the full year 2017. For the fourth quarter of 2017, MPC reported earnings of $2.02 billion or $4.09 per diluted share compared to last year's $227 million or $0.43 per diluted share. For the full year earnings were $3.4 billion or $6.70 per diluted share, up from approximately $1.2 billion or $2.21 per diluted share in 2016. As Don referenced, earnings for the fourth quarter and full year included a tax benefit of approximately $1.5 billion or $3.04 and $2.93 per diluted share for the fourth quarter and full year respectively, as a result of re-measuring certain net differed tax liabilities is using the lower corporate tax rate. The bridge on Slide 6 shows the changes in earnings by segment over the fourth quarter last year. Apart from the $1.5 billion benefit resulting from tax reform what highlights the significant increase in Refining & Marketing compared to same quarter last year. The improvement was driven by higher LOS based blended crack spreads and higher utilization rates in the fourth quarter 2017. These benefits were partially offset by less favorable product price realizations versus spot prices used in the benchmark crack spread. Speedways fourth quarter is also were generally comparable to last year. The increase in light product margins were offset by higher operating expenses and lower merchandize margin in the quarter. The 47 million favorable midstream variance was primarily due to MPLX's record gathered process and factionary volumes as compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Quarterly results were also impacted by $205 million of income taxes associated with higher earnings and $47 million of increased allocation of higher MPLX earnings to the publically held units in the partnership, shown here is a negative variance in non-controlling interest. Moving to Slide 7, our Refining & Marketing segment reported earnings of $732 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $166 million in the same quarter last year. Looking at our key market metrics, an increase in the LLS-based blended crack spread at a $586 million favorable impact to the segment results, primarily due to higher Chicago crack spread. The LLS-based Chicago crack spread increased from $11.8 from $6.32 per barrel in 2016, driving our LLS-based blended crack spread to $7.75 per barrel from $7.39 per barrel in the same quarter last year. The Light Louisiana Sweet and Texas Intermediate differential widened to $5.64 per barrel, up from a $1.34 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2016. This wider differential drove a $214 million benefit based on the linked crudes in our slate. These benefits were slightly offset by a $53 million unfavorable RIN/CBOB crack adjustment as a result of higher in prices. This increase in costs was considered in our pricing decisions and is reflected in the price paid by consumers. As a result, there is an offset in the product portion of other margin. As a reminder and concession with its treatment, we view the LLS crack and RIN/CBOB crack adjustment together as an effective realized crack spread. Going forward, we'll collapse these impacts into a single variance factor which would have shown a net $533 million positive impact in the fourth quarter. Partial offset in the strong cracks with $113 million unfavorable other margin variance in the quarter driven primarily by less favorable product price realizations versus the spot prices used in the benchmark LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread. Slide 8, provides the drivers for the change in Refining & Marketing segment income for the full year. Income from operations of the $2.3 billion in 2017, up $964 million versus 2016. The LLS-based 6-3-2-1 blend crack spread had a nearly $2.3 billion favorable impact on full year segment results, $2.1 billion on an X-written basis with higher cracks present both the Gulf Coast and Chicago markets. The blend of crack spread for the full year increased by $2.88 per barrel to $9.84 per barrel in 2017. The LLS WTI differential widened to $3.15 per barrel, up from a $1.55 per barrel in 2016. This widening had a $250 million benefit on the full year segment earnings. These benefits were partially offset by three factors, the largest of which was the $505 million unfavorable variance and other margin. This unfavorable variance was primarily due to lower gasoline and non-transportation fuel product price realizations versus spot price is used in LLS based crack spread. This was partially offset by favorable impact in refinery value metric again, due to higher refined products price environment and increased crude throughput volumes in 2017. A narrowing continuing effect shown in the market structure come with a walk resulted in a $350 million unfavorable variance. This is effectively an adjustment of the prime crude price used in the benchmark crack to actual crude acquisition costs. This walk also reflects an unfavorable $345 million due the absence of the LCM reversal that occurred in the second quarter of 2016. Moving to Other segments, Slide 9 provide the Speedway segment results walk for the fourth quarter and full year. As a reminder, comparability of Speedways 2017 results to prior year's fourth quarter and full year's result are affected by the transfer of Speedways travel centers into a joint venture formed with Pilot Flying J called PFJ Southeast LLC in the fourth quarter of 2016. Since the formation of the joint venture in the fourth quarter of 2016, Speedway shared the results of operations is reflected as income from equity method investments and as shown in the other column of this walk. While prior activity remains in the light product margin, merchandise margin and other categories. Speedway's segment income was $149 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $165 million in the same period of 2016. The decrease in segment income was primarily due to higher operating expenses and lower merchandise margin. These impacts are partially offset by higher light product margin which increased to $17.70 per gallon in the fourth quarter, up from $16.17 per gallon the fourth quarter of 2016. Speedways income from operations for the full year 2017 was $732 million compared to $734 million in 2016, a record when excluding the LCM benefit recorded in 2016. The increase in full year segment income excluding the LCM benefit was primarily due to contributions from the travel center joint venture with Pilot Flying J and lower operating expense, partially offset by lower merchandise margin for the year. In January, we've seen a roughly 1.7% decrease in same store gasoline sales volumes compared to last January. Speedways same store gasoline sales has been impacted by higher retail prices as crude prices moved higher and impacts from severe winter weather. As Gary mentioned, the macro picture for 2018 remain solid and we expect a good underlying economic growth will continue to support strong demand for gasoline and distillate over the course of 2018. Slide 10 provides changes in the midstream segment income highlighting the $47 million quarter-over-quarter and the $291 million year-over-year improvement in segment earnings. The higher earnings were primarily due to increase in contributions from MPLX. MPLX results for the fourth quarter and full year were favorably impacted by record gathered processed and factionary volumes as well as contributions from acquired logistics and storage assets in 2017. As Don referenced earlier a more detailed description of the results for the partnership will be provided in the Marathon's earnings call being at 11 and we encourage you to listen in. Slide 11 presents the elements of changes in consolidate cash position for the fourth quarter. Cash at the end of the year was just over $3 billion, an increase approximately $923 million for the end of the third quarter. Core operating cash flow before changes in working capital was an approximate $1.4 billion source of cash. Working capital was a $1.3 billion source of cash in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the impact of higher crude prices and volumes on accounts payable and higher crude liabilities offset by an increase in accounts receivable. Net debt with a $73 million source of cash which represents MPLX's incremental revolver borrowings during the quarter. Return of capital shareholders by where share repurchase and dividends told $945 million in the quarter including $750 million of share purchases at a weighted average share price of 57.90. As Gary mentioned, on Monday, we announced a 15% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.46 per share. This represents a 26.5% compound annual growth rate in the dividend since becoming an independent company six years ago. This accelerated timing and increase reflects the high confidence we have in the long term cash generation of the business. Since beginning of the year. We've returned over $3 billion of capital to MPC shareholders through dividends and share purchases which were supported in part by proceeds from dropdown transactions during the year. Looking forward, we expect further return of capital with the after tax proceeds from today's dropdown transaction, all conducted with a continued focus on maintaining an investment grade credit profile at both MPC and MPLX. Slide 12 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the year. We're nearly $13 billion of total consolidated debt including approximately $6.9 billion of debt owed by MPLX. Total consolidate debt represents 2.2 times last twelve months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis or about 1.4 times excluding MPLX. This same metrics including distributions MPC received from MPLX in adjusted EBITDA was 1.3 times. We believe the addition of the distributions from MPLX is a more useful way to look at MPLX's ongoing debt service capabilities given the importance and stability of MPLX distributions MPC going forward. Beginning this year and over time, the growing MPLX distributions will provide substantial funding to MPC and will be a fundamental component of MPC's discretionary free cash flow. On Slide 13, we provide the illustrative impact to the Refining & Marketing segment from the drop of the refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services into MPLX. Similar to previous dropdowns, the intersegment earnings associated with the dropdown will be reflected in the Midstream segment. We are not restating the prior period results and as such prior period results remain in the R&M segment. Importantly, the dropdown of earnings into the Midstream segment will not cause any change to R&M margin. Direct operating costs will no longer include costs related to the refining logistics assets and the MPLX sees to manage the refining logistics assets as well to provide fuel situation services will be reflected as an increase to other R&M expenses. We expect a net annual increase in total R&M expenses of approximately $1 billion with the corresponding results to be reflected in the Midstream segment. For the Midstream segment, we will also provide supplemental volume statistic related to the fuel distribution services, although volume risks of the partnership have been largely mitigated by the fee-for-services contract that underlies the arrangement. Slide 14 provide updated outlook information and key operating metrics for MPC for the first quarter of 2018. We're expecting throughput volumes of 1.9 million barrels per day with some planned maintenance in the Midwest and Gulf Coast. Total direct operating costs are expected to be 7.90 per barrel. As I mentioned in the prior slide, direct operating costs will exclude the costs related to the refinery logistics assets being dropped and our guidance here has been adjusted for the dropdown completed today. We'll continue to provide this guidance adjusted for the drop impacts on a going forward basis. While guidance is not provided for other R&M expenses, for the first quarter, we expect a net increase of fractionally $230 million resulting from today's dropdown which includes the fees paid to MPLX for two of the three months of the first quarter. Sour crude is estimated to make up 51% of our crude oil throughput for the quarter, down from the first quarter of 2017 as we expect sour crude runs to be impacted by plant maintenance in the Gulf Coast. The estimated percentage of WTI price crude for the first quarter is 28%. Corporate and other unallocated items which were higher in the fourth quarter due to increase in unallocated corporate costs and employee related expenses are projected be $90 million for the first quarter. These costs are expected to moderate over the balance of 2018 as we move past some of the employee related expenses specific to the first quarter. Additionally, we've updated MPC's R&M segment price and margin sensitive is appendix on Slide 21. With that, let me turn the call back over to Lisa. Lisa?
Lisa Wilson: Thank you, Tim. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions. With that, we will now open the call to questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Kristina Kazarian from Credit Suisse.
Kristina Kazarian: Good morning, guys.
Gary Heminger: Good morning, Kristina, welcome back.
Kristina Kazarian: Thank you. As you had alluded to in the opening comments the WTI, WCS spreads really widened out. Can you give a bit more color on the how you guys are thinking about the overall impact on your refining system throughout the year?
Mike Palmer: Yes, Kristina. This is Mike Palmer. You're absolutely right. I mean the - what's happening is that the growth in Canadian heavy continues. And for example we've got the big four heels project is just now starting to ramp up. And with that growth in Canadian crude, what refining is that the pipelines that feed the U.S. systems are full and they're being portioned. So when you look at the numbers, we're very high WCS spreads right now, we do expect those to come down somewhat. But what it really means is that we'll continue to maximize the volume of heavy Canadian that we can move into our system.
Kristina Kazarian: Great. Thanks. And I'll follow-up on that to you. How you heard that thinking about the return that you will be generating on some of the residual upgrade projects you also talked about the beginning of the call particularly given the benefit of IMO that might be coming?
Mike Palmer: Well we look at those projects we've seen high double-digit returns of that we're looking at and that's being very conservative on IMO. We do believe that there are significant upside opportunity with IMO not only of the incremental projects but our base business, but we have not taken any of that upside into the IRR calculations on those projects. But when we finish, we're going to be able to destroy approximately probably somewhere between 280,000 to 300,000 barrels a day of residual and on a total refining system basis we're going to be up significantly over 700,000 barrels per day of annual distillate production. So both the residual destruction, our total annual distillate production, we have the ability to swing that between gasoline and distillate when this is complete and we've always set around 8% to 10%, will probably be a little bit higher when we have these projects complete. But high returns and I think significant upside if the market continues to perform like many of us think it well.
Kristina Kazarian: Perfect. Thank you.
Mike Palmer: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Benny Wong from Morgan Stanley.
Benny Wong: Hi, good morning, guys. Hi Gary. Just following-up on projects to positioning you guys for IMO, is that $400 million looks like, is there any of that to need to be spent to be completed in 2019 or is it all in 2018 and also beyond that is there any more opportunities that you guys are looking at to further position you for IMO?
Gary Heminger: Yes. Let me have Ray Brooks take that question.
Raymond Brooks: Sure. Your question about that positioning for IMO had a 20/20, probably the biggest thing that we have is Gary talked about residual destruction is we have a moderate expansion of our Garyville, Cokers, both Coker units were put in a larger Coke crowns and doing some deep bottleneck. And that wok will be primarily complete on one Coker Q4 2019 and the other Coker Q1 2020. So right on time there. At our Galveston Bay refinery, we've talked over the years about the Star Project which fits right in with IMO, it's a residual destruction, it's a diesel maximization project. That project is actually had staged implementation going back a couple years and will have stage implementation going forward all the way out to when it finally complete so be Q1 2022, but I had a IMO they'll be some more implementation there. To follow-up with your other comment about additional projects. In addition to the CapEx for R&M we always have a backlog of projects that we're are doing some level of engineering and we have some very attractive projects in queue that will continue to re-evaluate given the current market look and potentially bring some more of those projects forward.
Benny Wong: Great. Thanks. And for a second question just regarding the LP units you guys will hold after all the strategic transformation here. Have you guys ever looked at an up-sea structure the something is kind of come across like discussions this was essentially C Corp unit is that something that would make sense at some point or are there any reason that it wouldn't?
Timothy Griffith: Well Benny, this Tim. We'll continue to evaluate potential structural turn as where we think that makes sense. I don't think there's anything at this point that is absolutely compelling or imminent in terms of the review, but we'll take a look and see if there are such that makes sense. I think as we've said publicly our intent plan would be to hold these units indefinitely. I mean we would - they are so important to MPC cash flow that we don't see any situation where those units are not held by MPC but we'll continue to evaluate structure where we think it may make sense, we've looked at other vehicles even for C Corp sleeves that may provide some market access that is tougher in the and not the space but nothing that is required or in terms of our view at this point.
Benny Wong: Got it. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question from Paul Cheng from Barclays Capital.
Paul Cheng: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Gary Heminger: Hi, Paul.
Paul Cheng: Gary, I just want to make sure I get your number correct, you said in the investment that you guys are making when if you think it sense then you're going to reduce in your we see production by 280,000 to 300,000 barrel today. I was looking at your press release, last year your heavy fuel oil is 37 and 63 so that's only about 100. Did I get it wrong and also you say production increase 700 or that you say that is up to 700 because in the full year last year your 641, so maybe you can clarify maybe I missed right one you just said?
Gary Heminger: Sure. And what I was saying is that in total I was not saying incremental, Paul, I was saying in total that our reserve destruction will grow to by the time we finish these projects in 2019 and 2020, we're going to grow to about 280,000 maybe I said 280,000 to 300,000 by the time we get this done in 2017. In '17 - let me tell in 2016 it was 240,000 barrels per day, in 2017, we finished a part of the Star Project which took us from that up to about 252,000 barrels per day and the balance would take us up this 280,000 to 300,000 and then that's a residual destruction. And then in distillate production, in 2017, we were about 640,000 and we're going to go up to about 710,000 to 720,000 when we complete these projects. So in total, the increment is about 60,000 barrels a day of residual destruction incremental and about 110,000 barrels a day or so of incremental distillate.
Paul Cheng: Okay. And is that going to have any change in the crude or that will be relatively steady?
Gary Heminger: Well, that it all depended on the date - excuse me that the crude prices of the differentials when we get these projects complete. The other thing is that we have the flexibility to run about 70% of medium sours and heavier or 70% sweet. And every day we're going to optimize based on where the crude diffs are. So we're going to have tremendous flexibility to run a very high medium sour, heavy slate and residual destruction. But if the sweet markets are if you optimize with sweet then will be able to run sweet, but that's the benefit in our system is that we can go either direction.
Paul Cheng: Gary, you always been the statement for the industry, so any update about the temperature in DC related to the reform RFS, is that any remote sense that we may see something happen?
Gary Heminger: Let me ask Don to talk about this. Don's been very involved here recently meeting with a number of people in DC. And yes we are very, very involved in this. But let me have done to give you the details on the update.
Donald Templin: Sure, Paul. We have consistently believed that the RFS is broken and we need either significant reform or repeal. MPC has always been focused on a long term solution that in our view permanently addresses all the issues and problems with the RFS. Clearly the PES situation recently has that maybe put a little bit more focus on RIMs and the RFS. But our view is that you need to have a long term solution. And we're actually, fairly optimistic or optimistic about the legislative efforts that are ongoing in Washington D.C. led by Senator Cornyn and others and we think it will result in a solution that I think has some short term relief but more importantly has a long term solution to RFS eliminating the mandate and allowing our transportation fuels and other transportation fuels to be able to participate in a free market.
Paul Cheng: Don, Can you elaborate a little bit more in terms of what are changes that you guys think that it may happen?
Donald Templin: Well, I mean we've actually we've been having dialogue with a number of legislators and I guess we have some perspectives on things that we think will work. They've been - I think they need to make sure that they have a solution that works for the energy industry that works for the corn ethanol industry. So I think there's lots of perspectives that are currently being considered. We are hopeful that we should see legislation in the not too distant future Paul, but I think it's premature for us to try to speculate as to what that will be since a number of legislators are working on that.
Gary Heminger: And Paul, I can say that we have the right legislators at the table working on this. Senators Cornyn and Cruz along with Grassley and Ernst. Grassley and Ernst being from the Corn Belt states are all very involved. So we're both sides of the table working on this. And then on the house side, The Chairman, Walden along with our Congressman Shimkus are very, very involved. So they are the right people at the table trying to get this issue off a high center. And I'm fairly confident that we're going to get there this spring.
Paul Cheng: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Gresh from JP Morgan.
Phil Gresh: Yeah. Hi, good morning. First question, I apologize if I missed it, I don't think you started. Do you have a new effective tax rate guidance that you think about following the tax reform and also perhaps how you might think about cash flow benefits from the tax reform, others have commented on the cashless side actually cash taxes trending below these book tax rates, so any thoughts there?
Gary Heminger: Yeah, Phil. We think that the effective tax rate is probably going to be a couple points below statutory in a going forward basis so we sort of guide you in that direction. We haven't given specific guidance as to the cash tax benefits but we have looked at 2017 sort of as if basis with tax reform and it's something in the order of $400 million to $500 million savings of cash taxes so again we're not giving specific forecast but it's certainly of that order of magnitude as we go forward.
Phil Gresh: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then the second question would just be around capital allocation of the free cash flow above and beyond understanding capital spending and projects that you've highlighted, as you look at 2018, you think about the buybacks that you've completed in 2017 and where the balance sheet that. Is 2017 the right order of magnitude we thinking about from a buyback perspective then in this type of market or any color would be helpful?
Gary Heminger: Sure. Yeah and again we're not giving specific guidance but what we did indicate is that after tax cash proceeds from the drops which are closing today beyond what any adjustments we need to make to capital structure to support the investment grade credit profile would generally be targeted at some form of shareholder return. So again I would use that as your guide in terms of what you think the year could be, but it is share purchase continues to be an important vehicle for us to get capital back to shareholders. We think it is very tax efficient and I think you'll continue to see you know substantial activity there.
Phil Gresh: And how much is the tax and leakage at this point I think you at one point you talk about I think the exact numbers are getting back I guess with the new tax rates?
Gary Heminger: Yeah. I think Phil probably the best thing to do would be to just adjust down based on the new tax rates from where we're at in terms of what the absolute leakage around the distributions would be. We haven't given specific guidance as a lot of allocation work that's got to be done in order to determine what that will look like but I think at a macro level taking the new statutory rates at what we provided before is probably a pretty good starting point.
Phil Gresh: Okay. And last one, Gary any thoughts in M&A environment you seems reasonably upbeat on the last call particularly around retail midstream?
Gary Heminger: Well, there continues to be opportunities in the midstream. I think the number at the year, I would expect the midstream positions probably to heat up. We're very bullish on the midstream when you look at the couple of our biggest customers on the production side that they're talking about the big increase and drilling activity over the next couple years. We're bullish on the in the Marcellus, Utica area that we've seen very strong growth in both of those arenas. On top of that the Permian, overtime, there's been a number of assets put in place I think specifically were put in place eventually to put on the market does a more single one-off type assets. We continue to look at a number of those, but I think both in midstream and in retail, there are going to be some opportunities during 2018.
Phil Gresh: Thanks, Gary.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets.
Brad Heffern: Good morning, everyone. Just following-up on Phil's question about taxes, what's the reason that you guys would end up being below the statutory rate, is that just the new higher bonus depreciation?
Gary Heminger: Brad, the biggest piece is really the income allocation that we make to the publicly held units and MPLX so that that is even without tax reform there would have been a big impact on the effective tax rate. So that's the biggest driver of that to a couple of point difference between statutory and our effective guidance.
Brad Heffern: Okay. So at the corporate level you know excluding that MPLX impact as it just basically modelling you know around the statutory rate?
Timothy Griffith: That's probably the right way to start it, yeah and that's sort of the marginal statutory rate.
Brad Heffern: Okay, thanks for the color. And then Gary, you know obviously you've been focused on this value unlocking plan for the past year, 18 months and it's coming to an end year. Can you talk a little bit about from a corporate strategy standpoint, what we're going to be thinking about for MPC going forward, you know, there going to be a greater focus on Midstream or Speedway or we're going to talking about cash returns, just sort of what's the theme for 2018?
Gary Heminger: The answer is yes. You know I've been very clear in the presentations we made at the end of the year and in our presentation today. And we are increasing the capital budget by $150 million in Speedway this year from 3.80 to 5.30, a very strong - and I'll ask Mike Hennigan to talk in a second here about what he sees on the Midstream side and Tim just answered on our return to shareholders. If you look since the beginning of MPC and specifically in 2017, very, very strong returns to shareholders both in dividends and share buybacks. You will continue to see as Tim just highlighted a significant amount of the after tax proceeds we received for these drops, it's going to be available for capital return to shareholders. Beyond that we see some very strong opportunities, Kristina's first question of the day a very strong opportunities in the refining side mainly around distillates production in our refineries. And let ask Mike here to talk about what he is seeing in the Midstream side.
Mike Hennigan: Hey Brad. We're pretty bullish our organic capital plan for 2018 if you noticed we disclosed about $2 billion of capital spend. That comprises eight processing plants, six up in the Marcellus, Utica as Gary mentioned, one in the Stack and one in the Permian. So we're in the right locations as far as shale development. We're also going to add a fractionator up in the Marcellus area. We are going to add two of euthanizes up in the Marcellus which I think is another opportunity to starting to reveal itself ethane up in the North East. In addition to that, we're expanding crude pipelines Ozark up in the mid-continent as well as Wood River over to Patoka as well. So we have a pretty full plate, execution will be a high priority for MPLX in 2018 as far as the identified capital. And then we have a couple of other opportunities that we're working on that will give some more diversified cash flows. So it's exciting time to be in Midstream and we're trying to get after it.
Brad Heffern: Great, thanks for all the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta: Good morning, Tim. Thanks for taking the question. Gary, on same store sales in January, I am sorry if missed that, did you say they were down 1.7%, was there anything funky in there if that was the number or that a function of some macro-trend that you are seeing in gasoline and any comments in terms of the gasoline outlook here distillates definitely looks very bullish but just to start on the gasoline product side?
Gary Heminger: Yes, just it is very bullish but and Tony can give you more color but it's - let's hope it's non-recurring but it was the tremendous weather issues we had across the entire southeast, the southwest added as well but mainly the southeast all the way up to New York to region where you live. And then we had it across entire Ohio valley. But we've had two to three major ice storms and things just we're shutdown. And I think that proves out, if you look at this week's inventory number in the build in crude oil, it's just less of refineries not being able to run, fall out, a number of refineries having temporary blips mostly due to power outage, but all this kind of works together. I think it is a very temporary thing. The other thing that Tony can speak to is we've had a very swift rising crude price and you have to be able to get that price to the street. So Tony, you want to how many restorations you've seen so far this year.
Anthony Kenney: Hi Gary. I think the two comments you've made is essentially the entire reason the same store is down as we are seeing it so far. Storm is the biggest impact, but as we see this rising commodity price environment, our wholesale cost has moved up in line with the rising crude prices. So in our efforts to pass that rising cost on to the street. We do incur some volume impact as a result of try to more or restore margins as well call it back to the levels where we think is appropriate given the environment.
Gary Heminger: Neil, let me say to your question and we had this in conference as well. I need the biggest macro change that you have seen in 2017 is that gasoline demand has outpaced where the expectations of the prognosticators are in the market. So outperformed very nicely in 2017. We would expect that to continue. Distillate continues to outperform. So both of those with the days of supply being very much in checked both gasoline and distillate as compared to five year average. I think build is very, very well on a macro standpoint for the refining industry.
Neil Mehta: I appreciate that Gary. One of the other things you talked about when we cut up a couple of weeks ago that you are generally constructive on the oil macro, those are view in 2017 as well and you are right. Can you just talk about the broader oil view that you had and then also talk about as one of the largest buyers OPEC buyers in the U.S. any thoughts on Saudi and OPEC going into through the year in terms of compliance?
Gary Heminger: Yeah, from a macro standpoint Neil, if you look at the crude inventories, very much in line and looking at a just over the last years a significant I would say rebalancing of crude oil across the entire system. So at your conference, we talked about where we think prices will be for the year and since your conference, I even becoming more bullish on where I think crude prices are going to go because of the resilience of the market, how the oil producers are continuing to I think be more constrained about incremental production coming into the market. And I think on the U.S. production side, there is a very strong view of that they need to be careful on running too fast, too quickly in the marketplace. So I think you are going to see probably will get north of 70 this year on the crude price which I think boards well for the total utilization of refineries, they boards well for the drill bit that's going to satisfy the NGL producers and those markets as well. So I think from a macro standpoint, it's going to be a strong year. Now the caveat to that is when you continue to see an increase in price, you have to get that price to the street, going to have to get to the wholesale level as well as retail level. However, inventories are in check and are in very good shape. And when you look at the first part of the year, I think they are going to see more turnarounds in the entire refining system and we very - some that are scheduled here in pad 2 earlier in the year than you would anticipate. And I think that again is going to put a very good balance underlying the refining system. Let me ask Mike to talk here about what he sees as far as OPEC supply coming into the market.
Mike Hennigan: Yeah, Gary, I think you said it well. I mean OPEC is doing a great job with their production. Again Saudi Arabia kind of the king pin they basically said that they need to continue to constraining their full production through 2018. And I think they will. From our standpoint, we've had no problem replacing the term crude out of the Arabian Gulf that is no longer economic to us with other grades. We have tremendous flexibility within our refining system we can process the very heavy high sulfur, high acid crudes that not everyone can. So that's been a positive for us.
Neil Mehta: Thanks, everyone.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Doug Leggate: Thank you. Hi, good morning, everybody. Gary, I think it's the first time you've spoken this year, so happy New Year. Gary, the tax on the benefit on your cash flow, how does that change you are thinking about a more aggressive step up in your dividend versus buybacks going forward?
Gary Heminger: Doug, Happy New Year to you as well. I think we outlined it before that we see capital investment some new opportunities in refining, but the further advancement in retail and in our midstream space from an investment side, we've been very aggressive in capital return to shareholders in 2107. We accelerated our dividend from July now to early January here and a significant increase in our dividend. So we will continue that type of cadence as we see fit. We have great investment opportunities as well as we have great opportunities. And I think it's a good investment we all do here in returning capital to shareholders. So we will continue to stay on top of our game as we look to return of capital to shareholders.
Doug Leggate: A nice one for sure. I guess I really only have one other the big picture question Gary and like several of the guys over there if I could take advantage of your macro view and it really goes back to IMO and one of the things we're kind of thinking is that there are still some regions of the world with utilization rates and the diesel margins really improve as much as some folks think we could. My concern I guess is that we see a step up in utilization for example in Europe at the expense of gasoline supply in the Atlantic based meaning we end up what we supply in the gasoline markets. I was just wondering how much you thought about the scenarios as to how just can alternately play out in let's say at $70 oil world which I guess also changes the economics for shipping, decisions as always discover and so on. So I am just wondering how - what are the kind of scenarios you're thinking about best case, worst case for the IMO outcome? And I'll it there. Thanks.
Gary Heminger: Yes, Doug. We thought about those scenarios as well. One of the things that you have to look at in Europe and it is starting in the U.K. it's going to happen so other countries in Europe as well. But they're going to become more of a sponge for gasoline going forward. As you know it's always been historically that they pushed diesel into the marketplace and those benefits are have gone away. So I do think that you're going to see more demand for gasoline. And the other thing is our exports, if you look at the rate of change of exports from the Gulf Coast, gasoline is becoming more and more prominent in the exports was to Latin America, South America, West Africa or into Europe. So Europe is still predominantly diesel, but it's going to increase. So yes, we look at those scenarios and we will continue to watch those very carefully. But right now, I think we are not only speak for MPC, we are very, very well positioned for this IMO changes coming. And if gasoline continues to pick up that's why we're investing in further distribution of capabilities both in Galveston Bay and Garyville to be able to take bigger cargoes of gasoline.
Doug Leggate: I appreciate the full answer Gary and congrats on a great year. Thanks again.
Gary Heminger: Thanks, Doug.
Operator: Thank you. We do have time for one final question. Our last question today is from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.
Roger Read: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning.
Gary Heminger: Hi, Roger.
Roger Read: Hey Gary. Just if we could catch up a little more on the retail since that's where your kind of incremental investments are coming on presuming didn't need the tax reform to make that happen. But with the slower growth we've seen in terms of I know January weather, but if you look at Q4 right on a per store basis, retail was down and the merchandise excuse me was down, in the fields were down. Is that a function of why you need to repurpose some of the stores or upgrade them I guess was the term used? And then as we think about expansion is that a function of new markets or better locations within existing markets, just going to understand want to understand if it's a regional growth story or stepping into a new region? And then the last part of the retail question since it was asked about midstream any retail acquisitions that are possible or look attractive in this environment?
Gary Heminger: Sure. Tony, you want to take Roger's first questions and I will take rest.
Tony Kenney: I'd be happy to Gary. First of all let me remind you the comps you're looking at when you mention the trends in the fourth quarter and actually for the full year, remember we formed this joint venture with pilot, so we moved sales margin expenses out of the detailed categories into an equity earnings component. So you will see some natural variances on those just because of the formation of venture. However, your point is correct there is some softness in what we look at is transaction counts inside of our store. But again, we think that our plans, the technology investment, our loyalty program, the focus on the consumer that we have, those are all and actually the priorities and some of the growth areas and some of the store that we're investing that capital that Gary mentioned earlier, will be around so high growth areas like food service for example in convenience store. I think we've got a very good program to continue to grow and invest on the remodel part of that capital that Gary talked about. As far as the new builds, rebuilds, our focus is going to continue to be and we've consistently said this. We're going to be in the footprint of MPC's supply chain. I mean that's part of the synergies and the value that we have seen over the years that we continue to tell the market about in terms of the integration benefits of Speedway with MPC supply. So when you look at our footprint, you look at our foothold in the Midwest and some of the new markets we have on our eastern markets. Those are really good MPC supply areas and therefore we want to take advantage of those synergies by investing our stores where we can take advantage of the synergies with supply. And the last point on acquisitions. We don't say anything specific about that. But the industry as a whole my observation would be is that is consolidating, there needs to be some consolidation, it's a very fragmented convenient store industry, so I think there's going to be opportunities in the future to look at some acquisitions in our primary footprint.
Roger Read: Okay. Great. Thank you and I'll leave it there.

Operator: Welcome to the MPC's Third Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Elon, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Lisa Wilson. Lisa, you may begin.
Lisa Wilson - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's third quarter 2017 earnings webcast and conference call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, Chairman and CEO; Don Templin, President; Tim Griffith, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Hennigan, President of the general partner of MPLX and other members of MPC's executive team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there, as well as in our filings with the SEC. Now, I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thank you, Lisa, and good morning to everyone. If you please turn to slide 3. Earlier today, we reported strong financial and operational performance across the business with third quarter earnings of $903 million, illustrating the substantial earnings power of our integrated business model. An important part of our success this quarter was our employees and their dedication to operate our facilities safely and reliably throughout the quarter, and notably under the extremely challenging weather conditions during the recent hurricanes. This focus enabled us to meet the needs of our customers and the market at a critical time. During Hurricane Harvey, our system did not experience material flooding or damage, but we did operate at a reduced rate at our Galveston Bay Refinery for a few days to enable pipelines, marine vessels and other logistics assets to resume normal operation. After the storm passed, our team resumed normal refinery production rates rapidly and restarted critical logistics infrastructure, positioning MPC as the first to resume dock shipments to a market in need of supply for recovery efforts. Also to help supply the markets' needs, we temporarily delayed turnaround activity at our Catlettsburg, Garyville and Robinson refineries. Shortly after Harvey, we were preparing for the landfall of Hurricane Irma. In preparation for the evacuation of Florida's residents, our logistics team focused on transporting as much fuel as possible to Speedway and Marathon brand locations along the evacuation route, utilizing our trucks, barges, as well as additional third-party assets. We staged fuel for resupply in strategic locations and we were well-positioned to supply the Florida market as soon it was safe to operate. Within three days of the storm's passing, 98% of our approximately 240 stores – Speedway stores in Florida were operating as were all four of our live product terminals. We were pleased to be recognized by the state and government officials for our efforts in getting supply into these critical markets. In both hurricanes, our response and recovery efforts went beyond our fence line. MPC along with our employees donated to local municipalities and charities in both Texas and Florida to aid with storm recovery. MPC volunteers also spent countless hours helping their fellow employees and other flood victims. To our employees, I'm grateful for your contributions to this critical work, and I'm proud of our role in manufacturing and transporting and marketing fuels and other products that millions of people use to make their lives better every day. Turning to our strategic actions designed to further enhance shareholder value, we have been sharply focused on executing our plan. Since the beginning of the year, including the third quarter dropdown, we have contributed assets to MPLX with a combined transaction value of $3.065 billion, resulting in consideration of $1.7 billion in after-tax cash proceeds and 32 million MPLX units. In total for the year, we have returned $2.2 billion to our shareholders, including buybacks and dividends. We expect to repurchase at least $550 million of shares in the fourth quarter. As part of the strategic actions, a full thorough review of Speedway was completed. As we reported in early September, our board was unanimous in its conclusion that the greatest long-term value for shareholders is optimized with Speedway remaining a fully integrated business within MPC. Having a strong retail business in Speedway is a valuable differentiator for MPC, and we see significant opportunities for maximizing value creation at Speedway. This will be done by continuing to deliver on past organic investment and through additional investments to grow the business. Looking forward, our strategic plan remains on track. We have offered the remaining identified dropdown to MPLX and the offer is currently under review by the board's independent conflicts committee. This last dropdown includes refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services, which are projected to generate $1 billion in annual EBITDA. We expect this dropdown to close in the first quarter of 2018, and we expect additional return of capital to shareholders with the after-tax cash proceeds, consistent with maintaining our investment grade credit profile. Once the terms of the dropdown are finalized, MPC will immediately initiate the offer of its GP economic interests, including its IDR rights to the partnership in exchange for newly issued LP common units. Both transactions would then close in the first quarter. The GP transaction will provide a clear valuation for MPC's GP economic interest and is intended to reduce MPLX's cost of capital for the long term. All transactions are subject to market and other conditions, as well as requisite approvals. In summary, we remain committed to driving shareholder value through execution of our strategic actions and are confident that our value creation plan, combined with our proven operational excellence will further drive substantial long-term shareholder value. With that, let me turn the call over to Don to cover additional highlights for the third quarter.
Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thanks, Gary. We reported third quarter earnings of $903 million or $1.77 per diluted share, with solid operational and financial performance across the business despite the tough operating conditions Gary mentioned earlier. Our Midstream segment, which largely reflects the financial results of MPLX, reported record third quarter earnings. The outstanding performance in the quarter and the increase over the third quarter of last year was primarily driven by record gathered, processed, and fractionated volumes. MPLX continues to build on its strong footprint in the Marcellus, Permian, and STACK shale plays. Since the beginning of this year, the partnership has increased its processing capacity in the Northeast by 7%, bringing our total capacity in this region to approximately 5.8 billion cubic feet per day. The partnership expects to add approximately 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of processing capacity in 2018, with approximately 1.2 billion in the Northeast, and approximately 300 million in the Southwest. With visibility to strong growth opportunities through a robust portfolio of organic projects and strong distribution coverage, MPLX is well-positioned to be a source of significant long-term value for our investors. Our partnership's value proposition will be further enhanced once the exchange of MPC's GP economic interest is complete. I would encourage you to listen in on the MPLX call at 11:00 A.M. this morning to hear additional color on the performance and opportunities for the partnership. On the retail side, Speedway continued to deliver top-tier operational and financial results in the quarter, driven by solid light product and merchandise gross margins. This was despite the challenging weather conditions Gary mentioned earlier. Speedway's new joint venture with Pilot Flying J also favorably impacted results in the quarter. Speedway's performance and its contribution to MPC is further validation of Speedway's importance to our integrated model, and its ability to generate substantial returns for our shareholders. We will continue to focus resources and capital to Speedway to drive additional value over the long term. Turning to Refining & Marketing, we operated exceptionally well during the quarter, and we were able to capture strong crack spreads while meeting the needs of our customers and the market during the challenging weather conditions. Refinery throughputs exceeded 2 million barrels per day for the second consecutive quarter. Additionally, we set multiple refinery production records during the quarter, including record crude throughput in the month of August. I'm also pleased to report that demand for exports continued to be strong in the third quarter. Between Galveston Bay and Garyville, our exports averaged 331,000 barrels per day, up from second quarter of this year and third quarter of 2016. Exports remain a fundamental component in our refined products distribution and we continue to invest to support additional export capacity in our system. We are encouraged by improving market fundamentals and prospects for a more balanced supply and demand environment going forward. U.S. demand remains robust in the fourth quarter and into 2018, led by distillate demand growth and a healthy U.S. economic environment. On a days of supply including exports basis, U.S. gasoline and distillate inventories are now below their five-year averages, and should remain supportive for MPC's refining system as we look into next year. Meanwhile, global oil inventories have declined by more than 300 million barrels in 2017, and we see further progress toward rebalancing continuing into 2018. With our fully integrated and flexible system, strategically located assets that provide excellent optionality, and a focus on operational excellence, we believe we have a sustainable long-term competitive advantage that drives real value for shareholders over the long term. With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk you through the financial results for the third quarter.
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thanks, Don. Slide 5 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. For the third quarter of 2017, MPC reported earnings of $903 million or $1.77 per diluted share compared to last year's $145 million or $0.27 per diluted share. Third quarter 2016 earnings included a $267 million impairment charge or $0.31 per diluted share related to our investment in the canceled Sandpiper Pipeline project. The bridge on slide 6 shows the change in earnings by segment over the third quarter last year. The walk highlights the significant increase in Refining & Marketing, driven by higher LLS-based blended crack spreads and the ability to maintain high utilization rates. The benefits were partially offset by less favorable product price realizations versus the spot prices in the benchmark crack spread. Speedway's results were comparable to last year and represented one of the best third quarters in Speedway's history, and I'll provide some additional color on that shortly. The $45 million favorable Midstream variance was primarily due to MPLX's record gathered, processed, and fractionated volumes as compared to last year. The $251 million favorable variance shown in items not allocated on the walk is due to the absence of the non-cash impairment charge I referenced earlier related to Sandpiper. Quarterly results were also impacted by $340 million of higher income taxes due to higher earnings and $27 million of allocation of higher MPLX earnings to the publicly held units in the partnership, shown here as a negative variance in non-controlling interests. Moving to slide 7, our Refining & Marketing segment reported earnings of $1.1 billion in the third quarter, an $845 million increase compared to the same quarter last year. Looking at our key market metrics, an increase in the LLS-based blended crack spread had a $923 million favorable impact to segment results, primarily due to higher crack spreads and the ability to maintain high refinery utilization rates. The LLS-based blended crack spread was $4.61 higher at $12.69 per barrel in the third quarter. Strong crack spreads in the quarter were slightly offset by a $73 million unfavorable RIN/CBOB crack adjustment as a result of higher RIN prices. This increase in costs was considered in our pricing decisions and is reflected in the price paid by consumers. As a result, there's an offset in the product portion of other gross margin. As a reminder and consistent with this treatment, we view the LLS crack and RIN/CBOB crack adjustment together as an effective realized crack spread. We could have simply reflected an $850 million positive crack spread, but are showing them here separately, given the desire to provide visibility to both factors. Also, partially offsetting the strong crack spreads was the $207 million unfavorable product variance, as shown as a component of the other gross margin bar on the walk. This was primarily due to less favorable product price realizations versus the spot prices in the benchmark LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread than was true in the third quarter last year. Moving forward to the other segments, slide 8 provides the Speedway segment results walk compared to the same period last year. As Gary and Don mentioned, Speedway delivered strong earnings of $209 million and performed exceptionally well during and after Hurricane Irma to supply fuel, food and supplies to those in need. As a reminder, comparability of Speedway's results to prior-year third quarter is also affected by the transfer of Speedway's travel centers into the newly formed joint venture with Pilot Flying J called PFJ Southeast LLC in the fourth quarter of 2016. Speedway's share of the results from operations from the joint venture is reflected as income from equity method investments and is shown in the other column of this walk, while prior quarter activity remains in light product margin, merchandise margin and other categories. During the quarter, a decrease in light product gross margin had a $20 million unfavorable impact. While Speedway sold nearly 1.5 billion gallons during the quarter, the volumes were down from 2016. Light product gross margin was $0.177 per gallon, a solid result amidst rising crude oil prices during the quarter. Merchandise gross margin also contributed a $12 million unfavorable impact to segment income. Light product and merchandise gross margin on favorable variances are higher than they would have been due to the absence of contributions from the travel centers in 2017, as I already mentioned. If the travel centers were still in, the net impact would be close to a push for the quarter. The increase of $32 million shown in the other column of the walk includes Speedway's share of results from the joint venture with Pilot Flying J, as well as lower operating expenses due to the absence of operating expenses in 2017 from the contributed travel centers. So far in October, we've seen a roughly 1.3% decrease in same-store gasoline sales volumes compared to last October. As a reminder, we continuously endeavor to optimize total gasoline contributions between volume and margin as market conditions adjust. So, we generally do not focus too much on either factor in isolation. Slide 9 provides the changes in the Midstream segment income quarter-over-quarter. The $53 million favorable variance for MPLX was primarily due to record gathered, processed, and fractionated volumes as compared to last year. MPLX results were also favorably impacted by earnings from its recently acquired Ozark Pipeline system and the first full quarter of its indirect interest in the Bakken Pipeline System. The unfavorable variance of $13 million in equity and other affiliates reflects the decline in earnings from pipeline equity investments, primarily related to favorable inventory adjustment recorded in 2016. As Don mentioned, we would encourage you to listen in on the MPLX call at 11:00 to get more color on the partnership's strong performance in the quarter. Slide 10 presents significant elements of changes to our consolidated cash position in the third quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was nearly $2.1 billion, an increase of approximately $600 million from the end of the second quarter. Core operating cash flow before changes to working capital was approximately $1.6 billion source of cash. Working capital was a $320 million source of cash, primarily due to an increase in crude and refined products prices and the impact of the payment terms differentials. Net debt was $156 million source of cash, which reflects MPLX's use of its revolver during the quarter. Cash flow reflects net proceeds of $39 million from MPLX's second quarter commitments through its ATM program that settled in the third quarter. No additional common units were issued in this program in the third quarter. Looking forward, higher earnings and cash flow, combined with a disciplined approach to capital investments, have increased the partnership's capacity to fund organic growth with debt and retained cash and it substantially reduced the need to access the public markets. Return of capital to shareholders via share repurchase and dividends was $654 million in the quarter. As Gary referenced, after-tax cash proceeds from this year's dropdowns have been substantially returned via share repurchase activity, including the $452 million of share repurchases in the quarter, and the over $1.6 billion since the beginning of the year. In the fourth quarter, we expect share repurchases of at least $550 million. Looking forward, we expect cash proceeds from the remaining dropdown to fund substantial return of capital to shareholders, all conducted with a continued focus on maintaining an investment grade credit profile at both MPC and MPLX. Slide 11 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the quarter. We had nearly $12.8 billion of total consolidated debt, including approximately $6.8 billion of debt owed by MPLX. Total consolidated debt represented 2.4 times last 12 months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis, or about 1.6 times excluding MPLX. We continue to show debt-to-EBITDA excluding MPLX as we think it is more useful to show the independent capital structures given the effect of the relatively higher leverage of the growing partnership on MPC's consolidated metrics and our approach to managing capitalization separately. Going forward, we'll also provide debt-to-last 12's EBITDA adjusted excluding MPLX with credit for MPLX, MPLX's distribution to MPC, which we think are an appropriate component of MPC's debt service capabilities. For the third quarter, the ratio on this basis was 1.4 times, although the difference between that ratio without the LP credit is going to grow as the drops are completed. The dropdowns are effectively converting EBITDA into MPLX LP distributions. Given our control as the general partner, we believe these distributions are highly probable with very low risk of interruption. Over time, MPLX distribution to MPC will provide substantial and fundamental funding to MPC and an important component of MPC's discretionary free cash flow. Slide 12 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the fourth quarter of 2017. We are expecting throughput volumes of 1.925 million barrels per day with planned maintenance in the Midwest. Total direct operating costs are expected to be $7.35 per barrel. We also expect to see an advantage to process lighter crudes in the fourth quarter driven by narrower sweet/sour differentials. Sour crude is estimated to make up 54% of our crude oil throughput for the quarter. The estimated percentage of WTI-priced crude is 26%. Projected fourth quarter corporate and other unallocated items is estimated at $80 million. With that, let me turn the call back over to Lisa. Lisa?
Lisa Wilson - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thanks, Tim. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions. With that, we will now open the call to your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question today is from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.
Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, good morning.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Good morning.
Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: First question is just on capital allocation. We've actually seen some additional C-store assets coming to market recently of decent size, I'm wondering is M&A something you would consider at this point, particularly on the retail side? And operationally, with where you're at, with the Hess integration and things like that, is this something that you'd think about?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yes, Phil. This is Gary. We of course think about it and we will do our homework on such opportunities. We've looked at some in the past until we've completed our thorough review of Speedway, we really were not going to act on anything, but it – retail, Midstream continues to be a very strong focus in our path going forward.
Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: So if you were to look at something of a decent size, would that in any way influence your use of proceeds from the dropdowns, or, Tim, with the balance sheet, as you were describing, I mean, it does feel like there's room to be able to do both? Just curious how you think about that?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, first of all, we've always said, we will always maintain an investment grade credit profile. And then, it just depends on if something makes sense, how big it is – we illustrated that we certainly have the competency to be able to leapfrog markets like we did when we bought Hess when we went to the East Coast and we've been able to integrate the Hess assets very, very well into our system and exceed the synergies that we have planned. So, it just depends, Phil, on what the size would be. But I don't expect that we will deviate from buying back shares that we've discussed in the past.
Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. Okay. And Gary, if I could just ask one last one, the Capline reversal, I was a bit surprised that the timing that it would take five years and that the capacity would only be 25% of the current northbound capacity, could you talk about that?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, as you know, we have three owners in the system. And this was a – we're very pleased that we were able to get this open season out into the market, we're receiving very, very strong inbounds on consideration for this pipeline. From an engineering and construction to reverse this pipeline, you are correct, it will not take five years, it's more from a commercial standpoint that the three owners are looking at this. And timing from, as I say, from a commercial side that we've put the open season out in the manner in which we did.
Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Great, thanks. Good morning. I guess couple of more questions on Capline. Maybe it's obvious, but does floating the open season suggest that all three owners are in agreement at this point on repurposing the line? And could you just talk about the strategic rationale for the reversal from MPC standpoint? Are you focused primarily on incremental growth for Midstream or is this developing crude optionality for Garyville?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, Chi, it's both. As you know, this pipeline flowing south to north has the capability depending on the crude slate of running 1 million to 1.2 million barrels per day. Has not – recently been running anywhere near that level. But if you look at the Eastern Gulf, so everywhere from Baton Rouge refineries through Garyville, I think over to Mississippi, there is a strong desire to have a steady source of heavy crude. And so, the Eastern Gulf does not have that steady source coming down today. So, from a commercial standpoint, it's very important to MPC. Secondly, it provides a good Midstream source as well and that, as you know, Capline is not yet a part of our MLP, and that's just because the commerciality of that pipeline as it sits today is certainly – is not at a level – at the value level that it should be. So, as this is reversed down the road, we think that, that pipeline is going to be much more valuable, and then it will be an asset that will be considered for MPLX.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. To get incremental heavy Canadian barrel to Patoka, would you, MPC, consider locking up line space all the way down from Alberta on one of the trunk lines coming down either Enbridge or maybe KXL...?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, let me ask Mike Palmer to handle that, Chi.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay.
C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, Chi. We don't think that there is going to be any sort of a problem in supplying a reverse Capline. Enbridge has numerous projects, for example, that will get completed in the not too distant future and we think that, that will certainly allow for supply into Capline. And not only that, I mean, the Keystone base system can be used in order to supply heavy Canadian into reverse Capline as well. So, we – again, we think there's plenty of opportunities to move the heavy Canadian down Capline.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Mike. And maybe one final question here, does the Capline reversal tie into the potential of converting LOOP for exports, and what would be the targeted export capacity at LOOP that you've talked about in the past?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Chi, I was just waiting for Mike to finish, and I was going to add in that you've got to think about Capline going beyond just St. James, that it eventually could go all the way back out to LOOP and it could reverse VLCCs out of loop. That study is underway. Today, we have a capacity of around 800,000 barrels a day of unloading capacity, but that's off of – we have three buoys, and I think we're going to unload two ships simultaneously. But we're – we do not have that study complete yet on – and presumably, it would be heavy crude that we would be looking at exporting. So when we get that study complete, Chi, we'll be able to share with you – we just don't have all of the engineering done.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: But certainly would be the long-term plan, which it would be very positive for the Canadian producers, it'd be very positive for the midstream players, and also for all of the Eastern Gulf refiners to be able to have that crude source, and then some to even be able to export if they wished.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Yeah. It's an interesting development. Great. Thanks, Gary. I appreciate it.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng from Barclays.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Good morning, Paul.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That is a very impressive result on the Refining. So, congratulation on that.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thank you.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just to – on the – with the IMO 2020, do you plan to make any large refining CapEx related to that? I think at one point several years ago you were contemplating about resid hydrocrack, and then of course that being shared (31:09), just curious there, should we look at any large capital outlay?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Ray?
Raymond L. Brooks - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, this is Ray Brooks. I'll take that question. As far as IMO, yes, we are looking at strategic opportunities for resid upgrading primarily at our Gulf Coast refineries where we've got the STAR project that we've talked about before. The big part of that is upgrading our resid, we've done some of that. We have some more planned with our resid hydrocracker expansion there. And then at Garyville, you ask about the resid hydrocracker there, we have no plans to pursue that, but we're looking at some opportunistic and quick-hit projects to expand our coking capacity at Garyville. So, yeah, the IMO is on the horizon for us and we think we've got a couple of good-looking opportunities.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. The second one, just curious that in the first quarter when you got the (32:17) $1 billion EBITDA to the MPLX, $600 million is the wholesale-related margin. I presume that's coming out from the Refining segment. Is that coming now from the margin side or it's going to be under (32:34) on the other costs? And also that the remaining $400 million, is that already in the Transportation segment or it's also coming now from the Refining?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, Paul, this is Tim. I mean, both are effectively in the R&M segment currently. Let's talk about each of them individually. The refining logistics asset is really going to be structured as a sort of a fee-for-capacity arrangement within refining. So that's going to be sort of a charge that will flow back to for Refining. So that's a straight charge out of the R&M segment that will show up in MPLX once the drops complete. For the fuels distribution, similarly this is a service contract, a giant service contract that will exist between the parties and elements of it will be in margin, elements will be below the line (33:23) in terms of how it gets reflected, actually I think most of it will actually show up below the line in terms of where it shows up. So, it'll be out of margin, but part of the movement between the segments of R&M and into MPLX.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So, I get that from a simple modeling standpoint, we should not assume the margin capture being changed that much, but that your segment where (33:47) you sell from refining would drop, but not necessarily in the margin?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: And that's right. It should not have an impact on gross margin, but it will have an impact on the segment.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks.
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: And I think – Paul, I had mentioned even on the last call that heading into these drops, we'll try to provide some framework about how that will look pro forma for the transactions to sort of help guide your thinking around how best to model it.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Good morning, all. I'll start with another macro question. Just thinking about Brent, WTI at this point, it looks like at least in the Midwest you guys are planning to run a lot more WTI in the fourth quarter. Any thoughts around sort of the sustainability of these $5, $6 spreads going forward and maybe are we at the limit of what you guys can run in terms of WTI in the system?
C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, Brad, this is Mike Palmer. With the Brent and WTI spread now in this $5.50 to kind of $6 area, certainly that has encouraged a lot of U.S. exports to take place, as I'm sure you know. We expect that we'll continue to see a positive Brent TI spread going forward. But with all the exports taking place, I guess I would believe that we'll start to see that spread come in over the next months. When the spread is wide like it is, what we want to do is, we want to be in a position where we can take in as much of the WTI-based crude as we possibly can, and that's what we do in our optimization process. So, we're trying to capitalize on all of the WTI-priced crude that we possibly can in the system today. And as we move forward in the future and we get our Ozark expansion completed, that'll open up a considerable amount of additional optionality that we don't have today.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay, great. Thanks for that color. And then maybe for Tim. Just on CapEx, you guys haven't revised the budget at this point, but I think it implies like a $1.6 billion spend in the fourth quarter. Is there any reason to think that you guys are actually going to spend that or is there some sort of big expense that's included in that budget that is in the fourth quarter?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, we're probably a little bit behind what we expected by the end of the third quarter, but we suspect that there will be some catch-up that will occur in the fourth quarter. So again, we're not going to re-guide the capital, but I think you should expect to see some catch-ups that will occur into the end of the year here.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the IMO regulations. So when all this sort of high-sulfur fuel oil ends up back in the market and as companies marine buyer (36:53) substitute out that fuel, I mean, where is the stuff going to end up? Can it end up as a feed into your plants as a coker feed, or how do you guys look at that as I guess a feedstock or a product that's trying to get a big discount in the market?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Ray?
Raymond L. Brooks - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. This is Ray. I'll take a first stab at that. Our goal every day is to fill up our resid processing capabilities. And we can do that via couple of different ways, having up the crude slate to take advantage of that, or looking at shrinking our lower-valued sales. What I will say is, even ahead of IMO, we've taken a lot of steps to reduce our residual fuel sales by increasing our process – existing processing today through our cokers and resid the asphalting units.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Mike, do you want to add anything on that or...?
C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: No. The only other thing I guess that I would add is that, again, we're -we're well set up to look at various opportunities in the world for any resid that's surplus to our system. So, as part of our continuing optimization process, that's exactly what we'll do.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. So my follow-up question is on exports for gasoline and distillate. Were those numbers lower just simply because of the hurricane impact and the need to sort of keep more barrels at home versus export those volumes?
Raymond L. Brooks - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Faisel, the 331,000 barrels a day is one of the highest rates that we've ever had. So we are finding the export market to be very attractive and we are moving product to the export market when that is the better alternative than placing it in the domestic market. But we are – we believe the export market is attractive, we believe we're well situated given our Gulf Coast refineries. And as you well know, we're continuing to invest in upgrading or enhancing the capacity of our exports. And by 2020, we should be able to have a capacity of over 500,000 barrels a day from those two refineries, Galveston Bay and Garyville.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Faisel, if you really look at the macro view here, I want to make sure investors understand this. If you look at gasoline and distillate days of supply, we're at the low end for both products on a five-year average – the low-end of that five-year average on a days supply. I think that's going to continue to provide momentum for light product exports. It's going to continue to provide balance for domestic inventories. And I think we're really teed up versus – I'll take you back to the same period in 2016 and same period in 2015, when we were mid-fourth quarter with very high inventories coming into the lower demand part of the season, and that was a drag on margins. Here, days of supply are really strong across – it should be really strong for inventory across both gasoline and distillate, and I think should continue to show strength finishing up the fourth quarter.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Gary. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Corey Goldman from Jefferies.
Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC: Hey, guys. Just a quick question on the MidCon fleet during the quarter. Obviously, DAPL, it's still ramping; can you just tell us how that impacted if at all the MidCon refineries in 3Q?
C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, Corey, it's Mike Palmer here. DAPL became operational in June. And obviously what that does for us is it does give us the conduit into Patoka for the North Dakota Light crude. And over the third quarter, I can tell you that we've been ramping up the volumes of North Dakota Light as it has been attractive relative to the alternatives. So it's – again, it gave us the optionality we needed to take advantage of a well-priced feedstock.
Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC: Got you. And when – sorry – would you expect that ramping to be more I guess ratable? Is that a 4Q event or a 2018 event?
C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, it's – the pipeline itself is fully operational. So shippers can ship into Patoka or they can ship down to the Gulf Coast, either one. The amount of North Dakota Light that we'll want to bring into our system ourselves will depend upon how it's being priced. So that volume will come up and down depending upon the marketplace and how we optimize.
Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC: Understood. Okay. And maybe just as a follow-up question, given that it's so difficult to track these things with different contract rolls, is there anything that you can talk about from a third-party contract perspective that perhaps could be rolling sometime in 2018 or late 2017 that could find its way toward the MPLX bucket that maybe can put some earnings upside? Just – we don't see a lot of that information in the marketplace, I don't know if there's anything there that you can provide for us.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: And, Corey, I just want to make sure I understand that, when you say contracts that are rolling, are you meaning contracts to provide further throughput and pipelines or can you be more definitive on your question?
Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC: Sorry. Just to the extent you had third-party contracts with other midstream or downstream service providers, is there anything that is expiring in the near term that could perhaps be funneled towards the MPLX bucket?
Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: I guess – this is Don, Corey. I mean, what we're always doing is, we're looking for opportunities to – if there is a – if we're using a third party to supply MPC and we have an opportunity to supply or move it ourselves, we're always looking to those opportunities. So I think we've historically been looking at that and certainly Mike Hennigan and his team have been very focused on understanding what are the opportunities to source more of the movements from third parties to MPC-owned – or MPLX-owned logistics.
Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC: Great. Thanks, guys.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah.
Operator: And your next question is from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research.
Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC: Good morning, all. [Technical Difficulty] (43:39-43:49)
Operator: I apologize. We are having technical difficulties with that line. We'll move on to the next one. Our next caller is Doug Leggate from Bank of America.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America – Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good morning.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Hi, Doug.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America – Merrill Lynch: Sorry, I was clearing my throat. Good morning. How is everybody doing? Gary, the comment in the release about the after-tax proceeds from the drop, can you give us an idea of what you think the cost basis of the drop next year would be assuming the $1 billion gets done?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Doug, it's Tim. We had said even on the announcements in January that using a roughly – sort of 20% tax rate on the drops was probably appropriate. I'm not sure we guide any differently at this point. So you can think about it in those terms, somewhere between there and sort of statutory. So that's probably the range.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America – Merrill Lynch: Okay. And maybe just related to that, can you offer some color on the pace of how you would redeploy that cash in terms of buybacks? I guess it wouldn't all be instantaneous, so how would you expect the buybacks to be ratable over next period?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, we'll manage it in a way that we think optimizes our ability to access to market without influencing the price. Again, we'll – this is certainly going to be a big slug of proceeds all at once, so I think we'll evaluate more accelerated forms to see if those make sense. We've been very successful in open market repurchases and really delivering at or below daily view apps (45:16), so we'll take a look at what makes the more sense at the time.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America – Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks. My last one, guys, is I guess a little more convoluted because it relates to some of the GP drops that have been done by some of your peers. I think in the past you've talked about a kind of target range multiple perhaps something in the 15 – 20 range, the recent drops or the recent conversions have been done a little bit lower than that. I'm just wondering if you could offer a perspective on that. And related, and Gary, I know, we've talked about this in the past, but it does give a lot of transparency to your ownership of MPLX going forward. But obviously, as you take distributions, your tax basis there would essentially ultimately go to zero over time. So how should we think about the after-tax value at the MPC level for what is a tax-free entity and as it relates to the public market quote? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Sure, Doug. It's Tim. Let me try to take both of those. Your first question with regard to maybe precedent transactions or other GP transactions we see in the marketplace, for one thing, our 15 to 20 that we provided in January was really illustrative. And frankly, that's not where we started on multiples. We really looked at what would be the appropriate premium of cash flow pro forma for the transactions vis-à-vis what the GP cash flow would have looked like otherwise. We turned it into a multiple because we know everyone loves to talk about multiples, but the – I guess the thing that is worth pointing out is that the situation that both of the recent transactions that have been done, the situation of the GP and the situation that MPLX's GP finds itself are very different. And so, it's I think very difficult to compare two transactions and say those multiples should be about the same because it's really not an apples-to-apples comparison. You really have to assess what the cash flow growth profile of those GP distributions will look like on their own sort of at the point the transaction's conducted. So, again, we're not going to re-guide to ranges or what the value is, I mean that's a process that's in front of us. We'll have all the appropriate dialog with the conflicts committee and the MPLX board. As we've stressed on multiple occasions and maybe worth repeating again this morning, pro forma for these transactions, MPC will be a substantial holder of LP units. And really striking a balance on the GP buy-in to make sure that it both illuminates value of the GP and provides an affordable and sensible transaction for the partnership becomes very important, because any action that MPC takes that harms the partnership hurts no one more than MPC. So, I think we – again, we'll be very careful about striking an appropriate balance on the transaction. And again, we'll share our color on valuation at the appropriate time. I don't think we want to get in front of a process just now. Your second question if I understood, it was really – relates to the tax basis and the distribution that come back. There is certainly a tax advantage of LP distributions versus GP distributions which are fully taxable from an MPC perspective. So MPC although it will not be afforded the full benefit of the return of capital that LP holders will, is going to get a tax benefit on LP distributions vis-à-vis what would have been available otherwise. So again, I think as we get closer, we're certainly happy to share some more color around it. We certainly understand the desire and interest in understanding exactly how much of those distributions will be taxable and we'll share some color with you once we get through that transaction and are in a position to give you that guidance.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America – Merrill Lynch: And that would be really helpful. Thanks, Tim. I appreciate your time. Thanks, guys.
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research.
Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC: Hi guys, can you hear me?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Hey, Paul, that's much better.
Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC: Good, good. I just want to assure you that I was not listening, I didn't bunk off to listen to the Suncor call; I was hanging on your every word.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: I thought you were in Australia sipping something good and...
Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC: You figured I was in Australia sipping something good, well, I don't know about that. I'm in midtown and I'm drinking coffee. Gary, to look back just to go over the not spinning Speedway. It was interesting that you guys gave a – I think it was a synergy number, but there was a sort of a benefit number associated with retaining Speedway. Long term, I think you've absolutely made the right decision to do what I think other companies are doing in terms of retaining control of gasoline distribution. Could you just talk a little bit more about that number that you gave, how the committee came up with that, and what goes into it? That was question one. Question two is a bit of a follow-up to Doug's, but I was wondering if you could – you're relatively very quickly going to get through this dropdown process, where do you see MPC going strategically from that point? One thing that you could talk a little bit about maybe is 2018 CapEx, but also where you see the long-term strategy development from this newly-shaped company? Thank you.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Right, Paul. And if you go back to Speedway, and you're right, we did publish a number of $270 million to $390 million per year, and then – that range is what we see as the integration value.
Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC: Right.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: And we continue to illustrate it very, very well here. Again, in this quarter, Speedway had one of the best quarters – I think top three quarters that they've ever had. But, that makes up all the ratable movement that we go through our refining system in the Speedway, the value in certain markets that we can glean out of Speedway. So all-in-all, as we look at Speedway again as borne out in this quarter, very, very strong segment for us, and we continue to see that going forward. Asking as we complete this drop, where do we see things going? And I I've answered this a little bit earlier that retail and growth in our Midstream is going to continue to be front and center in our strategy. We think our base refining system is in very, very good shape, and as Ray mentioned, I think we're in very good shape to be able to handle the IMO and be a strong margin taker when this IMO comes to play. But we look at the organic side of MPLX as being a strong growth element, as well as we look at Speedway as being a strong growth element for our business. And if you look at MPLX historically, and now that we're coming to the end of the dropdowns, we have a very strong inventory of organic projects, but we're really – I've charged Mike with really increasing our third party business. And for MPLX not to be dependent on just the business coming from MPC, but other third party business. You look at the linkage that we have between Refining and Midstream and through MPLX, it's great linkage. I look at the assets that are now part of MPLX that were MarkWest and the linkage that we have there, we have great opportunities to be able to move the Northeast NGLs I think to the East Coast eventually. We have opportunities we believe when Buckeye reverses the Laurel Pipeline to be able to make some movements that will lower cost to consumers in the Pennsylvania and Eastern markets. That movement is all about lowering cost to consumers, which I think can be supplied from PAD 2. So, we have many opportunities that we're looking at with a very, very strong refining base underlying all of those opportunities.
Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC: Right. So I mean, I think in the past you've been skeptical about the attraction of East Coast and West Coast refining. So it sounds like the refining base is going to be around where it is today give or take, and the growth is going to be as logistics play through the MLP?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, Paul, I believe two things – really three things there, if you look at three segments. There's definitely going to be further consolidation in refining, there's going to be further consolidation in midstream and we're seeing the consolidation happening in retail. So, there are going to be opportunities across. I'm not discounting that there may not be some opportunity in refining some day. Being upfront here that I don't see anything immediately on the horizon from a consolidation standpoint in refining. But certainly there's a lot of movement going on in midstream and in retail right now. And I think we have the ability, we've been able to show certainly that big acquisitions – we can execute on acquisitions and we can execute on delivering synergy. So – well, everything has to be at the right price that will be value generating to MPC.
Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC: Understood. Thank you, Gary. I'll let someone else have a go. Thank you.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thanks, Paul.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Spiro Dounis from UBS Securities.
Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to tag on to one of Brad's questions from earlier on differentials. How should we think about the WCS discount widening out from here with I guess Canadian production ramping up later this year? And just more broadly how you're thinking about heavy differentials in 2018 with potential for OPEC maybe ease up on the production cut?
C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, Spiro. Mike Palmer.
Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC: Hi, Mike.
C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. We're obviously watching the same thing and I think you've probably seen that – well, certainly during 2017, the heavy Canadian differentials have been fairly narrow and there's been – there still has been a lot of demand in the Gulf Coast for those barrels that's helping to drive that differential in. But with the increase in production that's coming on late this year and into next year, we've already seen those differentials that have started to widen. And again, MPC is in tremendous shape in order to take advantage of that additional supply, both in our Midwest system as well as on the Gulf Coast. So we do expect to see better heavy crude diffs in 2018 than we did in 2017. From the – when you start looking at the medium sours, generally the OPEC crudes, it's fairly clear that the Saudis and OPEC are working hard to bring the global petroleum back into balance. That's happening, inventories are coming down. We would expect to see continued pressure on the sour diffs until we get to the point where OPEC starts to put more crude into the market. And as that is the case, then we'll optimize, as we talked about earlier, with sweeter crudes. But the opportunity in 2018 right now – early on certainly looks to be with heavier crudes.
Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks, Mike. And then just follow up once again, sort of as you're approaching the end of this accelerated dropdown strategy and IDR exchange, just wondering if you could remind us again how you view at the general partner level – is there any – are there any options on the table to monetizing – I guess it will be a considerable ownership in MPLX? I think at one point, there was discussion of a potential GP spin-out. Is that something that's still on the table or are you kind of view that as off the table right now?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, it's Tim. I'm happy to answer that. I mean, I think, as we've talked even in the fall of last year, we were really evaluating all of the paths we could take with the GP. And I think where we landed was that ultimately buying of the GP's economic interest by the partnership in exchange for units was the best path for the partnership. So I'd say – I guess we always keep an open mind. I think it's highly unlikely we're going to proceed down a different path with regard to that value realization. We think ultimately the exchange for units is the best path there in terms of sort of retaining it. Now, your second piece of that I think was around liquidation of the units, and I'll tell you that ultimately these units coming back – again, we are effectively taking a pretty big slug of refining earnings and converting it into LP distributions. And those are fundamental to the system. I mean, those LP distributions-backed MPC will be a very big piece of MPC's discretionary free cash flow. And I don't think we have any intention at any point to liquidate these units. They are a fundamental part of the cash flow of the enterprise. And we would expect to hang on to these units for as long as we can imagine.
Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC: Understood. Appreciate the color. Thanks, Tim.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Justin Jenkins from Raymond James.
Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Just one from me today, and I think it piggybacks on your recent comment for MPLX, Gary. I guess with the, let's call it, carnage in the broader midstream space lately, if larger scale M&A opportunities emerge, would MPC be willing to consider waiving the IDRs ahead of the buying, if that were the case?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: I'm not sure I heard the last part of your question correctly. Waiving the IDRs...
Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Sorry. If there was an MPLX acquisition opportunity and it was large enough that equity were to be involved, would MPC be willing to waive the IDRs that could be associated with that transaction, not saying that one is out there, but just opportunistically.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Okay. I'm sorry, I just didn't hear it properly. That will be a case-by-case basis and we'll review that when the case comes. A very important point that – I'm glad you asked that question – that we really need to emphasize here. Where we set an MPLX and I use the word carnage in the midstream, we do not believe that – and in fact our numbers will illustrate that we are in a completely different position. We have outstanding coverage and we have outstanding growth targets and opportunities in front of us. So, we are in a very good shape and a strong balance sheet investment grade. So, we are in very good shape. We continue to have strong coverage and to have very strong growth as we go into the future. So if there are some opportunities, certainly we're going to take a look at those and see what fits best for our system and fits best for the growth of our unitholders and to continue to build that inventory that certainly supports the coverage in the MLPs.
Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Perfect. Agree with you 100%, Gary. Thanks for the response.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question today is from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank.
Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, thanks. Maybe just a couple of quick ones. On DAPL, can you remind us on expectations for distributions from the JV and maybe perhaps provide some color around recent Bakken differentials and your thoughts on go-forward sustainability?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: So, Ryan, this is Don. We have not given information on the distributions from DAPL, but I can say that to-date it is performing at least as well as the economic expectations that we had when we sanctioned the project and took it to the board. We're very pleased with the results so far.
Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And Bakken diffs, any thoughts on how those sustain going forward?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Bakken diffs, Bakken differentials.
Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. The Bakken diffs are something they trade every day at Clearbrook. And you can probably – you can probably find that somewhere in the trade press, Ryan. We continue to buy at Clearbrook, we're buying those at Patoka. I don't think you'll generally find those diffs at Patoka, and I'm not going to share those with you today, but they move around.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: And, Ryan, maybe the important point to be made is that the system that we operate has got so much flexibility and optionality that as – if those differentials open up, we'll run more and have got lots of options with regard to our crude system. So that's – I mean, I think that's probably the point where you want to focus is that we've got the flexibility and optionality every day to sort of identify those best sources of crude for our system, and we'll take action appropriately.
Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And maybe just a quick – a follow-up. You mentioned that you're trending 1.3% down year-on-year same-store sales in October on gasoline. I know domestic gas demand has been a bit of a conversation all year, but as we reach towards the end of 2017 here, can you give us some thoughts on what you think you're seeing on U.S. gasoline demand and maybe expectations as you look into 2018?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: You know, Ryan, it's very hard to take gasoline demand off of one month – yeah, we are trending down 1.3% for the month of October, but you have to take into context where crude prices have gone. And being a leader in most of the markets in which we have – which Speedway operates, we are the leader trying to get the incremental cost to the street. And when that happens, it costs some volume, but then we generally pick that volume up. I would say if you look at the same period last year, yes we're down a little bit, but last year was a very strong year, and we're continuing to hold on to most of that volume increase that came out of 2016 and through 2017. There's certainly some noise in the third quarter Speedway numbers because of all the storms. And one of the biggest things is people fill up when they have storms come, and they fill up and top all their tanks off with extra storage, wherever they can put it at their homes. And then you have a law to make up for that. So you're going to see some choppiness and noise over a period of time. So here in October's numbers, I would kind of take those with a grain of salt, just because there's been so much choppiness in the weather patterns in the country. But I think looking into next year, I think on gasoline demand, I think it's going to be probably flat with 2017, maybe slightly up depending – it's all going to be on where is the ultimate crude price going to be and what that takes the gasoline price to. But I think we would expect to see gasoline up just a little bit next year versus 2017.
Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Very helpful, Gary.
Lisa Wilson - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Okay. Thank you for joining us today. And should you have additional questions or would like clarifications on the topics we discussed this morning, Denice Myers, Doug Wendt and I will be available to take your calls. Thank you.

Operator: Welcome to the MPC's Second Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Elon, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Lisa Wilson. Lisa, you may begin.
Lisa Wilson - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thank you, Elon. Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's second quarter 2017 earnings webcast and conference call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, Chairman and CEO; Don Templin, President; Tim Griffith, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and other members of MPC's executive team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there, as well as in our filings with the SEC. Now, I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks and highlights. Gary?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thank you, Lisa, and good morning to everyone. If you please turn to slide 3. Before I begin, let me take the moment to highlight recent changes to our executive team. Don Templin, previously President of MPLX is named President of Marathon Petroleum Corporation, overseeing our refining, supply, distribution and planning and marketing operations. He also continues to serve as a Director on the MPLX board. Don has been an extraordinary asset to our company and shareholder since we became an independent publicly traded company in 2011, and we look to forward to his continued leadership as president of MPC. We're delighted to welcome Mike Hennigan, who has joined as MPLX president. Mike has replaced Don and comes to the role of 35 years of industry experience, most recently as President and CEO of Sunoco Logistics Partners, a role he held since 2012. He brings a tremendous depth of experience having led by most successful growth oriented massive limited partnerships in the market. We are very enthusiastic about Mike's joining and believe his appointment speaks to our commitment to grow our industry leading Midstream platform in MPLX, and drive long-term value for our investors. Moving to our second quarter highlights on slide 4. We are executing the strategic actions announced earlier this year to further enhance shareholder value. Following the completion of the first of several planned dropdowns in the first quarter, we used substantially all after tax cash proceeds from the transaction, to repurchase shares including $750 million in the second quarter. We are targeting the dropdown of joint interest ownership in certain pipelines and storage for several of these to MPLX in the third quarter with the proposed transaction currently under evaluation by the MPLX board and as independent complex committee. These assets are projected to generate approximately about $135 million of annual adjusted EBITDA. Work is also on schedule to prepare the remaining assets for dropdown to MPLX. This is expected to occur no later than the end of the first quarter of 2018. In conjunction with the completion of the dropdowns, we expect to exchange our general partner economic interest with newly issued MPLX common units. All transactions are subject to market and other conditions as well as requisite approvals. Additionally, a special committee of the board and its independent advisor are continuing to work through the assessment of Speedway and expect to complete this review and recommendation by the end of the third quarter. Turning to our results for the second quarter. This morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $515 million or $1 per diluted share, including a net charge of $0.03 per diluted share related to estimated losses for litigation matters, partially offset by Sandpiper asset liquidation gains. We delivered strong operational and financial performance across all segments of the business in the second quarter. Speedway continues to perform very well, reporting its third best quarter ever. Speedway delivered record second quarter segment income from operations of $239 million, surpassing the previous record set last year by $71 million on a normalized basis. Speedway's exceptional results were driven primarily by higher life products and merchandise gross margins and the outstanding expense control. Tim will provide some additional color on Speedway's performance shortly. We continue to focus on delivering top tier performance and expect continued growth in Speedway earnings, as we drive marketing enhancement opportunities, build new stores, remodel stores, and rebuild existing locations across our footprint. We continue to be very encouraged by the attractive investment opportunities that are available to us. Our Midstream segment, which includes the financial results of MPLX, also delivered outstanding performance in the quarter. MPLX reported record second quarter earnings, primarily driven by record process and fractionation volumes. This includes a 14% increase in processing volume and a 20% increase in fractionation volumes versus prior year. Investment in the partnership's Utica build-out projects, including the newly constructed Harpster-to-Lima pipeline, became fully operational in July. MPLX expanded the capacity of our East Sparta to Heath and Heath to Harpster pipelines. In combination with the cornerstone pipeline, these projects create additional fee-based revenue for the partnership and new access for Utica and Marcellus shale producers by moving condensate and natural gasoline through the Midwest. The partnership is currently constructing additional connectivity and expanding pipelines to provide more optionality for Midwest refiners. In addition to continuing expansion in the Marcellus and Utica, the partnership continues construction of the Argo gas processing plant in the Delaware basin. In July, the partnership also began construction of an additional gas processing plant to support growth in the STACK shale play of Oklahoma. The new facility, named the Omega plant, is expected to enter service in mid-2018. MPLX has continued strong financial and operational performance and robust set of growth opportunities clearly demonstrate the substantial and growing value the partnership represents to the total enterprise. We remain confident in MPLX's compelling value proposition to our investors. I would encourage you to listen in on the MPLX call at 11 o'clock this morning to hear additional color on the performance and opportunities for MPLX. Turning to refining and marketing, we reported solid quarterly results and continue to drive further process and cost efficiencies with the combination of our Galveston Bay and Texas City refineries. These refineries are now being operated and managed as a single combined refinery and will continue to be a critical part of our world-class Gulf Coast refining capacity. Moving forward, we will simply refer to this complex as the Galveston Bay refinery. Second quarter results were driven by record crude throughput of approximately 1.9 million barrels per day. After completing turnaround activity in the first quarter our Garyville and the combined Galveston Bay refinery complexes have each demonstrated crude unit run rate capacity of nearly 600,000 barrels per day. I'm also pleased to report that our Canton refinery has received the VPP Star certification from OSHA, joining in an elite group of companies that demonstrate exemplary occupational safety and health protection. Canton joins MPC's other certified VPP Star Sites including Garyville, Robinson, Detroit and Texas City refineries. And underscores our unshakable commitment to health, safety and environmental stewardship throughout our operations. As we enter the second half of the year, I also want to provide some observations of the macro environment impacting the business. We believe the global and U.S. macro picture remains solid and expect the good underlying economic growth will continue to support strong demand for our products, as inventory levels are worked down in the second half of this year and into 2018. Export markets, which have been important to the high utilization of our refineries are expected to remain robust. Exports remain a fundamental component in our refined products distribution and we continue to invest our support additional export capacity in our system. We think the prospects for more balanced supply and demand environment going forward will be supported what the global refined product markets we serve. With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk through the financial results for the first quarter.
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thanks, Gary. Slide 5 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. For the second quarter of 2017, MPC reported earnings of $515 million or $1 per diluted share. As Gary mentioned, results included net charge of $0.03 per diluted share related to estimated losses for litigation matters, partially offset by Sandpiper asset liquidation gains. The $515 million compares to last year's $801 million or a $1.51 per diluted share, which included a net benefit of $0.44 per diluted share related to the reversal of the lower cost or market inventory valuation reserve offset by an impairment of one of MPLX's equity investments. The bridge on slide 6 shows the change in earnings by segment over the second quarter last year. The walk highlights the decrease in Refining & Marketing offset to some extent by increases in earnings from Speedway and Midstream. The variance for both Refining & Marketing and Speedway segments include the absence of the $385 million pre-tax benefit to reverse the company's lower cost-to-market inventory valuation reserve reflected in the second quarter of 2016. $360 million of this benefit in 2016 was included in the Refining & Marketing segment, and $25 million was reflected in the Speedway segment. The $79 million favorable Midstream variance was primarily due to MPLX's record processing and fractionation volumes as compared to last year. The $51 million favorable variance shown in the items not allocated segments bar on the walk is due to the absence of an impairment of the equity method investment recorded in the second quarter of 2016, and our share of the gain on asset liquidations related to our investment in the cancelled Sandpiper pipeline project, offset by estimated losses related to ongoing litigation matters. Quarterly results were also impacted by $131 million of lower income taxes and $109 million of increased allocation of higher MPLX earnings to the publicly held units in the partnership; shown here is the negative variance in non-controlling interest. Moving to slide 7. Our Refining & Marketing segment reported earnings of $562 million in the second quarter compared to approximately $1 billion in the same quarter last year. Looking at our key market metrics, an increase in the LLS-based blended crack spread had a $374 million favorable impact to segment results primarily due to higher U.S. Gulf Coast crack spread. The LLS-based blended crack spread increased from $7.66 per barrel in 2016 to $9.18 per barrel in the second quarter of this year. This increase was offset by several unfavorable impacts during the quarter. First, higher RIN prices produced a $70 million unfavorable RIN/CBOB crack adjustment. This increase in cost was considered in our pricing decision and passed on to consumers, thus an equivalent offset resides in the product portion of our other gross margin. As a reminder and consistent with this treatment, we view the LLS crack and RIN/CBOB crack adjustment together as an effective realized crack spread. We could have simply reflected a $304 million positive crack spread, but are showing them separately here given the desire to provide visibility to both factors on an absolute basis. Second, a narrowing sweet/sour differential had a negative impact on earnings of approximately $93 million versus last year. The differential tightened from $691 per barrel in the second quarter of 2016 to $548 per barrel in 2017. Third, a narrowing contango effect, shown in the market structure column of the walk, resulted in the $115 million unfavorable variance. This is effectively a smaller adjustment of the crude acquisition costs versus the prompt crude prices used in the benchmark crack. Lastly, we experienced a decrease of $223 million in other gross margin in the segment. Higher actual crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs versus our benchmark basket resulted in a $169 million negative crude variance in addition to a $65 million negative impact, primarily related to lower non-transportation product price realizations and higher purchase RIN costs in the quarter. Moving forward to the other segments. Slide 8 provides Speedway segment results walk for the second quarter. As Gary mentioned, Speedway delivered record second quarter earnings of $239 million, up about $71 million after excluding the $21 million benefit from the LCM reversal in the second quarter I mentioned just a minute ago. An increase in light product gross margin had a $31 million favorable impact as margins averaged $0.184 per gallon in the second quarter of 2017, up from $0.155 in 2016 on the nearly 1.5 billion gallons sold in the quarter. Merchandise margin also contributed $2 million favorable impact to segment income. As a reminder, comparability of Speedway's results to prior year's second quarter was also affected by the transfer of Speedway's travel centers into the newly formed joined venture with Pilot called PFJ Southeast LLC in the fourth quarter of 2016. Speedway's share of the results of operations from the joint venture is reflected in income from equity method investments and is shown in the other column of this walk, while prior quarter activity remains in light product margin, merchandise margin and other categories. On a comparable basis, excluding the contribution of these travel centers, improvement in both light product margin and merchandise margin were higher than what is shown in the table. Similarly, an increase in other income of $38 million includes Speedway's share of the results of the joint venture with Pilot Flying J as well as lower direct operating expenses resulting from the contribution of the centers. So far in July, we have seen a roughly 2.1% decrease in same-store gasoline sales compared to last July as we continuously strive to optimize total gasoline contributions between volume and margin as market conditions adjust. Slide 9 provides the changes in the Midstream segment of $79 million year-over-year. The $62 million favorable variance for MPLX was primarily due to record processing and fractionation volumes as compared to last year. Results were also favorably impacted by changes in natural gas and NGL prices, earnings from the recently acquired Ozark Pipeline system, as well as increased earnings from pipeline equity method investments. Slide 10 provides a significant elements of changes in our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was nearly $1.5 billion, a decrease of approximately $700 million from the end of the first quarter. Core operating cash flow before changes in working capital was about $1 billion source of cash. Working capital was a $141 million use of cash in the quarter, primarily due to an increase in crude inventories and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Cash flow reflects net proceeds of $286 million from organic equity issuances by MPLX through its ATM program to fund its organic capital program. Return of capital to shareholders via dividends and share purchases was $936 million in the quarter. As Gary referenced, after tax cash proceeds from the first quarter dropdown had been substantially returned via share repurchase activity including the 750 million of share purchase in the quarter during the year-to-date total to $1.2 billion. Yesterday, the MPC Board of Directors announced an 11% increase in the quarterly dividend up to $0.40 per share. With this increase, MPC has achieved a 26% annual compound growth rate in the dividend since becoming an independent company six years ago demonstrating continued confidence in the long-term cash generation of the business. Going forward, we expect cash proceeds from the dropdowns and ongoing LP distributions to fund substantial ongoing return of capital to shareholders, all conducted with the continued focus on maintaining an investment grade credit profile at both MPC and MPLX. Slide 11 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the quarter. We had $12.6 billion of total consolidated debt including $6.7 billion of debt at MPLX. Total consolidated debt-to-book capitalization was about 38% and represented 2.8 times last 12 months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis or about two times when excluding MPLX. We continue to show debt to EBITDA excluding MPLX as we think it's more useful to show the independent capital structures given the effect of the relatively higher leverage of the growing partnership on MPC's consolidated metrics and our approach to managing capitalization separately. We're also pleased that in July, the complete replaced its existing bank revolving credit facilities expiring in July 2020 with a new five-year $2.5 billion bank revolving credit facility expiring in July 2022 and a new 364-day $1 billion bank revolving credit facility expiring in July of 2018. Slide 12 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the third quarter of 2017. We're expecting throughput volumes of 1.925 million barrels per day with some planned maintenance in the Midwest. Total direct operating costs are expected to be $7.10 per barrel. Other manufacturing cost on a per barrel basis are expected to be slightly higher than 2016, primarily due to higher forecast and natural gas prices in the same period last year. We expect to see an advantage to process lighter crudes in the third quarter driven by nearly 3,000 differentials. Sour crude is expected to make up 54% of our crude oil throughput in the third quarter. Projected third quarter – I'm sorry – estimated percentage of WTI price crude will be 24%. Projected third quarter corporate and other unallocated items are estimated to be at about €80 million. With that, let me turn the call back to Lisa.
Lisa Wilson - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thanks, Tim. As we open the call for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions. With that, we will now open the call to questions. Elon?
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question today is from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, team.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Hi, Neil.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Gary, why don't you start off with your latest thinking around the wholesale segment, and just the MLP eligibility of those assets whether PLR is required, and any comments there?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yes. We've -- I think pretty well exhausted the work on that question. We're still waiting on a well opinion, but we've become comfortable that we do not need a PLR from the IRS now going forward. Tim, you have anything else to add to that.
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. No. I think that's right, Neil. I think the only other comment is just that the new treasury regulations, which we've been through pretty extensively and with outside counsel all suggested that, our structure works as Gary said, with the caveat that those regulations don't go effective until January 1, 2018. But as Gary said, our comfort level is high that the structure we have contemplated is going to work in all the qualifying income for the partnership.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's great. Follow-up question and this is for both you, Tim and Gary, it's just thoughts on other gross margin, it's always a tricky thing to model, but any thoughts in terms of the key drivers in the quarter? And a related question is just on the sweet/sour differential. Gary, any thoughts you have there in terms of whether this is going to be sustainably lower or to how you see that playing out over the next six months to a year?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, Neil, the – we've tried to provide a little bit more color with regard to what the impacts have been in an actual space, so I think trying to get into a forecasting or predictive mode with regard to what we're going to see on product price realizations is very difficult, depending on the markets. As we highlighted here for second quarter, big driver was non-transportation fuels in terms of the product realizations and on the crude side, again some higher crude costs than what we see in the benchmark, but I'm not sure we can give any clear guidance as to exactly what will impact that on a going-forward basis.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yes, I'm going to have Mike Palmer here, Neil, to talk about the sweet/sour differential.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay.
C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, Neil. I guess what I would say on that is obviously we've talked about this narrowing sweet/sour differential, if you watch the LLS March spread, that it's been coming together for some months now. And I think in the short term that we would expect to see – to continue to see the sweet/sour differential narrow. But on the other side, I think that we do believe that rebalancing is occurring already, and as that does occur, I think we are going to see more foreign sour come back into the market, which again will allow the sweet/sour to widen. The other thing I would say is that, if you've been watching the Canadian heavy closely, the Canadian heavy was impacted a little earlier by planned maintenance, unplanned maintenance in the fields. It was also impacted by the Syncrude plant that had a fire that reduced the amount of synthetic available for blending, and it hurt the synthetic. But as we look forward toward the end of the year, or perhaps early in 2018, there is additional heavy production coming online of the Four Hills project. So we think there will be additional heavy Canadian that will help the spreads as well. So a little longer term, we're pretty constructive on the sweet/sour spreads.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Good morning, everyone. Gary, I was just wondering if you could – Hi. I was just wondering if you could give a little more color on the Speedway review process, I think the original guidance was around mid-year for the results, and then it became late summer, and now it's by the end of the third quarter. Is there anything that's taking longer as part of that review process?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Not really, Brad, in fact, I look at late summer and the third quarter has been pretty close to being equal. But anyway, this is not just a simple question on – I've had a lot of questions on the IRS, the PLR, if that's the gating item. The analysis goes much, much deeper than the IRS question and the supply agreement. We continue to make a very good progress and very detailed analysis, but you have to have a vision where, how the company can compete and what its balance sheet would look like with further steps down the road. So we're being very methodical in our review and we believe that combined with our board strategic session in September, really will be the combination of that analysis and we'll report then.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thanks for that. And then, there have been some press reports talking about a potential reversal of LOOP or not necessarily a reversal but just allowing exports through LOOP. Is that something that you guys are willing to comment on and is that a meaningful EBITDA potential for MPC?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Mike?
C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, yes, Brad. It has got some trade press of late. And certainly, from an export standpoint, LOOP does have a unique opportunity and that there are a deepwater port, they've got plenty of storage. They have relatively low investment to allow exports to actually occur, so they are very interested in moving forward with that. You know, MPC is the shipper, I guess the one thing that we would say is that we recognize the opportunity. The one thing that we're – that we want to watch is that again the primary responsibility of LOOP is to be an import facility and that's extremely important for us in our refineries. So while we see this opportunity, what we want to do is, we want to work with LOOP to make sure that there is no conflict between its responsibility as an import facility and one as an export facility.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the Paul Cheng from Barclays.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys, good morning.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Hey, Paul.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I think, this is for both – for Tim. Tim, on a going-forward basis upon the completion of the job done and whatever you decide on Speedway, how will it impact your thinking of the balance sheet and liquidity requirement? Is that changing given altogether that you will have job close to about $2 billion of the EBITDA into the MPLX, so how that may impact one way or the other in terms of your balance sheet and liquidity thinking?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, I think both developments would be certainly important to how we think about capitalization and the amount of leverage and liquidity that the business needs to maintain. We've certainly been actively involved in the planning around what things will look like sort of pro forma for all the drops, the amount of leverage that MPC would sustain. And we've talked about, I mentioned even as part of my remarks that we really view the capital structures independently and think that the consolidated metrics become less useful, but that becomes very important as the drop-downs play out and obviously a lot of earnings move over to the partnership, which is going to be more leverage. So, there is undoubtedly consideration of what the capital structure looks like with regard to the drop themselves. On the Speedway considerations, as Gary said, there is a multitude of considerations on not only what a spun entity looks like, what the remaining MPC would like, and it's hard to imagine that if there were some separation there that there wouldn't be some adjustment to the amount of leverage that MPC would sustain. But that is very clearly part of the overall analysis and assessment that's going on. I can't tell you exactly where we would target it, but I think it's pretty clear that the amount of leverage that the business without Speedway would be lower than what we could sustain in its current configuration.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Sure. Just wondering if there is any range of rates or any metric that you can provide preliminary?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Again, not at this time. I think, as Gary said, as the special committee completes its work, makes its recommendation to the Board, to the extent that it's helpful for people to understand how we thought about it, we will share any and all thoughts about what things could look like. But I don't think there is anything at this point that I think would be particularly instructive.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: The second question in on the second quarter, are we funding margin capture rate? Should we assume that is a reasonable quarter as a baseline or that has some unique circumstances that we need to adjust on a going forward basis? Because I was maybe surprised given that from the first to the second quarter, (31:05) has come down a lot. So I would have thought your margin capture rate comparing to their first quarter will improve a lot, but it doesn't seems that has been the case.
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, Paul. Again, and I think this is comparable to the question that Neil had asked on sort of other gross margin and product price realizations. Again, also in the second quarter from – on a sequential basis we are about flat. I don't know that there's anything unique around realizations or effective capture in second quarter that we'd highlight necessarily. So at the same time, I'm not sure I want to call it a normalized quarter either. But nothing I think that we would call out specifically that is an unusual item that occurred in the second quarter that we would not expect on a run rate basis.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Gary, just wondering if you had any thoughts on the situation in Venezuela and do you believe that U.S. ought to place sanctions on PDVSA, and what impact could that have on the company's crude imports or probably more importantly product export markets?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, let me first ask Mike to comment on what he sees as far as the flow of crude from Venezuela and then I'll comment on the sanctions question.
C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yes, Chi. So, obviously the Venezuelan crude coming into the Gulf Coast is important. We participate in that; we certainly buy heavy spot cargos from Venezuela during most months. So, yeah, if that crude was no longer available because of sanctions then we would have to replace that crude from somewhere else. And while we've had no difficulty replacing the crude that we've lost, that OPEC has cut, again, as we pointed out, I mean the sour crude there's not as much coming into the Gulf as there had been prior to the OPEC cuts, so it would not be favorable.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: And this is very hard, Chi, for us to comment on whether or not the government might put sanctions on Venezuela; I don't want to speculate on that. I'll just share that it appears to us that there's tremendous upset and turmoil in the country. We're concerned about the overall heavy supply. And when you look at the macro in the world, the global supply demand balance and the rapid retreat of inventory here from the first quarter to the second quarter, it appears as though there's going to continue to be some swings of where this crude ends up – its final destination is in the world. So if there were sanctions by the U.S., I think clearly this crude is going to find the home in other parts of the world, and probably some other heavy crudes would make its way back into the U.S., but more than likely they would be a little more expensive in doing so. But I don't want to speculate on sanctions of Venezuela.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. So I guess Gary what you're saying is that the maybe the heavier crude differential specifically in the U.S. would tighten further, but you still have – but that may not be the case globally outside the U.S.?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: It may not be the case, I mean, it's taking back the last two years we saw very little heavy crude coming out of Middle East into the U.S. and some of that is changing here recently as different grades are being made available to into different parts of the world. So it's – their crude will find a home, if there is – if there are sanctions put on them, it will find a home. And I would say if there is any change in the spreads, it is probably going to be short-lived.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. The second question here, it looks like this PAD 2 to PAD 1 product flow starting to take shape here in the Laurel Pipeline reversal is gaining some clarity, can you discuss anything regarding your volume commitment on that line and whether the company is also pursuing delivering batch product volumes on Mariner East II?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yes. We don't want to get in Chi into any commitments if any that we are going to make on Laurel at this time. We think it makes a tremendous sense to reverse that pipeline and to head east, but at this time we can't speak to any commitments.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Are you have anything specific on Mariner East II batching products as well as NGLs in that line?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Mike Hennigan is here, let me ask Mike to – he would able to answer that on batching product?
Michael J. Hennigan - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. One of the things that energy transport did when they offered Mariner East II was to provide a suite of options as far as shippers to evaluate. The main focus has always been the NGL side of the bucket, but they have offered refined product activity as well. So that's something that we'll have to evaluate going forward as well as some of our other options.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks, Mike. Welcome to the board by the way.
Michael J. Hennigan - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.
Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, good morning. I'll start with a question on Speedway. Tim, you talked about the volumes in July, down 2%, Wondering how that would compare to the overall market, just trying to get an assessment of what we are really seeing out there. And then secondarily, very strong merchandise margins in the quarter, and wondering what drove that, and how you think about the sustainability?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, Phil, we'll have Tony answer the merchandise. Just let me say while we are down 2% here in this month, what you have to set back and look at is, Speedway and mainly the markets in which they operate, they are the leader in the market. We've had an upswing in product cost, because of the increase in food cost, therefore it's our responsibility to get that price to the market you know and they lead the market to be able to try to recover those incremental cost. So in terms of a rapid increase in food prices, which we have seen over the last few weeks, you know, you're going to see an immediate response of the street, as we try to move that cost to the street. But you know once things equalize that volume comes back to us, because we clearly are the consumer's choice, first choice to buy our products in a normal market. But let me have Tony talk about merchandise and the merchandise margins.
Anthony R. Kenney - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, there is really a couple of things that's happening inside the store. One is, you know, we continue to focus on high growth, high margin opportunities in the store like food service, like a lot of our general merchandise categories, things that you'd buy in the cold walls. And so that definitely has a positive effect as we grow our sales we're going to be growing our merchandise margin right along with it. The other factor is that cigarettes continue to be in decline, and cigarettes carry the lowest gross margin inside of our stores. So you're getting a – we're getting a benefit also from the decline, the overall weighting in margin from the decline in cigarettes and the growth in the higher margin other items that I mentioned.
Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. Okay. Second question is just the commentary on the buyback. So I just want to clarify. So, it sounds like the buybacks that were completed in the first half of the year largely tie out with the proceeds from the dropdowns that have occurred. So as we look at the second half of the year and the timing and the amount of the dropdowns being a bit smaller and more pushed likely into early 2018 that we should see probably commensurate slowing the buybacks, really just a timing thing, but just clarify.
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. Phil, I mean, certainly for the $1.2 billion that's been bought back so far this year, I mean you can sort of draw the line between that and the after-tax proceeds from the drop. So, I think dropdowns will continue, as it has been the case for since we spun the company, we are always looking at what the liquidity position of the company is, and again to the extent that we've got cash flow beyond the needs to support the investment and working capital and short-term needs of the business, our first inclination is to return in the form of share purchase. So share purchase will continue, they will flex and flow based on the needs of the business at the time, but you will expect to see more, and the pace will adjust as we go forward.
Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And Tim, just to clarify maybe with Paul's question. The current level of leverage around 2.0 at the parent. I mean, that that's generally your comfort level, is that correct, or would you be willing to go higher in the current state?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. In think in the current configuration, we're about where we think is appropriate given our desire to maintain investment grade credit profile. So we're -- it's I think we're within the ballpark of where we think an appropriate leverage should be for how we sit today.
Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Good morning, everyone and good morning, Gary.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Doug, I've not talked to you for ages, where've you been?
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Nice to talk to you Gary. So my question is kind of going about to the post dropdown outlook for the refining business. And what I'm really thinking here is given the scale of the EBITDA drop when you're done, I have to assume that the sustaining capital for the refining business dropped somewhat as well as those obligations move to the MLP. Can you give us some idea what that change in sustaining capital is going to look like in terms of the as we think about the free cash flow coming out of refining business? And I've got a follow-up, please.
Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: So, Doug, this is Don, you're right. There will be some sustaining capital or maintenance capital that will flow to MPLX versus being in the refining business. So if you think about our forecast this year for MPLX that maintenance capital number is about $150 million, some of that is due to new acquisition, so we acquired the Ozark Pipeline that has a component, but a big proportion of that $150 million would be coming out of the refining business and going into MPLX.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: That's the number I was looking for. Thank you, Don. Gary, my follow-up, if I may and I realize this is a little sensitive given the timing but I think you've personally been pretty clear about your views on how you saw Speedway and again I apologize for this one, because it is a bit sensitive, but obviously the activist is going to reduce their position a bit as far as we can tell. It looks like maybe your review had won the day, but I'm just curious if you could give us your updated thoughts. Do you still feel that the benefits of integration of Speedway outweigh the potential benefits of separation? Again, I realize, you might be limited in what you can say, and I'll leave it there. Thanks.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yes, Doug. I understand your question very clearly, but I'm going to leave the answer to that to – in September, when we finish the work and we will announce to the market, we will call a meeting and announce to the market what our decision is. But it's too early to provide any direction either way. We've been very clear in all the presentations we've made, all the investor presentations that this is a very fulsome review. And when we make that decision, we don't want any investor to lean one way or the other. And I certainly am not going to provide any direction one way or the other until we finish up. As I said, we continue to meet with the special committee, they've asked us for some more work to complete that analysis. And we feel very comfortable here at late summer that we'll have that work done and we'll provide our conclusion.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I fully respect your position Gary, I understand the sensitivity. So maybe just clarify one thing for me. I think there may have been some confusion in the market on this. Are you pursuing a PLR on Speedway as well?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Tim can handle that.
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, Doug. We are – I mean, this is again part of the information that is important in terms of the overall assessment. So we are in the process, we've had some information request back and forth. And again that will be a component of the overall assessment, the nature of the relationship, they could be maintained between the entities and certainly an important part that we want to understand what the book ends are. So we'll continue to do that process, and the feedback learned, and garnered from that process will help to inform the view. But again, as Gary mentioned earlier, that's not the hinge points, that's an important consideration for sure, but there is multitude of factors that going to the assessment. But we are in a process to answer the question, and an active process of that, again there is we've had information sharing and request back and forth, and that will become part of the overall analysis and set made as the special committee completes its work and makes its recommendation to the full board.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Appreciate the answers, guys. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Spiro Dounis from UBS.
Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about the product mix, specifically around gasoline, it looks like last quarter percentage of gasoline as part of the total came down a bit. Just wondering, if that's how we should model it going forward, if this is a one-time thing? And generally, as you look out to the industry, do you think other refiners are doing the same thing, which maybe explain why we're seeing some pretty good gasoline drops?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Ray, do you have any comment on that?
Raymond L. Brooks - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, as far as the gasoline ratio of our production, we continue to look at the price at daily, weekly and adjust accordingly. We're configured the swing between gasoline and distillate?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Spiro, I'd look at gasoline, I'm glad you asked the question, because I want to get this comment out. If you look at bulk light products gasoline and distillate days of supply, we are now very comfortably within the five-year average, and in both coming close to the low end of the five-year average. And if you look at it globally, the refined products globally are pretty much at the lower end of the five-year average. Whereas in crude, you've seen a tremendous drop first quarter to second quarter, 50 million-barrel drop in crude, and we expect that to continue. We have pretty good optics of where the crude market is going over the next 60 days to 90 days, and we're expecting to continue to see those inventories drop. As those inventories drop on the crude side, I think it's also going to affect the make on the refined products side. The key I think refined product to watch is the distillate days of supply. As we come into the third quarter, the distillate days of supply last year were very high in the industry, and we are at one of the lower tranches of inventory right now, and I think that is going to bolster both distillate and should drag gasoline along with it, albeit gasoline is at pretty close to the low end of the five-year average as well. So, as Ray said, every day we make that decision every day on whether we maximize gasoline, maximize distillate. We can move in the range of about 8% has generally been our history, one product to the other, and we'll just see where inventories by region stand. And the other thing, the question I had earlier on Venezuela and exports, the gasoline export market continues to pick up, which is helping the gasoline inventory as we export it into other regions of the world; and all those things we take into discussion when we go forward.
Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC: Got it. And actually that segues into my next question. Just in terms of the export market, you've obviously highlighted pretty substantial export capacity in the past. But just wondering if there's any interest in maybe moving beyond the U.S. border either via retail or wholesale. Obviously, it's in the headline that some of your peers are doing that. Just if there's a first-mover advantage there, or it's just sort of fine where you're at for now?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. Where we're positioned in our Galveston Bay refinery, it gives us a great position to be able to supply the new market that is very positive of course as the supply into Mexico. We do not have any logistics advantage to the western side of the country of Mexico, but we certainly do coming in from the Gulf side. Yes, we are looking at should we get into the wholesale distribution, and whether or not we should even take some of our retail marks down into Mexico, we're considering that very strongly. And as we go forward right now, we think our best investment has been to export into the Gulf side of Mexico, and we've been very successful in doing that. And the margins that we've been able to pick up certainly have been a benefit to the other areas in the world where we sell our product.
Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC: Got it. Really appreciate the color. Thanks, everyone.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, good morning. Just a couple of follow-ups.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Hey, Faisel.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, Gary. On exports, can you just – I think you guys have mentioned off late, I didn't see the numbers, but in terms of gasoline and diesel, what did you do and sort of where is the primary strength in terms of the exports when you guys push that product out of the country?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, Mike can answer that.
C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. I think the number that we mentioned, Faisel, was the 313,000 barrels a day of total exports. And, yeah, we continue to see very robust demand for both gasoline and for diesel fuel. Latin America tends to be the biggest market for us; that's where the gasoline goes. Mexico, as Gary had mentioned early, Mexico has been buying a lot of gasoline. In fact, they had a refinery problem that even increased the volume that they needed to bring in. But we've also been successful in exporting diesel fuel to Europe. And many times this is on larger ships that gives them a bit of an advantage. So, yeah, the export market continues to be very robust.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then just on the buyback program. How much is remaining under your current buyback program and you guys have to go back to the board to re-up that number at some point in time?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, Faisel, we actually did and we announced in May that we had gotten additional $3 billion reauthorized from the board, so we're well over $4 billion of board authorization to do buybacks. And again, that was done, we shared this at the time that we announced it really to just enable us to execute the plan that's been laid out without need of going back to the board. So we've got all the capacity we need there.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Justin Jenkins from Raymond James.
Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I guess maybe starting with the follow up to Brad's question on LOOP, but does adding export capability there bring any other opportunity for organic pipeline growth? And does it do anything to change the equation and all with the Capline?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, LOOP, if you go south to north, that is the main artery that feeds Capline, and it makes a lot of sense long term to be able to reverse Capline and be able to take other cruise down into, down to LOOP and possibly for export down the road. I think before you look at export, if you'd ever reverse Capline, the first thing that we do, we'll supply the Eastern Gulf refineries from Capline, if you would ever reverse it, that would be the first and most important thing to us. If you look at what LOOP is considering, basically, it's a very low investment to be able to reverse that pipeline, a few valves, and a few incremental attachments to the buoys to import hoses to be able to put export facilities on the buoys to be able to end up loaded ships. But I don't see anything at this time as far as incremental pipelines other than the possibilities someday to reverse Capline.
Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. I appreciate that, Gary. And then maybe on the capital allocation front, as my follow-up. With the dividend increase yesterday things like the plans, healthy and ratable yearly increase, but is there a scenario where some big distribution number coming back from MPLX into MPC, starting in 2018, especially, is there a scenario where we could maybe match the MPC total payout with what's received from MPLX?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, Justin, clearly, we're going to reevaluate dividend policy relative to all of the cash flows that would be available to MPC at any point in time. So I mean, upon completion of the GP economic interest sale to MPLX and the take back of units, you're looking at an LP distribution stream back in MPC that is clearly going to factor into our thinking around sustainable growth to the MPC-based dividend. So that, I think the quick answer to your question is, it is undeniably going to be part of our overall assessment and we'll take a look at that at the appropriate time.
Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Perfect, I appreciate it guys.
Operator: Thank you and we do have time for one final question. Our last question today is from Corey Goldman from Jefferies.
Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here, and I will keep it just a one question here. So it's kind of just a follow-up to Doug's question on Speedway. And I think last call, Gary you were talking about how the drops in the IDR exchange to MPLX were being viewed kind of as a separate matter, pertaining to a possible Speedway separation. So I was just hoping to get some color in terms of how we're finding this view in that process. And with that the insight about $1.2 billion of turnaround of maintenance expense has occurred over the trailing 12 months. So I don't know if you can comment whether or not that review is taken to consideration, just the accounting treatment and the differences between MPC and some of its peers, any commentary on that will be appreciated?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: I'm sorry, Corey, but I don't understand your question.
Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC: When looking at kind of a possible Speedway separation, do you view this stub refining business, if Speedway were to be separated, as inclusive or exclusive of turnaround and maintenance expense, just given how that treatment in accounting kind of throws off MPC's EBITDA versus its peers, I just don't know how that committee or you guys were viewing that.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, if we were to spin-off Speedway, the RemainCo would be refining in midstream and refining would still have to have turnaround on maintenance cost and that would be definitely within the refining side of the business.
Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC: Do you view that like the multiple of that?
Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Corey, this is Don, I mean. I think that yeah, we are primarily focused on cash flow versus sort of the accounting treatment. We believe that there are some of our competitors that capitalize cost versus we expense those cost, but at the end of the day, the analysis is being done by us by the special committee. There is a focus on the cash flow generation capability of the entities, all the entities involved in MPC and the different scenarios that Mike developed if there were a Speedway separation or other actions taken. So, I would say we are not focused sort of on a EBITDA multiple, because one EBITDA has turnaround cost on it, one does not, we're much more focused on sort of the cash flow generation, the capabilities, the leverage metrics that you'd want to maintain that type of thing.
Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC: Well that's it, that's really helpful guys. Thanks so much.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thank you, Corey.
Operator: Thank you. And now, I'll turn the call back to Lisa for closing remarks.
Lisa Wilson - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thank you for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or would like clarification on the topics discussed this morning, Denice Myers, Doug Wendt and I will be available to take your calls. Thank you for joining us this morning. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Welcome to the MPC First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Lisa Wilson, Director, Investor Relations. You may begin.
Lisa Wilson - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thank you, Christine. Welcome to Marathon Petroleum's First Quarter 2017 earnings webcast and conference call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, Chairman, President and CEO; Tim Griffith, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and other members of MPC's executive team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there, as well as in our filings with the SEC. Now, I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks and highlights. Gary?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thanks, Lisa, and good morning and thank you for joining us. Let me begin with some highlights on slide 3. This morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $30 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. First quarter results reflect substantial turnaround activity at our three Gulf Coast refineries. In April, we successfully completed this turnaround activity ahead of schedule, under budget and with exemplary environmental and safety performance. I'm especially pleased with our refinery team's focus on safety with no lost-time injuries incurred in almost 3.5 million man-hours worked during the turnarounds. This marked the first set of turnarounds for the Garyville Major Expansion process units since they came online in late 2009, completing an outstanding seven-plus-year run. During the turnaround, we took the opportunity to upgrade process units such as the hydrocracker at Garyville, which can now operate at 121,000 barrels per day, a 73% increase from its original capacity. Turnaround work at our Galveston Bay refinery included the second of the refinery's two crude units. Both crude units have now been through a Marathon-conducted turnaround and are consistently processing over 500,000 barrels per day, highlighting the operational improvement we continue to pursue at the facility since we acquired it in 2013. Market conditions during the first quarter were challenging for Refining & Marketing. While crack spreads and sweet/sour crude differentials were favorable, these benefits were offset by weak product price realizations. Market dynamics, including higher inventory levels and seasonally weak demand, were both factors contributing to this weakness. That said, we have seen notable signs of improvement, including declining U.S. petroleum inventories and strong underlying economic activity. With our substantial Gulf Coast turnaround activity behind us, we are well positioned to drive continued top-tier operational, safety and environmental performance and take advantage of increasing refinery margins, favorable crude oil and refinery feedstock purchase cost, and seasonal improvement in our consumer demand for our products. Turning to Speedway, despite experiencing a slight decline in year-over-year operating results, we are encouraged by improving market conditions seen late in the quarter, with strengthening gasoline and distillate demand, and remain optimistic as we enter the summer driving season. We continue to be enthusiastic about the growth in our Midstream segment, supported by MPLX's strong financial and operational results in the quarter. First quarter segment income increased over last year due to growth in processing and fractionation activity in the Northeast and the Southwest, as well as contributions from our logistics and storage assets. On the growth front, MPLX completed several organic projects and strategic transactions during the quarter, further diversifying its asset base and strengthening the partnership's position as the largest processor and fractionator in the prolific Marcellus and Utica shales. In March, we completed the first of several planned dropdowns to MPLX as outlined in our strategic plan, and began funding a substantial return of capital to our shareholders. I'm pleased to report, work is on schedule to prepare the remaining assets slated for dropdown to MPLX. We also look forward to the exchange of our general partner economic interest for newly issued MPLX common units in conjunction with the completion of the dropdowns. All transactions are subject to market and other conditions, as well as requisite approvals. These actions are designed to unlock the value inherent in our midstream platform and to provide substantial ongoing return of capital to shareholders in a manner consistent with maintaining investment-grade credit profiles at both MPC and MPLX. Additionally, a special committee of the board and its independent advisor expect to complete the ongoing review of Speedway by mid-2017. We are enthusiastic about the future for MPC and MPLX, and remain focused on driving long-term value for our shareholders. With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk you through the financial results for the first quarter. Tim?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thanks, Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. For the first quarter of 2017, MPC reported earnings of $30 million, or $0.6 per diluted share compared to last year's $1 million, or less than $0.01 per diluted share. Recall that first quarter 2016 earnings included a goodwill impairment charge of $0.04 per diluted share and an LCM charge of $0.02 per diluted share. The chart on slide 5 shows the change in earnings over the first quarter last (06:29). Before I get into absolute results, I wanted to highlight a change in segment reporting as a result of our March 1 dropdown of terminal, pipeline and storage assets to MPLX. The results from these assets are now shown in the Midstream segment. Previously, these results were part of the Refining & Marketing segment and that shift is reflected in the earnings walk. Segment results show this reporting change from the date these assets were considered to be a business for accounting purposes: January 1, 2015 for pipeline and storage assets, and April 1, 2016 for the terminal assets. Accordingly, the terminal assets are reflected in R&M for the first quarter of 2016 and in the Midstream segment for the first quarter of 2017. For the year-over-year comparison, the walk highlights two increases for the quarter. First, Midstream reported an increase of $120 million, primarily driven by increased processing and fractionation activity and the earnings from equity investments in a new and existing pipeline and marine operations, as well as the change in reporting for the results of the terminal assets I just discussed. Second, the absence of impairment expenses in 2017 resulted in a favorable year-over-year effect of $129 million. These increases for the quarter were offset primarily by a $32 million decrease in Speedway earnings and a $150 million unfavorable variance in income loss attributed to noncontrolling interests. This $150 million variance largely reflects the year-over-year increase in MPLX's net income and its allocation to the public unitholders of MPLX, as compared to the partnership's net loss in the first quarter of 2016, driven primarily by the goodwill impairment charge last year. Moving to slide 6, our Refining & Marketing segment reported a loss from operations of $70 million in the first quarter compared to an $86 million loss in the same quarter last year. Before I review the segment results, I want to highlight the changes we've made in this walk aimed at providing additional insight into R&M income from operations. We've recently added a RIN/CBOB adjustment to the market data (08:29) to the walk to the right of the LLS 6-3-2-1 crack. This impact was previously captured in other gross margin on the walk. As this amount has been carved out of other gross margin, we've also provided a further breakdown of that category, highlighting how much relates to crude, products and volumetric gains in the period. We believe the renewable fuel obligation, otherwise known as the RVO. or RIN, is embedded in the refinery gate price of (08:59) gasoline and diesel, and the LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread reflects this cost. For obligated products, the RVO, like other costs, is incorporated into our trading and pricing decision and ultimately recovered and passed on to consumers. This perspective that RIN cost is reflected in the crack underpins our belief that moving the point of obligation has no real economic effect on refining profitability nor an impact on the viability of any specific refinery. We think this is a short-term look that is ultimately a distraction to the more fundamental changes that need to be pursued with Renewable Fuel Standard and the way it's been administered. As to the absolute Refining & Marketing results for the quarter, increased crack spreads in both Chicago and the Gulf Coast created a favorable impact of $441 million compared to the first quarter of 2016. The blended crack spread increased from $4.62 per barrel in 2016 to $7.72 per barrel in 2017. Also, a decline in RIN prices produced a $27 million favorable RIN/CBOB crack adjustment. As discussed, this benefit was considered in our pricing decision and passed on to consumers, thus an equivalent offset resides in the product portion of other gross margin. Several factors offset these favorable impacts during the quarter. First, a narrowing contango effect, shown in the market structure column of the walk, resulted in a $110 million unfavorable variance as the difference between the prompt crude prices narrowed in relation to the benchmark LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread, as we adjust the market metrics to reflect actual crude acquisition costs. Second, a decrease in other gross margin had a $162 million unfavorable impact to segment results, mainly due to weak gasoline and non-transportation product price realizations reflected in the $325 million negative product impact versus the first quarter last year. Third, we had an increase in direct operating cost of $144 million, primarily related to higher turnaround activity at our Gulf Coast refineries. As Gary mentioned, we successfully completed substantial turnaround activity at Texas City, Galveston Bay, and Garyville refineries during the quarter. While higher than last year, our direct operating costs of $9.45 per barrel in the quarter were about $0.60 per barrel better than what we expected in the quarter, due to strong cost management of the turnarounds. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect full year planned turnaround and major maintenance cost across our refining system to be similar to full year 2016 levels. (11:36) million unfavorable variance categorized as other in the walk relates to the March 1 dropdown and associated changes in segment reporting from Refining & Marketing to Midstream for the terminal assets that I referenced earlier. Moving forward to the other segments, slide 7 provides the Speedway segment results walk for the first quarter. Speedway segment income was $135 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $167 million in the same period of 2016. Comparability of Speedway's results to prior year's first quarter was affected by the transfer of Speedway's travel centers into the newly formed joint venture with Pilot Flying J called PFJ Southeast LLC in the fourth quarter of 2016. Speedway's share of the results of operations from the joint venture is reflected in income from equity method investments and is shown in the other column on the walk, while prior quarter activity remains in light product margin, merchandise margin and the other bars. Speedway's change in segment income, a decrease from light product gross margin, had a $31 million unfavorable impact as margins averaged $0.157 per gallon in the first quarter of 2017, down from $0.168 in the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in margin is primarily due to the lower margin per gallon and the absence of contributions from the travel centers for the quarter. Similarly, a decrease in merchandise margin of $10 million was due to the absence of contributions from the travel centers. Without this impact, merchandise gross margin would have increased over last year. Income was also lower compared to last year, given the $24 million gain on a location sale in the first quarter of 2016 compared to a $3 million gain in 2017. Partially offsetting these unfavorable variances is a $30 million favorable variance in the other segment income, which reflects the decrease in operating expenses due to the absence of the travel centers in 2017 and Speedway's share of the results of the new joint venture. In April, we've seen a roughly 2.3% decrease in same-store gasoline sales compared to last April. Speedway's same-store gasoline sales was impacted by higher retail prices versus last year and is in line with EIA published industry data. Slide 8 provides the changes in the Midstream segment income of $120 million quarter-over-quarter. The $86 million favorable variance for MPLX was primarily due to higher processing and fractionation prices and volumes, and income from the terminal assets acquired from MPC. As mentioned earlier, the Midstream segment income for the first quarter of 2016 does not reflect any results from these terminal assets since they were not considered a business for accounting purposes until April 1, 2016. The absence of financial results for the terminal assets in the first quarter of 2016 represents almost half of this favorable variance. Earnings from equity investments in new and existing pipeline and marine operations also contributed (14:41). Slide 9 presents the significant elements of changes in our consolidated cash position for the first quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was nearly $2.2 billion, an increase of approximately $1.3 billion from year-end 2016. Core operating cash flow before changes in working capital was a $703 million source of cash. Working capital was a $410 million source of cash for the quarter, due primarily to a decrease in current receivables and inventories, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Additionally, consolidated cash flows impacted by debt borrowing and repayments including MPLX's $2.2 billion debt issuance and MPC's repayment of the remaining $200 million under the term loan. Cash flow also reflects net proceeds of $148 million from opportunistic equity issuances by MPLX through its ATM to fund its organic capital program. Return of capital to shareholders via (15:46) $610 million in the quarter. After the dropdown closed on March 1, we executed $420 million of share repurchases in March and ended the month with an additional $60 million of share repurchases commitments that were settled in April. We would expect this activity to resume once we're out of blackout following the quarter. Going forward, we expect cash proceeds from the dropdown and ongoing LP distributions to fund substantial ongoing return of capital to shareholders, all conducted with a continued focus on maintaining an investment-grade credit profile at both MPC and MPLX. Finally, cash associated with the MPLX and Antero Midstream joint ventures, purchase of noncontrolling interest in a fractionation capacity at our Hopedale complex was the primary contributor to the $170 million source reflected in the other category on the walk. Slide 10 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the quarter. We had $12.6 billion of total consolidated debt, including $6.7 billion of debt at MPLX. Total consolidated debt-to-book capitalization was about 38% and represented 2.8 times last 12-months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis or about 2 times, excluding MPLX. We continue to show debt-to-EBITDA, excluding MPLX, as we think it is more useful to show the independent capital structures given the effect of relatively higher leverage of the growing partnership on MPC's consolidated metrics and our approach to managing capitalization separately. Slide 11 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the second quarter of 2017. We're expecting throughput volumes of 1.975 million barrels per day, up from second quarter 2016, primarily due to increased crude processing capabilities at Galveston Bay and Robinson. Total direct operating costs are expected to be $6.80 per barrel. Other manufacturing cost (17:47) higher primarily due to higher forecasted natural gas prices than the same period last year. We expect to see an advantage from processing sour crude as reflected in our expectation that it will make about 61% of crude oil throughput in the second quarter. Estimated percentage of WTI-priced crude is expected to be about 20%. Projected second quarter corporate and other unallocated items are estimated at $80 million for the second quarter. With that, let me turn the call back over to Lisa. Lisa?
Lisa Wilson - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thanks, Tim. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions. With that, we will now open the call to questions. Christine?
Operator: Thank you. And our first question is from Chi Chow of Tudor, Pickering & Holt. Please go ahead.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hey. Thanks. Good morning.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Good morning, Chi.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Gary, you – good morning. Yeah. Gary, you mentioned in your remarks that you're currently seeing more favorable feedstock costs. But it looks like to us that crude differentials relative to Brent have really tightened across almost all grades outside of Permian, in particular, for medium and heavy barrels. How do you reconcile your statement to what we're seeing on these market prices?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Sure. And let me have Mike Palmer who, of course, is in charge of buying 2 million barrels a day. Let me have Mike get into the details here.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hi, Mike.
C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, Chi. I guess we're fairly optimistic about differentials really. We think that if you look – start with the Brent-WTI spread, I guess we know it's been trading between $2 and $2.85. We think it's going to move toward the upper end of that range. That'll be favorable. We believe that if you look at the heavy market, for example, it has been influenced, obviously, by the Syncrude plant fire and explosion. Those differentials are now starting to come back to normal. So we think that will be attractive in the second half of the year. And, frankly, we've been seeing plenty of spot opportunities generally on the harder-to-process kind of crude oils, heavy sour, sometimes high acid. So, we still see plenty of opportunities.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: And, Chi, the other thing is, we've talked about this before with you and other analysts, we have the ability to run two-thirds sweet or two-thirds sour. And so, we have tremendous flexibility. Here in the first quarter, we almost topped out at close to two-thirds, probably can run a little bit more of sour, but it just shows the tremendous flexibility we have to go back and forth and take advantage of whichever crude gives us the best economics; and we answer that question every day. So, I think that flexibility, along with Mike's comments, is really what gives us some optimism.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. I guess on the Canadian situation, how is that impacting your crude supply strategy here in the second quarter in the Midwest? And then, I guess just more broadly, the OPEC cuts and the production declines we're seeing in Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela are very steep, and it just seems like this may be a longer-term issue on tightening this. But, do you have any concerns long term on these issues?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Mike?
C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Chi, I guess what I would say is that we do believe that there's a lot of OPEC resolve to bring the market back in balance. So, we do think in the second half of the year, that's certainly going to be a factor. I think from our standpoint, what I would tell you is kind of what Gary already has. We have a lot of flexibility within our system both in terms of running sweet crude, running very heavy, high (22:27) crude. We have a lot of logistics opportunities and flexibility. So, I don't think it's going to be a problem finding crude oil to run. And I think that we're in a position where we can find the most cost-advantaged crude to run as well. With regard to your question on Syncrude and how that's going to affect the second quarter, again, it kind of comes back to the same story. We have a lot of flexibility to process synthetic crude oil in our plants, but when we see something like the Syncrude explosion that takes place, to us it's an opportunity. And that means when Syncrude gets expensive, we'll sell off the Syncrude and we'll bring in another crude. We've got the flexibility to do that. So, that's kind of how we see it as we move forward.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: You bring barrels up Capline and do you slack the coker at Detroit because of the heavy dose type unit? I'll leave it there.
C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: No. We haven't seen a need to slack the coker at Detroit, no.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. Okay. Thanks, Mike. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, Gary.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Neil, how are you?
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Doing well. The first question is around share repurchases. We had a nice number here in the first quarter, supported by the dropdown. Gary, can you just talk about your strategy around share repurchases and how aggressive you think you can get around reducing your share count in 2017?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Sure. And I'll have Tim help me here. But this is clear, from our January 3 announcement, what our plans were and this is right on with our strategy of returning capital to shareholders. So, we were very aggressive here in the first quarter. We've elected to use our internal sources versus an ASR. We just think it's better for us, better for the economics of the share repurchases to do it internally than to go out and do one block. But our plans are – we did $420 million here, really $480 million if you look at what wasn't settled, kind of overlapping the end of the quarter. But we expect to continue to be very aggressive in share repurchases. Tim, you want to add into that?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Gary, I think that's right. I mean, ultimately, our activity was bounded to March for the first quarter, but we expect this activity is going to resume into second quarter. And I think you could expect to see similar pacing as we go forward and utilize the drop proceeds.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's great, guys. And the follow-up is on Speedway, and it's a two-part question. I guess the first is, Tim, can you read out that demand number again or retail sales number for April? I just want to make sure I got it. And just, in general, what you're seeing in terms of volumes going through the system? And then, Gary, I recognize we are still going through the process here. But, how are you thinking about the latest in terms of what to do around Speedway from a corporate structure perspective?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Sure.
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. Neil, the...
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Tim or Tony, you want to handle the first part?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. Sure. Neil, for April same-store, so far we've seen about 2.3% decline on year-over-year for April and I'll hand it over to Tony for his comments.
Anthony R. Kenney - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. And, Tim, that's really reflective of the market conditions so far that we've seen. So, actually, Speedway, the U.S. market demand data suggests it's down slightly more than Speedway, so we're tracking that. One of the factors in there is the average retail prices are up year-over-year as well. So, that's part of it.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: And, Neil, if you look at, average retail is up $0.40 to $0.50 over same period last year. I go back and looked at the first quarter and we're early here in April. This number here of 2.3% was just for April. But if you look at first quarter, we were down 1%, so we outperformed the overall market significantly, Speedway did in the first quarter. But with our position in the market and needing to get this increase in the wholesale price and crude cost to the market, I think that's what has had a temporary lull in demand. As far as our study, our full and thorough review, as we've stated on Speedway, it continues to clip along at a very good pace. The special committee is very engaged. Our outside advisors are engaged and by mid-year, the definition of mid-year will be sometime summer or late summer, we will have a conclusion of the direction we're going. So, we continue to move along rapidly in this study.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Thanks, Gary. We'll stay tuned.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Edward Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse: Yeah. Good morning, Gary, and congrats on getting a big maintenance schedule behind you.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thank you.
Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse: I guess just on that maintenance schedule quickly, I mean there was some self-help going to be coming through an Analyst Day from a few years ago, I think $350 million. And that was up from $175 million last year. Are these turnarounds going to deliver some of that improvement in the assets that was behind some of those Analyst Day slides?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yes, Ed. In fact, in my comments I talked about the hydrocracker. When we first built Garyville, that hydrocracker was rated at, I don't know, 70,000 to 72,000 barrels per day. And now, we have the hydrocracker only with improved technology, very little incremental capital. We have it up to, I think, the second largest hydrocracker in the world at 121,000 barrels per day. We're seeing the same thing at Galveston Bay. Now that we've been through both crude units, improved the technology, improved the operations and really been through Marathon-style turnarounds, we have that plant now up, running 500,000 barrels per day. The same thing at Robinson where we upgraded some systems at Robinson. So, the systems, the technology is in place. And that's what's important here in our comments is that we didn't go out and build new units. We improve the technology, improve the – some of the operating and mechanical performance of the process units in order to be able to increase the throughput. So, I think we're right on schedule. Of course, everything is a result of how margins are. But, the other thing that I think is important – I was talking to Tom Kelley who runs our Marketing group. We're expecting a strong year in asphalt. And as – a question we had earlier on can we – would we slack a coker, well, we have the flexibility to even make more asphalt if the market requires, and we're starting out the first quarter here, as we start into the asphalt season, a very strong demand, up over 6% versus same period last year. And I think that flexibility is going to help us as well. So, all of these things should deliver. We have the opportunity to deliver the incremental economics that we've talked about in the past.
Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse: And then switching, I mean so many things to talk about to MPLX. I mean, one of the things that was going to be a result of the merger was the synergistic investments. There's the Alky, there's NGL long-haul pipes, NGL exports, Centennial, some of the infrastructure you have. Maybe any comments as to how far we are along in terms of some of those decisions?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Sure. Don?
Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. Sure, Ed. As you probably saw in the MPLX update, as well as the MPC one, we are working very hard and focused on growing our organic backlog. And, in fact, our guidance for organic growth capital has increased up to the top end of the range as $2 billion this year and we are continuing to identify a lot of those opportunities. So, we're very optimistic about the outlook. We are very optimistic about sort of what our producer customers are experiencing, particularly in the Marcellus, and also in the Southwest we have some exciting opportunities in the Delaware Basin supporting our producer customers there. You asked specifically, I think, about the Alky project. We have done a lot of analysis around that. As you recall, the driver of that was driven – the economics were being driven by the differential between butane and sort of octane value. Currently, that differential isn't strong enough in our view to go forward with that project, but there's been a lot of engineering done around that and to the extent that there are the market factors and the economics would support that project, that one can be revisited and accelerated in terms of implementation.
Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse: So, to summarize, most of the pull that you're seeing on organic CapEx is sort of gathering, processing, closer to the upstream wellhead?
Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. I would say that and there are opportunities and we're continuing to explore opportunities at around pipelines, in general. I mean, clearly there's a lot of build-out in the Permian generally and to the extent that you can get product to the water and provide producer customers alternatives to just the domestic market, people are very interested in projects that would allow them to do that and we're continuing to explore those types of projects.
Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thank you.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: And, Ed, to your question on Centennial. Centennial still can be a resolution to be able to get incremental propane, butane, maybe even ethane to the Gulf Coast and it's – we continue to work with our partner on this project. However, the producers who are looking for that additional route and additional market are still analyzing which direction they want to go. And we're not ready to pull the trigger on this project yet, as we continue to work with the producers to get their commitment on whether or not that reversal goes forward. So, we're working it hard, but the producers have to make the decision if they want a second market.
Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey guys. Good morning.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Hey, Paul.
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Good morning, Paul.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Gary or maybe this is for Tim. Tim, if we're looking excluding MPLX on a pro forma after you finish all the job and the exchange of the GP, where is the sweet spot for you from MPC standpoint, the net debt-to-EBITDA or net debt-to-capital of those ratios? And how those ratios may change that if you have decided to spin off Speedway?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, I think for how we view things today, we sort of view the – around 2 times on a net of MPLX basis is probably an appropriate area. Again, we've focused on maintaining an investment-grade credit profile, we'll continue to do so. Again, the prospects of any change to Speedway is something we'll have to assess as we go. It's certainly been an important part of the cash profile of the business. And if that were not a part of the business, I think we'd need to reassess and understand what that impact would be. It may very well support a even lower leverage than that. But that's clearly all part of the overall analysis and assessment that we're going through, and that will clearly be an important part of our consideration, so.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And from an accounting standpoint, when we go for the dropdown, the remaining of the dropdown, the EBITDA loss from the refining, are they going to come out from the gross margin or they're just for the gross margin realization or they're just going to be all increased in the refining expense line?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, again, depending on exactly how it's structured, for what we've got contemplated for fuels distribution, for instance, or for the refinery assets, that would be earnings that would have an impact on gross margin.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: When you do the dropdown, will you be able to just maybe, at the time, give us some idea so that we know how to model?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. I think we can probably provide some framework around what that could look like. The important part, from an MPC perspective, is that for a lot of the earnings that could have an impact on the R&M metrics, we're effectively turning it into a distribution stream that's coming from the partnership. So, again, we've continued to view this as sort of an enterprise-level initiative, but we certainly can provide some frameworks around the best way to think about things on a more segmented basis.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That would be really appreciated. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brad Heffern of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Good morning, everyone. Gary, I was wondering if you could put some more flesh on the bone on sort of your macro comments to start the call. It sounds like, at least, in your retail system, you're seeing headwinds on the gasoline side. I think your guidance is for a record throughput in the second quarter. The rest of the industry has been running at record levels over the past few weeks. So, is there a concern that whatever demand growth we are seeing is just going to be offset by people running so well post such a heavy turnaround season?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, Brad, I think the key ingredient to your question is where we see exports going and we see exports while we were a little over 200,000 barrels a day, we export 226,000 in the first quarter. But our book going forward gets us back into the historical range of 300,000 barrels a day, plus or minus a little. So, the export book continues to be strong. It looks like we're – from a macro level, we're fairly – I would say, it's evident that we're kind of teeing up to be in the same position of last year. Inventory share in the first quarter from the gasoline side, especially pads 2 and 3, are on the gasoline, distillate inventory, are pretty much in check what they were last year. First quarter inventories and the market seem to take a pause yesterday on why gasoline inventory built in PAD 1 here last week, but that's all of the timing of cycles coming through Colonial, some cycles possibly from Plantation Pipeline, but – or maybe just the – when some imports hit the New York Harbor. But, all in all, it's early in April and Tony talked about a slight pullback in demand, but that's because we're up $0.40 to $0.50. So, from a macro standpoint, I think the crude market is going to continue to have strong resolve in trying to get crude prices up. I think that's going to help in differentials over the same period. But I believe as long as we stay in this range, we're kind of ranged $2.25 to $2.50 in gasoline right now. I would expect demand to be about the same as this period last year. And I think everything – the flywheel is going to be the exports. And export demand continues to be strong. So, I think we should be okay.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thanks for that, Gary. And then I was wondering if there's any update on the fuels distribution private letter ruling, is that still being pursued and where are we in the process?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Sure. Tim?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Sure, Brad. So, with regard to the strategic plan, I mean, I'll give a broader update that we're very much on track with all of the sort of remaining drops and putting the company in position to proceed with those. With regard to the fuels distribution specifically, again, we were obviously very pleased to see the new QI regs issued in January and made part of the Federal Register. Based on our reading of them, it looks like it'll be supportive of our model. They do have an effective date of January 1, 2018, and right now it would be tough for us to rely for activity in 2017 on that, but we'll pursue every angle. Again, I think the net result is that we're still very encouraged by the prospects and having everything ready to go, and we'll evaluate any and all alternatives to sort of accelerate that, but we feel pretty good about the path forward right now.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: And, I'm sorry. Christine, I just wanted – Paul, your question with regard to the drops and the impact on the refinery piece, I want to just clarify. The impact on segment income for R&M will certainly be there. But it more likely will get picked up in sort of other cost. It'll be sort of an operating cost imposed within the refining system as a service contract. So, I'd indicated part of R&M gross margin, but actually it will be picked up in sort of other elements of operating expense within R&M. Nonetheless, when we get to that point where it can be helpful, we'll certainly try to provide some framework around it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC: Yeah. Hi. Good morning, everyone. It's really a follow-up to all the above questions. If you could just step back and give us the overall timeline. Is the next event going to be the independent committee? And then, would it be the private letter ruling? And is the best guess that the whole process of restructuring is completed by end of the year? Thanks, guys.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, Paul, it's good to talk to you. Haven't heard from you in a long time.
Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC: Hey, man. Hi, Gary.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. Yeah. To go through the – the next step would be, more than likely, as we had outlined earlier, we would expect to have late second quarter, early third quarter another drop. And then the drop we're looking at, we think, would have minimal tax impact based on the tax reform discussions that are public at this point in time. One thing that I think we all need to be cognizant of, and I know many of the investors that we've talked with, who have asked us questions, is to ensure that we're keeping a close eye on how tax reform might affect, whether it's a 12 – a December dropdown or whether it's a January, early 2018 dropdown, depending on how whatever tax changes might go into effect. And, of course, we're continuing to work and be very diligent in what that tax planning might be. So, the next thing would be a dropdown sometime mid to late summer. Secondly, we will follow through with the study of Speedway through the special committee. And then, lastly, and we're proceeding on, we will have all of the drops ready from an accounting, finance, tax, administrative standpoint. We're pursuing and working very, very quickly to get all of those drops ready. Tim just explained the PLR process, which is positive. So, everything will be ready to go, but I think everybody would conclude that we need to be as tax efficient as possible.
Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC: Understood, Gary. And then speaking of having not spoken for a while, when we last spoke, it was before the inauguration, 100 days of this presidency shortly coming up. How have things changed? I mean, of course, border tax is a huge issue and we last spoke – what's your latest perspective on what's happening in DC? Thanks.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yes. Then that's a very good segue into this tax reform. If you noticed what the President, Secretary of Treasury and Mr. Cohn announced yesterday, you didn't hear the words border tax anywhere in that preview. And so, I think the work that not only we have done, but the entire business community continues to work on is that border tax just doesn't seem to work going forward. So, that's very positive and I recall speaking at your conference. That was a big issue. And as I said, we had a lot of work to do and, so far, I think we've been successful in outlining and trying to educate what that meant for companies such as ours in our industry. So, our work, we continue to be very, very positive with this administration and the President and his outlook on the energy industry, his outlook on where we think some positive steps can be taken on renewable fuels. And, obviously, with the pipeline permits that have been approved that helped get DAPL up and going and we expect mid-May for the first deliveries to come out of DAPL, that is certainly going to be a positive for us in our Midwest refineries. So, all in all, very, very positive with this administration.
Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC: Thank you very much, Gary.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, good morning. I guess I'm going to ask one more tax question just as a follow-up to your comments about the next drop. I believe all in, it's a question for Tim, you had expected a roughly, I think, $1 billion tax implication from this entire plan. I'm wondering if there's any update to that, kind of ignoring what might change here. And then secondarily on tax, do you expect the consolidated tax rate to come down at all as more income flows to MPLX? I know the first quarter was a bit below the trend of last year. So, I'm just wondering how that might progress.
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. I think, Phil, I guess, to answer the question, two parts. One is, what the cash tax impact would be on the drops, I think, and ultimately the guidance we provided around that of roughly 20% over the course of the full drops we think is still appropriate. The effective tax rate for the corporation will be impacted over time as the drops are commenced, given the NCI impact and the amount of allocated income that will go to unitholders. So, there will be sort of an evolution over the course of the drops that will very likely drive down the effective tax rate over the course of the next couple of years. And, again, as we get closer to that and we can provide a little bit more clarity, we'll try to do so.
Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then, just a second question. You had given a wide range, I think, around potential valuations for the GP-LP swap. I think it was around $9 billion to $12 billion type of range a while back. I'm wondering if you've dialed in on that any more at this point. Any additional color you might be able to provide?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. Phil, again, I think the range that we gave at the time we thought was an appropriate range, I don't know that there'd be any updates. The valuation of the GP interest is clearly going to be part of a comprehensive process that we will do an assessment. We will make a suggestion as to what we think that value is worth. We'll work through with the MPLX board and its conflicts committee and ultimately land on evaluation. So, I don't know that there's any more color or adjustment to a range that we'd provide at this point. Again, this is a process that's out in front of us and I think the range that we've given is one that we still think would be appropriate.
Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Last question, just on the product-related component of the other gross margin, it was definitely softer than any quarter of last year and you made some opening remarks on this. Just wondering if any of that was perhaps one-time in nature. I think there have been some other publicly-traded retailers that have talked about some wholesale headwinds in the quarter. And I'm just curious, has that, in any way, influenced the product-related component of the margins this quarter?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Mike, do you have any comments?
C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: I guess, I'm not clear on what this one-time issue was, Phil. Could you explain that further?
Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: There are some wholesale headwinds called out, in particular, Colonial line spacing values and things like that, that other companies have talked about. I wasn't sure if that in any way – I believe wholesale is still in your refining business, your refining segment, but I didn't know if there were...
C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yes, it is.
Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Any particular headwinds there that you think influenced you, that might have been temporary in nature?
C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: We have seen – certainly in January and February early on, we saw specific weakness in some of our markets. And I think that's improved somewhat in March and April. But in terms of one-time events, no, I don't – I can't think of anything.
Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Right. Yeah. Okay. That's good. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Corey Goldman of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning. Just a quick follow-up, Gary, to your comments regarding Centennial. Just to go the other way towards the east. So, with SXL formally moving forward with the expansion on ME2, which allows a little bit more than 0.5 million barrels a day move west to east. Just wondering since that pipe will be capable to move refined products, can you comment on MPC's appetite to move some gasoline or diesel to the East Coast and what would be needed from MPC to make that possible?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Sure. And I'll let Mike talk about that since he manages all of our movements.
C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. That's certainly something that we're interested in and watching. In our Midwest refining system, we do have further capacity that could be used. And certainly it's seasonally during the year we need further markets. We've talked about this before. So, we're interested in moving additional product outside of the Midwest, and we'll look at that over time.
Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC: Got you. And then were there any impact to Speedway if you were to start moving product towards the East Coast?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: No. That wouldn't have any impact to Speedway at all.
Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And then just a last question from me. Presumably, the dropdowns to your point about timeline won't be completed before the Speedway strategy is announced. So, just wondering, how does the committee look at a Speedway strategy if the MPLX portion is kind of yet to be completed? In other words, we won't have a view on really the value of those IDRs until after the Speedway committee kind of came to a conclusion. So, I was wondering how they view the changes at MPLX and the value proposition there and what that means for Speedway within MPC.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: I would say, Corey, that those are two different matters that, the value of the IDRs will really have no impact on the decision of Speedway one way or the other. Speedway is already – the volume that goes through Speedway is already implicit in MPLX, and the amount of volume that we're moving through MPLX today. But I would say that it really wouldn't be a determinant either way.
Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC: Isn't the committee looking at whether or not Speedway is valued properly in MPC though?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Oh, absolutely. What I'm saying is, you asked a question on how Speedway in or out of MPC would affect the MPLX – the drops of MPLX. I'm saying that doesn't matter either way. We still have the volume that's already inside of MPLX and would expect – and that's one of the big questions is, can you have a supply agreement attached to – if you decide to go a spin route, can you have a supply agreement attached to that spin in order to be able to maintain the volume that goes through? That's yet to be determined, but what I'm saying, I don't see the volume. We would expect that we would have a supply agreement either way. So, that really is not going to have an effect, but absolutely, the committee is looking at the value.
Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Understood. Thanks, Gary.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Spiro Dounis of UBS Securities. Please go ahead.
Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC: Hi, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just two quick ones. Gary mentioned the strength or potential strength in asphalt this year. Just curious on when you think that can really start to impact the capture rate and product realizations as we kind of go through the second quarter. And then just along those lines, maybe just give us more color on, I guess, why you think there's going to be that much strength this year versus last year.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, you just look at the backlog of projects and the inventories of asphalt that we came out of the end of last year, the inventories that are available of asphalt. So, that's why I make that statement, but I think it's the infrastructure that's required in the U.S., this administration is very bullish on infrastructure and improving roads, bridges, and so we expect that we're going to have a strong asphalt season, Q2, Q3, mainly because of the inventory that we came out of last year. So, being up 6% early in the asphalt season, I think, is a good indicator and with our flexibility of going through the cokers or making asphalt, that gives us another real strength versus some of our competition.
Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC: Got it. Okay. And, once again, Gary, you've been pretty open before on just, I guess, providing some views around OPEC and potential decisions. Just curious, I guess, we're about a month out now on the next meeting, just your thoughts around that and what might happen around the oil price.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yes. Mike Palmer was – in his comments earlier, illustrated the strength and the resolve that we believe is in OPEC. As we look at OPEC, I stated early in the year that we expect to end this year in the $60 to $65 range. I still think that that is still in line with where we see the crude markets going. The resolve of OPEC, and you will continue to see that, I think, in the inventory numbers going forward, that there is a very strong resolve to get worldwide inventories in check. It certainly appears as though there would be an extension of the OPEC agreement into the second half of the year. I believe as the oil minister Khalid al-Falih stated that he thinks that is important to continue to get global inventories in check. And with that, I think it's going to have a double-prong effect. I think it's going to bring worldwide inventories closer to balance. And secondly, it's going to be a win for the U.S. producers, because as the price continues to go north of even $50, but if we get up in the $55 to $60 range and with the efficiency and reduced cost that the U.S. producers are seeing, it's going to be a strength for the Permian, Eagle Ford, Bakken areas in their production. And I think that's going to certainly help us with our acquisition of the Ozark Pipeline. It's going to give us that ability to move barrels through Cushing into the Midwest, bring barrels down from the Bakken. And I think it should help differentials over time.
Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC: Got it. I really appreciate the color. Thanks, everyone.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thanks, Spiro.
Operator: Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Lisa Wilson, Director, Investor Relations, for closing remarks.
Lisa Wilson - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thank you for joining us today and your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or would like clarification on topics discussed this morning, Denice Myers, Doug Wendt and I will be available to take your calls.

Operator: Welcome to the MPC Earnings Call. My name is Jason and I will be your operator. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.  I will now turn the call over to Lisa Wilson. Lisa, you may begin. 
Lisa Wilson : Thank you, Jason. Welcome to Marathon Petroleum's Corporation fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings webcast and conference call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our Web site at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, Chairman, President and CEO; Tim Griffith, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and other members of our MPC executive team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on Slide 2. It is a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC.  Now I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks and highlights.
Gary Heminger: Thanks, Lisa, and good morning to everyone. If you'd please turn to Slide 3. This morning we reported fourth quarter earnings of $227 million or $0.43 per diluted share and full year earnings of $1.17 billion or $2.21 per diluted share. We were pleased with the results for the quarter across all areas of the business, despite a 2016 that proved to be challenging from a commodity price and margin perspective. We are also enthusiastic about MPLXs 2016 results. One year into the combination of MPLX and MarkWest, and remain very encouraged by the growth opportunities in front of the partnership, which will continue to be a source of long-term value for our investors. Moving to the company owned retail business in 2016, Speedway set all-time records for the year, while continuing to maintain its disciplined approach to cost control. Speedway surpassed segment all-time highs in income from operations, light product gallons sold, merchandise sales, and merchandise gross margin on both the percentage sales and absolute dollar basis. Speedway continues to exceed expectations by driving marketing enhancement opportunities and continuing to realize acquisition synergies across the network. Turning to refining and marketing, Garyville successfully completed the largest turn around in its history during the quarter. As part of the turnaround we completed an SEC LTF grade project, increasing Garyville's production capacity of high value Alcolift and light products. We also completed the Galveston Bay refinery export capacity expansion, increasing Galveston Bay's export capacity by 30,000 barrels per day, increasing our total export capacity from both the Galveston Bay and Garyville refineries to nearly 400,000 barrels per day. This morning we also announced our 2017 capital investment plans for both MPC and MPLX, which remained focused on strengthening the sustained earnings power of our business to growth and margin enhancing projects, as well as expanding on more stable cash flow businesses. We are discussing these capital plans separately as the funding will be managed independently and we think the consolidated totals will be less useful going forward. Our capital investment plan for MPC for 2017 excluding MPLX is $1.7 billion, this planned spending for MPC is roughly in line with MPC's capital spending and investments in 2016 and includes nearly 1.2 billion for refining and marketing, 380 million for Speedway, 90 million for Midstream Investments at MPC and $100 million to support corporate activities. The refining and marketing segment includes 325 million for margin enhancing investments including Garyville distillate maximization projects, Galveston Bay export capacity expansion and approximately $85 million for the South Texas Asset Repositioning project. This morning we also announced a $500 million reduction in the total planned investment for the STAR project.  We now plan to spend a total of 1.5 billion for STAR through 2021, while principally maintaining the project's scope and projected returns. The high returns stage investments planned for STAR are designed to enhance profitability and reliability, while integrating Galveston Bay at Texas City refineries creating the second largest refining complex in the United States. We expect to invest about $380 million in Speedway primarily to build new stores and to remodel and rebuild existing retail locations in its core markets, driving continued growth and opportunities in merchandize across the platform. This morning MPLX also announced its 2017 capital spending and investment plan, a $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion for organic growth plus approximately $100 million for maintenance capital. About 75% of these growth investments are directed to the development of natural gas and gas liquids infrastructure expansion to support MPLX's producer-customer demand, primarily in the Marsalis region. The remaining growth capital will be for the Utica infrastructure builds-out in connection with a recently completed Cornerstone pipeline, a butane cavern in Robinson, Illinois and a tank farm expansion in Texas City, Texas. Additionally, we are executing the strategic actions announced on January 3, to enhance shareholder value. We plan to significantly accelerate the drop downs of MLP qualifying assets generating approximately $1.4 billion of annual EBITDA to MPLX as soon as practicable and now planned for 2017. Our proposed transaction representing approximately $250 million of this annual EBITDA is already under review by the conflicts committee on the MPLX board and is expected to close by the end of the first quarter. Work related to the remaining plan drop downs is on schedule and we were pleased to see the qualifying income regulations finally released. We are currently reviewing the amended regulations and pursuing all actions to get comfort around the qualifying income treatment for our proposed, fuels distribution model, which will likely involve a private letter ruling on the structure given the substantial differences to precedent transactions. In conjunction with the completion of the plan drop downs, MPC also expects to exchange its economic interest in the general partner, including incentive distribution rights for newly issued MPLX common units. We expect this exchange will capture the underappreciated value of our general partner interest and optimize the cost of capital for the partnership. Similarly to our long-term intent to maintain an investment grade credit profile cash proceeds from the drop downs and ongoing LP distributions to MPC are expected to fund the substantial ongoing capital to shareholders.  Importantly, all transactions were subject to requisite approvals including the independent conference committee of the MPLX Board and will be subject to market and other conditions including tax and other regulatory clearances. Additionally, a special committee of the Board has been formed and has selected an independent financial advisor to assist in the full and thorough review of Speedway to ensure optimum value is delivered to shareholders over the long-term. We expect to provide an update on the review by mid-2017. As we start the new year, I also wanted to provide some observations on the macro-environment we are expecting in 2017. From a commodity and oil price perspective we are encouraged by OPEC's resolve around production levels and think the prospects were more balanced supply and demand environment, should be supportive of higher crude prices throughout the year. This bodes well for a number of important differentials on the refining side, as well as helping to continue to generate meaningful midstream development opportunities for MPLX. We think the U.S. macro picture remains solid and although we have seen unusual weakness in refining products demand in January, we expect a solid economic growth will continue to support good underlying demand for refine products, as inventory levels are worked down over the course of the year. We are also encouraged by the early tone set around energy policy by the new administration. Although the ultimate changes remain to be seen, it appears we may have a ligament opportunity to walk back some of the regulatory burdens that the industry has had to deal with over the last several years. Including excessive delays on important and needed pipelines, a potential revisit of the requirements on the renewable fuel standard, as well as much needed reform on taxes. The execution of our strategic plan, strengthening commodity prices, recovering refinery spreads and an improved regulatory environment all contribute to what we expect will be a strong 2017, and believe we are well positioned to deliver long-term sustainable value to our shareholders. Before, I turn the call over to Tim, as we announced last Friday, MPC looks forward to welcoming Mike Stice to our Board later this month. Mike comes to us with more than 35 years in the upstream and midstream gas businesses, including as Chief Executive Officer of Access Midstream Partners, where he had one of the largest gathering and processing MLPs. On behalf of the whole MPC Board it's a pleasure to have Mike joining our ranks as we embarked on an exciting year. With that let me turn the call over the Tim to walk you through the fourth quarter and the full year 2016 financial results, Tim?
Tim Griffith: Thanks, Gary. Slide 4, provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. MPC's fourth quarter earnings of $227 million or $0.43 per diluted share were up from last year's 187 million or $0.35 per diluted share. For the full year 2016 earnings were nearly 1.2 billion or $2.21 per diluted share, down from 2.9 billion or $5.26 per diluted share in 2015. The chart on Slide 5, shows the changes in earnings over the fourth quarter of last year. It's important to note that the $187 million of fourth quarter 2015 earnings included a $370 million pretax lower cost for market inventory valuation charge. $345 million of this prior year charge is reported in the refining marketing segment, and 25 million was in the Speedway segment with the related tax benefit reflected in income taxes. There were no LCM adjustments in the fourth quarter 2016 resulting in a favorable year-over-year effects for both of these segments and unfavorable quarter over quarter change for income taxes.  The quarter-over-quarter comparison also reflects several impacts related to the MarkWest merger in multiple bars on the walk. Midstream segment results increased as we had a full quarter of MarkWest results this year compared to less than one month in 2015. The walk also highlight to increased interest expense resulting from the assumed MarkWest debt and an increased allocation of MPL's earnings to the publicly held units in the partnership shown here as non-controlling interest. Turning to Slide 6, our refining and marketing segment reported income from operations of $219 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 179 million in the same quarter last year. Looking at our key market matrix, an increase in LLS-based blended crack spread had a $105 million favorable impact of segment results as an increase from the Gulf Coast crack more than offset the effects of the decrease in the Chicago crack. The blended crack increased from $6.65 per barrels in '15 to $7.39 per barrels in 2016. We also benefited by 47 million on the sweet/sour differential, as a higher percentage of sour crude in slate more than offset a slightly narrower sweet/sour differential. Offsetting much of these favorable impacts was an unfavorable other gross margin effects of $397 million primarily due to two factors, first we experienced weaker asphalt, price product realizations compared to fourth quarter 2015. Asphalt realizations were exceptionally strong in the fourth quarter of 2015, and did not increase at the same rate as the rise in the price of crude in the fourth quarter of 2016. Second, we experienced weaker gasoline product price realizations versus LLS-based crack spread reported in our market metric for the quarter. Segment results also reflected an unfavorable impact from direct operating cost of 70 million, primarily related to turnaround activity in the quarter. Turnaround and major maintenance cost were $0.45 per barrels higher in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Turning to Slide 7, we’ve also provided a sequential comparison of the refining and marketing segment results for the fourth quarter of '16, as compared to the third quarter of 2016. A decrease in the LLS-based blended crack had a $201 million unfavorable impact of segment results, as an increase in the Chicago crack spread was only partially offset by an increase in the Gulf Coast crack. The blended crack spread decrease from $8.08 per barrels in the third quarter to $7.39 per barrels in the fourth quarter. Direct operating cost was 70 million higher than the third quarter, primarily related to turnaround activity at our Garyville refinery. A favorable other gross margin effect of $257 million almost completely offset these unfavorable effects. The change in other gross margin was primarily due to two factors, first we experienced stronger product price realizations versus spot market prices used in the LLS-based crack spread reported on our market metrics. Second, crude and feedstock acquisition cost compared to the market indicators were more favorable fourth quarter compared to third quarter.  Slide 8 provides the drivers for the change in refining marketing segment income for the full year versus 2015. Income from operations was $1.5 billion in 2016 compared to $4.1 billion in 2015. The LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread has nearly a $2 billion unfavorable impact on the full year segment results with lower crack spreads in both the Gulf Coast and Chicago markets over the full year. The blended crack spreads for the full year decreased from 9.70 per barrel in 2015 to 6.96 per barrel in 2016. We had $334 million improvement from the sweet/sour differential as a $0.42 wider differential combined with about 5% higher crude oil throughput over the full year. The primary contributors for the nearly $1.1 billion unfavorable other gross margin variance in this walk was narrower gasoline and diesel price realizations versus the LLS-based crack spread in 2016 compared to last year. Finally, the value of refinery biometric gains continues to be lower than last year due to the absolute lower refined product price environment in 2016. The $407 million increase in direct operating costs over 2015 was related to the higher refinery turnaround activity in 2016 versus prior year. Turnaround and major maintenance cost increased $0.70 per barrel compared to 2015 with significant turnaround activity occurring at Garyville, Galveston Bay and Robinson in 2016 compared to a fairly light scheduled turnaround activity in 2015. In addition, year-over-year results reflect the favorable effects to 2016's full year segment results caused by the 345 million LCM charge in '15 and the subsequent reversal of the inventory valuation reserve as refined product prices increased in 2016. Moving to our other segments. Slide 9 provides the Speedway segment results for the fourth quarter and full year. Speedway segment income was a 165 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 135 million in the same period 2015. The increase in segment income was primarily due to lower operating cost, increased merchandize margin and the absence of an LCM adjustment in '16 compared to the 2015 LCM charge of 25 million. These favorable impacts were substantially offset by lower light product margins, which decreased from $0.1823 per gallon in the fourth quarter of 2015 to $0.1617 per gallon in the fourth quarter of '16. Speedway's income from operations for full year 2016 was a record 734 million compared to 673 million in '15. The increase in segment income was the result of record merchandize margin, gains from asset sales and the effects of LCM adjustments mentioned earlier. The favorable impacts were partially offset by lower light product margins which decreased from $0.1823 per gallon in '15 to $0.1656 per gallon in 2016. So far, this year we've seen a roughly 3.8% decrease in same-store gasoline volumes when comparing January '17 to January of last year due to lower demand seen across our marketing area, in addition to the impacts from the ice storms in the southeast. For the same period U.S. gasoline demand decreased approximately 6.5%. As Gary mentioned earlier, despite the seasonal weakness in demand we continue to expect gasoline demand to rebound to levels comparable to 2016. Slide 10, provides the changes in the Midstream segment income of a 151 million quarter-over-quarter and 491 million year-over-year. The increases were primarily due to the combination with MarkWest on December 4th of last year and from the result of new pipeline and marine equity investments during 2016. From a cashflow prospective Slide 11 presents elements of changes to our consolidated cash position for the fourth quarter. Cash at the end of the year was just over 887 million. Core operating cash flow before changes to working capital was an $896 million source of cash. Working capital was $95 million source the cash for the quarter, as the price impact and crude payables more than offset inventory impacts in the quarter. Cashflow for the quarter also reflects opportunistic equity issuances by MPLX, through its ATM program during the quarter, with net proceeds of 277 million. Return of capital to shareholders by way of dividends and share repurchases was $210 million during the quarter. Going forward we intend to maintain our focus on disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation, including careful investment in the business and continued return of capital to shareholders.  As Gary mentioned early, we expect cash proceeds from drop downs and ongoing LP distributions to fund the substantial ongoing return of capital to shareholders. All conducted with the continued focus on maintaining an investment grade credit profit at both MPC and MPLX. Slide 12 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile of the business at the end of the year. We had $10.6 billion of total consolidated debt, including $4.4 billion of debt at MPLX. Total debt-to-book capitalization was about 33% and represented 2.5 times, last 12 months adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis or about 1.9 times if we exclude MPLX. We continue to show the metric without MPLX as we think it's more useful to show the bifurcated capital structure, given the effect of the relatively higher leverage of the growing partnership and consolidated matrix.  Slide 13 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the first quarter of 2017. We're expecting the first quarter throughput volumes to be down slightly compared to the first quarter of 2016, due to more plant maintenance during in the quarter. Total direct operating costs are expected to be $10.05 per barrel on a total throughput of 1.68 million barrels per day. The increased operating cost quarter-over-quarter is primarily attributed to plant maintenance, mainly in the Gulf Coast where turnarounds will occur at all three refineries. Gulf Coast crude throughput its estimated at 800,000 barrels per day. Included in the first quarter of plant maintenance is the first turnaround of processed units from Garyville's 2009 major expansion. While costs are higher than first quarter of last year, we expect the full year plant maintenance cost to be similar to 2016 levels. Manufacturing cost on a per barrel basis are also expected to be higher due to higher forecasted natural gas prices combined with lower throughput volumes. We expect to continue to see the advantage from processing sour crude as reflected in our expectation that will make up about 64% of crude oil throughput in the first quarter. Estimated percentage of WI type -- priced crude is 15%. Our projected first quarter corporate and other unallocated items are estimated at 80 million. With that let me turn the call back over to Lisa. Lisa?
Lisa Wilson: As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions. With that, we will now open the call to questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. 
Brad Heffern : Gary, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the border adjustment tax. If it happens, how would it affect MPC's behavior, how it would affect product markets in general and maybe the likelihood you think that it would get passed? 
Gary Heminger: Well let me start, in the event that it was to be passed, Brad, the refineries is going to be able to pass -- is going to have to be able to pass any incremental cost on to the consumer. And I'm very confident that we will be able to do that, just as we did when crude prices were $100 to $147, we passed the price on to the consumer. Now the calculus is really a political calculus on do I think it would be passed, because that's going to be the concern trying to pass something through congress that really is going to increase domestic crude prices at the benefit of domestic producers to the detriment of the consumer, I think is something that is it's going to be difficult. But if it were to pass, we'll be able to -- we'll be flexible, we'll be able to move the price on to the consumer. Now I've had a lot of questions, Brad, what do I think will happen with incremental exports, the companies who have their refineries in the Gulf Coast have the infrastructure and logistics to be able to export, will be the ones who will still be the most likely to export because we'll have the lowest cost. So, as we stated, we are a little over 300,000 barrels per day of exports in this quarter. We now have the infrastructure set that we can go around 400,000 and moving up to 500,000 barrels per day. So we're in a very, very good position. And even if border adjustments were to happen, I think Marathon is in one of the best positions because of our logistics, infrastructure, our optimization between PAD-2, PAD-3 refining, I think we'll be in good shape if it were to happen.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Thanks for that color, Gary. And then shifting over to the OPEC cut, I was curious if you've seen any impact on your volumes. Because of that cut, one of your peers said that they were getting prorated. And has there been any meaningful impact on the system overall?
Gary Heminger: Yes, let me have Mike Palmer cover that.
Mike Palmer: Yes, Brad. Certainly, we've seen the OPEC cuts. We have seen that there has been a tightening in some of the sour foreign opportunities that we've seen in past quarters. We at MPC, we've got strong relationships and contracts with Middle-East suppliers, so far we -- of course in January and February we've had turnaround, so there has been really no impact on us, our demand's been down. But as I said, we've got very strong relationships, we don’t think that there is going to be a big impact, we are already in the market buying March and April crude oil for the system, and we've continued to see some real values in sour crude opportunities. So, I don’t think it's going to have a big impact on us.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. 
Phil Gresh : First question is just. to follow up on some of the demand commentary. Gary, just curious, what you're seeing on the demand front. Why the data has been as weak as it has at the start the year and what makes you confident that it will get back to a stable outlook as progress through the year?
Gary Heminger: Well first of all Phil, I'll take you back to the same time last year, we didn’t have a winter, if you recall. So last year demand in January was strong, plus it was -- we were on the rebound after the rapid decline in crude prices and therefore gasoline prices. And you couple that with really no upsets in the weather patterns over the same period last year, led us to a very, very strong first quarter volume. Now we've had a couple of big storm cells that have come through mainly the South East, here earlier in the year. That has caused a pretty big upheaval. And then secondly, a lot of fog in and around the Gulf Coast regions used in ship channel, all the way through to Florida that has caused, really some supply and demand issues.  But I think we'll get beyond this and everything seems to have really, got back into a different place right now, and what we’re seeing though secondly, as you see crude prices increase, what you're going to see in many of our markets, Tony Kenney's Speedway operations in many of the markets, he has to lead the price up in order to get the incremental cost to the street. That will have some short term hit on demand, but I believe as long as crude prices continue to have a methodic pace upwards, I believe we'll be able to get that price to the street and not be too big of a hit on volume.
Phil Gresh : Okay. Got it. And my second question is just on the maintenance. Obviously a very high first quarter level for you as well as for your peers. How do you think about maintenance for the full year in the MPC system relative to what we saw last year? And are you anticipating the whole industry -- based on what we've heard from a couple, it feels like the whole industry is going to have pretty heavy maintenance, February through April. Is that consistent with your view?
Gary Heminger: Let me have a Ray Brooks, first handle our maintenance.
Ray Brooks: Okay, as Tim stated earlier, our maintenance for the first quarter is up substantially because in the Gulf Coast we have significant turnaround activity at all three of our refineries, so we're up for the quarter. But for the year, we look at being flat with 2016, where we actually ended up at 2016 and I will say, in 2016 we were very aggressive about bringing our spend levels down. So we're projecting to hold it even with that for the year.
Gary Heminger: And Phil, as we looked across the entire industry, I think we see both, where we have our refining PAD-2, PAD-3 to be about equal to the total maintenance of last year, may be just a little bit of an uptick in the Gulf of Coast. Some of the concerns, we have been -- the work we've done already here in January has been just little bit ahead of schedule and under budget, so we've been doing very well. There have been some concerns in the industry though about the labor force, but I don’t think at the end of the day that it's going to have a substantial impact on the refining industry, but that is something I would say to keep an eye on, but we're in very, very good shape on all of our turnarounds.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.
Johannes Van Der Tuin: Hi. It's actually Johannes here pinch hitting for Ed. First and foremost, just a quick question on, it's really the logistics side of the house. It seems like there was a bit of a bump in MPLX EBITDA guidance. How much of that is throughput utilization in the Northeast kind of low capital intensive improvements?
Gary Heminger: Don, you want to take that?
Donald Templin: Yes, I don’t think any of it was related to that I mean we’re just seeing stronger demand as we especially are moving into '17, we feel great about the growth opportunities that we have. The logistics and storage business is performing really, really solidly and we have some very good potential growth opportunities on the gathering and processing side.
Johannes Van Der Tuin: Okay. Are there any regional differences or specific drivers you would like to highlight? 
Donald Templin: Well I would say that from our perspective, Marcellus probably has some very strong opportunities for us and we're seeing good volumes there, our major producer customer such as Antero and Range and EQT have been very bullish on volumes going into '17. And then, we see a lot of optimism and opportunities for us in the Southwest. Our capital budget probably will spend more money in the Southwest this year, than we do in the Utica region.
Johannes Van Der Tuin: Okay. That's very helpful. And then circling back to the border adjustment tax very quickly, out of curiosity, do have a sense as to either for yourselves or the industry as a whole what percentage of WCS is on long-term contract?
Gary Heminger: Well, I don’t -- Mike, do you have any sense on WCS?
Mike Palmer: Well, on long-term contract, again going back to WCS, WCS is really it referrers to the heavy Canadian, WCS is a particular grade, but there are many heavy Canadian grades. Most of that crude oil coming out of Canada is either sold spot month-to-month or on 30 day or 60 day kind of evergreen contracts. So, it can be turned around fairly quickly. I think that regardless of the border tax, the Canadian crude, the heavy Canadian continues to grow and that crude will flow into the U.S. does that answer your question?
Johannes Van Der Tuin: I think it does more or less. So most of it is at the outside as kind of a 60 day contract?
Mike Palmer: Yes, most of that is -- [Multiple Speakers] 
Gary Heminger: The way you really have to look at this is that, there may be shippers who have long-term shipping commitments, but they are fulfilling that buying through the 30 day or 60 day evergreen window. So typically, we do not have a long-term shipping contract, like some those are going through the Gulf Coast, but the requirements were fulfilled year on a spot or 30 day, 60 day window.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.
Doug Leggate: Gary, I realize that the process around Speedway is still ongoing. But I wonder if I could ask you to frame your latest thoughts on the viability of a separate retail business while still pursuing the fuels distribution drop. I know control and influence over fuels distribution is important to the refining business so I was wondering if you could talk about the viability at a very high level, albeit we're still waiting on the result of the outcome of the review by mid-year.
Gary Heminger: Sure Doug, as we said -- and I said on the January 3rd call and to be very specific, the viability will be one of the scenarios that we looked at, but we're doing the full and through review over all the scenarios that we really can consider at this time. You have to look counterparty risk, you have to look at the balance sheet of MPC, after you drop in the fuels distribution. You have to look at the credit profile. So we’re going to look at all the different scenarios and I'm not going to lean one way or another. Our statement that we made on January 3, is just that, it's going to be a be full comprehensive review and then we'll determine by mid-year, what the outcome is.
Doug Leggate: kay. I thought it was worth a try but we will have to be patient. Gary, my second -- my follow-up question if I may, is unfortunately also on tax. It's a slightly different question though just in terms of how you are preparing or planning internally. And what I'm driving at is, you guys are obviously a fairly large cash tax payer. What scenarios are you running in terms of the current corporate tax potential changes -- the Brady Bill versus a 15% corporate rate and obviously the offsets from depreciation and so on? How are you trying to frame it? And it at the end of the day, if the tax rate fell, would you expect to see a material improvement, a reduction in your cash tax payment. That's really what I'm trying to get out. I'll leave it there. Thank you.
Gary Heminger: Sure Doug, Tim you want to take that?
Tim Griffith: Sure, Doug, I think the picture is still a little bit murky in terms of how all the potential reforms play out. I mean certainly the reduction and the proposed change in the corporate tax rate, either under the Republican blue print or under the Trump plan, that potentially 20% to 15%, obviously very helpful and could dramatically lower the cash tax burden of the company. There is also obviously a proposal to eliminate interest expense as a deduction there is a part of the proposal that incorporates immediate expensing of capital and then obviously the border tax adjustment. There is really a pretty complicated set of potential changes that come out and we're trying to look at them, as clarity is offered in terms of what the net impact could be on the business and sort of where it plays out. I think a little bit though to handicap exactly what form it takes, but certainly there are elements to the tax reform that we think are extraordinarily positive, the lowering of the tax rate and the immediate expense are two areas that we're very supportive of, and what the offset from some of the other provisions could be, I think remains to be seen at this point. It would be tough to handicap or indicate exactly where that’s going to come up, but we're going to look at it pretty carefully. We certainly are entirely supportive of the notion of tax rates going down to make the U.S. more competitive on the global stage and we think those are very productive discussions and could be fantastic it's implemented, but I think it's tough to say at this point what the net impacts on a cash tax basis for us could be?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays. 
Paul Cheng : I think the first question is for Tim. Tim, explaining that the quarter -- you were talking about the outer margin improvement sequentially due to two factors. One is there are stronger price realization than what the screens say and the other one is the true and the fiscal purchase call and small favor at both end of the benchmark. When you are looking at so far in the quarter, if those trends continue and getting more favorable or about the same or just getting less favorable?
Tim Griffith: Well we wouldn’t give guidance necessarily on the trending into the first quarter. I mean I think we would highlight the third quarter from a -- sort of product price realizations on a number of fronts was what we thought to be unusually low from a product price realizations. A lot of those impacts did not occur again in fourth quarter, and less likely we would see those as we go forward. But we really would not provide guidance necessarily on how that will shake out in the first quarter, we'll see what the product markets look like. As Gary indicated in environments where prices are rising, there is generally a little bit of the lag in terms of the catch-up on street prices which will have a product price realization impact, but again I think we would probably characterize third quarter as a little bit unusual relative to the realizations that we've seen over the last several years here.
Paul Cheng: Tim, in the fourth quarter do you have any sales of inventory?
Tim Griffith: I'm sorry, Paul?
Paul Cheng: In the fourth quarter, did you sell any inventory? Did you sell down anything from the inventory?
Tim Griffith: No. We actually had a slight inventory build into the fourth quarter. So there was no net liquidation of the inventory in the fourth quarter.
Paul Cheng: The second question is that, Gary, should we assume the MPLX 1.7 billion in the CapEx for this year is going to be fully funded? It's not going to require any support from MPC? And also, that the -- wondering, is there any additional color in terms of the drop down pace for this year? Are we going to do the 1.4 billion totally in this year, 250 million in the first quarter, should we assume, the other remaining, all get dropped down in the fourth quarter?
Gary Heminger: Well I'll take the last part of that first. As you know we've already turned over to the conflicts committee approximately 250 million, then we are working on what the optimum pace is for the balance of the year, that has not been -- we've not turned anything else over to the conflicts committee yet. That was expected, you would see something, maybe I wouldn’t necessarily call it ratable, Paul, but maybe another chunk sometime in the third quarter or so just to spread it out a little bit over the year. Let me have Don take the budget and how he is going to fund that.
Donald Templin: Yes, Paul on the 1.7 billion. We would expect to fund that all with NPLX, without any support from the parent. You'll recall that in 2016 there was a real focus on capital preservation the balance sheet and the leverage metrics at MPLX were higher than we wanted them to be and what we were targeting, so we started out with about 4.7 times leverage at the beginning of '16. We're down to 3.4 times by the end of '16, and we're in a very comfortable position to be able to fund our organic growth through a combination of equity and debt.
Paul Cheng: Thank you. Gary, just want to make one comment about the retail. Given the pretty aggressive drop down and also the change of the GP, we just hope that maybe that -- maybe I'm wrong, but personally I think it is probably far better off for you to keep Speedway inside [ph] instead of spinning it off. Thank you.
Gary Heminger: Thank you, Paul. I appreciate your comments, always appreciate your comments.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Chi Chow: Regarding the acceleration of the Midstream drops, does the commitment to contribute all the assets this year suggest that you may forgo the private letter ruling on field distribution? And I suppose by extension, did the recent IRS regulation give enough comfort on dropping that field distribution business down as qualifying income?
Gary Heminger: Sure, Tim?
Tim Griffith: Yes, I think the regulations that are issued were we think positive, we don’t see anything in them at our initial review that is suggestive of anything that would be a gaiting item to fuels distribution. Nonetheless, we still think its slightly that we will pursue a PLR just given the size of the earnings that represents and the impact it could have on the partnership. So we're certainly, as Gary said, pleased to see them finally issued, we are working through them now and again think it's still likely that we would pursue a PLR just to make sure we've got high levels of comfort that we're not putting something in the partnership that would not be qualifying in nature and potentially threaten the partnership's QI treatment.
Chi Chow: Given your drop-down guidance, do you expect that PLR then soon, I would think? Sometime this year then? Is that what you're suggesting then with the guidance?
Tim Griffith: You never know exactly what the timing would be, and there could be a little bit of a backlog on some of the PLR's. But we will, again, we're working through it now and again with the likelihood of the PLR, expect that we would be submitting that in the near term and then again would wait for guidance back from treasury around that. And again, we're still hoping that this -- all of these events could unfold in 2017, but that’s probably the wild card.
Chi Chow: Okay. Thanks. Second question, can you give us your thoughts on the potential change in the RIN obligation from refiners to blenders and what potential impact that might have on Marathon?
Gary Heminger: Well Chi, if you look at the how RIN prices have already come down from little bit over a dollar early in the fourth quarter to $0.47 today and that is not caused necessarily by concerns over the change in the point of obligation. I think it's really caused from the new administration taking over and stating that do not like this RIN requirement and the renewal volume obligation requirements. As we've always said, the market can be balanced at just a little bit under 10% in ethanol. And refiners and blenders, we need the ethanol in order to be able to meet our octane requirements. So I don’t think it’s a volume obligation versus RIN cost scenario, I think it's -- really we need to step back and look at, does this renewable fuel standard make sense in anyway going forward and my answer would be no, that the way it's set today on an absolute volume basis that needs to be changed to a percentage basis and if that happens, that will take care of all the RIN cost.
Chi Chow: Okay. Thanks. Gary, one other follow-up. If I read the IRS regulations correctly and I might not be able to, that was a hard document to get through, but it appears that they are ruling that the sale of RIN is considered a qualifying event. Does that change your thinking at all on possibly dropping RINs if they're still around into MPLX down the road?
Gary Heminger: Well, one of the things that we have always said. We do not see the RINs as affordable and so it will be very difficult to separate RINs and have a steady revenue stream from RINs. It's our belief that the RINs are in the crack spread and Mike, I'll turn it over to you to see if you see any different.
Mike Palmer: No, Gary. I wouldn’t answer the question any differently than you just did.
Chi Chow: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta : This is related to Speedway and retail. What drives the pickup in capital spending here in 2017 versus 2016 at Speedwell? And then, Gary, can you talk about how you think about the outlook for retail margins next year? Especially, if you're right that crude prices continue to grind higher?
Gary Heminger: I'll take the latter part, if crude prices and again it's the rate of the pace that crude prices were change, Neil. If there is slow and steady climb -- at your conference I outlined that we expect 2017 will end somewhere in the $60 to $65 range, is where we expect. So if it's a slow and steady climb into that level we'll be able to move the price to the street and really not effect demand much. I think at your conference I stated that, if we look the elasticity for an increase at the retail price, you're looking about every $0.50 increase in retail price, you may have somewhere 1.5% to 2% change in demand and that may vary over regions. But I don’t think it will have that much of an effect, we're expecting gasoline for the full year to be flat and diesel to be up a couple of percent for the year, and I'll let Tony talk about his capital budget for the year.
Tony Kenney: The biggest change in our capital is, we had a provision in our capital for 2017 to be able to comply with the euro pay MasterCard, Visa requirements at our dispensers at 2,700 locations. As you know that date has changed, we have the capital in there, it's not going to go away ultimately, sooner or later the U.S. is going to have to comply with the ability to take chip cards at our retail locations. So we're currently evaluating how we want to approach along the changed timeline, our investment in the changes that will make it retail. So most of that change is in regard to how we are going to go forward with the investments we need to make in accepting chip cards at our locations.
Neil Mehta : I appreciate the comments. And the second is on Dakota Access. Can you just talk about where we are with in terms of the Dakota Access Pipeline and when you ultimately expect that crude to start flowing?
Gary Heminger: Okay, Don, do you want to take that?
Donald Templin: Sure, we're optimistic that especially with recent communications coming out of the administration around that pipeline, we’re optimistic that that pipeline gets completed and gets completed quickly. And from an MPLX prospective, we are prepared to make our investment in that pipeline when the conditions to close or met. So with respect to their -- I would -- I think it's probably not our place to talk about sort of first oil and what not. But in terms of the transaction or the pipeline being completed, we know we're optimistic that will happen in the near future and we are well prepared for it.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.
Roger Read: Gary, maybe just to come back to some of the retail questions here. You mentioned on the January 3 call, I think, in response to a question, that you felt that most of the RINs expense is in the crack. If that's the case, then as we think about retails EBITDA generation down the line, should we think about it as sands RINs price? And that it's maybe a little lower performer than what we've been used too?
Gary Heminger: No I don’t think so, Roger. We don’t have -- we're not showing any value at the Speedway side for RINs. Marathon is the blender of record for a lot of our volume, that goes into Speedway, but I think we're going to see any change in Speedway due to possible change in RINs, Tim do you see it any different?
Tim Griffith: No I think that’s right, Gary. I mean ultimately Marathon is ultimately the blender, which is where this is getting picked up. So Roger, I don’t -- there is really nothing with regard to Speedway segment earnings that has a RINs component. Obviously, the RINs reflected and pricing gets factored into the sort of transfer pricing that we look at within the business, but there is nothing really that would change, even if there were some separation in the future, which obviously remains to be seen.
Roger Read: Okay. So there is not an allocation risk, like you said, on the transfer pricing or anything?
Gary Heminger: No.
Roger Read: Okay. Perfect. And then, Gary, can you give us a little more detail on exactly who's doing the evaluation of Speedway for the spin and maybe what Marathon management's input is on that directly?
Gary Heminger: Yes Roger, as I stated we’ve already have -- the Board has appointed a special committee and they are going down the path of their work with a financial advisor. We want to keep this as a very independent confidential study between the committees, so we’re not going to announce at this time who the financial advisor is, we will overtime. And managements job like -- I'm not on the special committee, this is -- I felt that was important to keep this totally independent and we have five Board members making up this special committee, all member of the Board, but I'm not part of that. Now management will prepare a lot of the data, that the committee and the advisors that are working on this. Management will compile a lot of data for the advisors to work on, but that's the management job, is just to compile data and to turn that over.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons.
Jeff Dietert : We've tracked about 10 Bcf a day of new pipelines coming on in the Marcellus this year and another 10 Bcf a day in 2018. I was wondering if you could talk about how you expect this infrastructure to impact Northeast natural gas prices and opportunities for you in the Marcellus?
Gary Heminger: So, Don.
Donald Templin: Sure, Jeff. We are also tracking those individual projects and we are confident that many of those projects will ultimately be completed. From our perspective right now, I think the last sort of year has been -- we were very focused on supporting our producer-customers in allowing them or providing them opportunities to move NGLs out of the Utica Marcellus. I would say from my perspective and I think based upon our discussions with producer-customers, residue gas movements out of the Utica Marcellus are an important part of their consideration around growth going forward. We would expect that overtime when you get those particular projects in place that the differential would probably come from -- get down to just maybe as $0.50 differential, which would really be a transportation cost differential. And you well know Jeff, that in the summer time and other parts of the year, that differentials has been probably as much as a $1.50. So we would be improving the differential for our producers-customers by a $1 probably.
Jeff Dietert: Great. You've previously guided to about $7.5 billion of organic spending between 2016 and 2020. It sounds like your 2017 guidance is kind of in that fairway. Any biased higher or lower on your long-term organic spending outlook?
Donald Templin: I think we we're really confident about and optimistic about the opportunity to identify and to deliver on organic growth projects, Jeff. So I would say that if I had a bias, it would be on the higher side of that, not on the lower side of that.
Jeff Dietert: Thanks for your comments.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Benny Wong from Morgan Stanley. 
Benny Wong: Just wondering if you can give us an update on how you're thinking about your return of capital program this year and how you guys balance the pace of your buybacks stock with the visibility you might have with your drop-down plan.
Tim Griffith: Again, if we look back at '16, obviously, the buyback activity is always a function of sort of where we see operating cash flow in the business. But I mean, I think with the plans that are announced with regards to the drops and again the prospects and at least the potential for the full 1.4 to be dropped into MPLX in 2017. Again, subject to our maintaining an investment grade credit profile and any adjustments we may need to make the capital structure to support that, the primary source of those funds is going to be in return of capital, so that will come in the formal potential considerations around the dividend and certainly for share buybacks which we think are the most efficient way to get the capital back. So I think our expectations based on what's laid in front of us for '17 is that, capital return will be a much larger source its activity in '17 and again outside of any adjustments we make to debt will be the primer use of the cash.
Benny Wong: Thanks for that. Just a follow-up, unrelated, can you give us some color around the scale back of the capital at the STAR program? Is there items that you are no longer investing in or did you figure out some work around where you're able to obtain the same result without spending the money? Just trying to get a better understanding of the change there.
Gary Heminger: Ray you want to talk about what the reduction entails?
Ray Brooks: Sure, the STAR program, we continue to progress that and as Gary stated earlier, we're -- that’s now viewed as $1.5 billion project. Still looks really good, just a little bit of color on that is, the STAR program actually has several components across the Galveston Bay TRD complex that we've looked at. And the first part of that, we actually pulled in in 2016 with -- when we looked at a resid de-asphalting unit. And we did a repurpose of that unit to actually run resid and then expanded it. And that had phenomenal return, it exceeded our expectations and so has generated more EBITDA then we previously projected. And then it was three other components of that going forward. Looking at our sour crude unit and revamping that, expanding our recent hydrocracker and then also looking at just a diesel hydrotreater. At this point we are going to progress engineering on two basis of that, the crude unit revamped and resid hydrocracker revamp. And at this point not progressed any further on the engineering with the diesel hydrotreater. And that’s simply based on looking at all the components on a stand along basis for their return and two projects exceed our refining total rate, well under the 20% and where the diesel hydrotreater did not. So that’s just a little bit more detail on that project going forward. [Multiple Speaker].
Tim Griffith: And Benny, what Ray was talking about there, our expectation for 2016, the de-asphalting unit that was complete, we had expected about 80 million of EBITDA and now we're projecting that to be north of a 100. So a very, very strong increase due to the performance of the unit. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Corey Goldman from Jefferies. 
Corey Goldman: A quick follow up to Johannes' question on MPLX guidance. Don, can you comment what's included for DAPL in 2017 in the guidance?
Donald Templin: There is nothing included for DAPL in guidance.
Corey Goldman : Okay. And if I remember correctly, you guys already pre-funded to CapEx for DAPL? Is that right?
Donald Templin: We have about 2.7 billion of liquidity currently, so we're in really -- with almost $300 million in cash, so we're in a very good position, sitting here in anticipation of that. 
Corey Goldman: Okay. That's helpful. And then a quick follow up. I'm assuming you guys have been in communication with rating agencies as it relates to some of the pro forma debt-to-EBITDA metrics following the drop downs. Can you give us some commentary on what we can expect it would take to retain IG for both levels there?
Tim Griffith: Sure, we've had dialogs and even with negative outlooks that Moody's and Fitch put out, more recently we have talked even beyond that. But I think we feel very comfortable that, anything that we do with regard to capital structure will be supportive for both entities. For MPLX what we've indicated as that, about a four times debt-to-EBITDA over the course of the time, we think makes sense, and is an appropriate amount of leverage for a partnership that's investment credit rated. You may have seen even yesterday S&P published that MPLX on a standalone basis is investment grade, that initial rating was based on the rating of appearance, so we think that's very encouraging. And then again on the MPC side, we will continue to look at and evaluate, I think the initial reactions to the announcements with some concern about the increase in leverage and again what we've indicated is that we will take actions and adjust the capital structure as we need to, to support that profile overtime. Even with all of the actions we're taking here I think it's worth reminding everyone that the amount of cash distribution that come back to MPC, even once we work through a GP buy-in, are going to be substantial and that will afford us a tremendous amount of financial flexibility to make adjustment as we need to, as well as continue to return capital. So I think we're very comfortable that the investment grade credit profile for both the entities is something that we'll be able to maintain and we'll take action to, to support that overtime.
Corey Goldman: Okay. Any commentary on what appropriate cap structure could look like at MPC in terms of like an absolute number?
Tim Griffith: Well, I think if we look on sort of the net MPC basis which has also been an important part of the dialogue with the agencies and with fixed income investors we think that's probably sort of two times debt-to-EBITDA is probably in our comfort zone and would probably look to maintain things at or around those levels as we go forward?
Corey Goldman: Okay that' really helpful. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis from UBS Securities.
Spiro Dounis: Just wanted to ask you on your decision to repay or prepay some debt last quarter, I'm just wondering where you're thinking about going forward? Did you make a decision again and could we see you scale that down over the next quarter? Thanks.
Tim Griffith: Well, again Spiro its Tim. I think the consideration around the debt paid in the third quarter again was just based on where we saw the full year earnings coming out for refining and just making sure that again we're calibrating the capital structure for the underlying earnings. Again, any further adjustments to capital structure would really be based on sort of what we're doing with the drops and what things will look like in terms of the new debt taken out of MPLX and what that could mean for the consolidated picture. So it's something we'll look at, I don’t think there is anything that compels us at point, but again it would really be a function of the drops and what the pro forma capital structures look like once this activity is completed. So it's something we'll continue to monitor, no specific guidance that we would provide right now other than, we're going to continue to watch very carefully and adjust the leverage situations at MPC as we think appropriate.
Spiro Dounis: Got it, thanks Tim.
Operator: Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Lisa Wilson.
Lisa Wilson: Thank you, Jason. And thank you for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or would like clarification on topics discussed this morning, Denise Myers, Doug Wendt and I will be available to take your calls. Thank you for joining us this morning.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call for Marathon Petroleum Corporation. My name is Katy and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Lisa Wilson, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Lisa Wilson - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Good morning, and welcome to Marathon Petroleum's third quarter 2016 earnings webcast and conference call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, Chairman, President and CEO; Tim Griffith, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and other members of our MPC executive team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on slide two. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. Now I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks and highlights.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thanks, Lisa, and good morning to everyone. If you please turn to slide three. We issued two press releases earlier today: our third quarter earnings announcement and a strategic plan to enhance shareholder value. Driving long-term value for our shareholders is a top priority. Despite the steps we have taken to create value for investors, we believe that MPC's share price reflects a significant discount to the intrinsic value of our business, particularly as it relates to the valuation described for our general and limited partner ownership interests in MPLX and to the midstream assets we hold directly. First, we announced an aggressive dropdown strategy. By the end of 2017, we plan to offer to MPLX assets contributing a total of approximately $350 million of annual EBITDA with the first dropdown of assets contributing $235 million of annual EBITDA expected to occur by the end of the first quarter. The partnership's plans for funding these drops would likely include transactions with MPC including the potential for substantial amount of equity to MPC. We also intend to execute on additional value-enhancing dropdowns totaling an estimated $1 billion of annual EBITDA as soon as practical within the next three years. As a reminder, we are still awaiting tax clearance on a substantial portion of this dropdown portfolio which includes the revised treasury qualifying income regulations and a subsequent PLR for our fuels distribution business. Nonetheless, we are moving forward aggressively with other portions of the MLP eligible earnings available within MPC. This aggressive dropdown strategy is expected to support increased limited and general partner distributions from MPLX and provide value creation for investors. These transactions are subject to market and other conditions, as well as requisite approvals. In addition, we are evaluating strategic opportunities to highlight and capture the value of our general partner ownership interest in MPLX and optimize the cost of capital for the partnership. We have retained independent financial advisors to assist with this evaluation. We will be evaluating a number of alternatives aimed at highlighting the value inherent in the general partner and will provide additional detail to investors once we have determined the path providing the greatest opportunity to capture this value. Finally, in connection with these strategic actions to unlock value from our midstream assets, we plan to evaluate changes to our internal financial reporting largely focused on the assets and earnings associated with our future dropdown strategy that are currently reported in our refining and marketing segment. Our review is likely to result in changes to our segment reporting beginning in 2017. These initiatives are designed to unlock additional value from our robust portfolio of midstream assets and to further benefit from the value-enhancing platform we have established with MPLX. We will continue to analyze our businesses and portfolio to ensure we continue to deliver superior performance and returns consistent with our track record of maximizing shareholder value over the long-term. We will be moving ahead expeditiously on each of these actions and look forward to communicating with our shareholders as we execute our strategic plan. That said, let me turn back to our results for the third quarter. In our earnings release this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $145 million or $0.27 per diluted share. Earnings include a $0.31 per diluted share charge related to the impairment of our investment in the Sandpiper Pipeline project, due to the withdrawal of regulatory applications for the project. The lower earnings this quarter were due in part to lower crack spreads and compressed project price realizations in the refining and marketing segment. Despite a challenging quarter, we remain optimistic as we move forward into 2017, given signs with a market rebalancing and sustain strong demand. The combination of our niche inland refineries and large Gulf Coast refineries provide competitive advantages, including optimization potential and export excess. We continue to recognize benefits from the diversified nature of our business as the Speedway and midstream segments contributed more than $450 million of combined segment income in the third quarter. Speedway delivered strong light product sales volume and record merchandise margin dollars. The higher merchandise margin is consistent with its strategy to realize marketing enhancement opportunities. Having a strong retail business as Speedway is a valuable differentiator for MPC. Our integrated structure provides growing stable cash flows across market cycles, enabling us to return capital to shareholders while reinvesting in value enhancing growth initiatives. The stable cash flow also helps us maintain our investment-grade credit profile. The midstream segment, which includes MPLX, delivered solid results supported by increases in gathering, processing and fractionation volumes. MPLX continues to drive exceptional growth opportunities, supporting a diverse set of producer customers in some of the nation's most prolific shale plays and positioning it well to benefit from a rising commodity price environment. Additionally, in October, MPLX commenced operations of the Cornerstone Pipeline on schedule and under budget. We believe we're highly integrated and coordinated business model comprised of refining and marketing, midstream and Speedway along with a strategic plan announced today will enhance shareholder value and position MPC for future growth and continued attractive returns to investors. With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk you through the financial results for the third quarter. Tim?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thanks, Gary. Slide four provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. MPC's third quarter 2016 earnings of $145 million or $0.27 per diluted share were down from last year's third quarter earnings of $948 million or $1.76 per diluted share. As Gary mentioned, third quarter 2016 results include a $267 million or $0.31 per diluted share impact from the impairment of our investment in the Sandpiper Pipeline project. The chart on slide five shows by segment the changes in earnings from the third quarter of last year. The $803 million net decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower income from our refining and marketing segment. In addition, we had higher impairment expense during the quarter as well as higher interest expense resulting from the debt assumed as part of the MarkWest merger. These negative impacts for the quarter were partially offset by lower income taxes and higher income contributed by our midstream segment. Turning to slide six, our refining and marketing segment reported income from operations of $306 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared with $1.4 billion in the same quarter last year. The decrease was primarily due to weaker crack spreads in both the Gulf Coast and Chicago and less favorable product price realizations compared to the LLS-based crack spread. The lower blended crack spread had a negative impact on earnings of approximately $711 million. The blended crack spread was $4.10 per barrel lower at $8.08 per barrel in the third quarter compared to $12.18 per barrel for the same period last year. There were four primary contributors to the $463 million unfavorable other gross margin variants in this WACC. First, we experienced narrower gasoline and diesel price realizations versus reported market metric LLS-based crack spread in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same quarter last year. Second, our price realizations were negatively impacted by less favorable margins on non-transportation products, which includes asphalt. Asphalt realizations were exceptionally strong in the third quarter 2015 and have not increased at the same rate as the rise in the price of crude. Third, as I mentioned we experienced weaker crack spreads during the quarter. At the same time our outright RIN purchase cost more than doubled when compared to third quarter of 2015. Our cost to purchase RINs to comply with the RFS standards was $80 million this quarter. Finally, refinery volumetric gains also continued to be lower this quarter due to the lower commodity price environment we're in. R&M segment income benefited $79 million by an approximately $0.40 per barrel widening of the sweet/sour differential, as well as higher sour runs in the quarter versus same quarter last year. The LLS, WTI differential narrowed by $2.14 per barrel from $3.72 per barrel in the third quarter of 2015 to $1.58 per barrel in this third quarter. This had a negative impact on earnings of about $69 million based on the WTI-linked crudes in our slate. The market structure, or contango effect during the quarter is reflected in the $32 million favorable variance on the WACC and relates to the difference between the prompt crude prices we used for market metrics and the actual crude acquisition costs in the quarter. The $35 million year-over-year increase in direct operating costs relate primarily to higher turnaround activity in the quarter versus last year. Turnaround in major maintenance costs increased $0.25 per barrel or over $46 million compared to the third quarter of 2015. Moving to our other segments, slide seven provides the Speedway segment earnings WACC compared to the same quarter last year. Speedway's income was down $34 million compared to the third quarter 2016, primarily driven by lower light product margins. Gasoline and distillate margins were $0.177 per gallon in the third quarter of 2016, which was $0.037 lower than the third quarter of 2015, which was a period of very strong margins. On a sequential basis, light product margin was $0.022 per gallon higher than second quarter 2016. Partially offsetting lower fuel margins were higher gasoline and distillate sales volumes and higher merchandise margins. Gasoline and distillate sales volumes were up 20 million gallons over the same quarter last year. On a same-store basis, gasoline volumes decreased 0.6% over the same period last year. Our focus continues to be on optimizing total gasoline contributions between volume and margin to ensure fuel margins remain adequate. Increase in merchandise sales continue to be a focus, the results of which can be seen in the $28 million increase in Speedway's merchandise gross margin compared to the third quarter of 2015. Merchandise margins increased due to higher overall merchandise sales, as well as higher margins realized on those sales. Merchandise sales in the quarter, excluding cigarettes, increased 4% on a same-store year-over-year basis. In October, we've seen a decrease in gasoline demand with approximately 4% decrease in same-store gasoline sales volumes compared to last October. The decrease we expect to be temporary and largely reflects the impacts of Hurricane Matthew at approximately 500 Speedway locations. Slide eight provides the changes in the midstream segment income versus the third quarter last year. The $165 million increase quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to the combination with MarkWest at the end of last year, which contributed $121 million of incremental segment income to the quarter. The remaining increase of $44 million was primarily due to an increase in income from our equity affiliates and lower operating expenses versus third quarter last year. Slide nine presents the significant elements of changes in our consolidated cash position for the third quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was just over $700 million. Core operating cash flow was a $1.1 billion source of cash. The $666 million use of working capital noted on the slide primarily relates to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an increase in crude and refined product inventory levels during the quarter. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to the lower crude prices and volumes as well as timing of tax payments. Given the weaker refining margins we've seen this year, we took the opportunity to selectively prepay some of our debt during the quarter, which is reflected in the $516 million of net debt cash outflow shown in the WACC. MPLX opportunistically issued equity through its ATM program during the quarter, with net proceeds of $184 million as shown on the WACC. Return of capital during the quarter included share repurchases of $51 million and dividends of $190 million. During the third quarter, we increased our dividend 12.5% or $0.36 per share. We've increased our dividend six times since becoming a standalone company five years ago, resulting in a 28% compound annual growth rate on the dividend. Our continued focus on growing regular quarterly dividends demonstrates our ongoing strategy to share in the success of the business with our shareholders and this dividend increase just reaffirms that strategy. Slide 10 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the quarter. We had $10.6 billion of total consolidated debt, including $4.4 billion of debt at MPLX. Total debt-to-book capitalization was about 34% and represented 2.3 times last 12 months pro forma adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis or about 1.8 times if we exclude MPLX. We're showing the metric without MPLX, since the debt is non-recourse MPC, and MPLX will maintain a capital structure, which uses relatively higher leverage. Making consolidated debt-to-EBITDA increasingly less useful, given the size and continued growth of the partnership. Slide 11 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the fourth quarter of 2016. We're expecting fourth quarter throughput volumes to be down slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, due to more planned maintenance in the quarter. Total direct operating costs are expected to be $8.05 per barrel on total throughput of 1.83 million barrels per day. Beginning this quarter we're also providing our estimated percentage of sour crude throughput, which we expect to be 58% in the fourth quarter, due to the continued sour crude advantage. Our projected fourth quarter corporate and other unallocated items are estimated $75 million. With that let me turn the call back over to Lisa. Lisa?
Lisa Wilson - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thanks, Tim. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions. With that, we will now open the call to questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good morning, everyone. How are you?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Good morning, Neil. How are you?
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks, Gary. So, Gary, can you provide some early flavor as it relates to some of the strategic changes that you talked about, dropdowns, the GP structure, and some of the accounting changes? And then, talk about how retail fits into it, if at all?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Sure, Neil. As we – in our separate release this morning and we've been working on this for quite some time on. We spent the early part of the year in the transition to get MarkWest into the fold and to really get our businesses lined out. And then really focused on what is the proper growth strategy and how do we – we have tremendous portfolio of assets that can be considered over time to be dropdown, and we felt that it was the best to get into a very aggressive, strong rhythm on how to dropdown the assets that we have, and it's not just a dropdown strategy, Neil, we expect to be acquisitive in certain markets where it makes sense for the midstream, as well as we have a very good organic suite of projects to work on. But as we step back and looked at our total midstream business, we felt that now is the time to take this a very bold aggressive action and then we've also stated not just the dropdowns for 2017 of approximately $350 million, but we've also then are talking about the future dropdown strategy of the approximate $1 billion of other assets. Let me be specific through about that $1 billion of other assets, as you know, Neil, you and I talked about this many times. We have a significant portion of those assets under the fuels distribution piece that we have a private letter ruling request into the IRS. So we have to be careful and make sure we don't have any potential tax liability of dropping those down sooner than we would believe we have approval from the IRS. One of the – an additional thing that we highlighted, the value of the general partner interest, let me have Tim talk about some of the actions and the aspects that we would have around looking at the general partner interest.
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, Neil, we've – as we sort of outlined, I think the key for us is that we have – we've seen pretty clearly that the value of the GP is not being fully recognized in the value of MPC. So I think we want to take a careful but aggressive look at exactly ways that we can highlight that value, capture it and optimize the cost of capital for the partnership. So again, I'd say that we really want to look at everything. There's no preconceived notion or conclusions as to where ultimately this may lead us. Again with that objective of highlighting that value and optimizing the cost of capital for the partnership, it could include things like a buy-in of the IDRs at the partnership level, a public sale of some portion of the GP, other alternatives around restructuring the GP interests. Again, we want to make sure that we're going to look at everything and make sure that we understand what might be the best path to really have that value better reflected in the overall valuation of MPC.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah, I appreciate.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: And Neil...
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah, sorry, go ahead.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, and Neil, to your question on Speedway. We've talked many times about Speedway as well and you and other sell-side analysts have discussed this on how important Speedway is along with the midstream in trying to balance our cash flow across all cycles and we really believe that significant portion of the discount in our share price today really is reflected in the midstream space and Speedway is not the catalyst or the driver. Speedway has continued to perform very, very well, as indicated again in the performance for this quarter. So we look at the integration value. We look at kind of the dis-synergy if we were to do something different with Speedway, and we still believe that it has a very strong fit in our system.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I appreciate those comments, and Gary, my follow-up here is that you cited four reasons that other gross margins were under pressure nearer (22:31) gasoline and diesel, the non-transportation products, RINs, and I believe volumetric gains. How much of that is at third quarter phenomenon here as opposed to a recurring point. And I guess the reason I'm going here is that when I think about MPC's portfolio, historically you guys have outperformed your indicator margins by taking advantage of the logistics and the infrastructure advantages that you guys have. I want to make sure that's going to be a recurring advantage for MPC on a go forward basis.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Neil, you're spot on there with the outcome. Let's go back and look at the third quarter of 2016 versus the third quarter of 2015. Third quarter of 2015 had a rapid drop in the price of crude, and when you have that you're able to retain margins in all aspects of our business and all the way through asphalt. Asphalt was one of the major contributors to our third quarter last year. This year, when we started to see a steady climate in crude prices and with some of the problems that you had in the third quarter, you go back and look at Colonial, while sometimes a dislocation in markets such as – happened with Colonial, sometimes you recognize different pockets of the country and we're able to capture some of that value through the logistics arm that we have. That did not happen with that downturn and in fact it backed product back into the Gulf Coast and in fact backed product for the West. On top of that, we spent a lot of incremental money in order to be able to service our customers and keep our customers full during that period of time. So that was the phenomenon. But it really – Tim mentioned the gas and diesel prices, the price realization, but it really got into the bottom components and asphalt was a big marker that we saw as well. So I would say those are the big things. I would say they're non – expect them to be nonrecurring. Kind of a follow on to that here, early in the fourth quarter, with Hurricane Matthew, that had an upset across the entire Gulf Coast and some don't think about the tropical storm Hermine that hit in the third quarter, that had an effect as well. When you lose that volume from these top tropical storms, it's gone. So you all those affects – but all those things affected the third quarter and some into the fourth quarter. But I would expect that they would be nonrecurring.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Appreciate the comments. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. Good morning and congratulations on the more aggressive strategy. I guess, in MPLX debt to pro-forma adjusted EBITDA I think it was 3.5 times at September 30. So when you think from the MPC perspective of the cash versus units debate, or maybe just give some color as to what sort of expectation of how much cash you could get from these drops over the next year and then maybe next three years.
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Sure Ed. It's Tim. This is something that I think we're going to sort of carefully evaluate. I mean, the drops that we've talked about here and contemplated are certainly bigger than we've done in the past but I think we'll always be mindful of what the market capacity is to absorb new units. I think we would certainly want to take advantage of opportunities that exist, but clearly would not want to overwhelm the market with the number of units. So what we will – we'll assess as we go forward and make sure that we're being smart about it. I think the – from the overall enterprise perspective, we have a tremendous amount of flexibility here to take back units where we need to and we'll access the market in an opportunistic way as we go forward.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And then you've just had this new 707 tax rule, which reduces the amount of debt that you can use in basis for dropdowns, so I don't it maybe still early, but have you got any idea in terms of what tax leakage you would expect at the MPC level in terms of the drops or the impact that that ruling has?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, well. Obviously doing things as tax efficiently as possible will always be a primary focus. I mean the changes to the 707 regs to be honest, Ed, don't have a massive impact on our strategy, utilizing sort of debt-financed distributions back would not have been part of our normal mode with regard to the drops anyway. And frankly even before the 707 regs, a more aggressive tack that the IRS have sort of been targeting and obviously the change in regs is a – it sort of demonstrates that that's where that focus has been. So I don't think from our perspective, we view the change in the regs under the sky sale as substantially impactful to our strategy. But again, even the notion of taking back units and identifying assets with the greatest amount of basis, to shield as much tax as possible will be an important consideration as we evaluate which and what timing we'll undertake for the drop portfolio.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, and then if I could sneak a quick one in, the cash flow was the full working capital at $1.07 billion, but your earnings collapsed. I mean obviously there's the impairment, but even adjusting for that. So any color as to why cash generation is diverging from earnings would be helpful.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Ed, there's nothing specific in it. I'd say the – we had certainly some working capital impacts from the quarter that again really build on – based on some changes in prices and some inventory build in the quarter. And that was a relatively big use of working capital in the quarter. That's probably the biggest item of potential divergence that we'd highlight.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Great, thanks. Good morning. Gary, can you talk about the specific assets you're targeting for the 2017 drops?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. So, let me ask Don to cover that. Don's been doing most of the work on this.
Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, Chi. We would expect that particularly the first drop that we're targeting, those assets would be predominantly pipeline and terminal assets, so very, very traditional midstream assets that we currently own. And then later in the year, we also have some joint interest pipelines and others. So, it'll be in that vein of assets: typical, straight down the fairway, midstream assets that'll be moving from MPC to MPLX.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. And can you comment at all on what sort of multiple range you're targeting for the drops?
Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: I guess we're not targeting a specific multiple range. I think it'll be a fact and circumstance driven function based upon making sure that the drops are appropriately accretive for MPLX. One of the really important things about these drops was that, we wanted to – we don't believe that our yield is as low as we would like it to be at MPLX. And we are trying to take actions to lower that yield or lower our cost of capital. So, driving a distribution growth rate that is 12% to 15% and double digit in out years is important to us and having a valuation or multiple on the drop that makes sense to support that is, I think is in the best interest of both MPC and MPLX.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks, Don. And then one other question, can you comment on Marathon's interest in utilizing the reversal of the Laurel Pipeline once that becomes operational? And what are the opportunities this might open up for you down the road?
C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, Chi, this is Mike Palmer. I can answer that for you.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hi.
C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, hi, Chi. Obviously, when you look at the Midwest, we have a lot of refining capacity, and in the wintertime when gasoline demand goes down, certainly we have gasoline and distillate that needs to seek new markets. So you know we've been looking at a number of opportunities, but the reversing Laurel, such that Pittsburgh becomes primarily a pipeline supplied from the Midwest market is certainly big for us and we would participate in that.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: And Chi, we've been saying for some time, in fact I think Marathon was one of the catalysts of this idea, that it really makes sense to go West to East and starting to supply the PAD 1 market and it further balances all of PAD 2. So, we won't get specific yet into how many barrels we might move. I just say that this open season that has been just completed is going to be a big event for the entire PAD 2 industry because it has another outlet for us to balance the Midwest.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Yeah, I agree. And do you see enough demand from PAD 2 to eventually force the reversal all the way back to Philadelphia?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: I really believe long-term. And I've talked about this long-term that this is a – it's something that needs to happen, and is a big strategic move. So first I think we're looking to Altoona Mike (32:44), but yes, eventually I would see it going all the way to the East Coast.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Okay, great. Thanks Gary. Appreciate it.
Operator: And our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America / Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Good morning Gary.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Doug, how are you?
Doug Leggate - Bank of America / Merrill Lynch: Good, thank you. I – hopefully, we're going to see you in a couple weeks. I'm looking forward to that. The decision to take or the potential to take MPLX units in lieu of cash, obviously the quantity of the balance hasn't been determined yet, but what would that mean for your subsequent monetization of those units as it relates to your buyback strategy for MPC?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Doug, its Tim. Obviously that – if we did take back units, the percentage and number of units that MPC holds become substantial. And I think the things like potential sale of those units is something we'll evaluate over time. I mean again, wanting to make sure that anything that we do around that is tax efficient and we can minimize the amount of leakage around it. Again I think that our focus is much more around the total value getting realized within the system as opposed to the net cash, but I think we'll look at if there are efficient ways for us to potentially look at those units over time.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America / Merrill Lynch: I guess, just for clarification on my question, so if you took MPLX units, would you expect your buyback pace to moderate?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, again, the dropdown itself is not predicated on producing a huge amount of cash for a buyback necessarily. I mean the buybacks will always be a function of the cash that's being generated on an operating basis and potentially some from what gets dropped, so again, we'll evaluate as we go forward, and as we said, I mean, even if there are a number of units taken back, there's probably still a fair amount of debt that gets undertaken at the MPLX level on those assets. So I think the cash opportunity around it is beyond just the equity units themselves.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America / Merrill Lynch: Okay.
Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, I think you know Doug – Doug, this is Don. In 2016, one of the things that we were doing at MPLX was we had a leverage ratio that was non-investment grade in our view. And so, we committed to taking that leverage down and now we are in the zone that we want to be with respect to our leverage and to supporting an investment grade credit profile. So we would likely be thinking about funding future growth. Whether it is organic growth or whether it is dropdowns with a more sort of balanced 50-50 debt and equity type of arrangement. So, I think, hopefully that answers some of your question as well.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America / Merrill Lynch: Okay. That's helpful, Don. I guess my follow-up is probably also for you, Don, because the more traditional nature of the assets you know pipelines, terminals and so on, accelerating the dropdowns obviously means accelerating the increase in the refining cost basis. Can you quantify what that would look like based on the plan you have? In other words, how much would you expect the cost basis for refining to go up as you monetize these assets? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.
Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, I guess, I am not sure from the MPLX perspective. I mean, what we're trying to do is to build an EBITDA portfolio so that you know, we can continue to support that high growth rate that we are committing to.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America / Merrill Lynch: Right. But the EBITDA that you're transferring has an incremental cost to the refining business, right? Because you know the refining business, I know it's a wash at the consolidated level, but the refinery business has to now pay a fee for those assets that it's not currently paying. So I'm trying to understand what the increase in the cost base – and how you would account for that. I guess it's going to come out in the wash in the accounting but order of magnitude would be useful?
Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, again, Doug, and I know we've had a similar dialogue as over time. We really are viewing this at sort of the enterprise level with regard to the earnings that are available within the business and where ultimately they may reside rather that's as part of the traditional R&M segment or part of MPLX and obviously with the IDRs around them and the sort of recycle of cash. I mean we have tended to look at this and I think we'll continue to look at this on an enterprise-wide basis as opposed to the specifics around the impact on a particular segment within the business.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America / Merrill Lynch: All right. I'll take it offline. Thanks guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Hi Paul.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Gary, just curious that do you have a timeline in terms of the strategic review win that – I mean, when's the next time we're going to hear from you guys do you have or that it is just go along and that you really don't have a specific timeline?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: As far as a strategic review, Paul, I'm not sure I understand.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right. So I mean, do you have...
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Strategic review for the MLP or...
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: For the MLP, GP and the LPE (38:10) structure...
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Okay, okay.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: ...that strategic review. Do you have a timeline in terms of when that you think you're going to conclude or perhaps.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Sure. Sure.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: You don't really have a timeline at this point, and also that whether that strategic review and timeline have any indication on your MPLX distribution growth target for 2017 and 2018?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Right. I'm sorry I didn't – I wasn't tying your question at first. But I understand it. We've already been working on the strategic review. I would expect that we don't have an end date in mind, but with all the work we've already done, I would expect sometime mid-year or to be kind of in the arena of where we should have this work complete.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So that the December Analyst Meeting we should not assume we are going to hear a lot of update on that?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, Paul there's no Analyst Meeting scheduled for this year, but...
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Are you guys not going to do one?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: No, no.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: We do it.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: We do it generally every other year, Paul.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right.
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: And I think that, Paul, the – may be to provide a little bit of framework around that, I mean, we've identified this as one of the biggest sources of value discount with regard to MPC. So we have every incentive and motivation to move through this as expeditiously as we can. Again but I think we want to be careful and disciplined around the way that we look at things, but – we will be inclined to move through this as quickly as we can, and certainly we'll report back to investors, I think once we've determined what the most appropriate path is so, stay tuned. This is something that is a top priority for us.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. The second question then, just quickly, Tim, on the – I think with the Colonial Pipeline time for 10 days you incurred some additional trucking cost to supply your Speedway and Marathon network in the Southeast. Do you have a number that you can share, how big is that trucking cost? Is that material? And also whether that is being reported net of your refining margin?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, we have not sort of quantified or have anything to share. I mean, I think we would indicate there were some marginal increases on sort of trucking and some of the logistics cost to accommodate the situation, but nothing that is material that we'd call out specifically.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I see. And is it in the net margin or is it below line on the terminal cost and all the other total catch-all expense line?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. This is what sort of shows up in the other category with regard to the WACC. So again not amounts that we'd call out specifically, but that's where we would have captured it.
Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC. Please go ahead.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Good morning everyone.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Hey, Brad.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Gary, just circling back to some of the earlier questions about the general partner, I'm curious about the comment that you made specifically about reducing the cost of capital or optimizing the cost of capital for the partnership. I'm curious how that interacts with also unlocking value and how maybe having a public marker on the GP would help reduce the cost of capital and really what I'm getting at here is, is there a chance that maybe there is an IDR waiver that comes out as part of this process?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, again, Brad, I don't think there is any preconceived conclusions as to exactly the path we take, but I think modifications to the GP interests or potentially IDR modifications, again the buy-in, the public sale, there are all things that are on the table. I don't think we want to exclude anything from our considerations to make sure that, again, the focus really here is on highlighting that value and making sure that everyone sort of understands and the market can see and understand that value and making sure that we've focused on optimizing the cost of capital for the partnership, which obviously over time, and certainly in the lifecycle of MPLX is at a point where the IDRs continue to be a cash flow that has to be covered with regard to the growth. So I think we want to be mindful of all of these considerations before we land on any solution, and we'll certainly let the market know once we reach some conclusions.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thanks for that. And then thinking about the drops that you were talking about before, I think pipeline and terminals were mentioned. I know that the RINs are generally internal within the refining and marketing business, but I'm wondering if any of these drops are going to include the RINs.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: No, I mean, I think the drops that we've got contemplated now with some of the private pipelines and the terminals would not have any reflection from an earnings basis on the RINs, those are sort of independent from how we're looking at things.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. And one more quick one if I could. Gary, I think that a couple of months ago you talked about a potential reduction in the scope of the STAR project from $2 billion to $1.5 billion. I'm curious where you are in that review, and if you have any sort of updated EBITDA target for that new scope?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Right, let me ask Ray to answer this.
Raymond L. Brooks - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Sure. Earlier this year, we completed feasibility engineering of all the components of STAR, and what we concluded from that review was that, one of the components on newbuild distillate hydrotreater did not meet our internal minimum returns. So, at this point, we're not progressing engineering on that portion, and we're looking for other opportunities, evaluating other opportunities of unit revamps within the refinery to accommodate distillate desulfurization. So, that's a long way of saying that we do anticipate a drop in the CapEx that we were looking at before of the $2 billion range, we're looking at something south of that now, and we'll continue to progress our engineering and just do really what makes sense there. I might add at this point that the STAR program really is a multi-year, multi-faceted project, and earlier this summer we brought on the first pay part (44:40) which was a resid (44:42) desulfurization unit repurposing and expansion and that's played out very well for us. That was CapEx of about $65 million and it delivered the results and performing as expected, so we'll continue to look at the program and just do what makes sense economically.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay, so no new EBITDA target?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Not at this time. We're still finalizing the components of the project and when we have that finished, we'll make – we'll put it into our deck.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, good morning.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Good morning, Phil.
Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: First question is just on capital spending. I saw there is a budget out there for MPLX for 2017, wondering if you could just comment on the overall total MPC level capital spending outlook relative to this year, which I believe was tweaked up to 3.1 from 3.0 (45:42).
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, so we haven't given specific guidance at the MPC level, again that's something that we'll provide probably sometime in the fourth quarter here. At a macro level, we'd probably suggest that we're unlikely to see major changes from where things tracked in 2016, and again you saw the MPLX guidance in terms of the range that we might expect at the partnership, so.
Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Right. Okay. Second question is, just on the droppable EBITDA pool and the $1 billion that includes fuels distribution. Gary, I think in the past you've mentioned that there might be an opportunity for that pool to potentially increase for fuels distribution, is that accurate or is that – would you say that that fully encompasses the total opportunity within fuels distribution?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yes, Phil, I don't recall of saying that there is a chance for that to increase. That's volume dependent. We sell approximately 20 billion gallons today of material that what we believe would qualify for this fuels distribution, but I don't recall of ever saying that we are looking at that of possibly increasing.
Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then just my last question, there is a recently MPC filed a lawsuit with respect to Texas City, and I was just wondering Gary, if may be you could comment on that a little bit, just provide more color?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Sure, Phil. And I'm sure as you respect, we cannot openly talk about the litigation ongoing, so I just have to defer that to a later date.
Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons. Please go ahead.
Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International: Good morning.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Good morning, Jeff.
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Hi, Jeff.
Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International: Tim, on your slide 20, you did a WACC on the basic components of refining segment income that other gross margin to $287 million. I assume that they are probably the same variables that you talked about on the 3Q 2015 to 3Q 2016 slide. On the narrower gasoline, diesel margin, was that primarily a factor of Colonial Pipeline outage, or were there other factors that impacted?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, there is a number of factors, and as you suggest, the drivers that sort of led to the full quarter are really a lot of the similar ones that we saw on the year-over-year with regard to narrower gas and diesel price realizations are Colonial piece of that, but I wouldn't say the major driver, but again a component of the total change.
Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International: Okay. So, but Colonial was not the major driver there?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: No. No. It was not.
Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International: Okay. Okay. Thank you. And you also mentioned building inventories during the third quarter as a negative hit here, how significant inventory build did you have, and is that going to be a positive offset in 4Q?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, again, the inventory actions that we took in third quarter are not unlike other years, in large parts for hurricane build and sort of positioning the business into the season, so nothing unusual. And, again, I think a lot of those effects will always manage into the sort of LIFO targets that we've got for the business. So that was probably the bigger driver in the quarter with the refined products and crude build that were not sort of unexpected relative to how we manage the business.
Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International: Got you. And talking about alkylation, any updates to your Garyville FCC alkylation project scheduled for the end of the year, and perhaps any change to your octane outlook going forward?
Raymond L. Brooks - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. In the third quarter, we actually initiated some work on the alkylation revamp at Garyville, so that still stays well on target, and to be completed on schedule.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: As far as octane, Jeff, we still believe as you talk to the autos and you talk about the overall demand, we still think octane into the future is going to be a product in great demand, and it should be a valuable – it should have some incremental value to the entire slate as we go forward.
Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International: Thanks for your comments.
Operator: And our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil: Hey, folks, good morning. Gary, historically, you've talked about the benefits of control and basically maintaining a decent amount of control with regard to the MLP. I'm just curious with the announcement today, and some considerations on changes at that level, has there been any change in your appetite with regard to control and potentially maybe foregoing a bit in an effort to drive that value at the GP level?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: No, Blake. It's still a very big piece of our strategy that as we said back when we first initiated the MLP. Being able to control and having all the pipeline assets, terminal assets that are really the key to our integrated model is very, very important. And we'd continue to expect to control those.
Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil: Okay, great. The second question, and this is really more just clarity from a reporting standpoint. But obviously, you've already got a midstream segment, is it fair to think that the impetus behind this is to really reallocate some of that EBITDA that's coming out of the refining segment into midstream? And if so, I'm assuming we'll get some restated historical gross margins, et cetera.
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, Blake. I think that's conceptually how we're targeting that. There's a fair amount of what we've identified as MLP eligible earnings that really have been in the R&M segment historically. So certainly, for those portions that we think are and will be MLP eligible, identifying them independent from the R&M segment is conceptually I think what we're really targeting here.
Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil: Got it. Okay. Thanks, Tim. Appreciate it.
Operator: And our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah, good morning.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Hi, Roger.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: I guess to kind of come back to the overall strategic plan here if we could. As you've mentioned about the GP, we should consider almost anything as a possibility here from potentially elimination of the GP, a resetting of the IDRs or even an IPO of the GP, or is there something that's not on the table here? I just kind of want to make sure I understand all the potential here.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. Again, I think we want to be careful that we have looked at everything and have evaluated things, again with the real focus on highlighting that value and optimizing the cost of capital for the partnership. So, again, I think as we suggested, this is an evaluation that we'll undertake over the course of the next several months. And, again, I mean, it could include things like a buy-in of the IDRs, it could include a partial public sale of the GP, it could include some restructuring of the GP interest or the IDRs. Again, we want to be careful that we evaluate everything. We'll look at everything and pursue the path that we think makes the most sense relative to those objectives.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: And along those lines, do you – where you mentioned in the strategic plan optimizing the cost of capital for MPLX, which presumably applies to the GP and the IDRs, et cetera. I mean, is there an ideal cost of capital that you would plan to have there both pre-and post the $1.03 billion of dropdowns?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, I don't know if there's a specific number, Roger, that we focus on. But as Don alluded to earlier we've been generally unhappy with where the units have traded at the LP level. And certainly as the partnership moved into the high splits, and certainly with the addition of MarkWest, we know that the IDR burden on the partnership is significant, and obviously impacts the level of growth and things that we can pursue. So, I think a focus around things that will improve both in terms of the LP yield and where things are at as well as, again, ways to optimize the cost of capital for the overall partnership given the cash requirements that the IDRs bring are part of exactly what we're going to look at here.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then my last question, just as a follow-up of all of that. Presumably, the majority of the capital raised from the dropdowns, we should expect goes towards what, share repos, paying down debt, combination of the two?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, it all will sort of come into the total. I mean, I think to the extent that again we're comfortable with the liquidity position of the company, and we've got cash beyond the needs, then share purchase is high on our list. Debt pay down, I think we'll evaluate as we go forward. We did a little bit this quarter just to sort of calibrate the cap structure relative to the refining environment we've seen. But I'd say the priority is probably more around share purchase, and again certainly where the shares trade we think there's a tremendous value there, so.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. I appreciate your time. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, guys and congrats on today's strategic actions.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thank Evan.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Maybe just a follow-up to the last point. I mean, accelerated drops would be a significant cash windfall, I mean $1.4 billion x 9 is $12 billion before tax, before considering any GP potential monetization proceeds, which dwarf any capitalized costs you kind of referenced earlier today. Shouldn't we assume that most of that's going to support a buyback? I mean given your history, given your impetus for announcing today's actions that your equity is undervalued? And secondly, if drops are on the come, would you buy shares, use the balance sheet before they occur like in the 4Q? Your stock's down 5% today, and I know you didn't acquire much in the third quarter and with that size of monetization, you have a lot of shares to put away potentially.
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, and I think you're right, to be extent that there are big cash proceeds that ultimately come back, either from equity or debt that get raised through the drop process there, share purchase continues to be a priority for us in terms of where that money gets spent. Again, our focus is I think primarily and starts with the notion that the value hasn't been recognized. So, we want to make sure that that value recognition occurs, and to the extent that that produces cash at MPC level, that can be used for share buyback all the better. Again, provided that we have done that tax efficiently and managed it relative to the total needs of the enterprise. But, I think the notion that substantial portion could take the formal share purchase is not unreasonable.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. And maybe a similar follow-up to that and the prior questions on taking back equity as well as I guess your theory in terms of how this would be recognized by the market? But you mentioned dropping as soon as practical and then you dropped, and then you define drops per year. I mean, so is the limiting factor on the pace that you selected here, the capital markets – the equity capital markets for MPLX. So, meaning your actual dropdown pace could be faster if access or market depth or counterparty side proves to be greater? And secondly that your goal is really to sell units for cash, right, because that's what compresses your multiple, and that's ultimately in my opinion what forces and unlock the value versus potentially taking back units. So what's the limiting factor there? What is the limiting factor to the pace, and, I guess, is your goal to optimize the equity?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. I mean, I think, our goal will definitely be to optimize. The market capacity to absorb transactions is certainly a consideration among others that we've evaluated. But again, Evan, this is really a look as to – obviously, there is a piece of the dropdown portfolio that we're just not going to get comfortable with until we can get to the QI regs and the PLR around it. So let's set those aside for a moment. So, the remaining piece, we are moving pretty aggressively here. We're talking about dropping down up to half of those and setting a schedule for the remaining pieces, again, provided that we can get tax comfort on the rest at a pretty good clip. So, I think the considerations around it, it certainly involves market capacity to absorb larger transactions, but also just in terms of the pace and the capacity to manage the growth of the partnership and making sure that we can optimize that total sort of equation with regard to how fast we grow the partnership at the LP level and ultimately the cash flow that comes to the GP as well. So, again, I think, we are moving very aggressively here. I think we are – there are still certainly pieces of the drop portfolio that we will need to spend some time on the readiness for, but they are all from my perspective likely going to be part of MPLX, and we're moving very rapidly on it. So, I think this is an aggressive schedule, I mean, even though the drop that we suggested for first quarter would be the largest transaction for MPLX in its history, and again we recognize that that value is not getting picked up, and this increased clarity around the drop portfolio and when it comes in, we think, will help address that valuation gap.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. And then just maybe one more if I would. I mean, in terms of your statement of taking back units in conjunction with the drop, I mean, is that just a pragmatic statement that if that's what's necessary to fund, and I realize there is a debt piece that that provides cash to the parent. I mean, is that statement essentially there – if that's necessary? I mean, what's – or is it a goal to take, I guess, units back? That's what I am trying to get to.
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. But I wouldn't call it a goal. I would say that we want to be mindful of the market's capacity to absorb transactions. And where we can officially raise that capital, I think, we'd be inclined to do so. We have the flexibility to take back units to help alleviate any of those issues, and again we'll manage it prudently as we go here.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Big source of cash, guys, again congratulations.
Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, Evan, this is Don. I mean just one more comment on that. I mean one, you know, historically, we manage tax leakage by taking back units, so that was one aspect of it. And the other is, we are a substantial holder of MPLX units, so the value in the MPLX units, we want to make sure that we're not doing anything in the market that puts an overhang on those units that causes the value of our investment to decrease. So those are all things that get into the consideration.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And in the future if you could share an aggregate tax basis, so the drop (01:01:30) EBITDA I think that would be helpful as well.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our final question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC: Thank you. I guess, having settled that, I'm still a little bit perplexed by the timing here. If I look at the MPC share price or even the MPLX share price charts they don't look that troubled, I mean, I am sure you would want them higher, but I am still not clear why we have to have this announcement right here, right now. Could you just remind me why you decided that now is the moment that this needs to be announced? Thank you.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Paul, we've – as I said earlier in my comments that the first nine months or so, we work very hard at getting the MarkWest transition in place, really working with the producers, MarkWest had an outstanding reputation in the producers field, so meeting with producers and that really as I say getting these assets under wraps. But then, as you step back and look at how MPLX has performed and how the value has really been transparent or we believe lack of transparency of that value back into MPC, and the value to MPLX as well, that we thought it was important to really take a bold move here to increase the dropdowns, increase the pace of the dropdowns, of course a very bold move around us to reflect -an attempt to reflect what we believe is substantial value that is tied up inside of both components.
Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC: So, Gary, basically, I'm (01:03:35) obviously apologies, but do you see this as a major change in the strategy that is a much more aggressive dropdown outlook, and you felt the need to announce it right here right now?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Right. And Paul, if we take you back to prior to MarkWest, our strategy was to be a company-sponsored MLP, and all we had are dropdown components, and a few organic projects. At the time that we did MarkWest, we stated that we looked out into the future and could easily see that the rate of dropdowns from a sponsored MLP was not infinite and as you get out over time it was going to be much more difficult, and at the same time the pressure from others in the marketplace of attempting to be able to find growth opportunities was going to continue to be challenging, that's what we did the merger with MarkWest to begin with. We've been very pleased with the assets. Don has talked about the rate of growth, the volumetric increases and the gathering and processing businesses is very solid as well as the logistics and storage business that we have as well, but still we were not seeing that value transferred in the yield component of MPLX. And talking to a number of unitholders, they wanted to have a better understanding of the rhythm of how we were going to dropdown assets, and we felt that at this time it was again after getting all this under our belt, we felt its compelling that we needed to move forward back in line with where we said we would grow, kind of middle double-digits where we said we would grow when we first started the discussion on the merger to begin with.
Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC: Yeah. I get it. And I know we're over the hour, but can I just change subjects and ask you about...
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Sure.
Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC: ...the dreaded RINs thing. You've highlighted the cost here (1:05:51), but I get the sense there is a slight difference of view among refiners as to what should be done next. Could you first talk about what you anticipate to happen at end of November if anything? And then secondly talk about how you view the issue – the way the issue should be resolved? Thanks.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Right. Well, I don't know that anything is going to be happen at the end of November, Paul. But our – we've said for quite some time, and I know you've reported it as well that we believe how Marathon is positioned, we have the optionality, the flexibility with our retail component, our branded component and our very large blending component as well as some methanol production capacity. We have the ability to capture RIN value, and probably more so to lessen the cost of rig value across all those different components of our business. To change the point of obligation, we think that as fraught with many ramifications. Today, you have a – I don't know probably the number is less than 50 of refiners are big blenders for managing really step back and look at this, we're managing the whole RIN cycle for the EPA today. If you are going to go put this into the hands of 150,000 people, this considered what those ramifications are. We believe the RIN cost is captured in part of the frac spread today, and part of its retail, and part of its in blending. So we just think that change in the point of obligation is a bigger distraction.
Operator: And with that let me turn the call back to over Lisa.
Lisa Wilson - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thank you Katy, and thanks all of you for joining us today and your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or would like clarification on topics we discussed this morning, Teresa Homan, Doug Wendt and I will be available to take your calls. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call for Marathon Petroleum Corporation. My name is Katie and I will be operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call to Lisa Wilson, Director of Investor Relations.
Lisa Wilson: Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's second quarter 2016 earnings webcast and conference call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at Marathonpetroleum.com under the investors center tab. On the call today are Gary Hemminger, Chairman, President and CEO; Tim Griffith, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and other members of MPC's executive team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on slide 2. It is a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as our filings with the SEC. Now I will turn the call over to Gary Hemminger for opening remarks and highlights.
Gary Heminger: Thanks, Lisa. And good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us. If you'll please turn to slide 3. Earlier today, we reported second quarter earnings of $801 million or $1.51 per diluted share. Earnings included net benefit of $0.44 per share primarily related to a reversal of our lower cost of market inventory valuation reserve. All segments of the business performed well in the second quarter. Earnings benefited from improving crack spreads, robust product demand entering this summer driving and asphalt season, strong retail margins and the inclusion of Mark West in our consolidated results. The refining and marketing segment delivered strong results despite less favorable operating and market conditions during the quarter. Our integrated Seven refinery and extensive logistics network allows us to capture advantage feedstock and other raw materials as well as enhanced price realizations to our refined product distribution system. Our unique asset mix and flexibility position us to optimize operations even during disruptions such as those caused in the second quarter by the Canadian wildfires and refinery outages. Speedway continued its outstanding performance with a record second quarter segment income. In addition to higher light product sales volume and margins, the business delivered higher merchandise margins in the quarter. This improvement is consistent with a strategy to drive marketing enhancement opportunities. We're pleased with our progress in realizing synergies across the Speedway network earlier than originally planned and believe this will be a continuing source of value to the business. Speedway provides significant and growing stable cash flow, complementing MPC's integrated refining and distribution network. Speedway is MPC's most ratable distribution channel, provides a solid base to enhanced overall supply reliability and allows us to optimize our entire refining, pipeline and terminal operations. The midstream segment, including MPLX's financial and operational results, also delivered solid performance during the quarter. MPLX remains on target to achieve its 2016 distribution growth guidance without the need for additional dropdowns from MPC during the year. During the quarter, MPLX expanded its midstream presence in the Southwest with the completion of its Hidalgo gas processing complex in the Delaware Basin, where utilization is exceeding initial expectations. Construction of the Cornerstone Pipeline is also progressing as planned, with the completion expected in the fourth quarter. Cornerstone Pipeline is designed to provide MPC's Canton, Ohio, refinery with a direct supply of condensate out of the Marcellus and Utica regions and to supply natural gasoline to our Midwest refineries. As commodity prices recover, optimism is growing among MPLX's producer customers. And with world-class midstream assets located in some of the best resource plays in the country, MPLX is well-positioned to capitalize on an exceptional set of opportunities along the entire hydrocarbon value chain. As we enter the third quarter, both heavy and light Canadian crude differentials have returned to more favorable levels as the impact of the Canadian wildfires subsided. Canadian heavy production continues to grow and we expected good values throughout the third and fourth quarters. Additionally, we expect to continue to see spot opportunities in foreign sweet and sour cargos. The regional diversity of our refining assets also enabled us to benefit from access to the export market. We believe we have the right assets in the right locations, with 60% of our crude oil refining capacity in the Gulf Coast and 40% in the Midwest. We also expect to complete the first phase of our multi-year STAR program at the Galveston Bay refinery in Texas City next month. This phase will revamp and expand the resid hydrocracker by 12,000 barrels per day, improving the profitability of the refinery by increasing the conversion of lower-value residual oil into gas oil. EBITDA contribution from this initial phase is expected to average approximately $80 million per year. During the second quarter, we returned $221 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In addition, on July 27, our Board of Directors announced a 12.5% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.36 per share. The 29% compound annual growth rate and our dividend since MPC became an independent Company demonstrates our continuing confidence in the cash flow generation of the business. It also demonstrates our long term focus on capital returns while maintaining an investment-grade credit profile and strong liquidity throughout the cycle. The efficiency and flexibility of our integrated retail, logistics and refining system drives the diversified earnings power of the business and we remain encouraged by the long term prospects of our business and the value proposition for our investors. With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk you through the financial results for the quarter. Tim?
Tim Griffith: Thanks Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings on both an absolute and per-share basis. MPC's second quarter 2016 earnings of $801 million or $1.51 per diluted share, were down slightly from last year's second quarter earnings of $826 million. Gary referred to the $0.44 per-share net benefit in the quarter which included a benefit of $0.47 per diluted share related to the reversal of the lower of cost to market inventory valuation reserve and a charge of $0.03 per diluted share related to the impairment of one of MPLX's equity investments. The chart on slide 5 shows by segment the change in earnings from the second quarter of last year. As mentioned, earnings were impacted during the quarter by a $385 million pretax benefit to fully reverse our lower cost of market reserve. $360 million of this benefit is included in the refining and marketing segment and $25 million is reflected in the Speedway segment. After adjusting for this benefit, earnings were down approximately $410 million over the same quarter last year, largely attributable to lower income from our refining and marketing segment, higher interest expense resulting from the MarkWest merger and the equity impairment I just mentioned. These negative impacts for the quarter were partially offset by higher income contributed by our midstream and Speedway segments and lower income taxes. Turning to slide 6, our refining and marketing segment reported income from operations of almost $1.1 billion in the second quarter, compared to the income from operations of $1.2 billion in the same quarter last year. The decrease, after excluding the $360 million benefit from the LCM reversal, was primarily due to weaker crack spreads in both the Gulf Coast and Chicago and narrower LSWTI differential, less favorable market structure and higher costs related to turn our activity in the second quarter. Partially offsetting these negative impacts was an improvement in the sweet/sour differential in the quarter. The lower blended crack spread had a negative impact on earnings of approximately $502 million. The blended crack spread was $2.58 per barrel lower at $7.66 per barrel in the second quarter of 2016, compared to $10.24 per barrel in the same period last year. R&M segment income benefited $227 million by an approximately $2 per-barrel widening of the sweet/sour differential as well as higher sour runs in the quarter versus last year. The LSWTI differential narrowed $3.25 per barrel from $4.99 per barrel in the second quarter of 2015 to $1.74 per barrel in the second quarter of this year. This had a negative impact on earnings of about $100 million based on the WTI linked crudes in our slate. The market structure contango effect during the quarter is reflected in the $78 million unfavorable variance on the walk and relates to the difference between the product crude prices we use for market metrics and the actual crude acquisition costs in the quarter. The $70 million increase year over year in direct operating costs relates primarily to higher turnaround activity in the quarter versus last year. Turnaround in major maintenance costs increased $0.50 per barrel or over $80 million, compared to the second quarter of 2015. The higher turnaround activity also impacted total throughputs which were 62,000 barrels per day lower than the second quarter last year. Capture rate for the quarter was negatively impacted by the effect of rising crude oil prices on wholesale and secondary product margins, narrower crew differentials and tighter differentials on feedstocks relative to crude. Turning to our other segments, slide 7 provides a Speedway segment earnings walk versus the same quarter last year. As Gary mentioned, Speedway had a record second quarter earnings of $193 million which were $66 million higher than the second quarter 2015. Light product margin was a significant contributor to this increase along with higher merchandise gross margin and the $25 million reversal of Speedway's lower cost of market inventory reserves in the quarter. Gasoline and distillate margins were about $0.02 higher than in the second quarter last year at $0.155 per gallon, while volumes were up 33 million gallons quarter over quarter. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes increased 3/10 of a percent over the same period last year. Merchandise gross margin was $10 million higher than the second quarter last year due to overall higher merchandise sales and the higher margins realized on those sales. Merchandise sales in the quarter, excluding cigarettes, increased 2% on a same-store year-over-year basis, reflecting some of the progress we're making on enhancing our merchandise model across the entire business. In July, we've seen a decrease in gasoline demand, with approximately 1% decrease in same-store gasoline sales volumes compared to last July which you may recall was a very strong month in 2015. Speedway same-store gasoline sales growth was lower than estimated U.S. demand growth as we continually strive to optimize total gasoline contributions between volume and margin to ensure fuel margins remain adequate. Slide 8 provides the changes in the midstream segment income versus the second quarter last year. The $98 million increase quarter over quarter was primarily due to the combination of MarkWest at the end of last year which contributed $81 million of the incremental segment income to the quarter. The remaining increase of $17 million was primarily due to an increase in income from our equity affiliates and lower operating expenses versus last year. Slide 9 presents the significant elements of changes in our consolidated cash position in the second quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was nearly $1.8 billion. Core operating cash flow was a $1.2 billion source of cash. The $1 billion source of working capital noted in the slide primarily relates to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities partially offset by smaller increases in accounts receivable. The increases in accounts payable and receivable were primarily due to higher crude oil and refined product prices during the quarter which led to the net source of cash given the generally longer terms in the crude payables versus refined products. As we discussed in the first quarter call in April, MPLX issued convertible preferred equity during the quarter, generating equity proceeds of about $984 million. Proceeds from this private placement are broken out separately in the walk. MPLX used a portion of these funds to pay down its revolver which is included in the $521 million of net debt repayment on the walk. Return of capital during the quarter included the repurchase of $51 million worth of shares and $170 million of dividends. Share purchase activity may vary from quarter to quarter based on our needs and the cash flow characteristics of our business in any particular period. Our commitment to continuing returning capital remains the fundamental element of our strategy and important part of the value proposition for investors. Share count at the end of the quarter was approximately 528 million shares, reflecting repurchase activity of about $7.4 billion, retiring approximately 28% of the outstanding shares at the time that it's been. In addition, as Gary mentioned earlier, the $0.36 per-share dividend announced by our Board yesterday represents a 12.5% increase over last quarter's dividend and contributes to a 29% compound annual growth rate in the dividend since our spin. Slide 10 provides an overview of the capitalization and financial profile as of the end of the quarter. We had $11.1 billion of total consolidated debt, including 4.4 billion of debt at MPLX. Total debt to book capitalization was about 36% and represented a manageable 2 times last-12-months adjusted EBITDA of over $5.8 billion which is pro forma for the MarkWest acquisition. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.2 billion before reflecting the $1 billion source of cash for working capital in the quarter. Slide 11 provides updated outlook information and key operating metrics for MPC for the third quarter. We're expecting third quarter throughput volumes to be down slightly compared to third quarter 2015 due to more planned maintenance. Total direct operating costs are expected to be $7.65 per barrel on total throughput of 1.85 million barrels per day which reflects the impact of higher expected turnaround activity in the third quarter versus our third quarter last year. Our projected third quarter corporate and other unallocated items is expected to be about $75 million. With that, let me turn the call back over to Lisa for questions.
Lisa Wilson: Thank you, Tim. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If time permits, we will re-prompt for additional questions. With that, Katie, we will now open the call to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Doug Leggate: Gary, there has been obviously a lot of noise in the sector about the arbitrage potential value of your retail business. And I think your comments in your prepared remarks probably underlined your thoughts. But I just wondered if I could ask you to reiterate your view that retail is -- you are happy with the current structure of Speedway and the current business and whether you would ever consider a separation to try and exploit the arbitrage that some others were talking about.
Gary Heminger: Well, Doug, as you and I have talked many times, of course we look at this all the time. But, as in my remarks, we're very happy. And it illustrates when you have a down market like the refining sector has been in the last couple quarters, how important having a diversified portfolio and a diversified value chain is to a business like ours. It is not only the most ratable customer within our portfolio, it's also this and our long term strategy to grow the midstream business as well as the retail business. Those two segments are becoming, I would say, our most ratable cash flow streams within the business. So, yes, we're happy with the structure. But, yes, we continue to analyze and analyze very critically as you call an arbitrage. But when you look at an arbitrage, Doug, you also need to understand what the integration value is. Now, the integration value is, I would say, proprietary. I can't give out a number from a competitive reason of that integration value, but I can say it is very significant, especially when you look at downturns in the cycle. As I've mentioned several times, then you look again at the first half of this year, the EBITDA from Speedway the first half of this year clearly covers the total dividend and interest costs on our capital. So, yes, we're happy. Yes, we continue to analyze it very carefully. But I would expect that we will continue on as we're.
Doug Leggate: I realize it's not always easy to answer those kind of questions. My follow-up is really on the dividend. Obviously a nice bump last night. You're now mid-range with the peers. Going forward, what are your thoughts on the bounds in terms of distributions between buybacks and continued dividend growth? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.
Tim Griffith: Doug, our thinking has been and really since the time of the spin, that we would have a focus around maintaining a regular dividend that's got a growth cycle to it that is really sort of through the cycle and has got -- what we would love to see is double-digit over an extended period of time. So that is our primary focus to make sure that we have baselined capital turnaround -- an attractive and growing dividend that has got sustainability through cycle. Share repurchase for us continues to be a flywheel depending on the cash needs of the business, where we sit from a core liquidity perspective and how we're viewing things. Obviously we have taken down our capital spending plans in 2016 and I think some of the reductions that we have seen on the share repurchase side have gone in parallel with really a careful look at how the year will play out and what the cash flow generation looks like, but I think it will continue to be an important source and it will really be a function of the cash and liquidity position we find ourselves in as we move forward. So, continued focus. I know the activity is lower in second quarter and in first quarter than it's been over the last several years. But, again, it's really just a function of what the liquidity needs of the business are at different points in time.
Gary Heminger: And Doug, one more point to that. As many leading analysts have already printed this morning, as MPLX now has gotten into a good rhythm within the capital structure, the balance sheet and our growth going forward and as we expect that the yield will continue to improve within MPLX, that's going to give us that ability in the future as we have dropdowns to be able to bring that cash back in and further buy back shares. So that's a very important ingredient in our strategy as well.
Operator: And our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Evan Calio: My question is a sum follow-up to Doug's first question and maybe a different way to partially monetize the value arbitrage. I know you filed the IRS letter to expand the characterization of wholesale EBITDA which would add to your droppable inventory. Any update there and can you dimension the potential range for expansion of what might be MLP-able out of what is currently characterized as retail? Really appreciate it.
Gary Heminger: Well, Evan, we continue to wait on the IRS to answer our PLR. We're expecting that soon, but I don't know if that means this quarter, next quarter or the following quarter. We filed a long time ago, but still awaiting. The fuels distribution that we discussed earlier is really a -- I think an elegant way to consider -- Tim talked about a flywheel before. But that is an elegant way without getting caught up in a retail blocker, if you will -- a tax blocker to be able to drop down part of those -- of that value. So, we need to remain in our seats and wait for the IRS to opine on our request. But we feel confident that it will go forward. And, albeit, we give you a better range after we get that work back from the IRS.
Evan Calio: And the second question is on midstream. Shell is now building a cracker in Pittsburgh. It's still five years out. It's very positive for MPC and MPLX both from volume growth and what it means for pricing and relative Northeast pricing in particular put at parity with Mount Bellevue. Can you discuss that project or how it could affect your business and maybe how you are thinking about our positioning for that today?
Don Templin: Yes, Evan, this is Don. We have a leading ethane position in the Marcellus and the Utica. We've invested considerable capital in the past to be able to handle ethane recovery. And our view is that there is going to be continued production of -- and growth in ethane which will give us an opportunity. We're estimating probably -- depending on where the forecasts and up, we've heard or seen forecasts that would suggest in the early 2020s that there would be 500,000 barrels per day of ethane production. And if you got to those kinds of volumes, we could anticipate having capital projects that would be in the $500 million to $1 billion range in order to be able to extract that ethane to be able to support things like the crackers, but also to support ethane needs in the Gulf Coast and also for pipelines and other projects that are taking it to the East Coast.
Operator: And our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Neil Mehta: Gary, can you comment on the state of the product market as you see it? Inventories are elevated right now. Do you think that's a function of refining supply or a demand? And how do we work our way out of this? Do you ultimately think we need to see run cuts later this year in the world? And if so, where?
Gary Heminger: Yes, Neil, that's a very prudent question. And especially if you look at the same period last year, when we were in a very strong refining market last year. But refiners ran full out and that tremendous build and excess inventories is what really led to the downturn in the fourth quarter and early first quarter this year because of the rapid build of inventories and the long term to be able to run those off. I look at the inventories that came out yesterday, Neil -- in these PADDs where we predominantly operate, gasoline and PADD 2 is 2.9 million barrels over same period last year. And we were down 2 million barrels for the week. So we're in pretty good shape. The Gulf Coast is still a bit high on inventories. But Mike Palmer pointed out to me earlier today, if you look at the turnaround schedule coming up in the Gulf Coast for PADD 3 and early into PADD 4, it appears to be a significant turnaround schedule somewhere between 700,000 to 1 million barrels are going to be down over this period of time. And then of course we're going to switch to the winter-grade gasoline before long. On distillates, both PADD 2 and PADD 3 were fairly balanced on distillates the way I look at it across the chain -- or I should say across the industry. But the key point is and I believe that the refining industry has shown pretty good resolve in the past, that there is no need to be running inventories up that are going to cause the degradation in margins into the future. But as I say, distillates in pretty good shape right now. Gasoline PADD 2, we're in good shape. It's just PADD 3 gasoline is a bit high.
Neil Mehta: I might've misheard that, but did you call out same-store gasoline sales in Speedway were down 1% in July? And do you think that's just a function of comps? And could you just speak to how you see the demand trends on the gasoline side for the balance of the year?
Gary Heminger: And that's what we said; you are right, Neil. Gasoline has been a real strong contributor to Speedway over the first half of the year and I think somewhat can be timing. As you know, weather has been outstanding across most of the markets so far early in Q3 here. So, I would say it would be a bit more timing. I know Tony is on the line. Tony, would you like to add what you are seeing across the market?
Tony Kenney: Yes, you're right about the weather. That is driving traffic. We're seeing some nice benefits inside the store. On the volume, though, I think the comment about the comps that were hurtling from last July, fairly significant. We were close to 2% up last year and that's relative to both year's performance isn't all that bad.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Ed Westlake: When the market opens in the two minutes whether yield on MPLX goes. But do you think the yield at MPLX is now low enough, bearing in mind you've got the IDRs, to get on the front foot for growing projects at this cost of capital assuming that the upstream customers are there to do it? And also to start dropping down for cash?
Gary Heminger: That's kind of a softball question to add on whether I think the yield's where it should be. No, I think the yield should be much lower than where it is based on the tremendous suite of assets, both drop-down assets and organic assets. And then the other thing that we pointed out in the release this morning is we've indicated a double-digit growth in 2017 and we have not talked about that previously. So, I think that with the increase we just had in MPLX, with the expectations of growth in 2017, with the success that we've had and what we believe will be growing volumes in our base business -- and the other key to watch within MPLX as well, that is -- if you look at our capacity utilization, as commodity prices improve, we have a tremendous amount of basically free space to be able to fill up some of the capacity that we already have invested in that will fall directly to the bottom line. So, we're expecting that our yield is going to continue to improve with this solid performance, again, that we've had. Our balance sheet is in good order. But in order to be able to make a real step improvement in being able to drop down more at favorable multiples, we expect to be more competitive in the yield going forward.
Ed Westlake: Yes. I guess I was just trying to get to the point that obviously there's been an improvement in cash this quarter. Obviously part of it is the preferred and the working capital release. But if you can start dropping down for cash, you can start to build cash at MPC level, drive the LP BCF per unit up and also then obviously buy back stock. So just trying to get a sense of when that process might start, in your opinion.
Gary Heminger: Yes, you are absolutely right. As we stated earlier, we're in very good shape. We don't need to have another drop here in 2016. But we will continue to see how the markets perform and we can always pivot if we need to. But I think we're in very good shape, as we said.
Ed Westlake: And my follow-up is just on the synergy capital progress. Obviously that's a big chunk of potential future EBITDA -- $6 billion to $9 billion. Obviously, the industry is not on the front foot yet, but I'm sure you're doing a lot of work in the background. So maybe just give us a bit of color on -- I guess you have got nine projects. How those projects -- maybe not each one, but how those projects in aggregate are coming on.
Don Templin: Yes, this is Don. We're very focused on progressing a number of those projects. And as we think about the ones that we have prioritized, the first priority is to help move NGLs to the East Coast. So, we think about our producer customers. They are seeing some optimism in terms of NGL pricing and improvement in NGL pricing. But the flat price isn't the only issue for our producer customers in the Utica Marcellus in that basin. It's been the deferential that they have been experiencing like Mount Bellevue pricing. So, very focused on moving NGLs to the East Coast and I can say that that project is probably the one that is furthest ahead in terms of an in-service date and getting a solution. We're also looking at moving NGLs to the Gulf Coast and have been in regular discussion with our partner enterprise on Centennial and evaluating the feasibility of a reversal of Centennial. And then the third major project that we've been spending a lot of time on is a project to a butane-to-alkylate project that would likely be positioned somewhere near our processing facilities in the Utica Marcella's and that will allow us to convert butane to alkylate and allow our producer customers to see an uplift in their overall valuation. But that's a big project. That's a multi-year -- would be a multi-year project. And we're in, I would say, the heavy part of the engineering right now in terms of evaluating that.
Operator: And our next question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brad Heffern: Circling back on repurchases for this quarter, obviously there is the big working capital benefit and the cash balance was up pretty significantly on a sequential basis. Can you talk about why there weren't more repurchases? Is it a matter of that working capital potentially reversing next quarter?
Gary Heminger: Well, again, I think anytime we're making decisions on the liquidity position and where we're positioned, it also incorporates how we see things playing out from a forecast basis over the coming months and quarters. So I think we're mindful of that. The working capital benefit obviously is a big function of where absolute crude prices are at and how quickly they move. So, a lot of what -- and frankly, a lot of what was done from a cash basis was done as really sort of a pre-funding for capital spend we would have expected at MPLX over the course of the year. So that capital raise was less about trying to build into a big capital -- big cash position that could be spent and more about really taking care of the needs of the partnership over the back half of the year. We did pay down some of the debt, again, just to open up some capacity. But it really is -- I would say most of the proceeds that were brought in are sort of spoken for this point and probably would not go back and perform a share repurchase.
Brad Heffern: Okay, understood. Then in the prepared comments, you talked about the phase 1 of the STAR project coming online and the $80 million in EBITDA. I'm curious, is that all EBITDA that comes online when you guys flip the switch on that or has some of that been seen in previous quarters? And additionally, what's the underlying assumption for that $80 million in EBITDA? Is that at current cracks or is that some sort of five-year average number?
Ray Brooks: Yes, this is Ray Brooks. I'll take a shot at answering that question. The $80 million of EBITDA is on an annualized basis. So, as Gary mentioned, we're bringing on phase 1 of STAR this year which is actually two parts of that. One part that we did a few months ago where we resid the asphalting unit. We essentially did a project to turn that into its original purpose to be asphalt resid. And then, as Gary said, by the end of next month, we will have the rest of that project completed, but we're actually expanded by 12,000 barrels a day. So, those two parts together lead to a combined EBITDA contribution of $80 million a year. And we continue to look at this -- the economics on a point-forward basis and we're still good based on the assumptions here that it's in that range.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons. Please go ahead. 
Jeff Dietert: Question on -- as you look at your linear program models with the current margin environment, it looks to continue to drive relatively strong throughput per your guidance. How is the LP evolving? Still maximizing summer-grade gasoline? Is there any -- are there any regions where you are shifting to a more distillate-based yield? And there's been some commentary of that shifting to winter-grade gasoline production. Could you talk about how the current pricing is shaping up for you?
Ray Brooks: Sure. This is Ray Brooks and I will take a shot at that question, too. You asked a couple different things here. First regarding the LP model, yes, we do run the LP model on a weekly basis and we look at our crude avails and our product mix and determine what we're going to make and at what rate. And we will only run to what's economic for us -- makes economic sense to us. Regarding distillate and gasoline and winter-grade production, right now we're producing summer grade and we have about two months before we can legally sell -- start selling higher vapor pressure gasoline to our customers. So we're still in that mode. Now as far as distillate to gasoline, as you know, the economics there change frequently. And right now predominantly we're pointed towards diesel. And just to give you a little flavor, we have about a 10% swing that we have the ability to swing back and forth on our swing strings between gasoline and diesel.
Jeff Dietert: And secondly, product exports have been an important part of your strategy. Could you talk about what you saw on second quarter product exports and perhaps give a view on early 3Q outlook on exporting product?
Mike Palmer: Yes, Jeff, it's Mike Palmer. I would be happy to talk a little bit about exports. If you look at the second quarter of 2016, we have exports of 325,000 barrels a day. So, exports were strong. Things look very good for us in the second quarter. When we look around the market, most of the strength was in Latin America, although -- and obviously you know we're well-situated to supply Latin America due to the proximity, but we're also finding that we've had diesel cargos that are making its way over to Europe. So that ARB has been more difficult but still works under certain circumstances. So, we see the exports being strong. We have no reason to believe that will change at all in the third quarter. The first quarter was a little light due to supply, really, due to turnaround activity. But things continue to go very well.
Operator: And our next question comes from Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.
Chi Chow: Just a couple questions -- I guess one on the crude slate. It looks like you ran a really high percentage of WTI-based crudes in the Gulf Coast in Q2 relative to recent history. That's a bit surprising given the TI spread. Can you talk about that? And also, it looks like that heavy and medium sour crude differentials have narrowed recently, particularly on a percentage basis. What is your outlook there on the dynamics on the heavier crude markets going forward?
Ray Brooks: Yes, Chi, Mike Palmer again. You know, with regard to your second question first, I guess, with regard to sour crude, we're finding a lot of opportunities in the sour crude right now. Not only in the Gulf of Mexico where, if you look at those spreads over the last six months, Mars has been discounted to LLS in the range of $5 to $6. It's been pretty stable. We see that continuing. The sour crudes in the Gulf are still growing and we see really good value there. With the ARB coming in, we're also seeing some really good opportunities worldwide. We're bringing in more spot sour cargos than typically we have been able to find value in. And because Galveston Bay and Garyville have the ability to run the heavy, more difficult crudes high-TAN crudes, that's what we tend to focus on because that's where we get the discount. So we see that continuing to go forward. In terms of the additional WTI-based crudes, that's going to shift back and forth depending upon what's happening at the plants, what crudes we're really optimizing on a daily basis between the WTI and the LLS-based crudes. So I don't think there's anything structural in the market there. It's just part of the overall optimization.
Gary Heminger: Chi, it was the right question. If you look at our slate -- as we talked about at this same time last year, last year we were running about 55% sour. This year we ran a little over 61%. So we have the ability to swing back and forth due to the composition of our refineries and take advantage wherever the best margins are in the market. So, 61% is one of the highest percentages of sour we've run for some time. I just want to give you those parameters.
Chi Chow: That's really high. But are you seeing Canadian barrels back to normal levels of availability at this point? And I guess on the Gulf Coast, just from the Latin American barrels, any concerns about the steep production climbs we're seeing -- Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela -- on the heavier crude availability out of those regions?
Gary Heminger: You know, we've had a hard time trying to make sense of a lot of the Venezuelan crudes for some time there. They are not very dependable and they have been declining. So, I don't -- I would say that we really haven't had a big focus on much of the Latin American crudes. There are some out of Columbia that have made a lot of sense for us, but we don't really see that as a big deal. We have seen more interest in, for example, some of the Middle Eastern heavy crudes. With regard to Canadian, yes, the wildfire situation is behind us now. And we've seen the Canadian spreads return back to normal. They look a lot more attractive to us than they did before. And, as you know, the Canadian heavy with these projects that were sanctioned prior to this fall in crude prices, those projects continue. So, the Canadian heavy continues to grow. And we see a lot of value in the Canadian heavy.
Chi Chow: And then one question on the potential drop of the fuels distribution margin. When you look at that, I guess what happens to the RIN if hypothetically you do drop that -- the fuels distribution margin down? Does the RIN go with it or does the RIN stay at the MPC level?
Gary Heminger: No, the RIN would -- we would expect, Chi, that the RIN would still be controlled by MPC.
Chi Chow: Okay. Even though you've got the wholesale piece going? Structurally--
Gary Heminger: Yes, but where we're looking at the fuels distribution, it would be after the RIN or after the blending would have taken place. So, I would expect that we would not be putting any RIN volatility inside of MPLX.
Ray Brooks: Yes and Chi, I think the other important piece of that for how we have thought about this and the potential for structuring it, we're really looking at it as a sort of service arrangement as opposed to the transfer of inventory necessarily. So the -- I don't think we would expect any change to the -- where the RINs are resident and where the benefit resides.
Operator: And our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.
Roger Read: Guess I would like to catch up a little more and try to -- how to think about the share repurchases and how they will fit in. I understand a little early to lay out 2017 CapEx, but you did improve the balance sheet year to date. It sounds like in every which way, MPLX is on much firmer footing and a solid growth outlook. Refining, probably better in 2017 than it is right now. So, as you get free cash flow, how should we think about it between consistent raising of the dividend, further balance sheet repair if need be and then the share repurchases?
Gary Heminger: Well, again, I think, again, the focus around capital return and how we do that is going to continue in the business for as long as we can imagine. How we balance that -- I think the key part, Roger, is maybe as you allude to a little bit that this is really going to be a balanced approach. I think we're not inclined to go all in on full investment. We're not inclined to go all in on full share purchase. It's really going to be finding that balance that's in the business based on what the earnings look like, what the cash flow generation could be and exactly where we find ourselves financially at each point in time. Again, as I referenced earlier, this really becomes sort of a flywheel as we evaluate exactly how we want to position the business from a capital allocation perspective. We expect a level of activity will be there and could vary in different periods in time, but will be an important part of our balanced approach on the capital allocation side.
Roger Read: And as a follow-up to that, Gary, certainly Marathon has been an acquisitive Company. I understand you may be in more of a digested phase right now. But as you do free up more capital, whether from a retail, wholesale drop-down or further growth inside of MPLX, what else looks interesting on the M&A front? Is there a desire to expand the refining or should we think about it as a midstream retail growth really only at this point?
Gary Heminger: When you look at the valuation metrics of refining today, I think we're -- we have a very good platform and a good footprint in refining of where we want -- where we like being today. Doesn't say that we won't look at the other opportunities that may come about; we will. On the retail and midstream side, of course, we're very interested in continuing to build out within our footprint. The retail side -- we have the platform, the ability and, as Tony's team has been able to certainly illustrate, the expertise to be able to step outside of our footprint and perform very well. So we will continue to be interested in retail. I think retail and midstream probably give us higher returns. But I would say where our share prices are, as Tim just alluded to, buying back shares will be the top of mind as well.
Operator: And our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Paul Cheng: Gary, with MPLX sort of stabilized, do you believe that this point and going forward, whatever is the new investment opportunity, whether it is building out more NGL distribution business over there, I think it would be all self-funded that the need for the parent operation -- any support we need just [indiscernible] behind and you are not going to consider going forward? Or that this is -- may have opportunity that at some point it would be so great from MPLX that you would still consider support from the parent? 
Gary Heminger: And you are right, Paul; it just depends on the situation. As Don just mentioned, we have -- he was speaking to some of the big organic projects we talked about. And some of those can be hefty because of the size of the projects. And we will see what the carry might be, if any. But we have stabilized the balance sheet. I think that the business -- the base business is picking up. As commodity prices improve, the coverage should continue to improve. So I believe that it can stand on its own into 2017 and we will see at that point. But I don't see anything over the next few quarters that MPC would need to step in and support their balance sheet.
Paul Cheng: I know it's early. Any memory -- CapEx for 2017, even from a direction standpoint, you can share given the recent weaknesses in the refunding margins? Should we assume that CapEx is going to be somewhat similar to this year or that you think it's going to be down or going to be up?
Gary Heminger: Well, Paul, I would say that when we come to your conference during September, we're going to be able to have a pretty good idea of where we're looking at CapEx going forward. We're in that phase right now. I wouldn't expect it to be up from where we're in 2016, but we're just in an initial phase of looking at the capital for 2017 and beyond.
Paul Cheng: A final one and maybe this is for Mike -- Sandpiper. With a number of the major projects our region from getting oil out from Bakken, are we going to have enough oil from Bakken to fill that line?
Gary Heminger: Yes, Mike will take that. Mike?
Mike Palmer: You know, that really depends on what happens with crude prices and we think that things are rebalancing quickly now. We think that oil prices will be up and we do believe that North Dakota production is a big resource. We believe that North Dakota production will go up as well. So there will be oil into the future to feed the various pipelines.
Operator: And our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Phil Gresh: Perhaps just as a follow-up to Ed's question on the drop potential, how do you think about the deal pace of drops moving forward in terms of maybe on an annualized basis, what you think MPC you can get back from jobs that can be reallocated? And then also in terms of value-unlock opportunities, how are you thinking about the GP here? Do you think it's at a mature enough state to consider unlocking some value there or do you think you would need more time?
Gary Heminger: Well, I would say, Phil, we don't look at it as what can we hurry up and drop. We look at it as what is the growth rate that we're trying to achieve and what are the mechanisms that we use to achieve that growth rate. And as we stated in our release this morning that we expect double-digit growth rate, we're on target, first of all, to meet that parameter that we set out of 12% to 15% this year and then a double-digit growth next year. So, that is directionally how we look at it, Phil.
Phil Gresh: Okay and on the GP?
Gary Heminger: The GP -- when you were out visiting with us, we still believe that the GP is -- this is a -- it has to mature more to consider that. This clearly isn't the market to try to float a GP IPO. And the other thing that as -- we certainly have recognized in the market with some changes in structure is that it appears that simplification is better. But we continue to analyze and we will continue down that path.
Phil Gresh: Okay. And then my follow-up is just around the level of maintenance spending that we're seeing this year in the refining side. As we look ahead, would you say this is above normal in terms of maintenance this year? Or how might you suggest we think about the normal level of maintenance spending moving forward?
Ray Brooks: Well, this year was definitely a step up on the maintenance side from the standpoint -- it was a heavy turnaround year. So -- but it was definitely a step up. But our goal in refining is what do we have to do year in, year out to level that spend as much as possible. Take care of our turnarounds, but try to keep things as constant as possible.
Phil Gresh: Is there a specific number you might think about that you would get back next year just from having fewer turnarounds?
Ray Brooks: Yes, I don't think I can talk forward in forward numbers at this time.
Operator: And our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Paul Sankey: Back to these terrible RINs, Gary, I'm afraid. I don't know if you listened at all to what [indiscernible] was saying yesterday about a lawsuit or if you saw Jack Lipinski's comments this morning which were very aggressive, about essentially the idea that third-party traders and speculators are driving up the price of RINs. My question to you, Gary, knowing how involved you are in Washington is what is your stance, first, on what you think should happen? And what do you guys actually want as Marathon Petroleum? What do you feel is in your best interest as regard to RINs? Thank you.
Gary Heminger: Sure. While clearly we need to have our best interest which we continue to strive for, is full repeal of the renewable fuel standard. But knowing that that is a heavy lift, there has been a bill that's been introduced on the floor known as the Flores bill that would limit blending at 9.7% which really takes into account the neat gasoline that's in the market as well. We think that that needs to be supported with tremendous amount of support already inside the House on this bill and we need to get others on schedule as well. The RIN prices, you're right. Upwards of $0.95, $0.98. I know they've hit $1 over the last couple weeks. And it's a -- and I think -- I don't think, I know the reason is because the market is understanding that we're going to be very close and probably will tip over the 10% ethanol blend wall this year. Therefore, RINs are going to be at a -- the demand for RINs are going to outpace the supply. The steps that we've taken over the years, as illustrated as well in this morning's comments, is that we're in very good shape and we're fairly balanced on the RIN side. But nevertheless, we want a significant amendment or repeal of the renewable fuel standard and are working very hard towards or in that direction.
Operator: And our final question comes from Spiro Dounis from UBS. Please go ahead.
Spiro Dounis: Just one really quick one for me. Hopefully on M&A, and I know the question was asked earlier, but maybe just from a different perspective. Just in terms of the opportunity set out there and maybe quarter over quarter, it seems like things are pretty dire in the first quarter and gradually improved. And I'm wondering if you saw maybe a lot of fire sales come out of the market or if you still see a lot of opportunity out there in terms of what is available to pick up in whether it be retail, refining or midstream?
Gary Heminger: I think for the most part -- except on the midstream side, for the most part, R&M and retail has really ridden the wave here to the fourth quarter and first quarter. There is nothing pending on the refining side of the slate. There are rumors on different things that might be available. But I think the refining side still would be fairly pricey and be pricey versus the multiples that are achieved in the marketplace today. But beyond that, I would say there is some -- there has been some movement in the retail space. And Don can mention here on the midstream side what he is seeing across the midstream space.
Don Templin: Yes, Spiro, we haven't really seen any significant change. I think the people that were really in a desperate situation at the end of the fourth quarter going into the first was primarily on the E&P side. Clearly, the cost of capital was increasing for the midstream producers -- or midstream players. But I just haven't seen a dramatic change one way or the other. The folks that would be potentially in play in the first quarter are still in play and we haven't seen any big pullback in terms of opportunities.
Operator: And with that, I will turn the call back to Lisa.
Lisa Wilson: Thank you, Katie and thank all of you for joining us today and your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or would like clarification on topics discussed this morning, Teresa, Holman and I will be available to take your calls. Thank you.

Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call for Marathon Petroleum Corporation. My name is Katie and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I now turn the call over to Lisa Wilson, Director of Investor Relations. Miss Wilson, please go ahead.
Lisa Wilson - Director, Investor Relations: Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Webcast and Conference Call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at MarathonPetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, Chairman, President and CEO; Tim Griffith, Senior Vice President and Chief Finance Officer; and other members of the MPC executive team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on slide two. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. Now, I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks and highlights.
Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Lisa. And if you please turn to slide three. Earlier today, we reported first quarter earnings of $1 million, which included charges of $0.06 per diluted share related to a goodwill impairment recorded by our consolidated subsidiary, MPLX, and a lower cost or market inventory charge. The lower earnings this quarter were largely attributable to weak crack spreads, especially in the first two months of the quarter, as well as high turnaround activity. We completed significant turnaround activity at the Robinson and Galveston Bay refineries, ahead of schedule and under budget. As part of these turnarounds, we commissioned the light crude upgrade project at our Robinson, Illinois, refinery to increase light crude processing and overall crude capacity. This upgrade will improve the refinery's flexibility to optimize its crude slate and product yields in a variety of market conditions. We also implemented additional process improvements and synergy projects at our Galveston Bay refinery in Texas City in an ongoing initiative to enhance margins at that complex. Even with the challenging market conditions in the first two months of the year, we remain encouraged by the strengthening of frac spreads late in the quarter, as gasoline inventories declined and refiners responded to market conditions. In addition, we're also encouraged by the supply and price competitiveness of sour crude oil as we enter into the summer asphalt season. Heavy Canadian crude oil is still growing, and it's attractive for both our Midwest and U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. Medium sour crude also looks very promising. U.S. Gulf of Mexico sour production is growing, and we are seeing more foreign sour cargo opportunities than we have for some time, as OPEC competes for market share. MPC can capitalize on these opportunities, since we can process even the very heavy high-asset and high-sulfur crude oil at both our Galveston Bay and Garyville refineries. We are also well- positioned to take advantage of the expected strength in gasoline demand, given our high gasoline yield and pure leading alkylation and reforming capacity. We reported strong financial results from our Speedway and Midstream segments, which underscored the value of our ongoing strategic objective to grow the more stable cash flow segments of our business. Speedway continued its exceptional performance in the first quarter. In addition to higher light product sales volume, Speedway's merchandise margin increased in the quarter, reflecting progress toward our goal to generate two-thirds of our profitability from merchandise sales. This approximates the earnings contributions of merchandise sales prior to the acquisition of East Coast and Southeast locations at the end of September of 2014. We are focusing on the significant marketing enhancement opportunities at our recently converted retail locations, further optimizing the value of these assets and building out the earnings power of the entire Speedway business. We are also pleased with our Midstream segment, including MPLX's financial and operational results this quarter. MPLX completed several key operational projects this quarter, while generating strong, distributable cash flow for the partnership. Despite the challenging environment from midstream MLPs, we remain enthusiastic about the quality of the partnership's gathering and processing assets and the diversified customer base they support, particularly at the prolific Marcellus and Utica Shale regions. We believe the partnership is very well positioned to take advantage of the continued volume growth as NGL prices improve. Over one-third of the total U.S. gas rigs currently in service are in the rich and dry gas areas where MPLX operates and enjoys acreage dedications. Over the last year, the partnership commissioned almost 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of processing capacity to support its customers' growth plans. This year, MPLX anticipates its processing facilities in the Marcellus and Utica to average approximately 80% utilization, as it expects its overall processed gas volumes from this region to increase by approximately 15%, a notable increase in light of the current commodity environment. At the end of the quarter, we completed the contribution of our Inland Marine business to MPLX at a supportive valuation in exchange for additional MPLX equity. Our near-term support of the partnership in this challenging environment for MLPs is intended to contribute to the long-term value MPLX creates for our shareholders through our limited partner and general partner distributions, dropdown proceeds and the overall value of our equity interest in MPLX. We continue to believe the addition of the MarkWest business will be a powerful value driver for MPC and its shareholders over the long term. We will continue our disciplined investment strategy across all segments of the business, balancing value-enhancing investments with returning capital to shareholders over the long term. We also remain committed to strong liquidity and an investment-grade credit profile through all cycles. In the first quarter, we returned $244 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and announced a significant reduction of nearly 30% of our 2016 capital expenditure plan. MPLX announced yesterday its $1 billion private placement of convertible preferred securities with third-party investors. The partnership elected to take advantage of very strong investor interest in convertible preferred securities by privately placing $1 billion with a select group of investors. Originally contemplated as a transaction with MPC, the private placement provides an attractive funding source for the partnership, while preserving MPC's capital and financial flexibility. The combination of some opportunistic ATM issuances in the first quarter, combined with this private placement, provides for the partnership's anticipated funding needs for the remainder of 2016 and into 2017, therefore enabling MPLX to continue its execution of attractive organic growth projects that will contribute to distributable cash flow and long-term value for the partnership. The transaction is expected to close in early May. MPC is well-positioned to benefit as market conditions improve. In addition to our financial strength, we have a sustained competitive advantage from our refining system, premier retail assets and an enhanced logistics and storage network, with the addition of the MarkWest assets to MPLX. We remain bullish about the prospects for the enterprise as we go forward this year and beyond. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tim, who will walk through the financial results for the quarter.
Timothy T. Griffith - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Gary. Slide four provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. MPC had $1 million of earnings for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $891 million in the first quarter of last year. As Gary mentioned, first quarter earnings included charges of $0.06 per diluted share to impair a portion of the goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of MarkWest, as well as the lower cost or market inventory charge. The impact of the goodwill impairment charge on diluted earnings per share only includes the impact of our then 21% equity interest in MPLX. The chart on slide five shows by segment the changes in earnings from the first quarter last year. The primary drivers for the change were the $1.4 billion decrease in refining and marketing income and the $129 million goodwill impairment charge, partially offset by lower income taxes and higher income from our Midstream segment, which reflects the first full quarter of results from the combination of MPLX and MarkWest. Turning to slide six, our Refining and Marketing segment reported a $62 million loss in the first quarter of 2016, compared with income of operations of $1.3 billion in the same quarter last year. The decrease was primarily due to weaker crack spreads in both Chicago and Gulf Coast, higher cost related to the turnaround activity at Robinson and Galveston Bay, and a narrower LLS-WTI differential. In addition, we had less favorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to our market indicators, resulting from narrow crude differentials, which is included in the $199 million of other gross margin negative impact highlighted on the slide. The lower blended crack spread had a negative impact on earnings of approximately $869 million. The blended crack spread was over $5 per barrel lower at $4.62 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $9.69 per barrel for the same period last year. The LLS-WTI differential narrowed $2.57 per barrel from $4.23 per barrel in the first quarter of 2015 to $1.66 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016. This had an approximate $81 million negative impact on earnings based on the WTI-linked crudes in our slate. The $231 million year-over-year increase in direct operating costs related primarily to higher turnaround activity during the first quarter. Turnaround and major maintenance costs increased $1.64 per barrel or about $260 million compared to the first quarter of 2015. The higher turnaround activity also impacted throughputs, which were 78,000 barrels per day lower than the first quarter last year. Partially offsetting these negative impacts was favorable market structure during the quarter. This contango effect is reflected in the $117 million favorable difference on the walks and relates to the difference between the prompt crude prices we use for market metrics and the actual crude acquisition costs. Moving forward to the other segments, slide seven provides a Speedway segment earnings walk compared to the first quarter of last year. Speedway's income from operations was consistent with last year's first quarter at about $167 million. Last year was a record first quarter for our Speedway business, even before including the retail assets acquired along the East Coast and Southeast. So we are very pleased to see the continuing strong performance in the first quarter of this year. Gasoline and distillate margins were about $0.03 lower than the first quarter of 2015. This was offset by higher merchandise margins, higher gasoline and distillate sales volumes and a $24 million gain from the sale of a retail location in the quarter. Gasoline and distillate margins averaged $0.168 in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.197 in the first quarter of 2015. This decline reflects some the stickiness in price at the retail level, when crude prices move rapidly, as we experienced later in the first quarter. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes increased 1% over the same period last year. Merchandise margins were $19 million higher than the first quarter of 2015, due to overall higher merchandise sales and the higher margins realized on those sales. Merchandise sales in the quarter excluding cigarettes increased 3.1% on a same-store, year-over-year basis, reflecting some of the progress we're making in merchandising across the entire business. In April, we've seen an increase in demand with approximately 1.4% increase in same-store gasoline sales volumes compared to last April. Slide eight provides changes in the Midstream segment income versus the first quarter last year. Please note that we changed our operating segment presentation this quarter in connection with the contribution of our Inland Marine business to MPLX. Previously, the Inland Marine business and our investment in Crowley Ocean Partners were included in our Refining and Marketing segment. First quarter and going forward, we include all of the marine related businesses in the Midstream segment. The $90 million shown here for the first quarter of 2015 has also been adjusted for comparability between periods. The $77 million increase quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to the combination with MarkWest at the end of last year, which contributed $72 million of incremental segment income to the first quarter. The remaining increase of $5 million was primarily due to an increase in income from our equity affiliates and higher transportation revenues, partially offset by higher operating expenses versus last year. Slide nine presents the significant elements of changes in our consolidated cash position for the first quarter. Cash at the end of the first quarter was $308 million. Core operating cash flow was a $604 million source of cash. The $277 million use of working capital noted on the slide primarily relates to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and inventory. The decreases in these accounts were primarily due to the drop in crude oil and refined product prices during the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2015, which led to the net use of cash, given the generally longer terms on the crude purchases. Net debt repayments resulted in a $372 million use of cash during the quarter. This net reduction resulted from some opportunistic ATM issuances at MPLX in the quarter, generating equity proceeds of about $315 million. These funds were used to pay down a portion of MPLX's then outstanding revolver balance. The equity proceeds are also reflected as part of the $281 million of other cash flows in the quarter shown on the walk. We continued delivering on our commitment to returning cash to our shareholders. We repurchased 75 million of shares and paid $169 million of dividends in the first quarter. While the share repurchase activity may vary based on the needs and the cash flow characteristics of the business in any particular period, our commitment to continue returning capital remains a fundamental element of our strategy and an important part of the value proposition for our investors. Share count at the end of the quarter was approximately 530 million shares, reflecting repurchasing activity of about $7.3 billion, retiring about 28% of the then outstanding shares since the spin. In addition, the $0.32 per share dividend announcement by our board yesterday contributes to the 28% compound annual growth rate in our dividend since the spin. Slide 10 provides an overview of our capitalization and financial profile at the end of the quarter. We had $11.6 billion of total consolidated debt, including $4.7 billion of debt at MPLX. Total consolidated debt-to-book capitalization was about 37% and represented a manageable 2.1 times last 12 months adjusted EBITDA of close to $5.6 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $604 million before reflecting the $277 million use of cash for working capital in the quarter. Slide 11 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the second quarter this year. We are expecting second quarter throughput volumes to be down slightly compared to second quarter 2015 due to more planned maintenance in the quarter. Total direct operating costs are expected to be about $6.75 per barrel on total throughputs of 1.875 million barrels per day, which reflects the impact of higher turnaround activity. Our projected second quarter corporate and other unallocated items will be about $75 million. With that, let me turn the call back over to Lisa.
Lisa Wilson - Director, Investor Relations: Thank you, Tim. As we open the call for your questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. You may re-prompt for additional questions as time permits. With that, we will now open the call to questions. Katie?
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Evan.
Timothy T. Griffith - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer: Good morning, Evan.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Gary, my first question, I know you've been constructive on the refining margin outlook and curious you've got any updates there, particularly on Mid-con for the balance of the year, and then diesel? And somewhat related, I mean is your system currently at a maximum gasoline versus distillate yield?
Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer: I will let Ray talk about whether or not we're maximum gasoline, and diesel, I believe we are. But I'll let Ray Brooks talk about this. But let me speak to the overall Refining segment first within the industry, Evan. I guess I step back and look at it from an inventory position and this week's inventories for the first time, you see – and as I said in my script, I'm very pleased how the industry really has, I think, put (20:41) into balance. If you look at Pad 2, we are now spot on the same inventory levels as we were same time last year across Pad 2. The zero increase in gasoline and zero increase in ultra low sulfur diesel same periods. So I see that as very positive from where we were coming into the year. And I think that is really – should provide for strength, as we go into the gasoline season here at the end of Q2 and Q3. Secondly, the Gulf Coast, while gasoline is still little bit up, there's still some turnarounds being finished in the Gulf Coast, and with the exports, I think the Gulf Coast can get into as we go into the summer grade gasoline, they will get into balance very quickly. Lastly, the thing to really watch is the significant demand in asphalt across the country. And specifically, we're the largest manufacturer of asphalt in the refining system, and we're expecting a big asphalt season. And with our ability to run a lot of sour crude oil, and what we've been seeing widen out the Mars spreads, and not only Mars, but if you look at several cargo opportunities, the sour crudes have really started to improve here in the second quarter. And we see that as very positive going into the balance of the second quarter and Q3. So Ray, do you want to talk about max gas versus max diesel?
Raymond L. Brooks - Senior Vice President-Refining, Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Sure, Gary. We've completed all of our planned turnaround work, which was heavy in the first quarter, and we're back up running all our refineries at plan and at maximum. And our swing streams right now are directed to the gasoline stream. We have the capability to swing about 10% between gasoline to diesel, and that's all pointed to gasoline right now.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. That's very helpful. I'll keep my second question to the macro, just shift it to maybe your NGL outlook, where I know you've got significant direct exposure now, and there's what, six new ethane crackers starting up in 2017 and 2018, it's almost 550,000 barrels a day of ethane demand exports in the third quarter. New propane exports have lowered the inventories there in line with the 5-year average. I mean any thoughts on the NGL outlook? Where things look to be improving? And as you think about sensitivities at the MPLX level, I'd appreciate it.
Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Don, do you want to it please?
Donald C. Templin - President & Director: Sure. Evan, we do see improving pricing around NGLs, and we are optimistic and look favorably upon what's happening in the market. I think as it relates specifically to MPLX and our producer customers particularly in the Marcellus and Utica, absolute prices are important, but so is basis differential. And one of the challenges that they had particularly last summer was there were discounts from other markets. And so, our goal right now and the activities that we are undertaking are really focused on relieving the excess volumes in the Basin and allowing them to get to markets that are either more liquid or international markets. So, our projects like rail to the East Coast, our projects like – and this will be a little bit longer-term, but a consideration of butane to alkylate, our efforts to load unit trains, are the positive news about ethane being shipped from the Basin over to the East Coast and making its way onto an international shipment. Those are all very positive in our view for the producer customers that we have a regular interaction with and that impact our business the most.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey. Good morning. And I guess a broader care question to begin with. Obviously you've made a lot of strategic changes and the quarter was quite tough because of maintenance and then some of the environment issues, you end up with $300 million of cash. Can you just talk about what you think are the main levers that you're going to pull to rebuild that cash balance? Clearly the summer may be good, but we're 7 years into a business cycle.
Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer: Ed, let me have – Tim will cover the balance sheet part, but let me talk about our strategy. And you're right, we have – since we spoke at your conference, in fact in February, we've rolled out our plans to reduce capital this year. We made a significant headway in reducing capital. We are making tremendous headway in self help and reducing operating expenses across all segments of our business, and that's going to happen, and we're going to continue to do good job of that. But as we go forward to release any distraction within our businesses, as you recognized yesterday, we announced the convertible preferred, I thought it was important, the whole team thought it was important, that we get any distraction, as I outlined at your conference when I spoke, to get any distraction between MPC and MPLX off the table and we've accomplished that with the billion dollars of convertible preferreds that will take care of the capital budget of MPLX into 2017. Secondly, as we continue to digest this acquisition, Tony and his team have done a tremendous job in being able to digest the Hess acquisition, is that we are going to get into a mode and into a rhythm of being able to harvest the cash from these businesses and build up that stockpile of cash, and clearly intend to get back into a more robust share repurchase program as we go down the road. Tim?
Timothy T. Griffith - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. With regard to the cash balances, as you may recall for the Analyst Day last year, we highlighted the fact that as we go through our core liquidity analysis and how much we need to support the business and protect for all the potential contingencies, there's a number of elements of that analysis that are a function of absolute crude prices, and the amount of core liquidity in the form of cash that we would keep at $100, $80, $60 oil is much higher than where it is at oil between $30 and $40 and $45. So, I think we are very comfortable at the $308 million number. We expect it's going to be anywhere between sort of zero and $0.5 billion. And with the committed capacity we have on the facilities and the sort of tools we have available to us with working capital and otherwise, I think we are very comfortable that if these absolute price levels that we're at appropriate levels to protect the business on a going forward basis. So there's – I don't think there's a notion, at least at these crude prices, that we necessarily need to build cash balances back. I think we're comfortable with where we're at. But as Gary said, a lot of opportunity for sort of earnings enhancement as we go forward. And we'll certainly have those levers available to us, so.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Second question, briefly. We'll ask your customers too in MarkWest how they're feeling. But are you – with oil having picked up a little bit and perhaps the fears of (28:54) having receded, are you seeing any appetite to move forward any quicker on the upstream side of the MarkWest business?
Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer: Don?
Donald C. Templin - President & Director: When you say move forward more quickly at, and I guess a little bit of clarification there?
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Oh sorry, in terms of upstream customers wanting to get back in terms of activity and you know your just-in-time approach therefore needing to be speeded up a little bit.
Donald C. Templin - President & Director: Okay. Yeah. I would say that we are monitoring and are in regular constant dialogue with our producer customers. I do think, obviously, the uptick in pricing is a very positive sign for them. Our capital budget that we have currently, the billion-dollar capital budget, I think is reflective of what we believe our current drilling plans for our customers, our producer customers. We obviously – we think there is some flex there. But I don't anticipate that there would be any significant movement from the number that we've publicly quoted.
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Good morning, everyone.
Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Brad.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Gary, I guess previously you sort of touched on this. But I was hoping you could provide a little more color. I'm just curious the billion-dollar private placement, MPLX, how that frees up MPC. And the extent to which that reduces the support that maybe you thought you might have to provide to MPLX. And I'm thinking about specifically in the context of are we going to continue to see drops at very advantageous multiples for MPLX? And does it take some of the things like maybe IDR givebacks off the table?
Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, Brad, as you know, this is a – well, the MLP markets, the way they are today, it's a very dynamic situation. And it's – my answer has to be – address those dynamic cases. But certainly that is our expectation and our goal. As we did the drop of the Inland Marine system, it was at a very supportive drop and that was to be able to bridge MPLX over this time of challenge within the MLP market. MPLX has responded very, very well since early February, and very pleased with the support and the improvement in the yield since that point in time. Secondly, as I said in my prepared remarks, we thought it was very important to get this distraction at any overhang. Your question is spot on. In order to be able to be supportive to the MLP, what did the sponsor need to do? You're right. We dropped at a supportive multiple. We certainly don't expect to be dropping at those type of multiples going forward. And that was a bridge to get to where we are today. The same thing with the convertible preferred here. A very strong support for MPLX, but it takes that overhang and takes that distraction outside of MPC. And I believe as we go forward and look at any next drops, I think where we're situated now, we don't need to make anymore drops in 2016. We'll see how far out into 2017 before we would need to consider that. But our plan is as MPLX continues to improve and the yields continue to improve, which I'm confident they're going to, I think we're going to be able to cure this bridge or trying to rebuild this bridge that we've been working on for the last three months or four months. Tim, you want to add anything to that?
Timothy T. Griffith - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer: No. I would just reiterate the notion that, Brad, I think as we assess things, the convertible preferred provides a very efficient form of equity capital in a market that's been sort of volatile with elevated yields. Obviously, through the first quarter you saw common unit yields, which were extraordinarily high. And I think we were careful thinking about exactly what that could mean for the partnership on a long-term basis. So, with the amount of inventor interest around these securities and structuring of securities that we think makes sense it, as Gary said, provides a fantastic funding source. It takes 2016 off the table right into 2017. And again, allows the focus on the business to be the continued growth in production, the organic projects and positions the partnership well. What this will mean for sponsor support, I think MPC stands ready in all of its varying forms and all the varying tools to step in to help support the partnership. When there is efficient capital available in the marketplace, we'll avail ourselves of that. And when that's not available, MPC will stand ready. So we're pleased with getting this security done. As Gary said, there was some thought that MPC would provide this funding. MPC is still prepared to do so, but with the third-party money available, at terms that we found attractive, we thought that was a very good decision to move forward on.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. That's great color. Thanks for that. And then as my follow-up, I'd like to touch on Speedway. I was curious, you had a very good quarter in terms of growth, both in terms of volumes and in terms of merchandise sales. Is there a breakdown that you can provide of that for the legacy stores versus the Hess stores? I'm just curious if one side of that is driving the growth, or another, or if it looks broadly similar across the portfolio.
Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer: Tony?
Anthony R. Kenney - President, Speedway LLC: Yeah. Brad, as we've moved through the integration of the two businesses and the focus on capturing synergies, we've stopped keeping track separately of the two businesses. As you integrate all the functions of the business, I mean, the difficulty and the challenge to keep separate books on each is tremendous. So, we do not have a breakdown as to where the contributions are coming specifically.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you.
Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer: And Brad, I'll – Brad, let me just say, while we don't report individual segments from inside Speedway, Tony's team did a tremendous job and they now have re-ID'd all of the stores that were going through re-ID; way ahead of schedule on the synergies. We're way ahead of the schedule on the cash flow that we expected from this acquisition. But at the same time, their legacy assets performed very, very well. So, both sides I would say are running on all cylinders.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Paul.
Operator: Paul, if you're on mute, please un-mute yourself. Okay. We'll go to the next question. We have Neil Mehta on the line from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Morning, Gary.
Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Neil. How are you?
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Doing great here. So, Gary, want to touch – start off on retail and the right structure for it to be in. I know I've asked you this in the past. But what do you think about doing a retail spinoff? We just keep on seeing these marks out there of these retail C-Corps that are trading at 11 times, 12 times EBITDA. Does that make sense to monetize that asset?
Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer: Neil, and you're right, we have talked about this before. And as we look at that question, the answer has to be what – how do we think shareholders are valuing Speedway inside of MPC today, and therefore what is the delta? When I step back and really look at the delta that may be available, it certainly is not a number that I think gives credence to separating from the long-term strategic value that we see in having Speedway under the control of – or I should say not under the control, but inside the value system and inside the supply chain system of Marathon. It's always been one of our key value quotients with inside Marathon. We've gone back and done a lot of work on some other transactions that have happened historically where companies spun off their retail and it appeared to be a pretty small bump in share value that can be eroded for many different reasons across the value chain. With all that said, we continue to look at it. We continue to analyze it. And I clearly, as you and I have spoken, I clearly see what the values that are being garnered inside the retail-only space. And, as always, we will continue to analyze this as we go down the road.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I appreciate that. And then, Gary, just wanted your perspective on the crude markets on two different fronts, first, on your views on the differentials which continue to be tight, certainly for these inland differentials, but favorable on the light heavies and the medium sours. And then also just on the flat price, I know you were in Saudi Arabia a couple of weeks ago. Just any thoughts in terms of how you think OPEC acts through the balance of the year.
Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer: Right. Neil, as I spoke at your conference earlier in the year, Neil, I made a prediction that crude would be somewhere mid-$50s to $60 by the end of the year. Brent topped $47 yesterday and looks to have a momentum going into today. And I still believe that crude will continue. And what's so important is that this inches up slowly. You do not want to spike on a very short-term basis, because I think the pain on a spike and then coming off that spike would have longer lasting effects on the marketplace. So you want to have a very slow, gradual move. And we're seeing that happening. And I still stand by our thoughts that the crude is going to continue to move. And I think that's beneficial across the entire energy sector. I think that it improves demand. If you get prices up and get people back working in the oil fields, I think it's important, again, for the entire worldwide global demand sector. What I said in my remarks that – I'm glad you brought it up, is that we're starting to see the medium sours, the Mars, and some other cargos of Mars, medium, and other lookalike type barrels over the last month or so, we're starting to see that Mars spread, that medium sours spreads widen out. And I think that is very supportive to the industry, very supportive to those refiners who have the ability to run this medium sour crude and have the residual processing capability to handle (41:14) and us being the largest manufacturer of asphalt in the country, it really helps us as we went to the asphalt season. So I see crude continuing to move up for the balance of the year. I think it's very good for the medium and heavy sour refiners. And at the same time, we'll see what happens. I would expect that there's going to be another meeting of the OPEC numbers here in May. And at that time, I would expect to see these freezes put into place. And if that happens, I think it'll continue to have some pressure on the LLS grades as far as any spreads. But I think it will continue to benefit the medium sour players.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks, Gary.
Operator: And our next question comes from Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI: Hi, everybody.
Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Doug.
Timothy T. Griffith - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer: Good morning, Doug.
Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI: Guys, distillate consumption has been weak so far this year, even considering weather effects. And so I wanted to see if you could provide some color on the commercial or on-road aspect of this demand that you're seeing this year, and whether or not improvement's likely later on in the year?
Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer: Tony, you want to cover that, please?
Anthony R. Kenney - President, Speedway LLC: Yeah. Distillate demand is down. It's just a combination of a number of things when we look at the overall numbers that we're looking at on diesel. The over-the-road component is soft. It's probably down in the neighborhood of about 2%. That's the large 18-wheel freight business. And then some of the regional business is down a little less than that, probably in the 1% area. And there're some other factors that are affecting overall distillate as well. Demand for U.S., for example, all the shale production that was shut in, there were some large consumption on distillate for that activity, which has obviously slowed down significantly.
Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI: The negative numbers like that historically correlate to a particular GDP figure? And if so, what would be the read through to the U.S. economy? Or do you guys not take it quite that far?
Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer: Doug, we've always – you've heard me say many times that over-the-road diesel is a, I think, a precursor to the overall economy.
Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI: Yeah.
Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer: Due to some of the – if you go back to the first quarter, we just analyzed our diesel demand, over-the-road diesel demand in the first quarter. And there were times across the Eastern Seaboard, we lost four days and five days of diesel demand because of severe weather. But...
Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI: Okay.
Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer: ...you have severe weather in different pockets of the country every year. But it seem to be more severe in the markets in which we operate today. But you're right. It has always historically been somewhat of a predictor of the overall economy. I look at some of our big, big customers on the diesel side and they're down probably 2% to 3% on a same-store basis on diesel demand. Yet in talking to a lot of the big trucking companies, the trucking companies' books, they say looks strong going into Q2 and for the summer months. So, it remains to be seen. I expect that diesel, I don't think for the year, we're going to be down 3%. But we may – as you know, we've had tremendous growth in diesel the last three years or four years. And I think some of that is just leveling off of what the demand has been. But we still – if you go back and look the last three years or four years, probably in total up around 10%. So, when you average this out, I think the market's still fairly good.
Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI: Okay. Let's just hope it's a soft patch. And then also, condition seem to be worsening in Venezuela, although it's unclear as to whether it's affected refined product flows based on the data that we've seen. And so, I want to see if you can provide insight into that market if you have any? And also the outlook for exports into the other possible export markets in the Atlantic Basin this year?
Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Mike Palmer handles all of our exports. So, Mike?
C. Michael Palmer - Senior VP-Supply, Distribution & Planning: Yeah, Doug, I don't know that we have any particular insight into the troubles that Venezuela is seeing right now other than you do.
Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI: Okay.
C. Michael Palmer - Senior VP-Supply, Distribution & Planning: I can tell you that it is difficult doing business with them. They have a lot of trouble trying to keep their upgraders, for example, going. And there hasn't been a lot of spot opportunities from Venezuela for us so far this year. So, that's certainly been difficult.
Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI: And just the overall thing on export markets? Yeah?
Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer: But the other thing, Doug, due to the export markets, our export markets, as Tim said in his remarks, of course, we had turnarounds in the first quarter that will have dropped our export volume. But we've come back strong, and the book looks good throughout the balance of the second quarter, up over 300,000 barrels per day in exports, which would suggest that Venezuela continues to struggle.
Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, everybody.
Operator: And our next question comes from Chi Chow from Tudor Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Tim, it looks like you've repurchased around $75 million worth of shares in the quarter. Do you have a buyback target for the share?
Timothy T. Griffith - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer: Well, Chi, I don't know that there's a hard target. Again, this is something that we'll sort of assess as we go. Obviously, a relatively weak quarter on the earnings side and the resulting cash flows. So I think you'd expect that the activity would have been lower in first quarter. But again, I think our focus is that, we've talked about 100% of free cash flow through cycle as the business generates cash and we're sort of carefully looking at capital. We expect that the activity is going to vary based on any given quarter. So, I wouldn't say that it's a hard target, but a continued long-term focus on making that an important part of our overall capital plans.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. You talked about the Robinson crude project in the release. I guess in addition to the crude slate flexibility, is there going to be a corresponding increase in the production capacity of light products out of the plant?
Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer: Ray?
Raymond L. Brooks - Senior Vice President-Refining, Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. With the Robinson turnaround, we completed the project to increase our light crude processing capability. And what that allow us to do is increase our handling of light crude by 30,000 barrels a day on a stream day basis, and at the same time, that gives us an overall increase in total crude throughput of about 20,000 barrels a day at that refinery. So significant improvement in that refinery.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Can you talk about the yield impact on the product side?
Raymond L. Brooks - Senior Vice President-Refining, Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, the yield impact would just basically follow our normal distribution of about between gasoline and diesel there. There wouldn't be a large change there, overall. One thing that we've done at that refinery too at the end of last year is we increased our hydrocracker capacity by about 10,000 barrels a day. So this plays along with that too.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: I guess along those lines, it just seems like a lot of your current refining projects are focused on increasing ULSG production. And maybe this is back to Doug's question, with demands soft, how concerned are you about not only your increases on ULSG capacity, but just the broader global increase that we've seen over the last couple years? And how do you think that's going to play out on the cracks for diesel going forward here over next maybe even couple years?
Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, Chi, I would say that if you go back and look at our exports and look at the exports of the industry, still about 2 to 1 the global demand for diesel in the export market is what we're seeing. As I said earlier, we're back to all the diesel inventories across Pad 2 are balanced to where we were same period last year. Still up about seven million barrels of inventory in Pad 3. I think that can be cleared relatively easy as we go into the balance of the quarter. It's all going to come back to the question Doug had on, what is overall the over-the-road diesel demand equation? What happens to that in the near-term? But as we see – and it's always been our position. We work very hard to always balance the diesel inventory in Pad 2. Pad 3 diesel inventory moves into Pad 1, moves into Pad 2 with the demand and any dislocation that may happen in the marketplace. But most importantly is the export demands for diesel. Going back to Doug's question about Venezuela, and I think some other markets, we're continuing to see very strong demand. But we're also seeing improvement in gasoline demand at some of those export markets as well. So, I understand your question, and I think the entire industry is continuing to assess and be very careful in any incremental diesel projects. But as you know, Chi, you don't do one of these projects overnight. They're long-term in the planning and long-term that generally these small upgrades or creep that you get in that supply commonly do have a major turnaround cycle plan. So, it's all going from back down to the balance of over-the-road demand and the balance of export demand going forward.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Yeah. I think we're all trying to figure out how that's going to go here. But thanks for the comments, Gary. Appreciate it.
Operator: And our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC: Hi, guys. Gary, I had a question on...
Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Paul.
Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC: Hi. I had a question on MPC that I want to come back to, but just briefly you mentioned somewhat casually in passing that you thought OPEC was going to meet in May and set a freeze. I don't know if that was kind of a throw-away comment or if you could just expand on that a little bit. And then I'd like to come back on the subject of CapEx, please. Thanks.
Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, no, it wasn't a throw-away comment. It's just – you read the same things I do. But I go back in history and look at how all these discussions play out. There's a tremendous amount of disappointment in a number of the OPEC members that this wasn't solved at the April 17 meeting. And the expectation is, there'll be another meeting here in May. And this goes along with my entire thesis of where we think crude prices are going to go. I, of course, don't have any inside knowledge of whether there will or will not be. But it certainly comes from my years of experience that I would expect that you'll see another meeting.
Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC: Thanks for the clarification, Gary. Gary, you talked several times about the (53:57-53:59) CapEx. Could you talk about the outlook for MPC CapEx? Update us on the major projects that you're undertaking? And you mentioned that you're hoping to bring CapEx down further. And I think fairly strongly said that you were going to be prioritizing cash return to shareholders. So if you could give us the CapEx side of that balance outlook for MPC, I'd be grateful. Thank you.
Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure, Paul. And we stated in early February, we reduced the capital – that we've reduced the capital budget around $1 billion across both MPLX and MPC side of the equation. Our major projects, we are just embarking on very, very early stages of the Big Star project. And that goes out six years for the South Texas asset redevelopment project. So that goes out for a number of years, and we do not have any large projects or large capital expenditures in any individual project all at once. We will continue to look at the capital. Don has done a very good job in being able to squeeze capital out of the midstream side, as well as Tony has on the retail side to be very efficient and probably to backload some projects where we saw was opportunistic to reduce some of our capital spend. And we continue to look at that every month as we close our books. My comments on capital deployment and getting back into share repurchases was that, as we went through this big acquisition at Speedway, now a year-and-a-half ago, and that's, as I said earlier, we're way ahead of schedule on the EBITDA that it is generating. And MPLX, I believe that we really have that going in the right direction that our plan is, as conditions improve, and Tim just answered the question from Chi on share repurchases. We do not have a month-by-month plan on what we're going to do. But our strategy – or I mean we know what we want to do, but not a plan on exactly any share buybacks and when that might happen. But we want to get back into a rhythm as we log into the next few years of being able to harvest from these businesses that we've acquired and really set this company up very, very strong across all three segments of the business that we will be able to harvest and get back into a strong share buyback program over the long term.
Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC: Thank you, sir.
Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer: Yep.
Operator: And our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Go ahead.
Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey. Good morning. My first question is actually just a follow-up to what Paul was just asking. At the – in the December Analyst Day, you had talked about something around a $3 billion growth investment target for 2017. And obviously, you've been aggressive on 2016. A decent chunk of that's at MPLX. But as you noted, there's some increased spend in refining as well. So, could you just talk about maybe the level of flex capital embedded within that $3 billion growth number? And just are we thinking about the same level of flexibility as what you saw this year looking ahead?
Gary R. Heminger - President & Chief Executive Officer: Tim, you want to cover that?
Timothy T. Griffith - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer: Sure. Phil, obviously, as Gary indicated, we have and will continue to look very carefully at capital. There's a certain portion of the capital budget at MPC that is, what we'll probably describe as a little bit more maintenance in nature, a little bit more sort of regulatory pieces. But for all the pieces, and certainly when we think about some of the investments in Speedway, in T&L, obviously the Star project we announced, we've sort of extended that and pushed it out. There are elements and good pockets within the capital budget that probably would continue to have flex capability to them, depending on how things go. I mean there are a number of things that we can sort of set up and pursue more rapidly if conditions improve and we see the earnings and cash flows that could support the investments there, or frankly, defer further, defer into 2017 and potentially beyond as the needs of the business sort of migrate over time. So there is, I think, with any refining business, you'll see an element of capital that maybe has a little bit less flexibility to it. But we still have significant elements that we'll continue to look at over the course of this year and into next in terms of where we may want to make some adjustments.
Donald C. Templin - President & Director: And Phil, this is Don. On the MPLX side, or Midstream side, our budget this year has been reduced or we're going to manage it down to something closer to $1 billion. Of that, probably 60%-ish or so was G&P and 40% was logistics and storage. And in that 40% were a couple projects that were underway that we are going to complete this year, that won't continue on into next year, to give us some flexibility. So, for example, the Cornerstone project will be completed by the – we're projecting that it will be completed by the fourth quarter of this year. And that was roughly half of the budget that we had for the L&S business. On the G&P side of the business, this year, in our budget, about 60% of the total year budget was around gathering, and 40% was sort of processing and fractionation. The remainder of the year it's actually a higher proportion of gathering than processing and fractionation. We've essentially completed the major projects that we were undertaking. So, we have the ability to flex that capital next year, really dependent upon how our producer customers and what they're planning to do and how quickly they continue to grow their volumes. So, I believe there's a lot of flex. I believe that the – on the MPLX side, particularly, capital is probably closer to a number that we had this year. But we'll continue to manage that as the year progresses.
Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks. That's very helpful. The second question is just around on the refining side, Tim, probably your favorite topic. On an absolute basis, the other gross margin was only about $15 million in the quarter. You mentioned crude differentials as a key variance factor year-over-year. I was just wondering, was there anything else maybe one-time in the quarter because it was a big downturn quarter? Obviously it was a weak margin quarter to begin with. But if there's any additional color there, that might be useful. Thanks.
Donald C. Templin - President & Director: Yeah. So I don't know that there's any very unique one-timers. I mean again, a lot of what we've seen on the other gross margin sort of as it's tracked over time, has really been a function of where absolute crude prices are, because obviously at lower crude prices, you'll see things like volumetric gains decline in terms of the value ascribed to the gain within the refining system as absolute refined product prices are lower. You'll see with a lot of the differentials having come in, you also see a lot of the benefits that we had seen historically on the blend stock and feedstock into the system. Those spreads relative to L&S have come in as well. There is a little bit less opportunity, again, at these absolute levels to garner the benefits of feedstocks and blend stocks into the system as well. So, again, a lot of that has been trending that way just at the absolute levels and with some of the differentials coming off. And those are probably the biggest drivers of it. There's nothing in first quarter that was particularly unusual relative to the trends that we've seen really over the course of the last year.
Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks.

Operator: Welcome to the Marathon Petroleum Corporation Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Katie, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Lisa Wilson, Director of Investor Relations. Ms. Wilson, please go ahead.
Lisa Wilson: Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Marathon Petroleum's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Webcast and Conference Call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com, under the Investor Center tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, President and CEO; Tim Griffith, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and other members of MPC's executive team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on Slide 2. It is a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. Now I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks and highlights. Gary?
Gary Heminger: Thanks, Lisa, and good morning to everyone. Before I begin, I want to take the opportunity to introduce Lisa Wilson, our new Director of Investor Relations. Lisa is replacing Geri Ewing, who is transferring to our Finance department. Lisa has nearly 25 years of experience with the company and was most recently our Director of Financial Services and Insurance. We are pleased to report fourth quarter 2015 earnings of $187 million, ending a strong year with $2.85 billion in earnings. These results include $370 million pre-tax charge to value our inventory at lower cost to market. We remained very encouraged by the environment for U.S. refiners and we are pleased to see resilient crack spread supported by attractive product price realizations and continued strong gasoline demand in the fourth quarter. We believe lower prices at the pump will remain constructive for retail demand as we move through 2016. Crude oil prices continue to see pressure with the lifting of the Iranian sanctions. Resiliency of domestic producers and the [ph] sentiment in the market. Crude differentials have been and will likely remain volatile. WTI has traded at parity and in fact higher than Brent recently and we expect this trading pattern could continue in the near-term. However, longer term, we believe it will revert back to a differential based on product quality and transportation cost between the grades. We believe more favorable sweet/sour spreads will continue to exist and benefit MPC's complex refinery configuration in the Midwest and Gulf Coast. In December, , the Southern Access Extension pipeline or SAX came online, providing increased logistics flexibility and crude optionality, allowing us to more cost-effectively move Bakken and Canadian crudes into our Midwest refineries. SAX allows MPC to access additional advantaged crudes and adjust our slate based on the best economics. Speedway continued its solid performance during the fourth quarter, finishing the year with nearly $1 billion of EBITDA. I want to recognize Tony Kenney and his team's efforts in completing the planned conversions of our East Coast and Southeast retail locations to the Speedway brand well ahead of schedule. The team's aggressive execution strategy facilitated the realization of its synergies from these locations much sooner than anticipated and beyond our original productions. The acquisition of these high-quality assets has been a tremendous value driver and has exceeded our expectations in virtually every area. In addition to our strong financial and operational results in 2015, we also made tremendous progress in our strategic objectives of growing the more stable cash flow segments of our business and enhancing our refining margins. An example of enhancing refining margins is the condensate splitter that came online in 2015 at our Catlettsburg refinery, which allows the refinery to process condensate produced in the region and thus improve its realized margins. Completion of the MPLX and MarkWest merger in early December was a significant accomplishment in the company's strategy. Through this combination, we have created a diversified, large-cap MLP that positions the partnership as a Midstream leader with compelling long-term growth opportunities. We continue to believe MPLX will create substantial value to MPC's shareholders through its general partner interest and associated incentive distribution rights and we are eager to develop a numerous commercial synergies available to the combine partnership. I would also like to comment on our long-term commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Through share buyback programs and dividends, we returned a total of $1.6 billion of capital to shareholders in 2015; including $362 million during the fourth quarter. Delivering attractive capital returns to our shareholders continues to be an instrumental part of our strategy. Through year-end 2015, we have purchased over $7 billion of MPC common stock or approximately 28% of the shares that were outstanding when we became a standalone company. Our approach to the allocation of capital continues to be balanced and long-term in nature, taking into consideration the requirements of the business, returns to our shareholders and our overall capital structure. As a result, we may increase or decrease the amount of share repurchase activity in any given year based on these variables. Through disciplined strategic investments in our business and returning capital to shareholders, we remained focused on the long-term value proposition for our investors. This disciplined and prudent approach carries over to our sponsorship of the MPLX. As we evaluate the continued decline in commodity prices and the market's increasing belief that these price conditions will persist for some period of time. MPLX's producer customers are directly impacted. While MPLX's producers are in some of the best areas and continue to manage their capital and production plans very carefully, changes in volume growth will continue to impact income growth for the partnership. At the same time, valuations with within the MLP space, including MPLX have been severely impacted resulting in yield levels that are substantially higher than what we anticipated at the time of the merger, even with the strong support we expect to continue to make available to the partnership. These factors contributed to the MPLX's decision to provide new distribution growth guidance. Current market conditions were [ph] to an expected 12% to 15% distribution growth rate for 2016 revised from the prior 25%. Even with this change MPLX's distribution growth continues to be among the highest for large cap diversified MLPs. We were asked at our Investor Day meeting, if there was a tipping point as to when higher growth guidance will not make sense, I shared then that the conditions did not improve in MPLX's valuation and resulting yield, we would likely revisit the growth outlook for partnership. Based on the continued deterioration, we have seen since then, we have reached that point and this changed distribution growth is necessary. The commodity and equity market conditions we have now experienced could be temporary and we will assess the growth path for 2017 later this year, providing guidance around the partnership's distribution growth capabilities at that time. We will take into consideration the capital allocation needs of both MPC and the MPLX, but expect to continue providing support to the partnership as it navigates through this challenging environment. In support of the MPLX's 2016 growth plans, MPC offered to contribute its inland marine business to MPLX at what we believe will be a supportive value and we anticipate receiving MPLX equity in exchange for these assets. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016, pending requisite approvals. This dropdown of additional logistics assets to the partnership further diversifies as high-quality earning stream and underscores the flexibility our sponsorship as MPLX. MPC is focused on strengthening the earnings power of all aspects of its business. With the expanded margin enhancing investments across the enterprise, we recently announced plans to invest $2 billion at our Galveston Bay refinery over the next five years and investment program collectively referred to as the South Texas Asset Repositioning program or STAR. The investments planned as part of the STAR program of which approximately $150 million will be spent in 2016, are intended to increase production of higher value products and improve the facility's reliability as well as increase processing capacity. These high return investments were fully integrated at our Galveston Bay refinery with our Texas City refinery, making it the second largest refinery in the U.S. We expect the rapid payback on the stage investments planned for the STAR program, including an earnings stream in 2016. By using the flexibility inherent in our refining system and optimizing our logistics and transportation network, we are able to react quickly to changing crude oil and refined product market conditions, maximizing our profitability. In addition, as our downstream earnings demonstrate, our business produced strong results in a wide variety of commodity price environments. We remain optimistic on the long-term prospects for business and continue to believe returns will be compelling, including our sponsorship and GP interest in MPLX. With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk through the financial results for the fourth quarter. Tim?
Tim Griffith : Thanks, Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings both, on an absolute and per share basis for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015. MPC's earnings were $187 million or $0.35 per diluted share during the fourth quarter compared to $798 million or $1.43 per diluted share in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year 2015, our earnings were almost $2.9 billion or $5.26 per diluted share compared to 2014 earnings of $2.5 billion or $4.39 per diluted share. Chart on Slide 5 shows by segment, change in earnings from the fourth quarter of last year to the fourth quarter of 2015. As Gary mentioned, earnings were impacted during the quarter by $370 million pre-tax charge to adjust inventories to market values. $345 million of this charge is included in the refining and marketing segment and $25 million is reflected in Speedway segment. After adjusting for the charge, earnings were down $374 million versus fourth quarter last year, largely attributable to our refining and marketing and Speedway segments, partially offset by lower income taxes associated with those lower earnings. I will talk about each of these segments and the changes compared to prior period shortly. Results for the quarter also, include income from the MarkWest since the December 4th merger date with MPLX, which is included in the renamed Midstream segment, previously known as pipeline transportation and will continue to consolidate MPLX for reporting purposes. Turning to Slide 6, refining and marketing segment income from operations was $207 million in the fourth quarter compared to just over $1 billion for the fourth quarter of last year. The decrease was primarily due to less favorable crude oil in feedstock acquisition costs relative to our market indicators, largely resulting from narrower crude differentials and lower dollar-based refinery volumetric gains resulting from overall lower overall lower refined product prices. In addition, the fourth quarter of 2015 reflected an unfavorable LIFO accounting effect of approximate $45 million as compared to a favorable effect of approximate $240 million in the fourth quarter last year. All these unfavorable impacts are included in the $784 million other gross margin step on slide. In addition, segment results were negatively impacted in the quarter by the $345 million LCM charge I just mentioned, which is broken out separately here. The unfavorable impact from segment income were partially offset by higher LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads in Chicago in the Gulf Coast, favorable market structure and improvement in the sweet/sour differential in the quarter along with slightly higher sour runs. The blended crack $6365 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $5.42 per barrel in the fourth quarter of '14. You may recall that the crack spreads we provide in our market metrics on the website are calculated using prompt product and crude prices. The price we actually pay for crude on the other hand is established over the calendar month that we process the crude, but takes into account the market structure. This contango effect is reflected the $192 million favorable difference reflected as market structure on the walk and relates to this difference between the prompt crude prices we use for market metrics and the actual crude acquisition cost. Slide 7 provides the drivers for the change in refining and marketing segment income on a year-over-year basis. Refining and marketing segment income from operations is nearly $4.2 billion for the full year of 2015 compared to $3.6 billion in 2014. The LSS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread had $1.3 billion favorable impact on full-year earnings. With Chicago cracks a $1.11 per barrel better in '15 and Gulf Coast cracks a $1.88 per barrel higher. Based on our estimated mix of 38% Chicago and 62% Gulf Coast has resulted in the blended crack spread of $9.70 per barrel or about $1.59 better than 2014. In addition, favorable market structure, more favorable product price realizations and lower direct operating costs, driven primarily by lower turnaround activity and lower purchased energy costs had positive impacts on earnings year-over-year. These positive impacts on earnings were partially offset by less favorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to our market indicators, large resulting from narrower crude differentials and lower refinery volumetric gains. In addition, the LCM and LIFO accounting impacts I described earlier also impacted 2015 full year earnings. The impact of more favorable product price realizations, less favorable crude oil feedstock acquisition costs relative to market indicators, lower volumetric gains and the unfavorable LIFO impact are all reflected in the $1.5 billion of other gross margin in the graph. Other refining and marketing segment net expenses increased $396 million compared to 2014, as a result of a number of items, including higher terminal and transportation costs and lower equity affiliate income. Slide 8, shows the Speedway segment earnings walk for both, the fourth quarter and full year. Speedway's income from operations was $135 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter's 2014 record quarterly income of $273 million. Lower gasoline and distillate margins were significant changes in the quarter-over-quarter comparison, decreasing segment income by $93 million. Gasoline and distillate margins averaged $0.1823 per gallon in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $0.2451 in the fourth quarter of 2014. The non-cash LCM charge of $25 million and higher operating expenses also had negative impacts on segment income compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. These unfavorable impacts on income were partially offset by higher merchandise margin, which increased from $324 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 to $340 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The $16 million increase is a result of higher overall merchandise sales in addition to higher margins on those sales. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes were essentially flat, decreasing three-tenths of a percent and merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes decreased 2.7% in the fourth quarter 2015 compared with 2014. Speedway's same-store gasoline sales growth was lower than estimated U.S. demand growth as we continually strive to optimize total gasoline contributions between volume and margin to ensure fuel margins remain adequate. In January 2016, we have see a slight increase in demand with an approximate 1% increase in same-store gasoline sales volumes versus the prior year impacted to some extent by the winter storms in the East in the last few weeks. Speedway's income from operations for full-year 2015 was $673 million compared with $544 million for 2014. Results for 2015 include a full year of income from the operations acquired from Hess, whereas 2014 results only include income from those locations in the fourth quarter. Gasoline and distillate margins increased $401 million from 2014, primarily due to higher volumes resulting from the additional locations acquired as well as higher margins. Gasoline and distillate margins were $0.1823 per gallon in 2015 compared to $0.1775 per gallon in 2014. Speedway's merchandise margin increased $393 million to $1.4 billion in 2015, primarily due to the increase in a number of locations as well as higher margins on the merchandise sold. Partially offsetting increases in Speedway income from operations for the year were higher operating expenses, primarily attributed to increase in the number of stores. Turning to Slide 9, as I mentioned, we changed the name of the segment this quarter. Instead of a pipeline transportation segment, we now report a Midstream segment, which continues to include a 100% of MPLX's results, including income contributed by MarkWest since the December 4th merger. The addition of MarkWest is the only change to what is included in the segment. Midstream segment income was $71 million and $289 million for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 compared with $58 million and $280 million for the comparable periods in 2014. The decrease for the quarter was primarily due to the inclusion of MarkWest from the December 4th merger date and higher income from our pipeline affiliates, partially offset by $26 million of transactions' costs associated with merger. The increase for the full-year was primarily due to the MarkWest merger and higher transportation revenue resulting from higher average pipeline tariff rates. These favorable impacts were partially offset by $30 million of transactions costs associated with the merger and higher pipeline operating expenses. Slide 10, presents the significant drivers of changes in our cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2015. At December 31st, our cash balance was $1.1 billion. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was $1.2 billion source of cash. The $343 million use of working capital noted on the slide, primarily relates to $693 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by $361 million decrease in accounts receivable. The decreases in accounts payable and accounts receivable were primarily due to the significant drop in crude and refined product prices during the quarter. We completed a $1.5 billion public debt offering during the quarter, of which a little more than half was used to extinguish our obligation for the March 2016, 3.5% notes. These new notes, net of some pay down on the MPLX revolver resulted in the $655 million net source of financing cash shown in long-term debt here. Cash flow was also impacted by the approximately $1.2 billion paid to former MarkWest unitholders as part of the transaction consideration during the quarter, which is shown separately on the graph. As Gary highlighted, we continue delivering our commitment to balance investments in the business with return of capital to our shareholders. We returned a total of $362 million to shareholders in the fourth quarter bringing the total for the year to $1.6 billion. Turning to Slide 11, in the fourth quarter, we paid a $0.32 per share dividend, representing 28% increase over the dividend paid during the same quarter last year. We have increased our dividend five times since becoming a standalone company in mid-2011; result in 29.5% compound annual growth rate in dividend. Our continued focus on growing regular quarterly dividends demonstrates our ongoing commitment to our shareholders to sharing the success of the business and we are pleased to affirm that commitment with a $0.32 per share dividend declared earlier this week. Slide 12 provides an overview of our capitalization as of the end of the year. Just under $12 billion of total consolidated debt reflects the $6.7 billion of debt at MPC, plus the $5.3 billion of debt at MPLX, including the $4.1 billion of MarkWest notes assumed in the transaction. Total debt to [ph] capitalization was about 38% and represented a manageable 1.9 times last 12 months consolidated EBITDA. Operating cash flow for the quarter was about $1.2 billion before reflecting the $343 million use of cash for working capital in the quarter. Slide 13 provides a breakdown by segment of our 2015 capital expenditures and investments, excluding MPLX's acquisition of MarkWest, along with the revised capital plan for 2016. In light of a challenging commodity price environment that Gary talked about, our focus will be to aggressively manage CapEx spending. As part of this process, MPLX lowered its 2016 capital plan from an estimated $1.7 to a range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. The midpoint of the revised range represents a decrease of approximately $450 million from the previous forecast. Throughout the courses of '16, we will continue to evaluate our capital program carefully and identify further opportunities to reduce or defer investments where appropriate given the cash and capital constraints of the business. Slide 14 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the first quarter of 2016. We are expecting first quarter throughput volumes of $1.7 million barrels per day, which are lower than fourth quarter 2015 volumes due to more planned maintenance this quarter. Our projected first-quarter corporate and other unallocated items are expected to be about $85 million for the first quarter. With that, let me turn the call back over to Lisa. Lisa?
Lisa Wilson: Thanks, Tim. As we open the call for your questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. You may re-prompt for additional questions as time permits. With that, we will now open the call to questions. Katie?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Ed, please go ahead.
Ed Westlake: Good morning, everyone. First, before I ask my question, congrats on strong cash generation last year. I think a lot of focus is going to be on capital allocation, so I will kick it off on that. You have cut Midstream CapEx; can you give a little bit of guidance as to what has fallen out of the program and how the program might evolve into 2017, for example, if commodity prices stay low? Then, I have follow-on.
Gary Heminger: Don, you want to handle that please?
Don Templin: Sure. Ed, this is Don. A majority of the decline in that CapEx forecast is around the money we were going to spend in Utica and Marcellus, so you will recall that our original forecast was around $1.7 billion, and on the legacy MPLX side of the business, you know, that money was going to be spent on Cornerstone and the Robinson Butane cavern and a couple of those projects that are continuing on. The remainder was with respect to our G&P segment and a lot of that spending is going to be matched consistent with our just in time capital spending program to be able to meet our producer customers' demand, but not to deploy the capital in advance of their demands or their needs.
Ed Westlake: Okay. Thank you. Then a follow-on, still on capital, I mean, folks are worried about a recession, people have many different views on that, but you have revised capital down to 3.7. If you did have a period, where the market was stressed and you had to cut CapEx even further? Maybe just talk a little bit through the flexibility that you have in the capital program to manage a downturn. Thanks.
Ed Westlake: In fact, we are analyzing that right now, Ed, and we have several areas where we can manage our capital and that is the prudent thing that we are doing here. While I know it is difficult to lower the capital guidance and lower the distribution growth guidance, we just feel it is necessary to make sure we always manage within our means, so we have those opportunities, we can push some of the retail spending out if we had to that we are getting very high returns and really are very pleased with the returns we are getting there, but we are going through that exercise right now and we have already identified areas that we can be flexible.
Ed Westlake: Okay. Thanks very much.
Gary Heminger: All right, Ed.
Operator: Our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Evan, please go ahead.
Evan Calio: Good morning, guys. I think that this will be the theme on capital allocation. Gary, the market is clearly concerned on the Midstream CapEx and MPC's potential carry of MPLX CapEx, potentially expense of the buyback given the state of the new issuance market. I mean, can you further elaborate how far you can go down in MPLX capital spending given the wealth of dropdown assets that you already have?
Gary Heminger: Evan, our first statements here, while the entire MLP market has been under tremendous stress, almost since the day that we announced this transaction, but it was clear even with our increase in distribution last week that the market is still under tremendous stress and is challenge not to recognize that value, so that is why we have really ratchet back our distribution growth, which is certainly part of the capital allocation as we look at it into MPLX. Don just mentioned how far we have gone; so far we cut back to capital of MPLX and if need be, we could even trim it back some more on the MPC and should it be on the MPLX side. What we are clearly going to do and it has always been part of our strategy and part of our flexibility is that we will manage to our capital budget whether it is out of refining, whether it is out of Midstream or whether it is out of retail, we will be able to ratchet back to maintain a strong balance sheet.
Evan Calio: Great, and how does the consideration of a buyback, given your view of value and some of the relative underperformance of the stock. I mean, how does the view of a potential cap allocation to a buyback weigh against a potential further reduction of capital spending, whether it would be in refining or Midstream?
Gary Heminger: Sure. Tim, you want to take that?
Tim Griffith: Sure. Evan, again, I think considerations around the total capital allocation for the enterprise will continue to focus on balance. I think as we suggested even at Investor Day and this morning, the amount of share buybacks that we do at any point in time is going to flex depending on the needs of the business, but I think certainly in a environment of capital constraints, we will revisit the spending. Again, I think the intent and the plan for us is that the commitment around return of capital is really a long-term commitment. We do not get too focused on any one particular quarter one period, but certainly we will need to look at that across the full scope of the capital allocation of the enterprise.
Evan Calio: Thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Neil Please go ahead.
Neil Mehta: Hey, good morning, Gary and Tim.
Gary Heminger: Hey, Neil.
Neil Mehta: Gary, can you walk us through the new guidance from 25% down to 12% to 15%? Is there a way to bridge or quantify how much of the delta comes from different components, for example, how much of it is a change in dropdown multiples versus a change in the margin environment at MarkWest or a change in capital spending?
Gary Heminger: Right. Neil, I am going to ask Don and Tim to take this. I am overseas and I need to change phones here. Can you guys take that?
Don Templin: Yes. Neil, this is Don. I guess we were evaluating the full-year and there are a number of factors that we considered. You know, clearly, there has been pressure on volumes, but you know we are still seeing good volume growth and expect good volume growth in Marcellus and Utica to support our underlying business. We are very confident in the legacy MPLX business or the pipeline business. We are very confident in the steady cash flow of the marine business that has been offered to MPLX. I would say probably the biggest factor that we have been considering and have been analyzing and evaluating is the yield environment and you know the pressure that the yield environment puts on growth is we are funding our growth and issuing new units or funding it with debt. That has put, you know, incremental pressure on that, so I would say that a lot of our decision in our evaluation has not been based upon the underlying cash flows of the business, but it has really been a function of the way the market has performed since we announced the combination and even since early end of November when we were probably in the 4.5% kind of yield range. You know, we are more than 200 basis points wide of that in just a couple of months' time.
Neil Mehta: Okay. That is very, very clear, Don. Then, Gary, I am not sure if you are back on the line, but maybe the team can take it here. As it relates to gasoline, it is the topic that has been top of mind here. Week one, it felt like we could dismiss it, the inventory builds due to fog or weather conditions, but we have seen the relentless build in gasoline inventory, so, I want you guys to comment in terms of what you are seeing on demand. It sounds like you are up 1% in gasoline same-store sales, so that sounds fine. Why do you think we are seeing that level of inventory build and how do you think about the gasoline outlook from here?
Gary Heminger: Yes, Neil. I am back online. Sorry that I had to cut off.
Neil Mehta: Okay.
Gary Heminger: As I said at your conference, we were surprised to see that big of a build and had expected it to be reversed due to a lot of operating issues and it has not reversed to the area that we thought it, but gasoline demand continues to be strong. When we look at our exports, we know averaged 330,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of exports, granted we have a couple of turnarounds here early in the first quarter, but that will reduce our number of exports, but also our total volume and capacity will be down a little bit in the first quarter due to the exports. We see gasoline demand, as Tim stated, up 1% and we see that continuing on and I think I stated in our Analyst Day meeting that we would expect first quarter to be over first quarter last year due to continued lower price versus same period last year, but gasoline and octane continue to be very strong. Diesel has picked up a little in comparison to the fourth quarter across our same-store sector and our under diesel exports continue to be strong as well, so I will - Mike Palmer, see if he has any additional comments.
Mike Palmer: You know, Gary, the only thing that I would add is that, obviously, this time of year, we typically see gasoline builds, especially in PADD II, and you know that is what we are seeing now. We are getting ready to go into the turnaround season and part of the build that you see is in order to handle the shortfall that we are going to have when those refineries go down. That is only other thing that I would add to your comments.
Neil Mehta: All right guys. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Brad, please go ahead.
Brad Heffern: Good morning, everyone.
Gary Heminger: Hi, Brad.
Brad Heffern: Again, on a MPLX, I am curious about the projects that you had discussed that had sort of more direct synergies to Marathon itself, the alkylation project and so on. Has the timeline for those projects been pushed back?
Gary Heminger: Not at this time, Brad. You know, when we laid out all those projects in the third and fourth quarter last year, it was always anticipated that these were no longer lead projects and we are continuing to work those very hard. We are in some engineering on a couple of those projects, but we do not anticipate at this time to move those out. The alkylation project is very important, very important for the producers, very important for our octane needs and the distribution of octane into the refining system. We are still looking at a very strong interest in a solution in order to be able to move propane either to an East Coast market or move propane down into the Gulf Coast, so those are still continuing on and those were the two biggest synergy projects that we had outlined at the time of the transaction and both of those as I say we are continuing to work on.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Thanks for that.
Don Templin: Brad, this is Don. I might even add one more comment on that, particularly on the NGL project. One of the things that we believe is really important is that our producer customers are very much in need of an opportunity to increase the netback, particular on propane. I mean, we have been challenged in terms of getting it to a market where they can realize a higher price, so in our efforts to make sure that we are very sensitive to and focused on our producer customers, we think it is important for us to deliver a project or projects that allow them to get the highest netback they possibly can as quickly as they can, so speed is of the essence in terms of those types of projects.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Understood and thanks for that. Then thinking about the refining business, I am just curious around the crude slate, how things have changed of late, how you are changing, what you are running in the context of mediums and heavies appearing to be much more attractive and lights being less so?
Gary Heminger: Mike?
Mike Palmer: Yes. Brad, this is Mike Palmer. Yes. You have hit the nail on the head. I think what we are seeing now is that, when you look at the light sweet domestic production in this country, you know, we think that those lines are coming off and there is tightness, but at the same time we are seeing very good values on the sour side of the barrel. We are getting a lot of Middle Eastern crudes that are moving into the Gulf. As you know, the Gulf of Mexico itself has grown and continues to grow and the Canadian heavy sour continues to be a good value, so I think that is exactly what you are going to see happening as there is going to be probably less sweet runs and a shift to sour.
Brad Heffern: Okay. I will leave it there. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Phil, please go ahead.
Phil Gresh: Hi. Good morning.
Gary Heminger: Morning, Phil.
Phil Gresh: The first question is just a follow-up on Neil's question on refining fundamentals. Gary, you have been pretty upbeat about your outlook for the full year. Obviously, you know, it is just the start of the year and January does not make a full year, but I am just curious if what we have seen thus far in any way, reduces your conviction in the full-year refining outlook or if you still think that refining margins should be up in 2016 over 2015 or at least in the first half?
Gary Heminger: Yes. Phil, I still think refining should be strong in the first half, driven as I said earlier by gasoline demand and driven by octane. The crude oil prices have been quite choppy over the last three weeks here. Crude try to get momentum and then [ph], so that would be a little bit of a driver and the differentials of course that goes with that. Overall demand, again, driven by gasoline. As I said, we have seen some uptick in our diesel over the road demand here so far in the first quarter, but clearly in the market right now are the diesel inventories as Mike Palmer explained we will look at diesel as we go through the turnarounds season within the industry here already started in the Gulf coast. It will move up into PADD II and PADD I, starting in the second quarter should take care of the overhang in the diesel inventory, but if there is any overhang in the margins, I believe, it is going to really be diesel-driven.
Phil Gresh: Okay. Thanks. The second question is on the Midstream side. You guys have talked a lot about the levers available to pull, one of which is of course the support from the MPC side. You still have this significant backlog of droppable inventory, so I guess I just wanted to understand a little bit more how you are thinking about that support mechanism as we move forward and are you less certain about wanting to do drops beyond marine at this point just because of what we are seeing on valuations or just any thoughts around the puts and takes there would be helpful.
Gary Heminger: Sure, Phil. We still have all the flexibility and still have all the interest in supporting MPLX, supporting the Midstream business as we have stated. It is just as Don outlined, if you look at our yields from the time we announced the transaction to the date of closing and until note yesterday. Obviously, as we speak today, the yield continues to back up. I have always outlined that we believe that the differentiator in the MLP space is the quality of earnings and the quality of distribution growth. We have highlighted very clearly what that quality is and what flexibilities we have. However, the market is the indicator on how that is going to be recognized. Today, the entire market is under complete stress and MLPs have backed up in their yields value, so we just think it is prudent at this time not to chase that yield. As I said at the last question I had at the Analyst Day meeting, we will continue to assess, but there is no reason to chase the yield that is backing up with when we have very, very high quality assets, very high distribution growth that we can make happen. I think it is just best that we settle back, we see how the entire market continues to recognize MLP investments. As I said in my talk, we expect this to be temporary and we expect to be able to revert to our initial distribution growth guidance down the road as market settle down a little bit.
Phil Gresh: Okay. Thanks, Gary.
Gary Heminger: You are welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Paul, please go ahead.
Paul Cheng: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Gary Heminger: Good morning, Paul.
Paul Cheng: Gary, I have to apologize. First, because I was going to ask a similar questions as other people on the MPLX side. I understand that once you go into a certain construction or that you have certain commitment, so it will base on the commitment and the construction that you already have today. What is the minimum CapEx that you have to spend in the MPLX in 2016 and 2017? Also, what is the maximum that the MPC support on an annual basis that you are willing to do for that CapEx?
Gary Heminger: Sure. We have already outlined, Paul, that on the MPLX side, we dropped the capital back above $450 million from where we had initially approved the capital and I will let Don and Frank take it from there, if there is any - how much more room they have, but I know we have more room to drop back from there. Then I will have Tim cover the maximum that we would support.
Don Templin: Yes. Paul, we have not given specific guidance on sort of what the minimum is. I think that it is important to us to be able to flex in order to be able to meet the increase in volumes that are producers are experiencing and we expect them to experience, so we will continue to monitor that. We do have a lot of knobs to pull or levers to pull and we feel like we can manage capital in a very, very efficient way. I mean, we expect for example that in fractionation or in processing in Utica and Marcellus, we would expect processing to increase by 20% year-over-year and fractionation to increase by 30% year-over-year, so we are expecting good volume increases and we are going to make sure we are managing our capital appropriately to be able to support our producer customers.
Frank Semple: Yes. Paul with regard to what is the maximum amount that MPC would be prepared to support. I mean, again, the commitment to supporting the partnership as the needs arises there, that support can take a number of different forms. We have highlighted this morning that the marine assets are being offered into the partnership that what we believe people will see as a very supportive multiple. That is a fantastic opportunity. We would be taking back all units for it, limiting the partnership's need to access the equity markets, we have got options with regard to the intercompany funding either on alone or equity basis, we can look at potential modifications to do GP cash flows. We have got a host of things that we will look at. I am not sure that there is a hard target number in terms of what supports necessary, but we will continue to look at it in the totality of how the entities will manage each other and MPC is fully supportive of helping the partnership to achieve the objectives that it has got laid out, so we will see what the environment holds. As Don indicated and Gary highlighted, what really makes things challenging is the higher yield. I mean, obviously for the partnership, for every dollar of growth or earnings that goes into it either on an organic or acquired basis, there are just that many more units that go out, so we will have to assess this as we move along. The support is there and we will remain flexible with regard to what forms make the most sense given the time and circumstances involved.
Paul Cheng: Before I ask the second question, Tim, if I may, I would just say that in a market where there is a lot of nerviness and concern, I think both your shareholder in MPLX and MPC may benefit if the company would come with a more definitive answer in terms of what is the maximum support, and also correspondingly what is the roadmap that MPLX will be able to self fund the remaining. I think that your share pie on both sides probably will do much better if you would be able to come up with an answer in a more direct way for that. My second question, Tim, is for you. When looking at the refining operation, in addition to your manufacturing costs, your turnaround costs and your DD&A as a bottom. There is always a sort of like the terminal cost and other expense on refining. In the past couple years ago, that was roughly about running at $215 million a quarter. In the last several quarters, seems now they are running at about in the $350 million to $375 million a quarter, so the question is that, is that a reasonable run rate going forward? If it is, what may have caused the increase over the last couple years?
Tim Griffith: Well, Paul, I think you are sort of referring to the elements of other gross margin in terms of how we have looked at earnings quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year?
Paul Cheng: Yes. I mean, when we do a simple math in the model, if I look at what you record as gross margin in refining and your throughput and then your three cause items that you gave. After we do that, there is a gap between what do we report as your profit and what model we suggest and that gap in deposits is about $215 million a quarter. In the last several quarters, it has become more like in the $350 million, so I just want to see and I think that in the [ph] one, I understand is that that is including order, the terminal cost and other that is embedded and one is core business inside refining.
Gary Heminger: Yes. Again, there are certainly some seasonal factors that enter in too, but you are talking about things that would include sort of marketing, transportation, other expenses that get factored in.
Paul Cheng: That is correct.
Gary Heminger: Again, I would not say there has been any structural change to the sort of run rate around the expenses related. A lot of it will move higher based on some unplanned turnaround activity to the extent that comes in. We have certainly been impacted and benefited from the lower overall fuel costs related to natural gas. I would say as the structural matter, there is nothing that has moved dramatically. The notion that there is roughly $200 million gap, again I think it is difficult to predict based on the environment, but with regard to the refining system itself there is nothing that has structurally change that would impact that.
Don Templin: Hey, Paul, this is Don. I had maybe one other comment or observation. I mean, that number when prices are going up really quickly or prices are coming down really quickly, that number seems to expand or contract. While we have had volatility in the markets, we have had sort of relative prices have relatively have not moved down as fast or up as fast, so we get impacted in there when RIN prices move up really quickly or move down really quickly. We get impacted when commodity prices are moving up really quickly or down quickly. Even though it is a low-price environment, because we go a little bit more steady action there, I think, that is probably what has moderated a little bit from some of the previous quarters.
Paul Cheng: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Chi, please go ahead.
Chi Chow: Thank you. Good morning. My question may be a little bit derivative from Paul's here. It looks like you cut MPLX CapEx, obviously, but you kept the Midstream spending at the MPC level constant at about $830 million, looking at your slide 13 here. Can you talk about what projects are in that bucket and how much of that capital is earmarked for the support for MPLX in terms of incubating projects or other growth initiatives?
Gary Heminger: Don?
Don Templin: I guess, some of the ones that are in the MPC bucket versus, I will call up that the, G&P bucket or the logistics and storage, would include investments and things like we had some tail expenditures on the Southern Access Extension when we completed that. We have investments in Sandpiper as we are funding that with our joint venture partner Enbridge, so some of those projects, Chi, are ones that are longer lived, had some maybe bigger dollars associated with them. It was one of the reasons why we were actually incubating those up at MPC versus funding them directly at MPLX. I might also add, we have been making some investments in blue water, our joint venture with Crowley, the investment in the blue water vessels, so those are some of the things that are sitting up in MPC and not in the MPLX number.
Chi Chow: Don, again, looking at Slide 13, is that in the $351 million bucket, the Midstream R&M piece or is that in the other Midstream bucket excluding MPLX down below, which amounts to about $480 million to the other bucket from what I gather here.
Don Templin: I am sorry. I missed your question Chi?
Chi Chow: The SAX and Sandpiper spending in the blue water, is that all, and you have got two buckets of Midstream CapEx here on Page 13. You have got a Midstream R&M piece, $351 million. If I back out the MPLX CapEx in the second Midstream bucket, it gets to about $480 million. I am just wondering, I guess the bottom-line question is, is there room to cut the MPC Midstream CapEx or do you still need to spend that $830 million in support of MPLX going forward here?
Don Templin: I would say that the MPC piece of it is probably a little less flexibility in terms of cutting that. The stuff that is in MPLX consolidated, there is a lot more flexibility there.
Chi Chow: Okay. Maybe I will follow up with some details later. I guess, secondly, on the marine asset drop. Can you provide us any sort of EBITDA guidance on the…
Don Templin: Yes. We expect the next 12 months EBITDA to be around $120 million, Chi.
Chi Chow: Okay. You kind of hinted at it, but any sort of dropdown multiple you can share at this point?
Don Templin: We cannot share that right now, because the process is going through. It has been referred by MPC to the MPLX special committee or conflicts committee, so they are working through their valuation and we would not want to get in front of that.
Chi Chow: Okay. Final question on the condensate splitters, can you provide an update on the operation there and discussed the accretion and returns you might have realized in the fourth quarter?
Gary Heminger: Chi, we do not breakout the splitters at Canton and Catlettsburg separately, but both are operating at their design capacity. Mike Palmer, can talk about what the design capacity and what we have been running them at.
Mike Palmer: Yes. Gary, I sure can. The two splitters, you know, Catlettsburg has a design capacity of 35,000 barrels a day. Canton is 25,000 barrels a day. Total of 60, we are operating those two splitters at the plan that we have had. Typically, we do not talk about just exactly how much we were running. We still got some room. We are not full, but that was the plan for this point forward. I can tell you that we are buying as much condensate now as we have at any time in the past. That condensate production is holding up well, our strategy is working well. We did have a little bit of weather issue in January, but really that is all we have seen, so it continues to work per plan.
Chi Chow: Okay. Mike, can I ask, it looks like from some public pricing sources that Utica condensate prices fell below $10 a barrel in January and still holding in the low teens. Is that the level of feedstock cost you are realizing for the splitters?
Mike Palmer: Again, Chi, we do not really talk specifically about those price levels. I think all we said in the past is, what you need to do is take a look at the Ergon [ph] postings in that area to give you an idea of what the prices look like.
Chi Chow: Okay. That is good enough. Thanks. I appreciate it, Mike.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Doug, please go ahead.
Doug Leggate: Thanks to everybody. I know we are getting close to the top of the hour, so thanks for getting me on, but I guess we cancelled the two question rule today. I have two questions, if I may. First one is also on the MLP. Gary, to you, as you are taking units from MPLX, when MPLX is already very, very weak, thinking about the saturation of piling on and top of the existing MPLX shareholders, why not just slow down or defer the marine dropdown like you were originally going to do rather than force more equity into the market. What is probably going to have to be a relatively low multiple for MPC shareholders?
Gary Heminger: That is certainly is one of the things that we have looked at, Doug. Let me turn it over to Tim, as Tim has done all the analysis on what we think the best options are.
Tim Griffith: Yes. I mean, I think, ultimately as we scope the distributable cash flow necessary to support growth and the partnership, adding incremental earnings into the partnership is necessary, frankly, just to support the distribution growth even as revised this morning, so a deferral would put the partnership in a more compromised position and obviously, getting the earnings base recalibrated. I mean, in addition to the growth of distributable cash flow, we are also sort of very carefully watching the leverage profile of the partnership and the capacity to take on any incremental debt there is more limited, so this is, Doug, I think really a necessary step to keep us on the path that is designed and has been shared with the investment community with regard to the distribution growth. We have looked at a number of different alternatives and I think adding the Marine business into MPLX both, from a diversification and to support the growth and distributable cash flows, is what we think makes the most sense at this point.
Doug Leggate: Okay. Just a quick follow-up to that, Tim, just to clarify what I am asking, so MPLX right now is trading on about a 6.5 times multiple of enterprise value based on your guidance you have given today. There is the legacy dropdowns for the industry, the whole MLP argument or case was predicated on our 8 to 10-plus times multiple. From an MPC standpoint, are MPC shareholders going to get proper value recognition for the assets you are dropping down in this environment? That was kind of what I am asking.
Tim Griffith: Well, we think so. Again, I think, for the entire - MLP space to the extent that yields have moved up, it is highly likely that multiples likely would move lower. I think, you will see evidence of that as we get through our transaction here. Again, we think that the long-term value to MPC really again relates to the GP and the potential IDR stream and cash flows that are generated from the partnership over a period of time and the growth in distributions made possible by the drop of marine and other assets from MPC will help to accomplish that over time. Obviously, it slows a bit here relative to our initial expectations on growth, but we still think the long-term value proposition is very strong.
Doug Leggate: Okay. Thanks a lot. My follow-up is just a quick follow-up on gasoline, so whoever wants to take this. Gary, as you know, I think we have been kind of a lone voice in talking about too much U.S. gas in the supply for quite some time. It seems to becoming [ph] home tourist to some extent. My question is, a lot of your competitors are still talking about max gasoline modes and given the weakness in distillate, what is Marathon's view on nice gasoline versus nice distillate in winter. At what point do you - basically just runs to limit gasoline output and I will leave it there? Thanks.
Gary Heminger: Right. Well, we review that every day, Doug. As I have stated before, we are able to flex our gasoline versus distillate make around 8% to 10%, so every day we are looking at that termination on the values in the marketplace and we are just coming up now on starting to make [ph] for pressure gasoline getting ready for the changeover. We have the market starting early April to make sure it is in 8% to 10%. 8% to 10% is how we can flex, but every day we are making that decision on what is the best product to make.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Ryan, please go ahead.
Ryan Todd: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I will try to avoid one more shot at the horse and ask you a couple of quick refining ones. Maybe is a follow-up on the last question, you had a relatively high gasoline yield of 50% in the quarter, which is higher generally than what we have seen historically? Was that seasonality one-off effects. Is that kind of a maximum of process system? Is at the high end of where we can flex or is that a sustainable number that you think going forward if it were necessary?
Gary Heminger: Mike, you want to cover why we have more gasoline?
Mike Palmer: Gary, as you pointed out, determining whether we are going to be at max gasoline or max distillate is something that we look at continuously. You know the only thing I can say there is that, with regard to the 50%, I mean, economically that was the best place for us to be at that time. We certainly have seen a lot of strength with regard to gasoline exports in the current environment, a lot of that coming out of Latin America and even in the Far East and that is probably one of the reasons that the gasoline makes that high.
Ryan Todd: Okay. Thanks. Then maybe one follow-up on your outlook on turnaround season, as you look at turnaround season in the first half of the year, do you think that we will see the potential guidance to accelerate run cuts into the weak environment? Your outlook for a normal versus a heavy turnaround season and it seems like in your guidance, there is a relatively healthy amount of downtime, so any thoughts around both yours and maybe the industry turnaround season into the first half of '16?
Mike Palmer: Yes. Clearly, all of the refining industry, we look at the where the inventory situation and what the margins are. In the event, and we continue to expect gasoline to be strong, but in the event inventories are not in balance after the turnaround season here. It appears to be about normal season in the Gulf Coast, maybe a little bit heavier going into PADD2 early in the second quarter remains to be seen. I think the refining industry, as well as specific I can speak for Marathon. We have been very cautious and very prudent and always so watching the margins and if run cuts need to be made, the industry I think has been a very quick to assess that, but backup and say we do not see any issues today - any need for immediate run cuts. It is something that we certainly will watch going out into the second half of the year.
Operator: Our last question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Paul, please go ahead.
Paul Sankey: Hi, everyone. Thanks. It is going to be the same old subject. Just one on gasoline, Gary, your same-store sales were negative, very mildly negative in Q4. I was wondering why you would then think that how you could square the circle between being relatively optimistic on demand against what looks like quite a weak number actually to end the year. Additionally, could you just repeat the points about you think that gasoline inventory is being built here specifically with a view to a big turnaround season about to come, because it does seem that we are in turnaround season. Then just to hurry things up, I will tell you the follow-up is totally separate. Do you have a longer-term CapEx guidance for MPLX and MarkWest, given the changes since the Analyst Meeting? Thank you very much.
Gary Heminger: Okay. On demand [ph] I have Tony covered in more detail, but let me remind everyone that one of the - a same-store calculation really takes into account two things. Overall demand, but overall posture and how we are pricing into the marketplace. As Tim had in his script, we are always going to optimize and maximize what we believe to be the pricing posture in order to be able to get adequate returns within the Speedway space. Tony, I will turn it over to you. I believe that is exactly how you operated, so you want to make a few comments?
Tony Kenney: Yes. Gary, sure I will and you are exactly right. There is a lot of factors, Paul, that go into what really determines our same-store calculation. Speedway is on a growth profile and we continually add new stores is one example and some of the opportunity is to move volume to our new store. Overall for the quarter, if you looked at Speedway's total light product volume, we are actually up in total gallons, but when you do it on a true same-store basis, because of a lot of variables, one being the movement of volume, other factors within the PADD that we are seeing, as well as what Gary talked about in terms of the balance between volume and margin that we take going forward.
Paul Sankey: Got it, so you have got some pricing power, which gives you the knowledge that demand is pretty good?
Tony Kenney: Right. The other thing, Paul, we have recognized here in part of January the numbers Tim stated in his script were up 1.1%, I believe, so far as this month, but we were up higher than that in the first half of the month and we are very strong same-store month-on-month, but then the bump in crude prices, the quick response to the street cost you some volume. When you are one of the leaders in the market that is what happen, so we still continue to be very bullish on gasoline demand going into the second part of the year. Don, you want to take the question on the capital and then I will follow-up with a little bit more on the MPLX guidance?
Don Templin: Sure. We have not provided incremental outlook on capital spending. I guess, I would say it this way, Paul. The resource exists, we are very confident it does. Our producer customers are in what we believe to be very good regions and plays. The projects exist and what we are really doing is, we are managing the completion of projects to coincide with the volumes that are producer customers are producing, so we believe that the projects and the revenue opportunities are there. It is likely that some of those make it stretched a bit and we will match our capital plan to deal with the potential stretching in the volumes but we are very confident in our producer customers and the resources and their ability to long-term to deliver those volumes.
Gary Heminger: Thanks, Don. Go ahead, Paul.
Paul Sankey: I was just thinking should we just cut some of our long-term assumptions based on what you said and assume that even '16 will be a relatively high year? Post the cut, still high relative to the future?
Gary Heminger: I do not know. If prices rebound by the end of the year, Paul, it would be really dependent, I think, on sort of where prices end the year and what the outlook is for '17 and what the producer customers' drilling program and profiles are.
Paul Sankey: Okay. Thank you.
Gary Heminger: Paul, to that point, and I know there are number of questions that we had throughout this call. We reduce our guidance in this call. As I stated, we have decided at this time to suspend talking about guidance beyond '16. We just think that is the prudent thing to do. As we look at the overall business, we have been very clear. We have a temporary pullback here. I expect and my entire team expects, so this is temporary. As Don just stated, if crude prices rebound like we anticipate they will in the second half of this year, that could lead to volume growth, that could lead to producers being quicker to return into their producing regions, especially in the Utica and Marcellus, that is very important to our Midstream, but I want to temper any concerns about going past '16, because it is just important that we take care of the work at hand here then we will look at what happens beyond '16. Again, I think prices will recover in the second half and we will see where we go from there, but there is no reason to get into a discussion beyond '16 at this time. Lisa, I will turn it back to you.
Lisa Wilson: Thank you, Gary. Thank you for joining us today. Thank you for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or would like clarification on topics discussed to this morning, Teresa Homan and I will be available to take your calls.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Marathon Petroleum Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Hilda and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Geri Ewing, Director of Investor Relations. Ms. Ewing, you may begin.
Geri Ewing: Thank you, Hilda. Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's third quarter 2015 earnings webcast and conference call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the investor center tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, President and CEO; Tim Griffith, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and other members of MPC's management team. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statement on slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. Now I'll turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks and highlights. Gary?
Gary Heminger: Thank you, Geri. Good morning and thank you for joining us. We're pleased to report third quarter consolidated earnings of $948 million. Our results were driven by a solid performance across all of our businesses. We were able to capture strong crack spreads in a favorable refining environment and we took advantage of our flexibility to move feed stocks and refined products throughout our system to optimize profitability where original dislocations occurred. Lower fuel prices facilitate a strong refine product demand, further contributing to our results. Speedway also performed very well during the quarter, benefiting from higher light product margins. Our peer-leading merchandise model also continues to drive profitability, with higher earnings compared to the third quarter of last year. On September 30, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of our East Coast retail acquisition and we're very pleased with the results of the transaction so far. The new locations are performing well and the business is on track to more than double the $75 million in synergies we expected in this first year. We're significantly ahead of schedule in converting the acquired stores, with nearly 1,000 of the 1245 new locations converted to the Speedway brand and operating system. In addition to the convergence, over 240 remodels of these new stores have been completed or are in progress. This rapid progress on conversions and focus on remodeling selected locations will further enhance Speedway's ability to grow merchandise margins across this entire platform. Turning to the midstream business, we look forward to finalizing a combination of MPLX and MarkWest later this year and are very enthusiastic about the prospects of the combined partnership. The MPLX and MarkWest combination will create one of the industry's largest diversified master limited partnerships. We will combine MarkWest's robust organic growth opportunities with MPC's large and growing inventory of MLP-qualifying EBITDA. The growth of distributable cash flows to the combined partnership will also be supported by MPC's and MPLX's strong financial position, creating a large-cap diversified MLP with an attractive distribution growth profile over an extended period of time. The strategic combination will drive substantial long-term value for the unit holders of both partnerships as well as MPC shareholders. At the time MPLX announced a combination with MarkWest, the partnership provided distribution growth guidance through 2019. MPLX remains committed to the growth profile provided in that guidance. Given the significant change in MLP valuations and the resultant higher-yield environment the sector has experienced in the last several months, we now expect drop-down transactions or some other form of MPC support as early as 2016. As MPLX's sponsor, we're committed to support its success. As we work to maximize our shareholders' long-term returns, we continue to focus on a disciplined and balanced approach to investing in the business and returning capital to our investors. An important element of this focus has been to identify market opportunities and pursue transactions that accrue long-term benefits to shareholders, as we have done with our acquisitions of the Galveston Bay refinery and the East Coast retail operations. I'm confident we will extend our track record with the pending MarkWest combination. We look forward to MarkWest becoming part of MPLX to the benefit of all equity owners associated with the merger. Another important element of the Company's capital discipline is to monitor changes in the market to ensure investments reflect the best long-term, risk-adjusted returns to shareholders. In February of this year, we announced deferral of the final investment decision on the proposed residual oil upgrader expansion project at our Garyville refinery in order to evaluate the implications of market conditions on the project. While we still believe the ROUX project, as we call it, is an excellent project to enhance MPC's platform, at this time we have decided to cancel the project based on our assessment of market conditions. And we wrote off the $144 million in capitalized project costs incurred to date. We will look to deploy this $2.2 billion in capital on a variety of other projects to provide superior long-term return prospects. We were also pleased to return $327 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter. We purchased 156 million of our shares -- $156 million of our shares and have approximately $3 billion remaining under our total of $10 billion of share repurchase authorizations. We also paid dividends of $171 million. Our Board approved a $0.32-per-share dividend which was increased 28% last quarter, resulting in a 31.5% compound annual growth rate on our quarterly dividend since we spun in 2011. We continue our efforts to remain a leader in our industry through all cycles by focusing on operational excellence and continuous optimization of our refining and marketing system. We will continue to grow our stable cash flows through our retail and midstream businesses, taking a disciplined approach to capital allocation and delivering significant value to our shareholders through our sponsorship of and our general partner interest in MPLX. Due to the timing of MarkWest's special meeting for the proposed combination with MPLX, we're moving our analyst day meeting back one day to December 3. At that time, we plan to provide an update on our allocation of capital, including margin-enhancing opportunities identified at our Galveston Bay refinery, Speedway's growth in synergies from the stores acquired in September of 2014, the compelling combination with MarkWest and other midstream areas of focus. We look forward to seeing you at our combined MPC and MPLX analyst day on December 3. With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to walk you through the financial results for the third quarter. Tim?
Tim Griffith: Thanks, Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings on both an absolute and per-share basis. As Gary mentioned, our financial performance was strong once again in the third quarter, with earnings of $948 million or $1.76 per diluted share, during the third quarter of 2015, compared to $672 million or $1.18 per diluted share, in the third quarter of last year. Just note, third quarter 2015 earnings reflects the $144 million impairment charge or about $0.17 per diluted share, for the cancellation of the ROUX project that Gary just mentioned. You can see the earnings through third quarter are already about $140 million ahead of the entire year last year. The chart on slide 5 shows by segment the change in earnings from the third quarter of last year. The $276 million net increase in earnings was primarily due to higher income from our refining and marketing and Speedway segments which I'll discuss further in just a minute.  Partially offsetting these higher earnings is $144 million non-cash impairment charge for ROUX which is included in the items not allocated in the chart, as well as higher taxes resulting from higher taxable income in the quarter. Turning to slide 6, refining and marketing segment income from operations was about $1.5 billion in the third quarter, compared with $971 million in the same quarter last year. The $486 million increase was primarily due to stronger crack spreads in our markets and the favorable effects of Contango in the crude oil market in the third quarter of 2015. You may recall the crack spreads we provide in our market metrics on our website are calculated using prop product and crude prices. The price we pay for crude, on the other hand, is established 30 to 45 days prior to the prop month. This price difference is reflected in the $226 million favorable Contango reflected as market structure on the walk. Partially offsetting these increases was less favorable crude acquisition costs relative to our market indicators and lower dollar base refinery volumetric gains resulting from overall lower commodity prices, both of which are included in the $325 million other gross margins column on the chart. On slide 7, we provide the Speedway segment earnings bridge for the third quarter. Speedway's income from operations more than doubled from the same quarter last year. Speedway's newly acquired locations were an important part of that increase, contributing additional income of approximately $66 million to the quarter's results or approximately $98 million of EBITDA in the third quarter. For the legacy Speedway locations, light product gross margin was about $48 million higher in the third quarter 2015 compared to the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily due to higher light product demand and a favorable pricing environment during the quarter. Overall, the Speedway segment gasoline and distillate gross margin increased by $0.055 per gallon from the third quarter of 2014 to the third quarter this year. Speedway's merchandise margin in the legacy locations was $16 million higher in the third quarter compared to the third quarter last year, primarily driven by an increase in merchandise and food sales and improved margins. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes increased 0.5% and merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes, increased 3.6% in the third quarter compared to the same quarter last year. As you compare our same-store gasoline sales to industry averages, I would point out that these can vary due to many factors including regional footprint, weather and competition. Speedway continuously strives to optimize total gasoline contributions between volume and margin to ensure fuel margins remain adequate. As you might expect, total light product sales were almost doubled in the third quarter last year as a result of the Hess acquisition and we're pleased to highlight that gasoline volumes for the legacy Speedway locations were up 2.4% in the third quarter on an absolute basis versus the same quarter last year. Given that we're now one year into the acquisition, October will be the first month our new East Coast locations will be included in our year-over-year same-store metrics. So far for October, total Company gas -- same-store gasoline's volumes are up 1.8% versus October last year. Slide 8 shows the changes in our pipeline transportation segment versus the third quarter last year. Income from operations was up slightly from the same quarter last year with $72 million of income in this quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher transportation revenue in the quarter, reflecting higher average tariff rates and higher crude and light product throughput volumes, partially offset by increased operating expenses and about $4 million in transaction-related costs incurred as part of the MarkWest combination. Slide 9 presents the significant elements of our changes in our cash position for the quarter. We had about $2 billion of cash on hand at the end of the quarter. Or, operating cash flow was a $1.5 billion source of cash. The $389 million use of working capital noted on the slide primarily relates to a decrease in accounts payable partially offset by a decrease on accounts receivable. The decrease in accounts payable and receivable were primarily due to lower crude oil and refined product prices during the quarter which created the use of cash given the generally longer terms on the crude purchases. We continued delivering on our commitment to balance investments in the business with return of capital to shareholders. We returned $327 million to shareholders during the quarter, including $156 million in share repurchases. Share repurchases were slightly lower this quarter as we plan our liquidity needs over the next several months, including the $675 million contribution for the MarkWest combination and, based on current prices, the approximately $180 million to MPLX to maintain our 2% general partner interest after the combination is completed. Share count at the end of the quarter was 534 million shares, reflecting repurchase activity since the spin of about 27% of the shares outstanding at that time. Turning to slide 10, in the third quarter we paid a $0.32-per-share dividend, representing a 28% increase over the $0.25-per-share dividend paid during the second quarter. It was the fifth increase in our dividend and our dividend has seen a 31.5% compound annual growth rate since MPC became a standalone public Company in mid-2011. Our continued focus on growing regular quarterly dividends demonstrates our ongoing commitment to our shareholders to share in the success of the business. And as Gary highlighted, we're pleased to affirm that commitment with the $0.32-per-share dividend declared yesterday. Slide 11 shows that our balance sheet continues to be strong and our leverage low, with gross debt at less than one times the $7.2 billion of LTM EBITDA and a debt-to-total-capital ratio of 34%. Slide 12 provides an updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the fourth quarter of 2015. We're expecting fourth quarter throughput volumes of 1.8 million barrels per day which are down slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 due to more planned maintenance this year. As the fourth quarter begins and we come out of the summer driving season, we expect to see normal seasonal demand levels which are typically lower in the fourth quarter. Our projected fourth quarter corporate and other unallocated items are $130 million, including an estimated $58 million of pension settlement expense in the quarter. With that, let me turn the call back over to Geri. Geri?
Geri Ewing: Thanks, Tim. As we open the call for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. You may re-prompt for additional questions as time permits. With that, we will now open the calls to questions. Hilda?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We have a question from Edward Westlake from Credit Suisse.
Edward Westlake: Appreciate obviously most of your questions this morning are probably going to be on MarkWest. The -- some form of support -- obviously a drop-down would help, but talk me through what other forms of support you have. And then I have a more general question on MarkWest.
Gary Heminger: So, Ed, as you know, as we have talked on this call before, we have many forms of support. Let me back up really and talk about this transaction and the overall market. I still continue to be surprised at how the overall market has performed, especially how MPLX has performed. In a higher yield environment, of course, we need to talk about possibly support earlier than we had initially planned than later. But I think the industrial logic is still so strong with the combination of these two companies, MarkWest having just an outstanding suite of assets and growth opportunities and MPLX having a tremendous backlog and a growing backlog of EBITDA that is eligible for drop-downs as we go down the road. Of course, we have tremendous flexibility. I'm not going to tie us down to just one. But we can incubate projects and that's our plan going forward and we have been very specific about that plan going forward. And when I step back and look at the overall environment in this MLP world today and look at how strong MPLX is and you compare us against other MLPs that were just a drop-down story before, we still compare very, very favorably, if not one of the best in industry and now we're tying it to a very strong growth profile. And so I step back and look at it at, Ed -- I really don't look at it as whether it's a gathering of processing, whether it's a natural gas MLP, whether it's a refined products MLP, a retail MLP. It's what is your backlog and what's the quality of the EBITDA that you have. And I believe that we have, again, one of the best-quality inventories of EBITDA that can go into this sector going forward. And as I said, we looked at incubating projects. We take the backlog of projects that MarkWest has, we can incubate those projects inside MPC, drop them in at the right time. We can do many other things. Look at the multiples on how we drop down assets, other commercial arrangements where we do intercompany loans, IDR givebacks, the list goes on and on of the flexibility. But on the front side, we now -- based on the yield environment of MLPs and I do expect that our yield will improve substantially as the market gets more comfortable that this combination is going forward.
Edward Westlake: And then on the yield comfort, obviously there's a big move in the spreads of the overall index. But the upstream in the Northeast is under stress because gas prices are low and NGL prices are low. And when you look at MarkWest, although they have a lot of capacity and acreage dedication, the MPCs, the volume protection is relatively low on some of the new areas. So just give us some color as to how much diligence you've done on the ability of the MarkWest EBITDA to deliver against your expectations. And then if it does fall short, what would be the plan to support the overall combined EBITDA to the extent that volumes in the Northeast disappoint?
Gary Heminger: Right. And we did do, obviously, a tremendous amount of due diligence before we ever signed this agreement. But step back, Ed and look at the Marcellus and the Utica. And you look at -- you all and everyone on this call is very familiar with some of the major producers in these regions and the success that they continue to have in the Marcellus and the Utica at this time. The areas of -- and just some of the wells that have been made public recently are very large wells in the acreage positions that we have. I will let Frank talk about his current environment more when he has his earnings call next week. So I'm not going to go overstep my bounds here with his current business, but we did a lot of work on the due diligence. We believe the break-even cost in the Marcellus and Utica which is the predominant area of influence of MarkWest, continue to be some of the best basins in the country. And if there is a slowdown, as we've already indicated, we will consider dropping down earlier.  And we've talked about this $1.6 billion of project backlog or EBITDA backlog we have inside MPC and that continues to grow as we go forward. The key, though, that we're very interested in and the logic behind this deal on a combination is we have the balance sheet and the financial strength to really take the backlog of projects within MarkWest and bring them to the table. And I think that will overshadow any drop-off in -- from the producer side.
Operator: We have a question from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta: Gary, I wanted to give you the floor a little bit on the oil macro which you are always great about reflecting on. I wanted you to talk through your views on Brent LOS and some of these key crude spreads in a potentially lower production environment. And also views on the flat price as we get into the OPEC meeting in December.
Gary Heminger: Wow, I don't know that I have enough time to talk about that, Neil. But anyway, let me -- I believe the last time we were together, the market continues to illustrate that we're going to be lower for longer. I believe especially as you see the trade flows and you look at the crude resources that are coming from the Middle East, West Africa that is moving into the East Coast today. But specifically those crudes -- and we're finding some other supply sources, mainly Iraqi crudes -- I can have Michael Palmer, who's with me today, address this more -- but Iraqi crudes that are coming into the Gulf. And I think what this is going to illustrate for a longer period of time, you're going to see the influence of imports on top of continued domestic production. While domestic production has somewhat flattened out, especially in the Permian and the Eagle Ford, we're continuing to see -- and we see this through our ownership in LOOP, we're continuing to see good growth in offshore Gulf of Mexico production. So for the remainder of the year and into next year, we're still looking probably in the $50 to $55 range. You might get up into the higher 50s mid-to-later next year. I think we're going to be probably range-bound in that arena for most of 2016 and probably into 2017 until you start to see -- because you're going to have to see not only some domestic production, but you're going to have to see a balancing of this incremental Iraqi production coming on. And you also have to watch where Russia is taking some of their production and how they have been taking some of their production out of strategic petroleum reserve into other parts of the world and the effect that has on the Asian markets. So I would keep all those things in mind when you look at those, Neil. Bringing it back, then, to spreads here domestically, I think with the incremental production, as I just mentioned, coming in from the Gulf Coast, I think that bodes well for the supply side. We're coming down off the high-demand quarter here in the U.S. as far as refining capacity and the crude that is needed to satisfy the refining capacity in the U.S.. And I think here as we get into the latter part of the fourth quarter -- first quarter, you're going to see spreads widen out -- Brent, Tuck-in and I will let Mike Palmer, who is the expert on the spread market, add anything to it.
Mike Palmer: Gary, I couldn't have said it better myself. The one thing I guess I would add is just, again, in the third quarter, we did run a little more sour crude than we did in the quarter before or the third quarter last year. And I think one of the things that we're seeing, of course, is that the Gulf of Mexico production continues to increase. And then in addition to that, we have seen -- as Gary pointed out, we have seen some foreign cargo opportunities into the Gulf Coast that we've taken advantage of and others have as well. And I think that's likely to continue, as, again, Gary pointed out the Iraqi crude is being produced. There is certainly the possibility that we will have some Iranian crude that we will be trading in the world -- increased volumes next year. And I think that will continue to have some pressure against sour grades that should look attractive. On the other hand, the sweet crude, as we have talked about before, on the Gulf has been a little more expensive. There is not a surplus in this light-sweet crude waiting to find a home. The producers have many avenues to clear it. So, again, that to me points toward probably a little more sour crude that we will run.
Neil Mehta: The second question is more of a housekeeping question. The buyback was a touch lower than we were expecting in maybe the previous quarter as well. Was that related to MarkWest and some of the processes going on there? Anything you can speak to in terms of the quarterly buyback.
Tim Griffith: Again, there has been no sort of philosophical change around the way that we've approached capital return to shareholders. I think in any given quarter we're going to plan carefully in the liquidity. We obviously have a contribution that MPC will make to the MarkWest transaction that we certainly are thinking around. But if you look at cash balances, things are generally in line with where we're at. So, no change to behavior, no change to belief. I think just circumstances in the quarter were suggestive of a little bit lower activity.
Operator: We have a question from Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Chi Chow: I guess just on MarkWest, there has been a lot of speculation on the acquisition price given the decline in both MPLX and MarkWest unit prices. How comfortable are you with transaction as it is currently structured? And are there any actions you are considering to support the closing of the deal?
Gary Heminger: Well, Chi, I believe this deal is still very, very compelling. We've already -- I think the biggest and most positive action, we announced today when we reaffirmed guidance. But you just step back and look at the strength of MPC's balance sheet, MPLX's balance sheet, the financial position we're in -- it bodes very well to take this combination which I think sets us up on a pedestal as the best combination in the business going forward. And we feel it's a compelling enterprise. We have a number of options that I already talked about. And we believe, in effect -- we think today, tomorrow, we will go effective with a proxy and it will be sent out shortly.
Chi Chow: Okay. I guess the timing of closings here -- by moving the analyst day back one day, is that corresponding to when you expect to be able to be closed?
Gary Heminger: Right. And that's what -- maybe not necessarily closed, Chi; it just depends on the timing. But Thanksgiving and another bank holiday or I guess it's Veterans Day, that is coming up, we lose two business days. So, unfortunately, that's just the way the timing worked; it moved us back just the day to be able to have the analyst meeting. So, yes, that's as we would expect to have the vote in the first, second of December time frame.
Chi Chow: And I have a couple questions following up on Neil's questions on the crude markets. Can you talk about what you have seen on the heavy crude markets both -- what's going on in Canada with the new Detroit coker? Are the spreads for WCI still attractive? How do you see that market playing out? We've got pipeline access now all the way to Houston. You've got upgraders -- I guess [indiscernible] can cut on upgraders. How do you see the heavy Canadian market and then, conversely, the heavy market in the Gulf Coast as well? Any views on how supply demand will look going forward here?
Mike Palmer: Yes, Chi, I'll give you some thoughts on that. The heavy Canadian market continues to be very attractive. We've seen differentials to TI that have been gyrating around that minus $15 mark. By historical standards, that's a pretty good discount in a $45, $50 environment. And, again, this market is influenced by many things that take place. We saw a great opportunity on the heavy Canadian this summer during some turnarounds that were taking place. The spreads went a little wider and we really took advantage of that. We brought quite a bit more Canadian into our system and we were able to move record amounts down to Garyville. So, going forward, again, I don't see any reason to believe that that's going to change. We think that the differential will stay in that kind of a range and we will continue to take every advantage we can. We're continuously looking at foreign cargo opportunities that we can bring to the Gulf Coast. We see opportunities coming in from Brazil with some of their heavy sweet crudes. We oftentimes find very good values in crudes that are more difficult to run. They are either high TAM or they've got some other issue. The Mexican crude has been relatively attractive as well. So the heavy market looks pretty good right now and I don't see any reason why that should change.
Chi Chow: Does the agreement with Pemex on the crude swap -- does that open things up a bit more or any impact there?
Mike Palmer: No, I don't think so. As you know, I think what's been approved is 75,000 barrels a day. It's really a relatively small amount. I really don't see that changing the market for us at all.
Operator: We have a question from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.
Evan Calio: Maybe just a follow-up there, I presume you will use a proxy solicitor that will inform you how the vote is going through that solicitation period and utilize that data to determine or consider your options as it relates to the offer. Is that fair?
Gary Heminger: Yes, sir. That's correct.
Evan Calio: And then if the transaction were voted down which I know is in your base case or ours -- but I presume into that scenario, you just revert back to your prior drop-down strategy given your significant potential at the parent and you source growth internally. Is that your thoughts?
Gary Heminger: Well, you're right in your first statement. That certainly is in our base case. We're very confident that this creates a -- just a stellar position in the marketplace, one with a strong financial position, a tremendous growth profile. But if for some reason it did not go through, you're absolutely right, we would revert to MPLX 101.
Evan Calio: I think it will be a great transaction for MPC and MPC shareholders. Different question, can you discuss pipeline committed volumes in your two Bakken pipelines? And how do you think about the risk to MPC or your exposure in an environment where Bakken is in decline? And I know pipeline should have -- should be superior to rail in that environment, but what are your thoughts here, maybe any actual exposure?
Mike Palmer: Yes, I will answer that, Evan. So let me first mention that our Southern Access Extension Pipeline, SAX, a joint venture with Enbridge, it's a completed project. We're going to be filling line fills and tank bottoms in early December and then by January, we will be fully operational and online. We're already purchasing crude for that pipe. We fully expect that we're going to be at planned rates. It will be a combination of not only the North Dakota crude, but it will have a variety of various Canadian crudes. We're really excited about having this SAX pipeline open. It creates some flexibility and some optionality that we were out of and I think we're going to see some real strong earnings coming from crude that will be coming down that pipeline to our Patoka hub. With regard to Sandpiper, I guess I would say that probably -- exactly what you said earlier, we think that North Dakota crude is going to continue to be very attractive for those that have pipeline space. We're the best option in the market. We also think that as we continue to have fairly narrow Brent TI spreads, what you are really going to see is that the East Coast players that have been railing so much North Dakota light, we really do believe that those volumes are going to decrease. And as the commitments kind of run out -- they will be canceled and probably won't be re-upped. So we think that's going to create -- it's going to take some of the pressure off North Dakota light maybe that you see today. So we think Sandpiper is going to be another great vehicle for us. It will create flexibility and optionality in a market that we're sure will increase production down the road.
Gary Heminger: And Evan, the other thing about those two pipelines -- and Mike was speaking to the tremendous advantage to MPC -- is that gives a great cash flow EBITDA stream then back to MPLX down the road.
Evan Calio: All right, exactly. Maybe if I could one more, Gary and thanks for the macro views on the oil side. But in the past, you've also shared your macro views on the other side of the equation demand. Any comments on demand as you see it either through retail, export -- what's your thought there given that's an increasing concern in the market? I will leave it there.
Gary Heminger: As Tim mentioned in his script today, we're very pleased here -- October year to date, we're up 1.8% in Speedway on the gasoline side. And you will recall when we spoke last year about this same time, we were looking for an increase in gasoline demand. However, we were in the shoulder quarter and it really didn't kick off until early into the second quarter. I think the consumer really had some confidence that this gasoline price was here to stay. And gasoline demand has been very robust over the second, third quarter and now starting into the fourth quarter. On top of that, you look at exports for both gasoline demand and distillates demand and we, too, set a new record here in this quarter for our refined product exports with 333,000 barrels per day. So -- and we will continue to ramp up our gasoline exports as we've completed a couple of gasoline tanks, both in Garyville and continuing to improve in Galveston Bay, with our logistics to be able to move out the gasoline. So we think that going into 2016 here -- and as I mentioned earlier on the macro side of crude, I think that stands to benefit the consumer very well and you will continue to see good gasoline incremental demand. Turning to the distillate side, global distillates have been a bit flat. And I would say it's because -- if you look at over-the-road diesel here in the U.S., it still -- and we have pretty good optics through all of the travel centers and commercial fueling locations that Tony has done at Speedway. So we have a pretty good feel of overall gas or distillate demand and our distillate export demand continues to be strong. I think what you're seeing is that, across the globe and how some of the regions in the globe have changed, some of the exports and the globe in which they are hitting have slowed down a little bit. Our distillate demand exports continue to be very strong. But it appears on a macro basis, some parts of the globe, distillate demand has slowed a little bit.
Operator: We have a question from Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI.
Doug Terreson: So Gary, I just wanted to see if you could clarify the last point that you made about distillate demand. I think you highlighted that there were a couple of regions that had been a little bit spotty recently. Could you provide a little bit more color on which ones those might be?
Gary Heminger: Well, it appears as though there's been a slowdown in Asia and all of us have seen that. And then, obviously Brazil has had some bit of a somewhat of a slowdown. Europe continues to be robust. The Latin American countries for the most part continue to be strong. And you are seeing more of an incremental gasoline pickup in the Latin American countries than other parts of the world. So the markets in which we serve continue to be very strong. But I was answering that question, Doug, on a global basis -- and the new refineries that have come on in Saudi Arabia, some in China and I think that is just the material balance. The way it's moving around the world is where you are seeing some softness.
Doug Terreson: Okay, I just wanted to be sure. And then also, Gary, a few minutes ago you talked about Speedway and how that business is well ahead of expectations as it relates to synergies you thought you would have when the acquisition was consummated. So my question is between the major sources of synergy which at the time were light product supply and logistics and marketing enhancements and then SG&A. Which ones are driving the positive surprise versus the original expectations? And the second question is how are light product breakevens trending as well and are they similarly surpassing your expectations at the outset of the transaction?
Tony Kenney: The synergies in all the categories are ahead of pace in each one of those that you mentioned, the light product supply; the marketing enhancements; and the operating and G&A costs. What I plan to do, Doug, at analyst day is to provide more detail and more color in each of those areas. So, going back to Gary's comments -- opening comments, we're 2 times ahead of where we thought we would be in 2015 on synergies and I will provide more detail on that at analyst day.
Gary Heminger: And a light product breakeven, Tony?
Tony Kenney: Yes and with respect to light product breakeven, we're about a penny ahead of where we thought we would be when we originally put our forecast together. So, again, that's a combination of the business just performing well but also the enhanced synergies that we're realizing as well.
Operator: We have a question from Paul Cheng from Barclays.
Paul Cheng: A number of quick questions, hopefully. Gary, just curious, fourth quarter the turnaround seems unreasonably heavy for you guys. Are those primarily in the crude unit or conversion? And also that 2016 -- the turnaround cycle, are they going to be somewhat similar to 2015 or higher or lower?
Rich Bedell: The turnarounds in the third quarter, what we've had is Robinson has been primarily around a hydrocracker and its revamp. In Catlettsburg and the Robinson one is finished. In Catlettsburg, we do have a crude unit now. We're doing a revamp to that one to recover more gas oil. So that has impacted the crude runs at Catlettsburg. We also had a shutdown planned at Detroit to do some coker cleanout and catalyst changes there and that one is wrapping up right now. So those were the major turnaround activities here in the third quarter for us.
Paul Cheng: How about which 2016 is the turnaround cycle going to be comparable to? 2015? Or that we should assume it's going to be higher or lower?
Rich Bedell: Paul, you know, our policy is we don't talk about turnarounds into the future.
Paul Cheng: Okay. And maybe this is for Gary. There's a lot of movement in the MLP sector in terms of valuation have dropped quite a lot over the last six months. And then we have also started seeing the lower production. So, some of the MLP operators start to voice concern, the industry may have seen, at least short-term or medium-term, over-investment in the lot logistic outset. Do you share the same view and whether that -- in any shape or form, that may have changed your view on that market? Or how you are going to -- going forward in terms of your organic investment?
Gary Heminger: No. In fact, Paul, I'm glad you brought that question forward. We believe that is the most important part of our platform of this strategic combination is that we're running -- all of our midstream assets are running very well. We do not see stranded investment. And as a number of peers and members of the industry within the MLP community are starting to talk about lowering their guidance and reducing their investment, lowering their guidance going forward, we just reaffirmed again this morning, I believe this is now the third time since we announced this transaction that we have reaffirmed our guidance and where we believe to go or where we're going to go with this with our midstream. And it's based on the fundamentals of our business. We have such a backlog and projects within MarkWest. We have a backlog with some projects within MPC. And a lot of the barrels that are going to move through some of these projects are barrels that we already control. So, as I said, many are backing up on their growth. And from Ed Westlake's first question this morning is why I wanted to speak to that. Is we have a very, very strong case and I believe we deserve to be -- our yield deserves to be much lower and priced with the high drop-down, high-value MLPs in the business. And let me ask Don Templin to make a few comments as well.
Don Templin: Yes, Paul, I think one of the things that is really intriguing to us and excites us is that, particularly in Utica and Marcellus, there is clearly more production that exists now than there is a reasonable take-away capacity. And so you're finding the producer customers are very constrained in terms of their ability to get their product to a market where they can get an appropriate realization. And so we look at that as being a real strategic opportunity for us to be able to meet the need of the producer customers. So those are projects that are ripe for investment, where there's already production and we believe there will be -- in continuing production, but there's already production and a need for take-away capacity. So our ability to take on projects that allow producer customers to move their NGLs to a market where they get a higher netback is a high priority for us and a real opportunity.
Gary Heminger: And Paul, we're one of the few MLPs that have the financial strength to be able to get this done. Those projects, the back-up that's in the Utica, the Marcellus, they don't get done unless you have a strong balance sheet. And you can incubate these projects over time. That's where the strategic logic is.
Paul Cheng: And Gary and Don, I think I have two final questions. One on the Galveston Bay -- I think that previously you guys have been talking about the opportunity now that you sort of like the Galveston Bay version two. You already fixed a house and now that is looking for the opportunity to grab the low-hanging fruit or other opportunity set. Is that any -- maybe the update you can provide in terms of quantifying roughly what is that opportunity set may look like for the next two or three years? And secondly, that when you did the write-down this morning indicate that some related to the long lead-time equipment. Is there any alternative use of those equipment or that you are totally -- the reason that you have a write-down is that you are not taking delivery at all? And also that from that standpoint, is there any change in your future FID pull sets so that you will not have this type of situation in other words that the timing of when you are supposed to order the long lead-time equipment?
Gary Heminger: No, that's a fair question, Paul. I will take the latter question on the ROUX first and then I will come back to GVR. On the ROUX, we continue to look to see if there's -- if we have use of some of this long lead equipment. It's specifically designed and it's called long lead because it takes three or four years to be able to fabricate some of this. So, for the most part, what we did is we stopped the fabrication early in the stages. Therefore, it would not have -- for the most part, it's not in a finished state. So it would have very little lead. The majority of that $144 million was the preliminary engineering. Of course, all of that has value down the road as markets turn around. And we'll reevaluate -- I said in my talk earlier, this still is a very strong project and makes a good strategic process platform inside of our system. But the markets have certainly turn south. And if the spreads aren't going to be there, it doesn't make sense to go forward. As far as our FID process, our FID process worked very well here in that we didn't force something to go through and we minimized all of the fabrication expense. We have not done any work in the field as far as any construction or any earth-moving whatsoever in order to be able to start this project. Our FID process and the steps that we go through to make that final decision worked very well. But as always, Paul, we try to certainly back-end load any type of equipment, any long lead time until we have clearly a final decision. When we made that decision two years ago, this was a 25% recurring project and the market certainly has turned the other direction. And then your first question about Galveston Bay, you stole our thunder a little bit. That will be the centerpiece of what we will talk about on analyst day. We're going to talk about Galveston Bay, we will talk about our midstream business because it's going to be a combination analyst day meeting with MPLX. We will spend a lot of time on midstream and then obviously spend a lot of time, Tony already mentioned -- Speedway. So we will be giving a lot of those, as you say, low-hanging fruit, how we will harvest. And the type of projects we're looking at Galveston Bay will have quick returns and quick returns of EBITDA and they won't be long-lead projects of capital that's many, many years out before you start getting your return.
Operator: We have a question from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets.
Brad Heffern: And Speedway, just circling back to an earlier question, I was wondering if you could put a finer point on the synergies generated to date. Has it been the overall pool of synergies has expanded or have they been just coming in faster than you would expect and perhaps the 2017 goal now becomes the 2016 goal? But the overall synergies are not more than you originally expected?
Tony Kenney: Yes, so originally we had indicated that we would generate $75 million of synergies in 2015. And as Gary mentioned, that's about 2X that number that we've seen so far. So what's happened is, again, alluding back to Gary's comments, when you think about the accelerated conversions, the back-office platforms, the operating platforms, the benefits we get to really marketing the stores along the same lines as we do our legacy stores, those are all generating additional synergies that we're realizing from that activity. When you add in the number of remodels that we've completed -- so these are projects we're spending $300,000 to $500,000 to go into the stores and really redesign how we're merchandising the key areas of the store. And, again, those are giving rise to synergies on an accelerated basis. And then, lastly, I would say that the -- just the overall integration of the operations, the people have been tremendous. The amount of time it's taken to train thousands of employees on new systems and procedures has really exceeded our expectations. So, again, from an operating expense standpoint and then overall from the G&A standpoint, we have been able to take advantage of those savings as well.
Brad Heffern: And then just thinking about Speedway in general and its place in the portfolio, obviously it is a very valuable asset. At this point, the head stores are not mature. But fast-forward a couple years, if you feel that you are not getting the credit that you should for Speedway in the share price, how do you think about unlocking that?
Gary Heminger: Well, we will just continue to follow that through, Brad. We continue to believe Speedway, as you said, is a very, very strategic part of our portfolio along with our refining system and our midstream and how everything works and we move those volumes through our integrated logistics space, but we will cover that down the road.
Operator: We have a question from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.
Phil Gresh: The first question, just one more on MPLX, could you talk a little bit more about the interplay between the drops that you're not talking about in the organic growth that you see from MarkWest and other opportunities? How should we think about the mix of those two things when you look at 2016 in order to hit that 25% distribution growth target?
Gary Heminger: Well, you look at MarkWest by itself today -- and they've stated publicly, they have about $1.5 billion of CapEx in their plan this year. That will be coming on some work they already had going on. And as fields mature -- and the other thing is how they are improving utilization of the assets that they already have in place. You take on top of that the assets that we have already put into the MLP, how they continue to grow. And then one of the things that is kind of a flywheel, if you look at it, is how we move refined products. Sometimes it makes more sense to move refined products out the exports. Sometimes it makes more sense to take them through our pipeline systems. And we take that all into account. And then you couple that with possible drop-downs that we may look at. The other thing is -- let me turn it over to Pam. Pam Beall is here with me. Pam is managing all of the transition between MPLX and MarkWest, so let me have Pam give you some of her thoughts.
Pam Beall: Gary really elaborated extensively early on the call about the many different ways that the parent can support the distribution growth for MPLX going forward. So it's not simply a combination of drop-down and organic growth. And we will determine as we move through 2016, based on a lot of different considerations, what we think is the best combination of the many tools that MPC can lend to the partnership to support its distribution growth.
Don Templin: Phil, this is Don. I think the other really important factor in there is the yield environment. That will impact how the trajectory of where the EBITDA sources are and how that works going ahead. So what we feel great about is that we have a lot of options and tools to be able to manage whatever yield environment that we're in to be able to reach the distribution growth guidance that we've articulated. And we think that differentiates MPLX from many of MLPs that are out there. So I can't tell you the exact percentage, but I can tell you we have all the tools that we need to meet that distribution growth guidance and that is a differentiator.
Phil Gresh: Yes, okay. And then on the capital spending, if I think about the core business outside of the MarkWest, number one, you're tracking well below the full-year guidance. And number two, I'm just wondering how you are thinking about that as you compare it against how you're thinking about 2016, again, outside of MarkWest. How are you thinking about that today? And if you could maybe tie that to how you're thinking about return of capital as well -- the availability of cash flow to returning capital to shareholders -- again, this quarter being a bit lower. How are you thinking about that?
Gary Heminger: Phil, are you speaking to MPC?
Phil Gresh: Yes.
Tim Griffith: For capital spending through third quarter, we're not terribly far off our expectations and would expect that our full-year 2015 will be about where we expected. So -- and that's not unusual to see a little bit heavier of a capital spend in the fourth quarter. That includes all elements of the business. Obviously we've got some continued investment on the pipeline projects that we're working on within refining and within Speedway. So I think for the full year we will get there. We're really not at a position right now to talk about 2016. Hopefully you can join us for the investor day in December. I think we intend to give you a little bit more color around our intention and exactly where we're going to devote resources for next year across the entire business. The return of capital piece is another good question. I think you've seen from us and will continue to see from us a very balanced approach. This is not an all-in, one-way-or-another. We think that we -- it's carefully and then with a pretty disciplined approach invest in the business where we think it makes sense and do that with a focus on shareholder returns as well. We believe that the dividend and share repurchase are part of the overall value equation for investors and that's something we're going to remain committed to.
Operator: We have a question from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank.
Ryan Todd: Maybe if I could just follow up with one follow-up on the ROUX product cancellation. You discussed it a little bit, but maybe if you think about general capital deployment going forward, is this just more of a project-specific? Should we think about it in terms of the specific economics of this project? Is it a comment on relative gasoline versus distillate cracks going forward? Or if we think about it, can we view this as -- when you think about capital allocation within your portfolio, as better opportunities outside of refining or are there other opportunities within refining if these spreads aren't going to work where you can maybe shift capital going forward?
Gary Heminger: It's, first of all, a specific project, Brian. And it's the market conditions that we're seeing today. This project was all about taking heavy residue [ph], upgrading it through the ROUX and making [indiscernible] for diesel. And it's a spread from that. And we all know where crude prices have gone, therefore where the product price has gone and the spread has collapsed significantly. As I stated at one time, this specific project had a 25% return. It's going to have about $800 million to $1 billion of annual EBITDA and our FID process work, we're on top of that. And it suggests that the market conditions if they are going to be lower for longer, now is not the time to invest in them. But we believe that the backdrop to that is we have superior projects specifically around Galveston Bay that are higher rates of return, much quicker returns of capital into our marketplace that makes more sense. So, yes, we wrote this off. We shelved this for the time being. But when the markets come back, we have all the engineering done, complete and we can pull it off the -- you don't say shelf anymore, you pull it out of the computer and away you go. So the right decision from a capital discipline approach, but it gives us the available capital. There are other projects in refining and, of course, other good returns that we have either in the midstream or in the Speedway space.
Operator: We have a question from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.
Doug Leggate: So, look, a lot of stuff has obviously been asked, but I have two things. And then maybe you want to save this for the analyst day. Gary, you've been pretty open and active about finding ways to release value over the years. And obviously one of the big slugs of your business now is retail following the acquisition, obviously, a year or two ago. What are your longer-term strategic thoughts for retail in terms of what -- if you look at peers in the street, you could argue it gets a higher-multiple business that's embedded in a lower-multiple refining business. So I'm just curious about your broad thoughts on that. As I say, maybe it's an issue for the analyst day. And I've got a follow-up, please.
Gary Heminger: Right and I just had a similar question to that. We've been very clear -- you and I have traveled and talked about this in the past. Speedway is a very strategic part of our business. Our strategies are we want to have a very high-control volume out of our refinery specifically for gasoline. And as Speedway continues to grow the diesel part of its business, it is certainly continuing to help that. I think if you want to look at the capture rate from our refining and the margins that we get from some of our refining, it certainly helps having Speedway in order to have a very ratable demand source that has taken your refined product. Lastly, as I said last year when we did the acquisition of the Speedway East, that we want to grow Speedway to be a $1 billion-a-year EBITDA business and I will knock on wood and we will share more with you at analyst day, but I think we're pretty much going to be there in the first year of operations. So, it illustrates that our strategy -- the tremendous execution by Tony and the Speedway team in order to be able to accomplish this, to get about twice as many stores reconverted in the first year than we had anticipated is very, very strong. But we will share more with you at analyst day. I think your real question is are we thinking about spinning Speedway off and the answer is--
Doug Leggate: Yes, I didn't want to be that obvious. But, yes, that's pretty much it.
Gary Heminger: The answer is no. This is a very, very key part of our strategy going forward.
Doug Leggate: Gary, my follow-up is really, I guess we started off the call talking about MPLX or maybe I could just finish it up there. Clearly, the share price of MPLX is not under pressure. I think that's a wider market issue than just a Marathon issue. But leaving that aside, what does it do to your view on what you think you can attract by way of acquisition multiples for your midstream assets? And I'm thinking more the longer-term refining drops. A lot of you still think that sort of 8 to 10 multiple is still reasonable. And if so, when do you think we can start to see that process kickstart again?
Gary Heminger: Well, I will answer that from a very macro viewpoint, Doug. As we look across the entire midstream space, I still think you're going to see consolidation in the midstreams. I think you have to. The pressure on balance sheets of certain midstream companies -- that's why this is a compelling combination. And the industrial logic is our strong balance sheet with a company that has a tremendous backlog of projects and can't do all of them on their own. So that's number one. I think you're going to continue to see additional combinations in this business. The next point, when you look out at assets that are available, high-quality assets that are attractive in the marketplace are still demanding an 8, 10 and sometimes even a higher multiple when you are competing for those assets in an open auction. So I think the market -- because what we're talking about that is available to be dropped into the MLP are very high-quality, very high-sustaining cash flow assets and they will demand a premium in the marketplace. So I still think that market is good. Don, do you have any comments?
Don Templin: Well, maybe the other just observation, Doug, is in an environment where the yields have widened as much as they have, there is probably going to be some pressure just around the market in general on multiples. I mean, if you have a higher cost of capital on a higher yield, what you are able to pay for at acquisition, I think, does go down over time.
Operator: We have a question from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.
Roger Read: Can we talk about the export a little bit? You mentioned doing some things to expanded and if you could go just a little further than record volumes but where do you think volumes can go given the expansion? And as you mentioned earlier, some competition picking up and probably not anything we would call core markets of yours. But there is some capacity coming on in Latin America in fits and starts, let's say and a lot of downtime in that region as well that may not resume anytime soon. Just give us an idea of where that -- I think it was 330,000 you mentioned.
Gary Heminger: Yes, we did 333,000 this quarter. Let me ask Rich Bedell and Mike Palmer may have a few comments as well.
Rich Bedell: As far as the projects that we have to increase our export capacity, there's -- two are ramping up this year. One is done at Garyville and that was to increase the gasoline portion. In Galveston Bay, we're doing something to increase the distillate portion. And then looking down the road by about 2018, I think right now we will take that up to about 395,000 will be our stated capacity on exports. But then we go up to a little above 500,000 with a project that we will complete in 2018 at Galveston Bay that really takes the old crude import docks and makes them into gasoline and distillate export docks. So Mike, you can talk about the bigger scale of the demand.
Mike Palmer: Sure. Roger, here's what I would say. This export market is extremely dynamic. It's very complex. Every time we start to see maybe a little slowdown in one area, the strength shifts and it goes somewhere else. The predominance of our business ends up today in Europe or in Latin America. But in addition to that, we actually have cargoes they go all the way to Asia. There are all kinds of different needs out there for different specs and different-sized cargoes. And as I say, the market is extremely dynamic. We honestly have had -- we haven't missed a step since these big export refineries have come on and no reason to believe that we won't continue to have the advantage that we've had in the past.
Roger Read: And one follow-up on that, you mentioned weak diesel demand overall domestically, globally. It seems to me any sort of pickup in that is going to tighten the distillate market fairly quickly. And I don't know exactly how to name the timing of that. But do you see that there is any, especially given the shift to gasoline this summer that there is a substantial amount of excess distillate capacity that's not being used out there?
Gary Heminger: No, we don't think there's that much. In fact, a lot of upsets around the world in refining over the last quarter have been able to soak up a lot of that excess inventory in the marketplace. But you are right; it goes back, Roger, to basic economic theory. It's not going to take much to turn that distillate market around. Whether it's 50,000 barrels a day or 100,000 barrels a day, it's fairly balanced today. And so it's not going to take much to happen. A little bit of pickup in Asia, a little bit of pickup in Brazil that I was mentioning earlier. Europe continues to remain strong. So it's not going to take much to, I think, put things in a positive position on the distillate side of the equation.
Operator: We have a question from Jeff Dietert from Simmons and Company.
Jeff Dietert: My question is related to high-octane gasoline and I was wondering if you could comment on your flexibility to increase production of high-octane gasoline within your system. Are you seeing retail sales and high-octane gasoline grow more rapidly? And then the regular 87-octane gasoline?
Rich Bedell: From the refining standpoint, we've seen that octane demand has gone up. Primarily, I think it's related to running the shale crudes and the Canadian crudes with the diluent. So you are using your octane, you're blending it up in the refinery. Our octane knobs -- Marathon's refinery, we have a pretty high percentage of reformer capacity and we utilize it fully. So we're generating octane there. We're also looking at projects to generate additional octane through our cat crackers and alp units. But we've -- look at our product slates and we optimize our refineries around that. Mike, do you want to take a little bit around some of the octane sales?
Mike Palmer: And Jeff, I will finish the call here with one of the key things that we will talk about with the MPL and MarkWest combination is we're looking at a project that has an alkaloid-type unit down the road that can take the butane that is in the Marcellus -- so the Marcellus Utica regions are long butane. We can take butane, put it through an alkylation unit and make a high-octane blend stock. And that's one of the key things that -- one of the real strengths we bring to the table in this combination that helps the producers. It helps us being short octane and helps the industry and the consumers. So that's a big part that we will talk about in December as well.
Operator: Thank you. We show no further questions. I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Ewing for final remarks.
Geri Ewing: Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or would like clarification on any of the topics we discussed this morning, Teresa Homan and I will be available to take your calls. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Marathon Petroleum Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Adrianne, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Geri Ewing, Director of Investor Relations. Geri Ewing, you may begin.
Geri Ewing - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thank you, Adrianne. Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's second quarter 2015 earnings webcast and conference call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, President and CEO; Don Templin, Executive Vice President of Supply, Transportation and Marketing; Tim Griffith, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Palmer, Senior Vice President of Supply, Distribution and Planning; Pam Beall, President of MPLX, and Tony Kenney, President of Speedway. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on slide two. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the call and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that cause – could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as in our filings with the SEC. Now, I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks and highlights. Gary?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thank you, Geri, good morning, and thank you for joining our call. We're pleased to report second quarter earnings of $826 million, reflecting a strong performance across to our operating platform. Refining performance was solid with $1.2 billion of income for the quarter as our refineries benefited from the combination of high utilization and favorable market conditions. Crack spreads were strong throughout the quarter, reflecting increased refined products demand in the U.S. We expect demand to continue to be strong in the near term due to the strengthening in the U.S. economy and lower fuel prices, which should continue to benefit our refining and marketing business. The new condensate splitter at our Catlettsburg, Kentucky refinery went online during the second quarter. Along with the splitter recently completed at Canton, we have increased our system's refinery capacity by over 40,000 barrels per day, as well as our ability to process condensate production from the region's emerging shale plays. These two splitters further enhance MPC's extensive high complexity system. Turning to our midstream business, we are pleased to highlight MPLX and MarkWest's recently announced merger agreement. This strategic combination complements our operations and expands MPC's commercial opportunities. It represents a significant step in executing our strategy to grow our higher valued stable cash flow businesses. The combination enables us to increase our participation in the U.S. energy infrastructure buildout and transforms MPLX into a diversified large cap MLP. MPC's strong balance sheet and liquidity will enable MarkWest to accelerate organic growth in some of the nation's most economic and prolific liquids-rich natural gas resource plays. We expect the combination of these projects and MPC's inventory of MLP eligible assets to support a strong distribution growth profile over an extended period of time for the combined partnership. It also defers the need for the recently proposed MPLX acquisition of MPC's marine transportation assets in 2015, with this drop being indefinitely postponed and the estimated $115 million of EBITDA to be returned to the $1.6 billion of backlog. As part of the transaction, MPLX affirmed its anticipated distribution growth guidance of 29% in 2015. In addition, it expects a 25% compound annual limited partnership distribution growth rate for the combined entity through 2017 with an annual distribution growth profile of approximately 20% in 2018 and 2019. This transaction also enhances the cash flow profile of MPC's general partner interest in MPLX. You may recall that MPLX's first quarter distribution put MPC's general partner interest in the highest year of the incentive distribution rights and the partnership just declared an additional 7.3% increase in LP distributions to $0.44 per unit for the second quarter. Speedway performed well during the quarter and continues to make tremendous progress integrating the East Coast and Southeast retail locations acquired last year. Over 650 of the retail sites have been converted to the Speedway brand since the acquisition last September, and we're on pace to achieve the anticipated synergies for 2015 from light product supply, as well as from operating and administrative expense savings. Additionally, the accelerated progress of store conversions and subsequent remodels has allowed us to more rapidly implement Speedway's industry leading Speedy Rewards loyalty program. This program and other marketing enhancements are expected to drive the synergies anticipated over the next several years. MPC continues to balance investments to grow the business with returning capital to shareholders. During the second quarter, MPC returned $544 million of capital to shareholders, including $408 million in share repurchases and $136 million in dividends. This brings our total return of capital to shareholders to $8.7 billion since becoming an independent company four years ago. To further underscore this commitment, our board increased MPC's dividend by $0.07 per share to $0.32 per share and authorized up to an additional $2 billion in share repurchases over the next two years. This authorization is on top of the $1.1 billion still available for repurchases at the end of the quarter and brings total repurchase authorizations to $10 billion since 2011. The company maintains a strong financial position and continues to execute a strategy through great value through new investments in the business and continued strong operating performance. With that, let me turn the call over to Tim to talk through the financial results for the second quarter. Tim?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thanks, Gary. Slide four provides earnings on both an absolute and per share basis. As you can see in the yellow bars in the chart, our financial performance was strong once again in the second quarter of this year. MPC has earnings of $826 million, or $1.51 per diluted share during the second quarter of 2015, compared to $855 million or $1.48 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year. The chart on slide five shows by segment the change in earnings from the second quarter of last year. Earnings were fairly consistent period-over-period with Refining & Marketing's income from operations down $54 million, partially offset by higher income from Speedway and lower income taxes resulting from lower overall taxable income. Turning to slide six, Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2015, compared to the $1.3 billion in the same quarter last year. The slight decrease was primarily due to less favorable product price realizations compared to the LLS base crack spread, less favorable crude oil acquisition costs relative to our market indicators resulting from narrow crude differentials, and lower dollar base refinery volumetric gains resulting from overall lower commodity prices. Segment results were also affected by a charge of $46 million to recognize increased estimated cost for compliance with the recently proposed renewable fuel standards. All these unfavorable impacts are included in the $458 million of other gross margin on this slide. These negative impacts were partially offset by a $372 million favorable effect of contango in the crude oil market in the second quarter of 2015. This $1.90 per barrel of contribution in the second quarter compared to the detrimental impact of backwardation in the second quarter last year of $0.93 per barrel. Additionally, direct operating costs were $130 million lower in the second quarter of 2015 compared to last year's second quarter primarily due to lower energy and turnaround costs Other refining and marketing segment net expenses increased $149 million compared to second quarter 2014 as a result of a number of items including higher terminal and transportation costs and lower equity affiliate income. On slide seven, we provide the Speedway segment earnings walk for the second quarter. Speedway's income from operations was $33 million higher in the quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2014. Speedway's newly acquired locations contributed income of approximately $14 million to the quarter's results or approximately $45 million of EBITDA. For the legacy Speedway sites, the merchandise gross margin was $23 million higher in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the same quarter last year, and the light product gross margin was about $16 million higher. Speedway same-store gasoline sales volume was down two-tenths of a percent versus same quarter last year compared to estimates of U.S. demand growth in the second quarter of approximately 3% higher. The primary reason for this difference is how Speedway continuously strives to optimize total gasoline contributions between volume and margin to ensure fuel margins remain adequate, as well as a substantial number of new locations and remodels during the quarter. Overall, gasoline sales volumes for legacy Speedway locations were up 3% in the quarter, reflecting the impact of investments in new, rebuild and remodel locations. Another key performance metric for our retail group is same-store merchandise sales, and we're continuing to see strong demand for our in-store offering as our same-store merchandise sales in the quarter excluding cigarettes were up 4.6% versus same quarter last year. So far in July we've seen a 1.6% increase in same-store gasoline volumes compared to last July. Slide eight shows the changes for our pipeline transportation segment versus the second quarter last year. Income from operations was down $2 million to $79 million in the second quarter. This decrease was primarily due to lower equity affiliate income and increase in various operating expenses, partially offset by higher transportation revenue in the quarter, reflecting higher crude and light product throughput across the system. Slide nine presents significant elements of changes in our cash position in the quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was almost $1.9 billion. Core operating cash flow was a $1.2 billion source of cash. The $237 million use of working capital noted on the slide primarily relates to an increase in receivables and inventory, partially offset by higher accounts payable and other accrued expenses. The increases in receivables and payables were primarily due to higher refined product and crude oil prices during the quarter along with slightly higher inventory levels at the end of the quarter. We continued delivering on our commitment to balance investments in the business with return of capital to our shareholders. We repurchased $408 million of shares and paid $136 million of dividends in the second quarter. Share count at the end of the quarter was 537 million shares on a split adjusted basis, reflecting share repurchase activity since the spin of 26% of shares outstanding at that time. Slide 10 shows that our balance sheet continues to be strong with a gross debt right at one times the $6.5 billion of LTM EBITDA and a debt-to-total capital ratio of 35%. Slide 11 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the third quarter of 2015. We are expecting third quarter throughput volumes to be down slightly compared to third quarter of 2014 due to more planned maintenance in the quarter. Since we have no comparable 2014 data that includes the newly acquired Hess locations, we are continuing to provide Speedway outlook information by quarter for 2015. For the third quarter of 2015, we expect Speedway's light product sales volume will be approximately 1.5 billion gallons. With that, let me turn the call back over to Geri.
Geri Ewing - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thanks, Tim. As we open for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. You may re-prompt for additional questions as time permits. With that, we will now open the call to questions. Adrianne?
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Edward G. Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey. Good morning, and congratulations again on the strategic tie-up in the midstream. I guess people are concerned that given the MPLX price response, and the fact that obviously the implied price for MWE has faded, that – and given the strength of the assets that MWE has that you might be forced to defend a bid at perhaps a higher price or sweeten the deal. Maybe just talk us through a little bit about your thought process there?
Richard D. Bedell - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, Ed, good morning. And I understand your question, and we feel this is a very compelling transaction, compelling for both sides. And when you look at the profile of MPLX, one of the things I think investors have not fully been able to understand yet is that our risk profile really hasn't changed from where we were before, because we had – we needed to execute on a number of organic growth projects within MPLX since we started the IPO in October of 2012, and a good part of the growth that we have there was eventually going to become dropdowns, all was going to be dependent upon executing an organic growth profile. And the same thing happens here with MarkWest, and then the key to this transaction is you look at MarkWest today, they are around $1 billion or so of EBITDA. And we're speaking to $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion of EBITDA still sitting in backlog within MPC, MPLX. So that's the great strength or the great combination going forward, but we really believe this is a compelling transaction, understanding the value that MPLX brings to the table.
Edward G. Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then a separate follow-on, I mean, you've got a lot of maintenance or some maintenance in the Mid-con if I look at your turnaround costs in the 3Q. Maybe just talk a little bit about any upgrades to the plants that you're planning during that maintenance to perhaps give better EBITDA from self-help off to the turnaround, if there is any?
Richard D. Bedell - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, and it is Rich Bedell, Ed. There's two projects going in Catlettsburg, their project is a crude unit upgrade to recover more distillate in gas oil out of those crudes and Robinson has a unicracker or a hydrocracker project to produce more distillate.
Edward G. Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Do you have any rough numbers on what the EBITDA contribution might be in say – I know diesel is not doing great, but in say current conditions?
Richard D. Bedell - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: I don't have any right in front of me here right now.
Edward G. Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator: And the next question comes from Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering. Please go ahead.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Great, thanks. This maybe a little bit of a naïve question, but could you walk us through how processing incremental condensate volumes at Canton and Catlettsburg and eventually Robinson will impact refining operations? Is the upside based on yield improvements or higher gasoline blending volumes or is there some other factor? I'm just wondering how to quantify the impacts of the increased condensate you're running through the plants?
Richard D. Bedell - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: It is Rich Bedell again. The overall condensates, I mean, you've got everything from the light straight run material all the way into a distillate-type material. So by running those it gives us more blend stocks and feedstocks for the downstream units. And the Catlettsburg and Canton are pure condensate splitter-type projects. The project that will go in in Robinson is more of a light crude project and that's going in next year, and that will just give us more ability to process the lighter crude slates that are available.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay, Rich. So essentially you're going to get better yields coming out, is that kind of bottom line?
Richard D. Bedell - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yes, yes.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay.
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, Chi, it's both yield and it's a low cost feedstock. I mean, you will have a structural advantage to low cost feedstocks in the region via the condensates. And given the location we think that that's an enduring advantage to the business.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Right. Okay. Now, does that exasperate the situation you've got going on with the octane differential between premium/regular gasoline? Does it make things worse I guess for them (17:59) or how do you think about that?
Richard D. Bedell - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, I mean we're pretty well-positioned with our reformer capacity to generate the octane to use the lighter blend stock. So I mean it all gets into optimizing the refinery.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: All right. Okay. And then one question on the MarkWest transaction. I'm not sure if you can answer but this, can you walk through any examples of growth projects that a combined MPLX/MarkWest Energy can undertake but that each entity cannot do on its own?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, the question you just asked, Chi – this is Gary – the question you just asked concerning octane is a great example. As you look at the feedstock that MarkWest has today, the – with the butane supply, butane is a great feedstock to put into an Appalachian unit and make octane. And we see going out to meet the CAFE standards of 2022 that the industry is going to be short octane. We have the ability to take this butane, marry it up with a possibly, and this is a conceptual project we have, but one we've been looking at for quite some time and then that is to manufacture octane right near the source. It makes more sense to do that than to distribute the butane to different markets, albeit the Gulf Coast or the harbor, New York Harbor and then manufacture it into a finish product. I think it makes more sense to manufacture it and then distribute that octane into the gasoline pool that is already in this market. That's just one example. We have a number of other examples that we're looking at, possibly batching of refined products to the New York Harbor and when I look at MPC, the dropdowns that we have, some of the pipeline opportunities that we've been looking at, as well some of the terminal opportunities, you combine that volume with volume that MarkWest has I think it can make some feasible projects.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: And lastly, Chi, we've already announced the Cornerstone pipeline. And so again, you take the feedstock and the initiation station, if you will, of Cornerstone is going to be right at MarkWest Cadiz facility. So we're going to be able to marry up additional products there. Initially we are building this to be able to move condensates up to Canton and our Catlettsburg refinery. You probably have recognized some of your E&P contacts how Marcellus and Utica are continuing to have some very strong results on some wells that have been drilled here recently. We believe that we can take some of those products, put them into Cornerstone and then go into the second phase of Cornerstone that we've talked about in the past, but the second phase to get us all the way back to the Chicago market and maybe even eventually tie-in with some pipelines that we have coming up from the North and considering reversing those getting back down to the Gulf Coast. So we have tremendous flexibility and tremendous options to be able to expand MarkWest and MPLX.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks for the color, Gary. On Cornerstone, does the linkup with MarkWest allow you to flow Cornerstone at full capacity?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: We – well, it's really not being that we're linking up with MarkWest. It's all going to be about how the drill bit and how the producer continues to bring the stream on. That's why I brought up early. You noticed recently the significant progress and then some of the big wells have come on in the region. We certainly think this is going to help us. Pam, do you have any more color?
Pamela K. M. Beall - MPLX LP: Well, I was just going to say, Chi, certainly the – as Gary mentioned – we're going to originate at the MarkWest Cadiz condensate stabilizer facility. We're also going to tie into their Hopedale fractionation operation. So we see the potential to move not just condensate but natural gasoline and butane and different grades as we're going to batch this system. And as Gary said, really we could – we believe we can deliver diluent into a pipeline that will end up going into Canada. We could reach the refineries in a Toledo, Lima, all the way back to our Robinson plant. And then, as Gary mentioned, there is even the potential to go north to Chicago and south to the Gulf Coast. So as the volumes ramp up, that's – we'll be able to step into, kind of lag into the growth in the region. So the reason that we upsized Cornerstone from 12 inches to 16 inches was really to handle what we think will be a very large increase in natural gas liquids coming out of Utica, Marcellus. So we do see a lot of opportunities to leverage a lot of pipe we already have in the ground, a lot right of way that we can access to build out a distribution system from the Utica, Marcellus area, west, south and northwest, and as Gary mentioned, even enough (23:32).
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Great. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the comments, Pam. I appreciate it.
Operator: And our next question comes from Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Douglas T. Terreson - Evercore ISI: Good morning, everybody.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Hi, Doug.
Douglas T. Terreson - Evercore ISI: First, I wanted to see if Tim would repeat the compliance cost item that you highlighted for other gross margin in the quarter?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Sure, Doug. You're talking about the $46 million?
Douglas T. Terreson - Evercore ISI: Was it $46 million? 
Douglas T. Terreson - Evercore ISI:
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, Doug, this is effectively at the end of May, we got the sort of the final proposed standards on renewable fuels, especially for biomass diesel.
Douglas T. Terreson - Evercore ISI: Right. Okay.
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: And so we sort of had built into what we expected that obligation to be. We found out at the end of May what it actually was going to be for calendar 2014 obligations, and so we were immediately in a position where we needed to acquire those RINs to satisfy that obligation. So that...
Douglas T. Terreson - Evercore ISI: Okay.
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: ... that these are basically D4 and D5 RINs and there's basically about a $46 million cost in order for us to come current based on the standards released at the end of May.
Douglas T. Terreson - Evercore ISI: Sure. Okay, thanks. Okay. And then second on Speedway, I wanted to see if we could get an update on integration of the Hess acquisition, specifically on the major areas of earnings opportunity that you guys have talked about meaning how is then its progress unfolding so far versus expectations on light products, supply and logistics, marketing enhancement, and SG&A cost? And also where were light product breakevens in the quarter, if you have them, and all they following at the rate that you thought that they would originally?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Okay, Tony?
Anthony R. Kenney - Speedway LLC: Yeah. On the color around the integration with the Hess assets, actually we're moving along at an accelerated pace in converting the brand to Speedway. We're little over 650 stores, more than halfway complete on that progress right now. But Doug, the important thing there is it's more than just the brand. What's going in inside the store is all of our technology that kind of is the platform for our marketing programs, primarily our loyalty program, all of our inventory management, other things that drives savings and synergies for us as we operate convenience stores. In terms of the synergies itself, I mean the early opportunities have been to capture the savings on the light product supply and logistics part of the business, which as you know we've talked many times about, the integrated benefits of MPC's vast supply system and how we're able to take advantage and extract some value from that. I mean those are basically in place right now in terms supplying the stores. And then the other early opportunities have been to capture the operating expense savings and the G&A savings. So for the quarter and for the year, what we're really saying essentially is that we're expecting to be on pace with what we earlier indicated what the synergies would be in the business for 2015. And then down the road as we begin to bring on all of the marketing enhancements through the conversions inside the store that I described earlier, then we'll start to realize those benefits down the road.
Douglas T. Terreson - Evercore ISI: Sure. Great. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: And your next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Hi, Neil.
Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Gary, I wonder if you could start off by talking about your capital allocation strategy? You raised the dividend by 28% yesterday. How are you weighing buybacks versus dividends at current levels? And how does MarkWest impact the way you think about capital allocation, if at all?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Sure. And Neil, you'll recall at our sell-side analyst dinner, when we were talking about MPLX, we had – we discussed some of these issues there that in fact we think it enhances things going forward. And let me have Tim go into the details.
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. So, Neil, the question of dividends versus buybacks is I think for us is a relative easy one. Dividends, despite their sort of tax inefficiency, we know are an important part of a lot of investors' thinking around a stock. And so our intention will be to maintain a strong and growing dividend for the long term. That is going to be the approach. I think the way we view the sort of what remains from a capital if there's excess capital or cash in the business is that share purchase is the most efficient way to get that back to shareholders. It has the nice benefit of sorting out the shareholder base and basically returning capital to those people that aren't going to be long in the stock anymore and allows for investors to pick their own liquidity window as opposed to pushing cash to shareholders who may not wish it in the form of a special dividend or other form. So I think that's the way we approach it. I think you should expect to see continued focus on both of these. They are are both part of our overall thinking on the sacred trust that exists with investors, with regard to the capital and cash we've been entrusted with. And that's likely how we'll continue. The addition of the MarkWest business and the combination of MPLX and MarkWest we think provides some very interesting dynamics. One of which we described on the announcement call itself, which is it is true that the GP cash flows are enhanced by the transaction. And the way we view that is that there really is a virtuous capital cycle here. As those GP cash flows come back into the C Corp. it becomes available for further investment in what will become ultimately investments of the partnership. An important part to what we think makes sense around the transaction and we think has got a lot of power to it, is the fact that to the extent there are very nice investments, good, high returning investments available in the midstream that provide some strategic advantage, we have the ability to incubate those at the C Corp. and drop them into the partnership at the appropriate time. One, just from a pure capital capacity, that the partnership may not be able to swallow it all at once, but also the timing issue that where capital gets spent and built and the time that it takes before those projects come fully on stream. MPC has got the capacity to sort of incubate them and basically put them in the partnership when they're at full run rate cash flow. So again the financial flexibility afforded here we think is tremendous. And the capital allocation will follow form on where we think the investments need to be made, but we fully stand ready to make continued investments in the midstream and through this vehicle probably on an even more accelerated pace.
Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks, Tim. And then a follow-up here on the macro, Gary. Of all the CEOs in the oil industry you've probably spent as much time in Saudi Arabia or dealing with the Saudis as anyone. What are your thoughts in terms of Saudi output and productive capacity? And then another question is I think last time we spoke you certainly seemed more constructive on oil than the forward curve and even our lower for longer views, I think investors could benefit from hearing your perspective on the flat price.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yes, Neil. What I said earlier in the year, in fact, at your conference in January, has continued to prove out for the year. I've said I think investors should watch the amount of imports coming into the U.S., namely from the Middle East, not only Saudi Arabia, but others. And that has continued to bear fruit for refining. And as we look at the forward positions and how crude oil is positioned right now as imports into the Gulf Coast, we think this remains. And the other thing I had stated is we were expecting to have a second dip. We did not expect a V-shaped curve here, and it ended up being – I think it's going to be a more of W-shaped curve with the crude price, that we expected this second dip. And but we do expect strength going on down the calendar, end of the year probably into the second quarter of next year before you really I think start to see some strength. The other thing is when I look at the volumes coming in through LOOP, the main oil line volumes continue to be strong, which again suggests strong imports coming into the U.S. And it really takes it back to the question of how is crude situated in the Midwest? And we've had this discussion many times, looking at the amount of sweet crude we run versus sour crude. We have the capacity to run somewhere between 65% and 70% sweet crude, and we're basically on the same number this quarter as second quarter of 2014 at around 54% sour. So that suggests we have a lot more room to run more sweet crude if it is priced right in the marketplace. So I think you're going to continue to see light sweet crude coming in from Middle East producers, landing in the Gulf Coast and being available. And that really is going to come back and tie-in with where do we see the drill bit? Where do we see the production out of the Permian and Eagle Ford? We're not getting much Bakken down into the – into PADD 3 today, some, but not that much. But it's Permian. It's Eagle Ford to really see what's going to happen there. So I think some of the same, Neil, going forward, and I expect to see the Middle East producers want to continue to maintain their market share.
Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right, Gary. Thank you very much.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: You're welcome.
Operator: And our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Hey, Paul.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Gary, I was wondering, there's a number of report talking about the tightness in the alkylate market and also at the high octane component. I think one of your competitors even said in the (33:59) talking about they may have difficulty that to produce output. I want to see that what is your view that how tight is the alkylate and high octane component right now in the marketplace? And how that impact that what you can see is on the gasoline supply and the corresponding crack?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: As Rich said earlier, Paul, we're very balanced on the outlook because of our reforming capacity. So – but you are right. There have been some wide spreads between the New York Harbor and Chicago and the Gulf Coast on alkylate and therefore octane. We're very balanced at this point in time, but we really see this growing into the future. Again, as I say, getting out to meet the CAFE standard with higher compression engines going many years from now – not many years, but into the latter part of this decade, we're going to need to be able to have more octane in the system. And I think you're going to be able to see this grow over time, these spreads, and this is why we have this interest and why we think it's a natural benefit between MarkWest and MPC going forward.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Will you contemplate to build some new alkali unit in your refining system?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: And that's what I had said earlier, Paul, that and as – we're very balanced right now, but the – one of the very strong synergies, operational synergies, from a conceptual standpoint, I don't want anybody to think that we have FID'd an alkylate unit, but from a very conceptual standpoint, with MarkWest being long butane, the producers being long butane in a very strategic area of the country, I think it really tees it up well for us to consider additional alkylation manufacturing capacity. And we're looking at that very strongly. And then I think it makes sense to manufacture it within the region. Don't transport the feedstock to different markets, but rather manufacture it where you need it in order to be able to put it into the final blend stock.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Gary, you have very heavy – I have to apologize, because I came in late, so you may already address it. In the third quarter, looking at your outlook, you have very heavy turnaround in the Midwest. I'm wondering can you share that – how is that outlook maybe for the fourth quarter? And also then in the third quarter is there heavy downtime? Is that primary in the front end of the refinery or the back end of the refinery?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Sure, let me have Rich cover that for you, Paul.
Richard D. Bedell - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, Paul, the turnarounds we have in our Robinson refinery starting in August are really around our hydrocracker and reformer areas and not so much the crude. And then in Catlettsburg that's one of the crude units we'll be taking down to do modifications.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, how about in the fourth quarter, Rich? Are you going to expect that you have a pretty heavy downtime also or is that just going to be more similar to the first half of the year where you don't have a lot of maintenance?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Say Paul, you know our history. We don't like to talk beyond what's going on right now as far as turnarounds. It's just too competitive to get into that going forward.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, that's fair. A final one, maybe this for Tim. Tim any preliminary 2016 budget you can share?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Well, Paul, we would love to be able to give you a look at the year, but we're not in position do so and if we were, we probably wouldn't be sharing it at this point. We – I think as we get closer to the end of the year you can look to us to give some indication for – from some of the metrics, but as you know we're not going to give any sort of full-year guidance at this point.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Can you at least tell us that whether it's going to be more likely, going to be flat, up or down comparing to this year?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, Paul, it's just too early to say, I think we'll – you will hopefully shortlist your invitation to our December Analyst conference, and if we provide any information it will be in that forum.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. All right, we'll do it. Thank you.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Hey, Paul, let me back up to your question about butane and how it fits in with the market and the structure going forward. Don has talked about this when – Don's been on the road, and let me ask him to share as far as some of the producers and consumers.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you.
Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, Paul. I think Gary mentioned the benefits to MPC and having the opportunity to have alkylate and octane, the benefit to MPLX of a combined project with MarkWest around this. But I think it's also important to make sure that we're not forgetting about the producer customers of MarkWest or the MPLX combined entity because it is our objective to make sure that they are getting the highest netback that they possibly can get. So these kinds of projects as we think forward are opportunities to benefit the producer customers, opportunities to benefit MPLX, the combined entity and opportunities to benefit MPC the C Corp.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, Good morning, everyone.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Good morning, Brad.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Just looking at yields during the quarter, I noticed that gasoline yield was the lowest I've seen, at least far back as my model goes. I would have thought that during the quarter you guys would have been running max gasoline. Was there any particular reason around that: Was it maintenance or turnaround-related and have you ramped up gasoline yield since then?
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, Brad, this is Tim, and Rich can certainly supplement. I mean I don't think there was any particular focus one way or another. As you know, we will – we run LPs every day and every month in terms of what optimizes the system with regard to product yields from a total value maximization perspective, and then we'll make those decisions as appropriate. We did – exports for the quarter were strong, and those are generally diesel-focused for the most part. So that there – those markets continue to be receptive and robust from a earnings opportunity perspective, but Rich, I don't know if you had any supplements?
Richard D. Bedell - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: I'm looking through. I don't have anything to add to that.
Donald C. Templin - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Hey, Brad, this is Don. I mean, exports were 330,000 barrels a day, so a super strong quarter from an export perspective, and as Tim mentioned about 70% of those exports were diesel or distillate. So there was a reason for – we were able to optimize the value in the netback of that diesel production.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. That makes sense. Thanks for that. And then looking at Galveston Bay, I was wondering if you had any update on the synergies that have been achieved to-date, how much there is left to achieve, and then where we stand on the earn-out?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Brad, I'll – this is Gary. In December this is going to be part of the centerpiece. We now have another centerpiece that we're going to talk about at the analyst meeting in December, being MarkWest. But Galveston Bay is going to be a big part of that. To really give you more detail, we're very pleased with where we stand. We're ahead of schedule on the synergies. We just made the second earn-out payment this year. So we paid out $369 million. We have $331 million left in the earn-out, and things are performing out very well this year. I'm very pleased to state that the strike that went on, it has been settled. We've had a great return to work, great productivity from our employees, and very pleased to welcome them back. So things are moving very well at Galveston Bay. But as I said, we will give you, along with Paul Cheng's question concerning the budget, we're going to give you more detail and where we see a lot of low hanging fruit going forward.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay I'll leave it there. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks, good morning everyone. Good morning, Gary.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Good morning, Doug. Where have you been? I haven't talked to you in a long time.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Well, let's just say we're working out of the Scottish office this week. But I got a couple of questions, if I may? First of all, I don't want to label the MarkWest deal too much, but to kind of get straight to the point, there seems to be some chatter in the market that the MarkWest side of the equation may not be terribly happy with the currency anymore. I'm just – I understand the commitment of both sides, but I'm just curious if you feel that there would be a need to change the terms somewhat in order to cement the transaction? And I know it's a tough question to answer, but I do have a follow-up as well please. Thank you.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yes, Doug and Ed Westlake had the same question earlier on here, and as I've said it's – we believe we're – it's a very compelling transaction and you need to look beyond just MPLX. So we announced this the day after the Iranian nuclear accord was announced and there's been a lot of macro headwinds in the marketplace. And if you look at the large cap MLPs, gathering and processing MLPs, even the high drop-down MLPs, there's been tremendous volatility and headwinds on those. But if you combine the – where the units are trading for both MarkWest and MPLX and take into account the headwinds in the marketplace, we still think that we are in a very compelling business. The relative performance, as I said, looking at MarkWest and look at those G&P units or the large cap units, if you take into account that that tough backdrop along with that, I think it further supports that this is a compelling transaction at this time. We're getting ready to – it won't be long that we'll have the HSR filed, and that'll be followed by the S-4. So there will be more details to come, and I think that's going to further support that this is a compelling transaction.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: As you know, Gary, we like the deferral of the refinery drop, so congratulations again on the deal. One follow-up if I may? It's really more a macro question. So there's two things seem to be kind of dominating the second half outlook. One is obviously strong gasoline demand and the other is the remarkable buildup of distillate. I'm just kind of curious as – because of your unique exposure on retail you tend to have a pretty good handle as to whether the 6% EIA gasoline demand growth is really translating on a same-store sales basis. So I wondered if you could comment on your view of sustainability of gasoline demand growth. And I guess the byproduct which is strong refinery runs means more distillate production going into winter and we seem to be starting from a fairly high level of inventory. So real more of a macro question. I'd just love to get your perspective on those two things and I'll leave it there, Gary. Thank you.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Sure, if you look at the overall gasoline demand and the 6% EIA, the last number I saw was 5.1% but maybe you have a new number from what I had yesterday, but and that's why we gave a little more color in Tim's presentation here on Speedway's gasoline being a market leader in many of the markets. With that, as we are trying to move these, as you recall, in the second quarter crude oil prices went up significantly over that period of time and with that trying to reflect that incremental cost to the Street is difficult. So that's why we gave more color this time to look at overall Speedway legacy assets versus – or legacy stores versus the new stores they acquired on the East. But we think that we performed very well on incremental gasoline, and we're continuing to see that as Tim outlined here in – early in the third quarter. We're continuing to see that move forward and move up very nicely. On distillate, as Mike Palmer and Tim spoke as well, our distillate exports continued to be very strong. And as I look at our book going into the third quarter they continue to be robust. So I think we're very well balanced on distillate. I think as the fall – you have two things, the fall harvest and secondly the fall turnaround schedule especially the ones that we've already talked about this morning, I think is going to soak up some of the distillate in the market. But the key, you're absolutely right Doug, the key to watch is how the exports continue forward on distillate.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks a lot, Gary. Appreciate the answers.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Igor Grinman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys, it's actually Igor Grinman here.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Good morning, Ryan.
Igor Grinman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: It's Igor here chiming in for Ryan. Hi, Gary. Just a question on the refining side your – so the other gross margin bucket contributed, I think it was $19 million in the quarter or call it a little bit higher if you're adding back the RFS-related hit you called out, either way it's a bit of a drop-off versus recent quarterly levels. So just curious as – I know it's notoriously fairly volatile but – and there are lot of moving factors in there, just curious is there anything that you can kind of point to the drop-off?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, sure let me have Tim take that.
Timothy T. Griffith - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, Igor, thanks. Certainly what we've seen on a run rate basis around this has been higher but we've had – we had a couple of things in the quarter that sort of are all part of that other gross margin. I think you're probably referring to the slide in the appendix that shows it as $19 million. But within the quarter we had, as I had mentioned in my comments, we had volumetric gains which were an impact on the quarter. That's frankly just the scale impact. Volumes were slightly lower, but just with lower absolute prices you're going to see a lower impact there. So that was a hit on the quarter. Product price realizations again, as you said, we've picked up the 46. That's part of that. But we did see a little bit softer gas margins in the quarter, and frankly, just less favorable than where they were for second quarter last year. Second quarter last year was a very strong quarter. You've probably heard us say on multiple occasions that we really perform best in volatile environments. That's where we have the greatest opportunity to sort of optimize the system, and frankly, second quarter last year was a very good quarter on that basis. And then we had some impact to some of the incremental crude costs, some of which we've already described, and some that had an impact on the quarter. So those are probably the biggest drivers and I think the things we'll highlight, and we'll see how this is looking forward.
Igor Grinman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Just one more, and apologies if this was discussed already, but on Speedway, fuel margins dropped off a good amount quarter-on-quarter. And I understand the crude price movement was upward and/kind of stabilizing over the quarter, but anything else there that we should note? Or is this kind of a feeling (50:28) of a level more or less on the margin side?
Anthony R. Kenney - Speedway LLC: Gary, let me answer that, please.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: All right.
Anthony R. Kenney - Speedway LLC: Yeah. I mean it goes back to Gary's comment he just made a little earlier. Crude ran up our wholesale cost increase, and that's kind of the pressure you're under when you're trying to pass on increasing cost. And that's what we saw in the second quarter. It's as simple as that.
Igor Grinman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: All right. Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. First question, just any update on the cap line reversal analysis? I know it's something you had put a press release out a couple of quarters ago, so I was just looking for any recent thoughts?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Phil, there's nothing new from what we've talked in the past. Still think it makes sense, but it takes a unanimous approval by all the owners but no update from the last time.
Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: So is there a particular timeline on it or not really at this point in terms of trying to make a decision?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: I would say, as we said last fall I believe, that we did a study from an engineering standpoint of what it was going to take. But it – from an engineering perspective, it's – I won't say it's easy, but it's just kind of a normal engineering project to be able to reverse the pumps and be able to reverse the flow. The biggest thing that I think you need to understand and the market needs to understand is where do you get the heavy crude supply into Patoka? In order to be able to reverse this you need a static heavy crude supply into Patoka so that you can have a good heavy supply and a ratable supply to the Eastern Gulf. And I would say that that is the issue, and with the downturn in crude prices and looking at the Canadian supply coming forward, I think the incremental Canadian supply is probably being pushed back a few years.
Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Sure, okay. And then just in terms of, I mean you've done the Hess deal, MWE, I mean is it fair to say that the organization at this point becomes kind of organically and inwardly focused in terms of execution in that further M&A anywhere across the portfolio is probably more limited likelihood?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah, I would say we have a lot to say grace over right now.
Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Fair enough. Thanks.
Operator: And the next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah, good morning.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Hey, Roger.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Gary, I'd like if we could be maybe the differential question, following up on the comments on the Canadian crude, and just the fact the differential is being narrower, kind of trimmed Q2 margins a little bit, any quantification you can give us or maybe just as we think Q2 to Q3 is especially WCS diffs have opened up, how that may impact realizations?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah. Let me ask Mike to cover the current markets.
C. Michael Palmer - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Yeah Roger. I guess what I can tell you, and it's obviously market information, but the wildfires in the Coal Lake area are behind us. And in addition to that, when you look at the differentials today, the Canadian heavy dip is up around that $16 level. We've got – we do have some projects that are coming on in Canada that were sanctioned some time ago before oil prices fell. So we've got some additional supply coming on from several projects. In addition to that, when you look to this this fall period, we do have some heavy refineries that have turnaround. So this $16-ish kind of differential, this wider differential that we're seeing, is likely to be with us for a while. So it looks very positive.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay, thanks. And then Gary, you mentioned earlier on the question regarding diesel and the need to focus on exports, is it, as simple as we should just watch the arbs to the various international regions? Or is there something else where we will actually notice a change in volumes first and change in arbs second? I was just kind of curious, chicken or egg question there.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: So I think you've got it right. That's chicken or the egg. And I wasn't saying that to give a hint on anything. It's just we have continued to see very strong and very robust demand on diesel into Latin America, Europe and South America with continued increases in the request for gasoline cargos. So I find both export products being very strong going into the third quarter and so I was just saying continue to watch that because I think that underpins the strength of refining going forward.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: You bet, Roger.
Operator: And your next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, good morning. Thank you, guys.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Hi, Faisel.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, Gary. I'd sort of go back to some of the comments around octane. So are you saying that the octane market is getting – is it getting shorter just because we've had this big uptick in gasoline demand so we need to fill that gap? Or is it – you also talked about the CAFE standards having impacts on octane, but I would think about the CAFE standards is actually having a negative effect on gasoline demand and therefore having a negative effect on octane demand. But can you just sort of elaborate a little bit more on what your – on how you see the octane market over the next year or two, especially given where gasoline demand is today?
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Let me have Rich cover that and then I'll take the longer term strategy part of octane.
Richard D. Bedell - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: I think what we're seeing is as we run the lighter crudes and the crudes with the diluent you're using those light straight run materials to blend off your octane, and that's raising the overall cost of the octane. So it's a function of some of the lighter feed stocks that we're dealing with.
Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay.
Gary R. Heminger - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: And what I was saying long term is it's not just – and it's going to – octane demand going forward is going to go with the changeover of the fleet. It's a changeover of the fleet and the manufacturers are starting to put out higher compression engines. So that will gradually grow with the changeover of the fleet that you're going to need higher octane as really the base gasoline to power these – the new cars coming off the line. So it's not going to be a drop in MPG that is going to hurt. It's going to be the incremental demand from the new fleet coming in with the higher compression engines.
Operator: I will now turn the call back over to Geri Ewing for closing comments.
Geri Ewing - Marathon Petroleum Corp.: Thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or would like clarifications on topics discussed this morning, Teresa Homan and I will be available to take your calls. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating, and may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Marathon Petroleum First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Cynthia, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Geri Ewing. Ms. Ewing, you may begin.
Geri Ewing: Thank you, Cynthia. Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Webcast and Conference Call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, President and CEO; Don Templin, Executive Vice President of Supply, Transportation and Marketing; Tim Griffith, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Palmer, Senior Vice President of Supply, Distribution and Planning; Rich Bedell, Senior Vice President of Refining; Pam Beall, Senior Vice President of Corporate Planning, Government and Public Affairs; and Tony Kenney, President of Speedway. We invite you to read the safe harbor statement on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and during the question-and-answer session. These results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause the results to differ are included here as well as in our filings with the SEC. Now we turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks and highlights.
Gary R. Heminger: Thank you, Geri, and good morning to everyone. I appreciate you joining our call. We are pleased to report record first quarter results with $891 million of earnings. The outstanding results demonstrate our ability to take full advantage of favorable market conditions. MPC's extensive logistics and retail networks give us tremendous flexibility in feedstock acquisition, and the ability to optimize refining operations and product distribution throughout our marketing footprint. MPC's integrated refining system made a significant contribution to the quarter's earnings, with Refining & Marketing segment generating $1.3 billion of income during the quarter. Our refineries operated very well, and we were able to capture the strong Gulf Coast and Midwest crack spreads. First quarter results also benefited from lower maintenance activity relative to the first quarter of last year. I am particularly proud of dedicated employees at both our Catlettsburg and Galveston Bay refineries for operating our facilities safely, efficiently and without production impact during the recent work stoppage, which has ended at Catlettsburg but continues at Galveston Bay. We look forward to a successful resolution at our Galveston Bay complex in the near term. Speedway, MPC's retail segment, also performed very well during the quarter. Speedway's earnings, independent of the contribution from newly acquired retail operations, resulted in a record first quarter. Speedway continues to make excellent progress transitioning its new retail locations to the Speedway brand. As of today, we have converted more than 400 stores, including 260 completed, during the first quarter. The comprehensive transition for each store not only includes the changing of signs and canopies, but it's a complete system changeover, which includes the back office, point-of-sale and inventory control systems, as well as integration of the Speedy Rewards Loyalty Program. With the majority of the Florida stores now converted, crews have been focused on convergence in the Northeast for the past month. This rapid pace of store conversions contributes to our confidence that we will achieve the synergies and marketing enhancements we expect as we integrate this business. I am pleased to announce that MPC's board has authorized the sale of its marine logistics business to MPLX, which we expect to close in the next several months. MPC's marine transportation business is a fully integrated waterborne transportation service providing -- provider, consisting of 18 towboats, 203 tank barges and related assets supporting movement of light products, heavy oils, crude oil, renewable fuels, chemicals and feedstocks throughout the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions of the U.S. The addition of the marine business to MPLX, along with its very stable earnings and cash flow, would support our plans to accelerate the growth of partnership and provides increased asset diversity as the MPLX continues to grow rapidly. MPLX also completed a binding open season for its Cornerstone Pipeline project, which is being increased in diameter to 16 inches to provide an industry logistic solution, including opportunities to connect many Midwest refineries to production from the Utica Shale, with potential to ultimately reach Chicago area refineries and pipelines that supply diluent to Western Canada. This type of organic growth, in addition to both MPC-sponsored drop-downs and third-party acquisition opportunities, demonstrates our commitment to grow MPLX into a large-cap diversified MLP with an attractive distribution profile. In addition, MPLX declared a $0.41 per common unit cash distribution last week, which puts MPC's general partner interest -- in the highest tier of the incentive distribution rights. The long-term growth profile of MPLX provides significant value to MPC shareholders over time. We continued our commitment to capital returns in the first quarter, with $209 million of shares repurchased in addition to $136 million in dividends. In addition to the $0.50 per share dividend declared yesterday, our board also announced yesterday a 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend to be distributed to MPC shareholders on June 10. MPC has performed very well for its owner since we became an independent company in mid-2011. Our share price has increased substantially since the spinoff, and this stock split reflects our confidence in MPC's continued value creation, making our shares more affordable for a wider range of investors. The stock is expected to begin trading on a split basis on June 11. MPC's geographic footprint and large integrated platform, coupled with favorable market conditions, create a positive outlook for the business. Our large integrated platform provides us excellent access to price-advantaged domestic crude oil and low-cost natural gas. And the significant plant maintenance activity we performed in 2014 has positioned us to run at high utilization for the balance of the year. We also continue to invest in refining margin enhancement projects, with approximately $830 million of ongoing capital investment over the next 3 years for projects focused on increasing our light sweet crude and condensate processing capacity, expanding our export capabilities and increasing our distillate production. These projects are expected to generate approximately $650 million of annual EBITDA and exemplify the high-return capital projects available across our system. We are pleased with the startup of the condensate splitter at our Canton refinery in December, which is already operating above its 25,000 barrel per day design capacity. We look forward to the startup of the 35,000 barrel per day condensate splitter at Catlettsburg, which is expected to be online by the end of the quarter, positioning us very well as condensate production in this region continues to grow. Our efforts to accelerate the pace of growth at MPLX, grow our retail segment and enhance refining margins support the diversified earnings power of the business, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. With that, let me turn the call back to Tim to walk through the first quarter results and an update of our financial position. Tim?
Timothy T. Griffith: Thanks, Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings both on an absolute and per-share basis. As you can see in the green bars in the chart, our financial performance for the first quarter is quite strong. MPC had earnings of $891 million or $3.24 per diluted share during the first quarter of '15 compared to $199 million or $0.67 per diluted share in last year's first quarter. The chart on Slide 5 shows, by segment, the change in earnings from the first quarter of last year. The primary drivers for the change was the $954 million increase in Refining & Marketing and the $110 million increase in Speedway income, partially offset by higher income taxes associated with those higher earnings. Turning to Slide 6. Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $362 million in the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to a higher crack spreads in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Chicago regions as well as lower turnaround and other direct operating costs in the business. The higher blended crack spread had a positive impact on earnings of approximately $449 million. The blended crack spread was almost $2 per barrel higher at $9.69 per barrel in the first quarter compared to $7.85 per barrel in the first quarter of 2014. The $503 million year-over-year benefit in direct operating cost relate primarily to the substantially lower turnaround activity in the first quarter versus the first quarter last year. Turnaround and major maintenance costs decreased to $0.79 per barrel in the first quarter from $3.15 per barrel in the same period in 2014. The lower turnaround activity also benefited throughputs, which were 202,000 barrels per day higher than the same period last year. During the quarter, we recognized a reduction in our projected refined product inventories. The cost in these inventories was based on prices in early 2014, which were much higher than current prices. As a result, we recognized a pretax charge of approximately $30 million in connection with this LIFO inventory reduction. On Slide 7, we provide the Speedway segment earnings walk for the first quarter. Speedway's income from operations was $110 million higher in the quarter than the first quarter of 2014. Speedway's newly acquired locations are performing better than expected, contributing income of approximately $36 million to the quarter's results or approximately $68 million of EBITDA during the period. For the legacy Speedway sites, the light product gross margin was about $70 million higher in the first quarter of '15 compared to the same period last year. Overall, the Speedway segment's gasoline and distillate gross margin increased by more than $0.08 to $0.197 per gallon in the first quarter versus the same quarter last year. Merchandise gross margin was $22 million higher in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014 for those legacy locations. On a same-store basis, which excludes locations acquired within the past year, gasoline sales volumes decreased 1.2% over the same period last year. Merchandise sales in the quarter, excluding cigarettes, increased 6.2% on a same-store basis on a year-over-year basis. In April, we have seen no change in same-store gasoline volumes compared to last April. Slide 8 shows the changes for our Pipeline Transportation segment versus the first quarter of last year. Income from operations was down $5 million to $67 million in the first quarter. The decrease was primarily due to increases in various operating expenses and lower pipeline affiliate income, partially offset by higher transportation revenue in the quarter. Slide 9 presents the significant elements of changes in our cash position for the quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter was $2.1 billion. Core operating cash flow was a $1.2 billion source of cash. Working capital was essentially flat for the quarter. Long-term debt was $103 million source of cash during the quarter, which was driven by MPLX's issuance of its first public debt during the quarter. Proceeds from the upside debt offering were used to pay down its revolver as well as for the continuing growth of the partnership. We continue delivering on our commitment to balance investments in the business with return of capital to our shareholders. We repurchased 209 million of shares and paid 136 million of dividends in the first quarter. Share count at the end of the quarter was 272 million shares, reflecting share repurchase activity since the spin of about 25% of the shares outstanding. Slide 10 shows that we had $2.1 billion of cash and approximately $6.7 million of debt at the end of the quarter. With EBITDA of about $6.5 billion during the last 12 months, we continue to be in a very manageable debt position with about 1 turn of EBITDA and a debt to total capital ratio of 36%. The strong cash generation of the business, highlighted by the $1.2 billion in the first quarter, continues to provide great flexibility as we pursue this balanced approach in our capital allocation. Turning to Slide 11. We have generated $3.5 billion in cash from operations and $1.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow during the last 12 months. Over this same period, we've returned about $2.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases for approximately 1.6x our adjusted free cash flow. During the first quarter of '15, we repurchased 2 million shares for $209 million through open market repurchases. It's our intention to continue returning capital to our shareholders that is not currently needed to support the operational and investment needs of the business, and we continue to believe share repurchases are the most efficient way to do so. Slide 12 provides an updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the second quarter. We are expecting second quarter throughput volumes to be up about 93,000 barrels a day compared to second quarter 2014 and up about 75,000 versus first quarter of '15 due to less planned maintenance. Since we have no comparable 2014 data that includes the newly acquired Hess locations, we'll continue to provide Speedway outlook information by quarter for 2015. For the second quarter of '15, we project Speedway's light product sales volume will be approximately 1.5 billion gallons. With that, let me turn the call back over to Geri.
Geri Ewing: Thanks, Tim. [Operator Instructions] With that, we will now open the call to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: My first question. Gary, could you elaborate on your opening comments regarding the favorable market conditions that you referenced? And as there's always investor apprehension around early summer margin compression? Do you see any industry elements that reduce margin volatility, and more particularly, MPC's ability to perform better through those periods of seasonal weakness given willingness return to cash to shareholders and generate additional proceeds via drop-downs?
Gary R. Heminger: Sure. And Evan, if you -- first of all, on the market conditions. Yes, we had a very strong first quarter. There are turnarounds in the Gulf Coast as well in the Midwest. I think a little bit earlier in the Midwest than we have seen historically helped us. And as we've been able to illustrate, and as we've talked about with investors, we do very well when you have volatility in the marketplace and being able to capture margins because of the logistics systems that we have. However, in this first quarter when you compare against our prior quarters, we didn't have that big other net adjustment that -- I shouldn't say, adjustment but that other revenue gross margin that we have illustrated in the past because it was more of a stable quarter from crude prices and -- but there were some upticks in different wholesale margins. Going forward, though, to your question, as we look here in the second quarter, Mike Palmer can get into this in more detail than I. The -- we continue to have a very robust export market. And I think the export market is going to continue to give, not just Marathon, but the industry, a solid performance going forward because of those export markets. We are being very careful to watch inventories across the regions that we operate to keep an eye on inventories because certainly, refiners want to run full out with the crack spreads that we have seen to date. But I think the ability of us being able to reach the export market and capture the margins both on the crack spread. And the differentials that we're seeing in the marketplace are going to help us. Mike, do you want to add any color to the exports?
C. Michael Palmer: Gary, I think you addressed it pretty well. As you said, I think that the export market for us continues to be as good as it has been. We continue to grow volumes, and we don't expect that to change. So I think looking at the second quarter, the product inventories have been pretty well behaved relative to the crude inventories that have grown a lot. So right now, the second quarter looks pretty good.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Great. That's great. The domestic market looks pretty strong as well. Let me -- my second question. Can you give us an update on BP Texas City integration now it's operating? I mean, it appears you're capturing a higher percentage of your benchmark now for several quarters, and I was just wondering if you're seeing upside to your synergy since the acquisition and integration. Any comments there?
Gary R. Heminger: Rich, would you handle that, please?
Richard D. Bedell: Sure. I mean, we were in the middle of some of the integration projects of tying the 2 plants together. In fact, pipe rack is getting ready to go across between the 2 plants. But we have also been able to capture some synergies on crude and storage and utilizing the gas, oils and the cat crackers. So those items have all come to fruition. I don't know if, Mike -- if you have any other comments about -- shaking his head no. So -- but yes, we've been very pleased with the performance of Galveston Bay.
Gary R. Heminger: And the other thing that I would add to that, Evan, is in my comments, I talked about $830 million of CapEx with $650 million of EBITDA. Part of that comes from Galveston Bay. And if you recall, in the first 2 years we operated in Galveston Bay, we really were going in and doing turnarounds, trying to get the plant operationally headed towards our method of operating and some of our operational excellence metrics. So we're just now starting into the process of being able to capture some of these low-hanging fruits that we think have outstanding returns. And that's why I stated $830 million of CapEx was $650 million of EBITDA per year. Part of that is coming from Galveston Bay. And as you can recognize, those are very high returns.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ed Westlake with Crédit Suisse.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And also good to see the operating cost performance coming through as you run the operations more fully this year. 2 questions. You gave us the Cornerstone update that looks like it's moving ahead. Any updates on Sandpiper-SAX that you could share, and obviously, the proposal to reverse Capline?
Gary R. Heminger: Mike, do you want to take Sandpiper-SAX, and I'll handle Capline.
C. Michael Palmer: Yes. Okay, Gary, that sounds fine. Yes, Ed. With regard to Sandpiper and SAX, it looks very positive for us. SAX, I think, we've cleared all the permitting hurdles that we've had. Construction is going to begin this summer. We would expect to see SAX operating sometime in the fourth quarter. With regard to Sandpiper, I think as we've talked about, we did have some permitting delays in Minnesota, but in April, the administrative law judge did basically rule in favor of the certificate of need. He made a recommendation to the Minnesota PUC that the project go forward and the certificate of need be granted. So that was very, very positive. And we're waiting on that ruling that will take place within the next couple of months, and then it will go into a routing hearing as well, but things look very positive to-date.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Good to hear.
Gary R. Heminger: And Ed, on Capline, really no news from when we spoke last. As I've stated before, technically, it's not very complex to reverse a pipeline like this. It just takes time, and you have to have everything in order, so that you can continue to move barrels from the South to the North, if you were to reverse this. But as I've said -- as I've stated before, and I gave a speech at the CERA conference last week, where we had a few questions on this as well. We're still in the throes of discussing with the other owners the interest in doing so, and it's going to continue to take some time, I believe, to get all of the owners on the same page that this appears to be the right thing to do.
Operator: And our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So the first question relates to the retail business. Clearly, the integration is going very well with Speedway. And just, Gary, I want to get your thoughts on potential monetization of those retail assets. And are there ways or other structures in which you can get the full value of those assets that might not be fully reflective of the [indiscernible] right now?
Gary R. Heminger: Well, clearly, Neil, there are different structures and avenues that you can take. We have looked at those over time, and they do not make sense to us at this time to consider other types of structures. First and foremost is to get the what we now call Speedway East fully transitioned, converted over into the type of operation that Tony runs, which I'm very pleased with how the progress that they're making, both in getting the stores converted, and secondly, the inside sales results bump that we're starting to see. So those are the key things. And we started an MLP with -- back in 2012, and that has been very fruitful for starting that, and we've talked about the fuels distribution. And in order to be able to do a fuel's distribution piece inside our MLP is we're counting on these volumes to be there. So I would just say that we remain flexible, we have many options that we could play down the road if we wanted to, and we'll just continue to analyze.
Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: All right, Gary. And then second was more of a macro question here. LLS brand has looked tight here. Just from -- you have a unique vantage point on this and potential bottlenecks between Houston and St. James. Curious on your thoughts in terms of the dynamics there and what's needed to get the spread to be [indiscernible]?
Gary R. Heminger: Certainly, a very timely question, and let me have Mike address this.
C. Michael Palmer: Okay, Neil. Yes, the LLS brand differentials of late have been near parity back and forth. I think currently, we're at about $1 spread with LL under Brent. If you look at the forward market, the forward market suggests that it ought to be in the $3 kind of range, and I think that's plausible. I do think that we still have some logistical constraints moving all of the light sweet down through Houston and of course, into the St. James area. And companies are working on that continually, but there is also, I think, a misconception in the market that we have this large overhang [Audio Gap] somewhere of this light sweet shale crude. And I guess, what I would say to you is, I don't think that's really the case. I think that -- first of all, I think the refiners have been doing a very good job of keeping up with the light sweet production that we've got in this country. We're running more than we've run in the past. We're not saturated within our Gulf Coast plants on the amount of light sweet that we could run. And I also think that the producers have done a better job of clearing the market than maybe, what, many people in the trade press understand. There's a lot of this light sweet crude that is going on foreign flagships to Canada. The number is in excess of 400,000 barrels a day. We've got another 50,000 barrels a day plus that goes on Jones Act vessels into the East Coast. That number fluctuates depending upon what the ARB is. But in addition to that, we've got another roughly 50,000 barrels a day of condensate exports that are occurring under the BIS rulings. So I would argue that the producers have done a pretty good job of clearing that market. I do think that as inventories continue to build mid-continent and more of those barrels maybe go to the South, you should see the differentials widen. And then again, that $3 level makes sense to us.
Operator: And our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Gary, one of your competitors, when they pre-announce a negative earnings for the first quarter, one of the reasons cited is that, given the strike, that the one of their recently bought facility. In this case, that will be Carson because they didn't have enough people in the headquarter that have worked in that facility. And so as a result even though they've been able to run it, that there's a huge degradation or efficiency loss. Wondering that, in your case, that in Galveston Bay, did you experienced any of those kind of yield degradations or efficiency loss? In other words, that when the strike is over, should we assume we could have another improvement in the operating performance?
Gary R. Heminger: Yes, Paul. First of all, I again want to recognize our team, both in Catlettsburg and Galveston Bay, but you're specifically asking about Galveston Bay here. And a gentleman who I went down to the plant, Rich and I went together, went down and visited the plant just a few weeks ago. And I was really impressed by of our management and the ship foremen and the superintendents who were running the facility. This is something that we train. We train diligently to be prepared. And from day 1 of taking over this refinery, this was our plan to make sure we always had a trained workforce, no matter what the event that could come in and help out. So I would say, and I will let Rich talk about it in more detail, but we have set new records on a number of process units, and we have been able to get a backlog of maintenance completed and doing it all in a very, very safe manner. And Rich, do you want to go into some of the details?
Richard D. Bedell: Yes, well, I think we run both Catlettsburg and Galveston Bay, basically, ran them full out through all this time period. We have a lot of people in the refining organization within the company. We've got waiting lists of people to go in if need be. So we're well-equipped to staff Galveston Bay for as long as it takes. And like Gary said, we've run -- we set production rates. We've lowered our -- I mean, our costs are down, our rates are up. So it's been doing a great job by the people at Galveston Bay and Catlettsburg.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: My second question. Gary, do you have any insight in terms of the U.S. economy when you're looking -- even though today, you no longer do as much of the diesel sales, but when you're looking at your retail network, any insight you can provide, and also whether you would be able to give us what is the RIN cost to you in the first quarter?
Gary R. Heminger: Okay. I'll let Don or Mike handle the RIN cost. As far as the U.S. economy, we're continuing to see strong diesel demand across all the pads, kind of 1.3% to 1.5% increase in distillate demand, which I think is really a precursor to how the economy continues to move. And these are -- I think these are good increases based on last year's substantial increase as well. So the thing that is a bit of, I wouldn't say concerning. But as we tried to reconcile the numbers that come out from a number of the government agencies and other groups who put out numbers, I think the gasoline demand, I don't believe, and it's just not Marathon's numbers -- look at what other competitors are saying in their earnings calls and talking to a number of our jobbers as well. The numbers are coming out from the EIA, on gasoline demand did not quite sync with what we really believe the gasoline demand is looking like. I think they are a bit overstated. But when I look back then at Tony's merchandise sales and customers in the store, we certainly are capturing increases in merchandise sales across his entire chain, which tells us that the customers are there. And I think especially here in the first quarter, we had so many areas that were hampered by very challenging storms, both Midwest, Northeast. And then in the Southeast mid-first quarter, we had a number of stores that were closed because of weather. So I think as we get out into the second quarter, we're going to have a much better barometer on how gasoline demand is going herein. Starting off in April's business, we're up a little bit on gasoline demand so far in the month. So I'll turn it over then to Don to talk about the RINs.
Donald C. Templin: Sure. RIN expense for the first quarter was $41 million, Paul.
Operator: And our next question comes from Chi Chow with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Got a couple of quick questions on the marine business. Can you give us any sort of annual EBITDA estimates for those assets? Do you -- is the business all MPC-related? Or do you have third-party business flowing through those assets? And any comments on the tax basis on the assets?
Gary R. Heminger: Okay, Don?
Donald C. Templin: Sure, Chi. The EBITDA, annual EBITDA, is about $115 million, and that is all related to MPC activities. So essentially, we also charter out, but those assets -- those specific assets would be dedicated entirely to moving MPC volumes. So that's kind of the EBITDA perspective. What was the last question, I'm sorry, Chi?
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: The tax basis.
Donald C. Templin: The tax basis, yes. They have a relatively low tax basis, and that's not inconsistent with some of the other assets that we have, that would ultimately be dropped into MPLX. But yes, relatively low tax basis.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: But obviously, still tax efficient on the MPC level. Okay. So another question on MPLX, and I don't know if I'm doing my math right here. But I believe your guidance on EBITDA run rate coming at the tail end of '15 is $450 million. Is that correct on annualized run rate?
Gary R. Heminger: That's correct.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: And so you also have a 29% distribution growth target at least for this year. It seems like there's a mismatch on my numbers, and it suggests that you may end up with a coverage ratio that's well above industry averages. Am I doing the math right there? And is that the intention?
Timothy T. Griffith: Yes. Chi, this is Tim. I don't think your math is flawed. Ultimately, the -- our interest was to grow the partnership pretty substantially so that it had a base of earnings and the size and scale that would allow to pursue projects on its own. So it is possible that in the first couple of years, the coverage will run a little higher than our 1.1 target over that time period.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: And is there some thoughts on the pace of bringing that coverage ratio down to really drive the -- what I'm looking at on the MPC side is the GP distributions, the IDRs?
Timothy T. Griffith: Well, there will be a natural migration back to about 1.1 over the course of the next several years. But again, over these first couple, you could well see a coverage ratio that's well above. So for how we have dropped assets thus far and our anticipated growth for MPLX, we'll see an earnings growth that probably will outpace the distribution growth early on and then those will sort of converge over time.
Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay. Okay, great. And maybe just one final question. Any update on the Garyville hydrocracker decision?
Gary R. Heminger: We still would -- we pretty much have finished all the front-end engineering, and we won't look at this again until the fourth quarter. We are working on the budgets for next year and the years following. And Chi, as you can recognize it, it's all -- is going to be revolve around where we see the overall commodity price going over the next number of years.
Operator: And our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.
Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: Could we just go back to your direct operating cost for a little bit more analysis, if that's okay? On Slide 6, you show that year-over-year, it's about half of the uplift that you got from refining earnings. I just was wondering, can you break out a little bit how much of that was just the volume increase that we saw in that period and whether or not you can quantify some of the other issues? And I'm thinking, I guess, of fuel cost as helping against any other impacts there may have been.
Gary R. Heminger: Tim, you want to handle that?
Timothy T. Griffith: Sure. Paul, the -- I think the biggest piece of that $503 million that we show in direct operating costs were just, frankly, the absence of a lot of the turnaround costs that were recorded in the first quarter of last year on the year-over-year walk. The volume impact on that, we'll have to come back to you on specifically, but that -- by far, the biggest driver there was just the absence of turnaround activity relative to first quarter last year.
Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: Yes, I get that. And so obviously, there's a double cost that you were running less with the additional cost, and that would be the vast majority of the uplift. I was wondering, is there anything to add on? I guess, particularly, your sensitivity to natural gas prices, which I guess didn't change a whole lot, but also where the lower oil prices also would boost your -- or rather reduce your operating expenses?
Gary R. Heminger: Paul, the operating energy costs were down in Q5 -- or Q1 '15 about $80 million.
Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: Okay. And then just totally separately the buyback, I guess, it's our forecast and it's our miss, but it was behind what we were thinking. Could you just talk a bit about how you're looking at the attractiveness of buying in more stock, the pace at which you're doing that and whether or not it's a competition against, for example, higher CapEx?
Gary R. Heminger: Sure, Paul. I think our primary drivers around how we're viewing that is, again, how we're situated on a core liquidity perspective as sort of our first prime mover. Core liquidity, in the environment of lower prices, that actually declines to some extent, but again, we'll continue to manage the cash position of the corporation in accordance with the needs. The slightly slower pace in first quarter is not reflective of any change in approach or belief that the shares were appropriately valued. Or otherwise, we still think the shares are substantially undervalued. And again, we'll continue to assess our capital and cash situation as we go and make adjustments. Share repurchase certainly affords us the best lever to make those adjustments, and we'll continue to use it as such.
Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: I think your debt came down a bit in the quarter, but I assume that you're not -- you're very much in the range of where you want the debt ratios?
Gary R. Heminger: Yes. I mean, the debt was, at a static level, unchanged, but with the role of LTM EBITDA, we actually had more earnings. So the debt-to-EBITDA decline really as a result of earnings growth as opposed to debt reduction. But yes, Paul, we're very much in the comfort zone with regard to where we think we need to be on maintaining an investment-grade profile, and we'll continue to manage it that way.
Operator: And our next question comes from Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI.
Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI, Research Division: Gary, just to clarify your comments on Galveston Bay, it sounds like not only has the work stoppage not led to a reduction in output, but that production and efficiency have been pretty resilient and may have increased during the work stoppage. Is that the correct way to think about that situation?
Gary R. Heminger: Yes, it is, Doug.
Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI, Research Division: Okay. And then also, global oil demand growth has been surprisingly strong this year, and you made some comments a few minutes ago about export markets. And I just wanted to see if we can get some more color on the regional demand trends that the company is seeing and whether or not there is any highlights or drivers in the improvement that we're seeing that you may -- that you think may be at work outside of the United States.
Gary R. Heminger: Yes. In fact, if you look at some of the announcements yesterday about how Saudi Aramco is going to really increase their supply efforts, and I think try to increase the market share into the Asian market, namely China. There are big questions about the Yanbu refinery coming up in Jubail soon to be operating, if that's going to affect the U.S. market. I was over there just a few weeks ago, and it's clear to me that the output from those refineries is going to head east. They have the best economics because they have the best transportation costs to go east with that product, and I think that's directionally where it is expected to go. And even though China has global markets, when you look at the global markets and specifically at China, that demand within their economy has fallen a bit. It's still up year-on-year, and I would -- we would love to have those types of increases here in the U.S. of continued to -- how they are achieving growth in their markets. So if you go back to the crude side though, and I've said this on the call we had for the fourth quarter and in several energy conferences, you still need and I think, investors need to look at where the crude is moving in the world. We're continuing to see very strong markets for imports of crude into the U.S. You're seeing more of the medium sours coming in. And those who have the equipment to be able to run medium sour, you look at our numbers for this quarter, we ran about 56% medium sour. That's up from where we've been. And the reason being, it's every day we're buying the best barrel in the marketplace, and medium sours certainly have been a very, very attractive barrel for us. When it comes back to say that there's still, I think -- I know Marathon, I don't know about all the other refiners, but it would suggest there's still -- we have a lot of opportunity to run other light sweet crudes if they are marketed competitively with these medium sours. And therefore, these medium sours are coming in from foreign locations. So what that tells you is we believe we're going to continue to see inventory growing in Cushing, in PADD III. And as inventory continues to grow, as you can see the contango market out there, we're pretty close, I think, to the top end of operational capacity, Doug, in the tanks and Cushing and some other markets. And why I say operational capacity is, as a refiner, we want to be very careful that we don't degradate a type of crude that we're buying, that ends up getting blended in with other crudes if you are sharing tankage. So we're pretty close to, I would say, to the high end of operating capacity. And I think then from watch foreign imports, watch the inventory growth, and I still believe that you're going to see here in the second quarter, spreads start to widen out.
Operator: And our next question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: First question is just on the midstream side. Given your desire to be a diversified MLP in the long term, how do you think about the opportunity for M&A at this stage? And if we think about the potential for slowing crude oil production growth, could that accelerate the M&A in this space or just -- how are you thinking about this over the next couple of years?
Gary R. Heminger: All right. Pam, you want to take that?
Pamela K. M. Beall: Sure, happy to do that. Well, I guess, first, I would say, when we saw the crude prices fall, we thought that, that could potentially put more midstream assets on the market that may be captive to some producers. We saw -- we've seen a little bit of that, but not a lot. And I think what we have seen is despite the fact that crude commodity prices have been volatile and crude prices have declined, there's a lot of capital out there to help support producers and help support midstream companies that may be more exposed to commodity prices. So I would -- probably a few exceptions, I wouldn't say that we are seeing any distressed selling in the marketplace today from that standpoint, but we continue to evaluate opportunities, M&A, acquisitions, opportunities, in addition to the drop-downs from MPC. We're looking across the spectrum, as I've said before. Those opportunities that would benefit both MPC and MPLX will always rise to the top of our interest list, but there certainly are a lot of different avenues that we could pursue to grow MPLX through acquisition, and we've got a team of people that are very actively evaluating a lot of opportunities.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And as you evaluate the M&A opportunities, would you likely use MPC as a source of funding? Or do you feel like a MPLX is large enough at this point to do sizable M&A as you think about the tradeoff between drops and M&A?
Pamela K. M. Beall: Well, I think each opportunity really will be fact and circumstance-based. It's hard to make that general comment. Of course, one of the reasons we are committed to accelerating the growth of MPLX is to position it so that it could take on larger opportunities directly.
Gary R. Heminger: That's what's good, Phil, is that we have the optionalities and the flexibility to go either way. We aren't beholden to -- like some who are not -- maybe do not have the balance sheet to be able to do certain acquisitions. We have that flexibility. If you go back to the color I just answered on Doug's question, if there is -- if we look at wider spreads going forward into the second quarter, there could be pressure as we go out into the second, third quarter. We'll see where our crude prices go, but there could be some further pressure that may open up the M&A activity a little more.
Pamela K. M. Beall: A lot of private equity out there chasing opportunities.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Understood. On the retail side, with respect to the synergy capture it has, Gary, maybe, you could just talk a little bit about where you stand today and what you think the biggest incremental source of upside could be as you look ahead with where you're at in the process?
Gary R. Heminger: Sure, Phil. And we have Tony on the line who's operating these stores every day. And so let me have Tony handle that.
Anthony R. Kenney: Thanks, Gary. As commented earlier, we're very pleased with the progress we're making on the conversions to the Speedway brand. And along with that includes the implementation of our merchandise programs inside the stores, which is a real source of synergies down the road. To date in 2015, we feel very good on the progress that we're making. We're going through the best practices of both companies that we committed to. And that is in and of itself is a good source of the synergies that we're experiencing, primarily, right now on the expense side of the business. So as we continue to go forward, we're going to start to realize some marketing efficiencies as well. So on a full year basis, in 2015, we're right on plan with where we expect to be on the synergy capture in 2015.
Operator: And our next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Sort of staying right there, I was wondering if you could give an update for the Hess stores that have been converted. Has there been any noticeable loss of customers? Or going the other way, have you been able to pull in more customers from other areas in Florida?
Anthony R. Kenney: Yes, I'll take that. The benefit that we have with the conversion is our loyalty program. So -- and these are the markets, Florida, in particular, as we move into the Northeast. It really not had a strong presence on a retail loyalty program. So what we're getting is a lot of good interest in customers signing up for our loyalty program, which is probably the best benchmark we have right now in terms of how we're attracting new customers. There's a lot of dynamics in play. Retail price, as the gasoline prices come down, I think that's driving traffic as well. So we're very careful on how we're analyzing that, and we've only got a little over -- we did the deal, it's 7 months old, and the conversions in Florida are probably 3 to 5 months old. So we have limited data at this point, but we're getting some very, very good feedback from our customers in terms of the loyalty and the offers that we have once we convert to the Speedway brand.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. And then thinking about SAX, I was wondering if you could go through maybe the ways in which SAX is going to change the crude sourcing in the Midwest, or is it really more providing optionality?
Gary R. Heminger: Mike?
C. Michael Palmer: Yes, Gary. Yes, Brad, it's going to have a significant impact for us. As you know, that pipeline runs from Enbridge's system in South Chicago down to Putoco, which is our hub. And today, if you look at our flexibility of bringing in either the Bakken crude or other Canadian crude, we pretty much limited that out with the logistical capability that we have today. And SAX, even before Sandpiper is completed, is going to give us that flexibility to increase the amount of crude that comes in from both of those sources. So it's a big deal for us. It's going to help the bottom line, certainly.
Operator: And our next question comes from Doug Leggate, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Gary, I don't know if I picked up on this earlier, but back to Paul Sankey's question on gas sensitivity. I was looking back at the operating cost question. I was looking back at the presentations from the last year and the Q1 delta last year was a negative 605 versus the prior first quarter 2013, and of course, gas was very strong last year. And this year, you had, obviously, had a big operating cost benefit of over $500 million. So I don't know if I picked it up wrong, but can you just walk through again what your gas sensitivity is, because obviously if gas prices remain low, those cost benefits are, probably, going to be quite sticky, I'm guessing?
Gary R. Heminger: Okay. Let me turn this over to Don or Rich. I don't have any of those numbers with me here.
Richard D. Bedell: Sure, Doug. Our gas sensitivity -- so $1 change in the natural gas prices is around $140 million after-tax on an annual basis. And with respect to the first quarter of '15 versus the first quarter of '14, there was about an $80 million benefit in the other manufacturing cost line related to the lower energy costs.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. I guess I don't want to labor -- maybe I can take it offline, but what I'm really kind of looking at is the full-year cost hit last year, looked year-over-year was about $913 million according to the presentation. So I'm trying to understand what caused the cost uplift last year because it's an absolute number, not a unit number obviously, and what's reversed to come back out in the first quarter is what I'm trying to understand, see how sustainable it is.
Gary R. Heminger: I mean, which -- I'm sorry, which quarter are you comparing...
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: For the first quarter year-over-year, you had a little over $500 million of benefit in the presentation. But the full year, last year, the direct operating cost negative impact was $913 million, most of which was in the first quarter, which is when gas prices were $5. So I'm trying to understand what the moving parts are. Like I say maybe I need to take it off-line, but what reversed out that gave you $913 million negative last year that gave you a $500 million positive in the first quarter, I guess, is where I'm getting at. I don't know if that's complicating the question too much.
Richard D. Bedell: The big piece of it last year, I think, was all the heavy turnaround activity that we had, Doug. So we can walk through individual components, but last year, you will recall, we had very, very heavy turnaround activity, which was a detriment to that quarter. And this quarter really is the absence of all of that turnaround activity.
Gary R. Heminger: And Doug, it's both cost and volume this quarter.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Right. You do not put through the maintenance, through CapEx, is that right? You expense it?
Gary R. Heminger: That's correct. Maintenance goes through expense, not CapEx.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. So that probably explains the bulk of it. Okay, that's really helpful. My follow-up, Gary, is really more of a micro question. Again, it's -- we're looking at you guys saying you can raise your utilization by 6% or so, and obviously, the industry as a whole has been running pretty hard. But we're starting off with very, very high gasoline inventories, I guess, for the U.S. And what I'm kind of thinking, well, I guess, I'm somewhat concerned about is when we looked at what happened at the end of last year, gasoline margins sunk on very, very high gasoline production. So I'm just kind of curious, how do you see the macro playing out? Obviously, your market is a big beneficiary of imports from other regions. So given those robust gasoline inventories, what's your prognosis on how you see things playing out this -- in this higher utilization environment?
Gary R. Heminger: Well, as I stated, I think it was on the first question. Something that we're watching very carefully. The inventories and the product exports still within the industry are much more skewed to distillate then to gasoline. However, gasoline is picking up namely to Latin America countries. And we see that, that is going to continue. But you're right, and that's why, when I stated earlier, also, to keep an eye on the EIA numbers that come out and what demand appears to be. We're not seeing, and I still think it comes down to being able to reconcile all the exports back to -- within the government numbers within their model. So it -- you make a good point, something that we manage and we watch every day, is to watch how the inventories continue to move. The key is going to be clearing out all the bad weather we had in the first quarter, and hopefully, getting down to a clean second quarter, where we really can measure what the gasoline demand is across the U.S. And once I have those optics, obviously, I'm going to be able to answer your question better, but we're watching inventories very, very carefully. But also, I'm seeing very significant growth in the export market.
Operator: And your next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Forgo.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I guess, I'd like to follow up a little bit on the light sweet crude. Obviously, you discussed a lot of the pipeline issues and sort of the storage issues. Previously, I think you mentioned as much as 65% of the volumes that you have at hand, could be light sweet crude. Can you let us know what we need to see? Is it the wider differential? Is it more pipeline access in order to get to those volumes?
Gary R. Heminger: Mike?
C. Michael Palmer: Yes, Roger. I think, what we need to see is we need to see differentials, say, versus medium sour that are more compelling than what they've been. When we're constantly in the market, it is every day trying to optimize our crude slates, and we do that on a day-to-day basis with domestic barrels. So we have this option to buy light sweet crude. We have this option to buy medium sour crude, for example, at Garyville. And so we're constantly looking at the differentials to see which makes a higher margin. And honestly, between the light sweet crude that so many think has this huge overhang in the market. And therefore, you think it would be priced so that it was compelling to bring in, that's just simply not the case. We go back and forth between buying the medium sours versus the light sweet. So at some point, if the production rises enough and the producers don't clear it to another market, then we would see numbers that would allow us to run higher volumes of light sweet.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. But doesn't that, by itself, sort of create the pressure for the export call? In other words, I get that you don't want to run the crude unless it's economically profitable, but if you have a differential at $7 or even, say, $10, that puts more pressure kind of within the system to call for the export volumes. So do you think it's a number closer to, as you mentioned, with LLS, $3? Or is it something that we need to see in a $5 to $7 range in order to clear the market if we have more crude on the market from the lower 48 producers?
C. Michael Palmer: Well, I think what we tend to look at, again, is the differential of LLS versus our other alternatives. So of late, I think, again, when I talk about the competition with the medium sours, I mean, we've been seeing a differential between LLS and Mars, it's been in the $3 range, $3 to $4. So again, if that differential came into something less, then we would run more -- we would try and run more light sweet at those more economic numbers. But that's primarily what we look at.
Geri Ewing: Cynthia, with that, we'll close the question-and-answer. I want to thank everyone for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Should you have additional questions or, like, clarification on the topics we have discussed this morning, Teresa Homan and I will be available to take your calls.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2014 Marathon Petroleum Earnings Call. My name is Brandon and I'll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer-session. Please note that this conference is being recorded and I will now turn it over to Mr. Tim Griffith. You may begin, sir.
Timothy T. Griffith: Okay, thank you, Brandon. Good morning and welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Webcast and Conference Call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, President and CEO; Don Templin, Senior Vice President and CFO; Mike Palmer, Senior Vice President of Supply, Distribution and Planning; Rich Bedell, Senior Vice President of Refining, Pam Beall, Senior Vice President of Corporate Planning and Government and Public Affairs; and Tony Kenney, President of Speedway. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well, as in our filings with the SEC. With that, I'll be happy to turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks and highlights. Gary.
Gary R. Heminger: Thank you, Tim, and good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call. We are pleased to report strong results for the quarter and full-year of $798 million of earnings in the fourth quarter and $2.5 billion or earnings for the full-year. MPC completed another milestone year. Our Refining & Marketing segment achieved income from operations of $3.6 billion for the year while executing the largest series of planned refinery maintenance projects in the company's history. Our achievements such as acquisition of Hess' retail operations and the acceleration of MPLX growth underscore our commitment to grow higher-value, stable cash flow segments of the business while optimizing our refining system for strong returns. While crude oil prices fell and crack spreads narrowed during the fourth quarter, we experienced strong product price realizations at both the wholesale and retail level. Speedway reported record earnings of $273 million for the quarter, including the newly acquired Hess locations and posted what would have been recording earnings for just the legacy Speedway locations. Conversions of these new locations and the deployment of Speedway's highly successful merchandise model are progressing well. As of January 31, 134 of the 1,245 acquired stores have been converted. We are taking the opportunity to evaluate ways to leverage existing best practices of both business models and implementing those practices across the entire Speedway platform. The earnings power of this combined business will be tremendous, and we are well positioned to execute our strategy to grow the EBITDA of this business to over $1 billion. MPC completed its third and largest dropdown to MPLX during the fourth quarter of 2014, which increased MPLX's interest in Pipeline Holdings to 99.5%. This dropdown was an important first step in our strategy to substantially accelerate the growth of MPLX. As the sponsor of MPLX, MPC intends to maintain a growing reserve of MLP eligible assets. That growth in reserves will be accomplished through MPC's continued focus of midstream investments and both entities' participation and energy infrastructure build-out that continues in North America. MPC continued to deliver peer-leading capital returns to its shareholders. MPC returned a total of $2.7 billion of capital to shareholders in 2014, $820 million which occurred in the fourth quarter. We have repurchased approximately 25% of the shares that were outstanding when we became a standalone company. MPC remains focused on the long-term value proposition for our investors. We also announced this morning our 2015 investment plan of $2.5 billion, which includes $1.3 billion for the refining and marketing segment, $452 million for the Speedway segment, and $659 million for the pipeline transportation segment. With respect to the residual oil upgrader expansion project at the Garyville refinery, we believe this project has great potential returns, but we are deferring our final investment decision as we further evaluate the implications of current market conditions on the project. MPC's 2015 capital plan reflects our commitment to further develop a stable cash flow, generate excitements of our business while enhancing refining margins. This will be done by growing our midstream assets, integrating the Hess retail operations into our Speedway business, and continuing to implement the margin enhancement projects in refining, including synergistic projects at our Galveston Bay refinery, which we acquired in 2013. Before I turn it over to Don, I also want to take this opportunity to remind investors that as a backdrop of the volatile crude price environment, we experienced over the last six months, we continue to be enthusiastic about the prospects for this business. Our flexible refining system, large retail presence, and extensive logistics network allowed us to successfully adapt to changing production and supply patterns. This was a year where our results clearly demonstrate the value of our integrated downstream system. Looking ahead, I think it is important to continue to pay close attention to crude oil inventory in PADD III and Cushing. We believe as those inventory levels continue to rise, it will have a favorable impact on crude differentials in the coming months. Fundamentally, ours is a spread business. We are well positioned to drive sustainable earnings in a variety of crude price environments, and we continue to believe that our best days are in front of us. With that, let me ask Don to review our financial performance for the quarter and provide some more detailed commentary on our 2015 capital plan.
Donald C. Templin: Thanks Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings both on an absolute and per share basis. Our financial performance for both the fourth quarter and full-year 2014 was strong. MPC had earnings of $798 million or $2.86 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $626 million or $2.07 per diluted share in last year's fourth quarter. For the full-year 2014, our earnings were over $2.5 billion, $400 million improvement over the $2.1 billion of earnings in 2013. Earnings per diluted share were $8.78 for the full-year 2014 compared to $6.64 for 2013. The chart on slide 5 shows by segment the change in earnings from the fourth quarter of 2013 to the fourth quarter of 2014. Speedway segment income was a major driver for our year-over-year increase, which I'll discuss in a minute. The Refining & Marketing segment income also contributed to the increase in overall earnings in the quarter. Turning to slide 6, Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was just over $1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with $971 million in the fourth quarter last year. The increase from 2013 was primarily due to higher product price realizations and a favorable LIFO inventory accounting effect, partially offset by narrower sweet/sour crude oil differentials and a lower LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread. The lower blended crack spread had a negative impact on earnings of approximately $197 million. The blended crack spread was $5.43 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $6.82 per barrel last year. The narrower sweet/sour crude oil differential had a negative impact on earnings of approximately $240 million versus the fourth quarter of 2013. There were three primary contributors to the $494 million increase in other gross margin. First, we recognized the build in our crude oil and refined products inventories in the 2014 fourth quarter when compared to year end 2013. For purposes of our annual LIFO inventory costing, this increase in inventory is recorded based on pricing at the beginning of 2014 which was substantially higher than fourth quarter prices. As a result, Refining & Marketing segment income for the quarter reflects the favorable effect of approximately $240 million. Comparing the fourth quarter of 2014 to 2013, the LIFO impact was approximately $190 million, which is included in the $494 million increase in other gross margin shown here. Second, we experienced strong product price realizations. Generally, as crude prices decline, our wholesale brand and Speedway prices tend to fall at a slower rate leading to some margin expansion. For the wholesale and brand businesses, this margin impact is reflected in our Refining & Marketing segment and represents about two thirds of the non-LIFO change. Finally, our actual crude and feedstock acquisition costs compared to the market indicators were more favorable during the fourth quarter 2014 as compared to the fourth quarter 2013. Segment income for the quarter was also impacted by the reinstatement of the biodiesel blenders credit on December 2014, retroactive to the beginning of the year. Slide 7 provides the drivers for the change in Refining & Marketing segment income on a year-over-year basis. Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was $3.6 billion for the full-year 2014 compared with $3.2 billion in 2013. The LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread had $761 million favorable impact on earnings. Both the sweet/sour and the LLS to WTI crude oil differentials narrowed in 2014 compared to 2013 resulting in negative impact to earnings of approximately $489 million and $695 million respectively. All of the gross margin indicators utilize spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and products sold. Differences in our actual product price relations, mix and crude costs quarter-to-quarter are reflected in the other gross margin column. Given the substantial $1.7 billion impact of the items, let me make a few comments about these year-over-year differences. The majority of the year-over-year change was attributable to product price realizations which were substantially more favorable in 2014 than they were in 2013. The impact of falling crude oil prices on wholesale and brand margins had a positive impact in the latter part of the year. In addition, second and third quarter 2013 product price relations compared to spot market values were negatively impacted by the effects of RINs further driving the year-over-year change. The LIFO accounting effect that I described earlier also impacts the 2014 full-year earnings. And finally our actual crude and feedstock acquisition costs compared to the market indicators were more favorable during 2014 as compared to 2013. Moving to operating costs, direct operating expenses were $913 million higher in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to higher turnaround expenses. As Gary highlighted, 2014 included the largest series of planned refinery maintenance projects in the company's history. On slide 8 we provide the Speedway segment earnings walk [ph] for both the fourth quarter and full-year. Speedway's income from operations was $273 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with 83 million last year. This is the first quarter with the results for the acquired Hess sites. The Hess locations contributed approximately $118 million to the segment's fourth quarter income. For the legacy Speedway sites the light product gross margin was about $67 million higher in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to last year. Overall, the Speedway segment's gasoline and distillate gross margin increased by more than $0.11 per gallon from fourth quarter 2013 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Speedway's merchandise margin in the legacy locations was $20 million higher in the fourth quarter 2014 compared to fourth quarter 2013. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes increased 0.3% and merchandise sales excluding cigarettes increased 5.4% in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with last year. In January 2015 we've seen a slight decrease in demand with an approximately 0.8% decrease in the same-store gasoline sales volumes versus the prior year. Speedway's income from operations for full-year 2014 was $544 million compared with $375 million in 2013. The Hess locations contributed approximately $113 million of income in 2014. For the legacy speedway sites like product gross margins increased $50 million and merchandise margins increased $55 million year-over-year. For the Speedway site segment gasoline and distillates gross margins averaged $17.75 per gallon in 2014 compared to $14.4 per gallon in 2013. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes decreased 0.7% in 2014 and increased 0.5% in 2013. Partially offsetting the increases in Speedway income were higher operating expenses primarily attributed to an increase in the number of stores. Slide 9 provides the components of Speedway's fourth quarter segment income on an absolute basis. The like product margin for the legacy Speedway and Hess locations were $176 million and $197 million respectively. The legacy Speedway and Hess locations contributed $225 million and $99 million in merchandise margin respectively. Operating and other net expenses were $424 million for the quarter. Slide 10 shows fourth quarter and full-year changes for our Pipeline Transportation segment. Income from operations was $58 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with $47 million last year. Income from operations was $280 million for the full-year 2014 compared with $210 million for the full-year 2013. The increases for both the quarter and full-year were primarily attributable to higher transportation revenue and pipeline affiliate income partially offset by higher operating expenses associated with pipeline maintenance activities. The increase in transportation revenue for the quarter and year were attributable to higher average pipeline tariff rates and an increase in the revenue recognized for volume deficiency credits in 2014. Slide 11 presents the significant drivers of changes in our cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2014. At December 31, our cash balance was $1.5 billion. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was $1.1 billion source of cash. The $670 million use of working capital noted on the slide primarily relates to $1.9 billion decrease in accounts payable partially offset by $1.2 billion decrease in accounts receivable. Decreases in accounts payable and accounts receivable were primarily due to the significant drop in crude oil and refined product prices during the quarter. Long-term debt was $371 million source of cash during the quarter which was driven by MPLXs borrowings to help finance its acquisition of an additional 30.5% interest in Pipeline Holdings in December. As Gary highlighted we continue delivering on our commitment to balance investments of the business with return of capital to our shareholders. We repurchased $682 million of shares and paid $138 million of dividends in the fourth quarter demonstrating this commitment to regular returns of capital. MPLX also had a public equity issuance during the fourth quarter with net proceeds of $221 million. That makes up the most significant portion of the other column. Slide 12 shows that at the end of the fourth quarter we had $1.5 billion of cash and approximately $6.6 billion of debt. With EBITDA of about $5.4 billion during the last 12 months we continue to be in a very manageable debt position with debt-to-EBITDA 1.2 times and a debt-to-total capital ratio of 37%. Turning to slide 13, during the last 12 months we generated $3.1 billion in cash from operations and $1 billion of free cash flow excluding the Hess retail acquisition. Over this period we returned about $2.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases or approximately 2.7 times our adjusted free cash flow. During the fourth quarter of 2014 we purchased approximately 7 million shares for $682 million through open market repurchases. It is our intention to continue returning capital to our shareholder s that is not currently needed to support the operational and investment needs of the business and we continue to believe that share repurchases are the most efficient way to do so. Slide 14 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the first quarter of 2015. We are expecting first quarter throughput volumes to be up compared to first quarter 2014 due to less planned maintenance. Since we have no comparable 2014 data that includes the newly acquired Hess locations we plan to provide Speedway outlook information by quarter for 2015. For the first quarter 2015 we project Speedway's light product sales volume will be approximately 1.4 billion gallons. Slide 15 provides a breakdown by segment of our 2014 capital expenditures and investments excluding the acquisition of the Hess retail operations along with our approved capital planned for 2015. Slide 16 lists the significant capital projects that we will be working on in 2015 and beyond. Our capital investment plan is focused on growing our midstream business, integrating the Hess retail operations into our Speedway system and pursuing margin enhancing projects at our refineries including further implementing synergistic projects at our Galveston Bay refinery. This slide also shows the percentage of our 2015 capital plan allocated to the various operations of our business. As you can see 35% of our capital is being allocated to investments in midstream assets, 18% to Speedway and 15% to margin enhancing refining projects. The remainder is primarily attributable to refinery sustaining capital. We believe this allocation of capital is consistent with our commitment to further develop a stable cash flow generating segments of our business while also enhancing refining margins. Now, I will turn the call back to Tim Griffith.
Timothy T. Griffith: Thanks Don. As we are going to poll for your questions we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. You may re-prompt for additional questions as time permits. With that Brandon, we are prepared to open up the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you sir, and we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] and from Morgan Stanley we have Evan Calio on the line. Please go ahead.
Evan Calio: Good morning guys, very strong results today. My first question is on contango. I know you hedged 75% of your runs with the TI contract. You know, can you remind us how you benefit in a contango TI market and any thoughts on contango as you move into turnarounds with the growing and imbalanced crude market and storage limitations and even how steeper contango may relate to a wider TI Brent spread?
C. Michael Palmer: Hi Evan, this is C. Michael Palmer.
Evan Calio: Hi Mike.
C. Michael Palmer: Yeah, as you point out, not only are we able to lock in that front month contango with our hedging strategies, but in terms of the purchase strategy for domestic crude, we also lock in that front month contango, so we are the beneficiary of that, you know, cheaper front month. With regard to the rest of your question, what was next?
Evan Calio: Yeah, just more just as an outlook item of kind of what do you think of the structure on the curve as we move into peak U.S. turnarounds with the growing imbalance market and even how storage limitations can factor into return of some more favorable U.S. pricing?
C. Michael Palmer: Well you know, that's the $64,000 question in my mind and everyone's mind is how long does this very weak market last. You know, I think to the extent that we see oversupply in the market, which certainly appears to be with us during the first half of the year, you'd believe the steep contango should be with us. As things come back more in the balance in the second half of the year, then I would guess that the contango would narrow.
Evan Calio: Great and then a second question I have is really on the wholesale fuel distribution segment. I know that it increased following the Hess transaction. It's included within the other gross margin in your R&M operations, and you included I think $600 million of MLP -able EBITDA largely related to that fuel distribution business. Can you help us with what wholesale added in the fourth quarter, and can it really, how you define that wholesale margin at least as for an internal transfer basis?
Donald C. Templin: Well, I guess Evan, this is Don. We don't typically comment on sort of individual components of the business. I guess when I was explaining the results for the quarter, in that other gross margin caption about two-thirds of the differential from last year's fourth quarter was related to, you know, product price realizations, and that's really a function of you know, wholesale and brand. So that to me is a demonstration if you will of sort of the earnings power of that part of the business, but in terms of the - when we had come up with the $600 million of fuels distribution that could potentially be MLP –able, that was largely a function of our wholesale and BRENT volumes of 20 billion gallons times, you know we just used a $0.03 marker to get you 20 billion gallons times $0.03 cents to the $600 million.
Evan Calio: Okay, so a portion of that, the step up quarter-to-quarter is ongoing and a portion of that profitability relates to market conditions for both product and other feedstock. So, I guess, I am trying to distill, which would ultimately at least how we model to drive higher capture rate going forward. So, I am just trying to find what that step change was given the Hess assets within your portfolio, and I guess we can maybe use the volumetric and the margin that you provided.
Donald C. Templin: I think that's the best way to do it Evan.
Evan Calio: Great, I appreciate it.
Operator: From Credit Suisse we have Ed Westlake on line. Please go ahead.
Ed Westlake: Yes, good morning and I guess solid is an underestimation, congratulations. Just on the same follow-on from Evan's question, where are you in terms of decision making or process in terms of being able to perhaps monetize some of that sort of wholesale EBITDA stream into the MLP?
Gary R. Heminger: Ed, this is Gary. As we said the last November, when we rolled out the acceleration, the fuels distribution was just a piece of the backlog, if you will of MLP eligible assets and we are in the process of going to a private letter ruling on the fuels distribution just to confirm what our thoughts are that this will all be eligible earnings, and we are very confident that it will, but there are certain steps you have to take. We would expect as we go through and look at future opportunities for MPLX, the fuels distribution more than likely is going to have to follow with the terminals as we go into that business, so we have plenty of run room where we need to instead of dropping in the fuels distribution, but we are carefully working on it and we expect to have that completed, that private letter ruling completed this year.
Ed Westlake: And then sticking with the MLP, obviously you mentioned that you’ve got the binding open season in the first quarter for Cornerstone and there is the permitting issues on Sandpiper and SAX, but maybe just a general comments in terms of the response of potential shippers given obviously the collapse in oil prices in terms of your ability to execute?
Gary R. Heminger: Well, it is very interesting Ed, if you look at the rig count Mike Palmer was just showing with me this morning. If you looked at the rig counts in the Bakken, Niobrara, Eagle Ford, and [indiscernible] rig counts have declined versus the Utica. The Utica's rig counts are fairly unchanged at this point in time and being one of the larger purchasers of the output of Utica, we continue to see growth in that volume. So we continue to still be confident in our open season, and the binding open season portion, and I think that truly reflects the change in the rig count.
Ed Westlake: Right, and comments on Sandpiper and SAX?
Gary R. Heminger: Sandpiper and SAX we unfortunately have the delay in the ride away permits. They're moving along well. They have just completed some testimony last week on the ride away business side that continues to move along well. So it's just the delay in the permitting is why we're deferring the capital spend, but we expect both of them to be moving along once they are ride away and this typical need is completed by the end of this year.
Ed Westlake: Great, thanks very much.
Gary R. Heminger: You're welcome Ed. Thank you.
Operator: From JP Morgan we have Phil Gresh on line. Please go ahead.
Phil Gresh: Hi, good morning.
Gary R. Heminger: Good morning.
Phil Gresh: First question is just in terms of the Garyville hydrocracker project, was just kind of wondering where things stand in terms of what contribution if any you are seeing? And just in general, your distillate production in the Gulf Coast in the fourth quarter was not up as much on a year-over-year basis as the third quarter, so just curious if you could kind of put those two things together and talk about just any color you have on the distillate fundamentals in the Gulf Coast, some of your peers have talked about weaker export markets recently?
Gary R. Heminger: Right, well, first of all on the Garyville ROUX project as we said in our earnings call this morning and in our capital plan that was released is that we are going to differ the final investment decision on the Garyville ROUX due to the very volatile crude markets and the crude markets tend to relay into the spreads that you will look between ultra low sulfur diesel and the heavy resid. So we are going to delay that for the time being, but still believe it is an outstanding project and one that has great potential for us, but at this point in time we will delay and come back and look at it at a later date. On the distillate, I will turn that over to Rich.
Richard D. Bedell: But Phil, were you asking about the hydrocracker expansion we did at Garyville last year?
Phil Gresh: Yes, I just kind of, you know, you had expected contribution from an EBITDA basis, so just kind of curious to get a snapshot on where you're at with that and I just noticed that the distillate production wasn't up quite as much in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis, so just kind of wondering you know, what's going on behind the scenes there?
Richard D. Bedell: Well, the Garyville distillate, or hydrocrack, or not distillate hydrocrack. Hydrocrack expansion that was taken from 95,000 to 110,000 and it is doing all of that and has been for most of the year. I think anything you see in distillate in the fourth quarter we had some hydrotreaters down and some turnaround activities at Galveston Bay and Garyville on catalyst changes, so that's probably what you're seeing there.
Phil Gresh: Got it.
Donald C. Templin: And Phil, this is Don. I think you had asked about sort of export. We averaged about 282,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter of exports and about two-thirds of that was distillate and a third of that was gasoline. So we continue to see strong markets in terms of our ability to place export products both gasoline and distillate.
Phil Gresh: Got it. Okay. Follow-up question just on the fundamentals as we look to the second half of the year, a comment was made just you know, when we kind of get past the supply situation, just wondering how you are thinking about crude differentials in that world, you know, you have a long-term view of $7 to top $12 spreads for Brent- WTI for example, but you know, also just worrying about Brent LLS and how you think about that in the world where crude production growth could actually maybe turn negative?
C. Michael Palmer: Well, you know Phil, I guess the – this is Mike Palmer. I guess the thing that we've been focused on of late is how quickly that Brent-WTI spread has moved out from something on the order of $1 out to $5 in that range and I think that's related to something that we've talked about before and that's just the inventories, they are building up on the U.S. Gulf Coast. So you know, it's extremely difficult to go out very far into fine forecast that differential, but it's at $5 today and certainly as inventories build it could go wider.
Phil Gresh: Okay, thanks.
Operator: From Wolfe Research we have Paul Sankey on line. Please go ahead.
Paul Sankey: Hi, good morning everyone. Gary, I was going to ask you about the hydrocracker decision, but I think you made that pretty clear in the previous answer. I don't know if there is anything more to add on that. I think of you is that we wanted to see a breather in terms of major projects. As I said, I am not sure if you want to add anything. I think it was quite clear. I'll go on to say given the oil price environment in the case of demand for oil, in the past you've talked about the year that distillate demand would exceed gasoline demand. We obviously got a different situation right now. How sustainable do you think the strength in gasoline demand is going to prove to be and how low do you think oil prices need to be for that to be the case? I'll leave it there.
Gary R. Heminger: Right, well. First of all, let me go back to your first comment on the Garyville project and I know you've always stated somewhat of a breather, however, I look at these projects as being very important for the long-term sustainability of the company. And when you have a very strong project we will continue to look at that, but as I stated, we have delayed any final investment decision and we will continue to look at this, but we certainly need to see these crude markets come back to some normal range before we would step in and look at this again. 
Paul Sankey: If I could just jump in Gary, so if I could just jump in there, what would that be, at what point would you say okay, this makes much better sense now?
Gary R. Heminger: Well as I said earlier, you have to have a view and a very strong view on where the ultra low sulfur diesel to resid spread will go into the future. And if you look at the projects based on for flatlining spreads and for flatlining different crude prices, even in today's markets it's still a good project, but it's not as robust as we had, as I said we'll continue to look at this and determine where we go from there. Looking at Mike Palmer and Rich just talked a bit about exports. The export, diesel across the globe is down just a little bit from the exports and the gasoline has picked up somewhat. And if you look at gasoline prices in this market, gasoline was very strong in the second half of the fourth quarter. As prices continued to decline, we were able to see an uptick in gasoline demand. But recognized we're comparing ourselves same period this year when you look at same-store results both in the same period this year versus last year and we have a lot of other issues going on last year. We had three polar vortex events, very heavy snowstorms. Now this year we have the addition of the Hess locations in the Northeast. We have stores that we didn’t have before that we're comparing some numbers against this year some very heavy snowstorms in the Northeast that we did not have in the period last year. But we see gasoline demand and my view is gasoline demand will continue to be strong this year and I think even at this prices, anything below 250 [ph] is going to continue to be robust for gasoline demand. I think we are just in a little bit of a low in Europe as far as diesel demand and the amount of exports of diesel, but we still see fundamentally across North America and even into the international markets we think diesel demand is going to be strong.
Paul Sankey: I got it. So essentially it's more of a price effect on gasoline and the cyclical effect on diesel right now?
Gary R. Heminger: Yes sir.
Paul Sankey: Thanks Gary.
Gary R. Heminger: All right Paul, thank you.
Operator: From Goldman Sachs we have Neil Mehta on line. Please go ahead.
Neil Mehta: Hey, good morning Gary.
Gary R. Heminger: Hi Neil.
Neil Mehta: Just can you just walk us through a little bit the way you're thinking about your capital allocation strategy, been aggressive on the dividend, aggressive on buy backs, but as you look to stock today and as you think about the cash flow going forward, how do you think about weighting one versus the other?
Gary R. Heminger: We have been and will continue to be very focused on capital discipline. If you look at the projects and our budgets they, and our capital plan for 2015 it aligns very much with the Analyst Day meeting we had at the end of 2013, where we said we're going to continue to invest in midstream and in our Speedway retail segment and in those very strong projects within refining that will give us high rates of return and that's exactly what we're doing. At the time we at that Analyst Meeting we did not have the Hess acquisition on our radar, but the investments we are doing are in the legacy Speedway locations, where we're going very strong, in fact across the entire Speedway chain. If I look at the return on capital employed in that segment over the last five years, we've continued to increase return on capital employed each year. So we think that was a - that strategy and our deployment of capital in Speedway is very sound. The same way in the midstream our strategy around Sandpiper and SAX and our Cornerstone are a very strong and that it provides very good earnings from a MLP -eligible earnings type of a project, but behind that it also has some very strong components that provides synergies to Mike Palmer's crude oil acquisition strategies and also into some of our light product distribution strategies. So we will continue to be focused on those components and then let me turn it over to Don to talk about the balance sheet, share repurchases versus dividend and our philosophy. 
Donald C. Templin: Neil, this is Don. I think that we are not targeting a particular amount of share repurchases in any period. I mean what we've historically leave was, was the way to manage the balance sheet, what we've communicated to you all is that we look to core liquidity and that sort of drives our investment allocation. So to the extent that we have the cash on our balance sheet that supports our core liquidity, the incremental cash is either invested in the business or returned to shareholders and if it isn’t being invested into the business we are returning it to the shareholders. So that is really the way we look at that allocation of capital.
Neil Mehta: That is very clear Don. So, Gary and Don, as follow-up on two topics that have been in the news lately, just any comments you might have on either then would be great. One would be thoughts on the union strike that has impacted your two facilities and then how you're responding to it and how we should think about the path forward there? And the other is the crude export discussion which seems like the volume around that has died down a bit, but Gary, I know you've spent a lot of time in Washington talking to policy makers, so your latest temperature on that issue would be great.
Gary R. Heminger: Sure, let me take both of those Neil, first of all on the union and the strike at various refineries around the country. It's been very orderly. We have two plants that have been affected, our Galveston Bay Refinery and Catlettsburg and both and we were very well prepared in the event this happened at any of our plants, as I said we were very well prepared, we were operating these plants at a very cleaned, what I should say cleaned turnover is the word I was looking for, cleaned turnover when the union workers left and we took over. And we would expect to continue to have very strong operations and as I said, we are well prepared, we were well trained and when you have these type of incidents you have to be prepared. So we'll continue to see Neil how this plays out. On crude oil exports and this really comes back to the crude oil exports that and it's a definition of crude oil exports. What is being exported is condensate and as I have said in the past and I have said in Washington, we really do not see that the condensate is an issue for U.S. refining, and what we've always in the past that there is not a glut of crude oil on the marketplace. Therefore some innuendo that there was a glut of crude oil, therefore we have to be able to export light crude oil. We do not see that as factual. And as we continue each month to close out the books, we continue to see areas where we do not get the deliveries of light crude that we had expected, and then the backdrop of that is to look at the imports that are coming into the country still suggest that we have at least 50% or so of the crude oil requirements of North America being imported. So looking at the condensate that is being exported, I'm not so certain that the volume has increased that much as maybe the media around this issue has dropped off more. So I think that's really more the subject that is going on, but it has not affected of us and I come back to most important thing to watch is how the exports coming in to the U.S. Gulf Coast as I said the imports with the exports from the middle east and others that are coming into the Gulf Coast has continued to watch how that grows, look at inventory that is building up in Houston and Cushing, I looked at the numbers in the last couple of days to see how PADD III, PADD II and Cushing inventories and for the last three weeks in a row have continued to grow if I take it even back to October, November, December, those inventories continue to grow in those markets. And that is what is even I think to watch to determine where crude spreads might be going. And overall where the crude price in the market may be going.
Neil Mehta: Thank you for your comments.
Gary R. Heminger: All right Neil.
Operator: From Barclay's we have Paul Cheng online, please go ahead.
Paul Cheng: Hey guys, good morning.
Gary R. Heminger: Hey, Paul.
Paul Cheng: Gary, can it, the 2014 was a very happy turnaround year. If that means that now Galveston Bay is pretty much that up to your standard and any rough estimate for the 2015 total turnaround expense? I mean in 2014 it was about $1.2 billion.
Gary R. Heminger: Right and as I said last year may been on the call this same period that we do, 2014 was going to be a very large turnaround year especially for Galveston Bay as we went through two of their very large units. Yes, we now have been through the majority of the big units and have those units close to our operating expectations. I'll let Rich go into that in a little more detail. And Paul, as you know, we do not give out the actual numbers nor do we give out a calendar of what our turnarounds are for this year. But it is going to be significantly less than the expenditures we had last year. Don you want to cover that?
Donald C. Templin: Yeah Paul, this is Don. I mean you are right, we did about $1.2 of turnaround expense last year. If you look at our guidance or just the outlook for the first quarter of 2015, you compare that to the first quarter of 2014 our turnaround, the projected turnaround expense is substantially down and you know it's probably in the $250 million range or slightly higher than that compared to first quarter of 2013. So we would also expect there be a bit of that that would play through in the rest of the year, but that's in the guidance of the outlook information that we've provided there.
Paul Cheng: Don what numbers they averaged for the cycle turnaround cause for you guys, is it $900 million a year a conjured opinion? I mean what number you can share?
Donald C. Templin: Well I would say that that number has probably been in the $800 million range, you know, broadly. I mean it's hard to point to a typical year. I would say last year it was $1.2 billion, maybe it was a $400 million differential this year to, for last year, but it is hard to kind of, each year is different and it depends on which units are being turned around and what not, but I'd say broadly that would be a good guide.
Gary R. Heminger: And Paul, let me ask Rich to make any comments after has finished these two big turnarounds any further comments on what you see in the plant and how you are in your staged planning that we talked about back in the acquisition day.
Richard D. Bedell: Well, we could continue to work through and we still have some more turnarounds out in the future on some of the Capline [ph] areas, but that's out in the out years. So we've been through some of the crude units and the hydrocracker s and we've been refurbishing them and getting them up to our standards. And we’ve seen through last year we set record production rates on a number of units at that refinery and we continue to optimize it and we think it's a great platform going forward.
Paul Cheng: The second question, do you have updates about Capline [ph] discussion with your partner? And also Mike do you have or maybe this is actually for Tony, do you have a number that what is the biodiesel blenders credit that the catch up from the first nine months of the year that you reported in the fourth quarter? Thank you.
Anthony R. Kenney: Well that was about $40 million, the biodiesel impact.
Paul Cheng: Full-year or just nine months is the catch up?
Anthony R. Kenney: Well it was about 40 million for the catch up yeah.
Paul Cheng: Okay, thank you.
Gary R. Heminger: Right, and Paul on Capline, we've talked about this somewhat before. We're completing the engineering to reverse this pipeline is not that difficult and the engineering studies will be complete here in the first quarter. But the longer term effect is really the commercial and it really goes back to and especially in this crude market that we're seeing today, we have a lot of analysis to understand where is the or do we have enough supply and it needs to mainly be heavy, so Canadian heavy type of input and there is enough supply to be able to satisfy those refineries in the upper PADD II markets who have already converted and require the Canadian heavy in order to be able to fill up their coffers. And then secondly, how much volume is available to get all the way down to the St. James or Louisiana Gulf Coast. So that is the big study that we know is going to take the balance of the year to understand if we you can line up the supply, how that supply will move to the markets and how that supply may affect some of the upper PADD II refineries I discussed touched earlier.
Paul Cheng: Thank you.
Gary R. Heminger: Welcome.
Operator: From Simmons we have Jeff Dietert on the line, please go ahead.
Jeffrey A. Dietert: Good morning.
Gary R. Heminger: Hi, Jeff.
Jeffrey A. Dietert: I was wanting to follow up Don, I believe you mentioned same-store sales in your discussion lead in, but I wanted to make sure I understood the January comparisons correctly, what were the comparisons for Speedway and then for Hess for January?
Gary R. Heminger: Why don’t we turn that Jeff over to Tony Kenney who is with us today?
Anthony R. Kenney: Jeff, January the light, the gasoline same-store we reflected negative 0.8 tens of a percent on gasoline and that is only for the legacy Speedway stores. We are not tracking yet same-store metrics on the Hess assets until the 13th month when we have confidence in those metrics.
Jeffrey A. Dietert: Got you and were there specific things that you attributed that the client to the DOE stats are reporting gasoline up seven or 8% this or the 5% or 6% which sometimes does get revised in the monthly data, but I was curious if there's any specific items that caused this to be lower? And anything that you are expecting to see, response on the demand side to these lower prices?
Anthony R. Kenney: Yeah, I guess what I would say is that from the Speedway and Hess side of the business during the month of January we actually saw about just under 10% increase in the wholesale cost to our business. So as we've attempted to pass along those increased costs to the market, you know that price elasticity does come into play for us. So as we're out there with those prices there may be some shifting between gasoline volume between competitors in the market and that's generally what I would say that the eight tenths rules, that reflects the Speedway.
Jeffrey A. Dietert: Great, and secondly on your Hess retail obviously a terrific performance in the quarter, excellent margin environment, could you talk about operations and sales volumes and how they're performing relative to expectations and any update to synergies that you have there?
Anthony R. Kenney: Yeah Jeff, I would say that I'm very pleased with the overall, I mean from the very beginning I took over the operations on October 1st and this is really a lot of credit goes to the wonderful people and the execution and the focus that Hess had on the business we basically were seamless. So the ongoing day-to-day operations and probably the most important aspect is making sure we're taking care of the customer and we've got some very good feedback from our customers. They've acknowledged the performance. So I've been very pleased on that side of it. In terms of the overall business, I think we're seeing that as we continue to implement the best practices at a stepped-up pace, the conversions and branding from Hess to Speedway as well as the implementation of the technology platforms inside the store such as our Speedy Rewards program, those are all generating the types of benefits that we would expect from that activity. The comment in terms of the synergies, we met the $20 million in the fourth quarter 2014 that we told the market and we are on pace to hit the 2015 mark as well for synergies. So, so far so good.
Jeffrey A. Dietert: Thanks for your comments.
Operator: From Tudor Pickering Holt, we have Chi Chow on line. Please go ahead.
Chi Chow: Great, thanks, this fantastic fourth quarter earnings, doesn’t look like you're getting much credit quite frankly in the market today. So I guess the question is, I guess Don, you outlined in some of the waterfall charts the uptick on the product price realizations. I'm just wondering, can the company sustain that outperformance on those realizations when crude prices stabilize or increase or will that performance reverse in that sort of commodity price environment?
Donald C. Templin: Chi, this is Don. I would say broadly if prices are falling quickly we tend – it tends to be sticky coming down and we tend to outperform. If prices are rising quickly the inverse is true. We tend to - it tends to take as a little while to catch up. So you know, in a flat environment I would say we would typically perform consistent with how we've done in the flat environments in a drop, in a dropping price environment, you know, we tend to outperform and this is really against the market metrics as opposed to our ability to capture margin, but it's against the market metrics and then in a rising price environment, you know, we tend to capture rate at least as it's reflected against those market metrics tend to be, tend to show that we are not getting all of that as the price runs up.
Chi Chow: Okay, great. And you also talked about realizing lower crude acquisition costs. Can you comment on that versus the indicators and have you changed your crude slate versus historical levels and is that sort of lower cost basis sustainable in the coming quarters?
Donald C. Templin: Yeah Chi, I would say that when you look at the crude slate in general there have not been very significant changes to the crude slates. As you know, I mean we basically have a process in place where we will take advantage of whatever the most advantageous crude is during a month when we're optimizing. So I don't think that the changes to the crude slates have been huge. We continue to focus on the domestic crudes, North American crudes, Canada as well as the U.S. and I think that will continue to be the case.
Chi Chow: Okay, I guess one more question on kind of the crude market then. Gary, you've talked about and you made some comments today also that you don't really see a glut of crude develop in the Gulf Coast, yet at the same time you also comment on looking at rising inventory levels and I think Mike, you mentioned that maybe the TI Brent widens out beyond $5 bucks. How do you reconcile those two statements on no glut versus potentially widening differential?
Gary R. Heminger: Well, I might have Mike Palmer cover this, but the comments that were made before was that there is a glut of light sweet crude. We ran 51% sour in the quarter which means we ran 49% sweet. That says and we believe we can run up to about 65% sweet crude, light sweet crude in our units. That suggests we have a tremendous runway to run more light sweet crude. If it is priced – if it is the right barrel and if you look at the alternative barrel if it's the next best priced barrel then that's what we would buy. So let me have Mike go into this in a little more detail.
C. Michael Palmer: Yeah, it's kind of an interesting phenomenon where you get the - have three inventories that have been consistently rising, but certainly that doesn't appear to be in the very light sweet crude oil, you know, especially when you look at differentials. The differential between LLS and Mars has been fairly consistent around that $4 level and there's been no compelling advantage to buy these light sweet crudes. And certainly when we look at the market today and if you're in the market on a spot basis for some of these again light sweet shale crudes, they are not very plentiful. So the inventories that are building up you know, we don't have a breakdown of exactly what that is, but certainly the differentials don't reflect the fact that it's a glut of this very light sweet shale crude that producers have been worried about.
Chi Chow: So Mike, are you suggesting then the inventory build is more on medium, you think it is Gulf of Mexico produced crudes or are there incremental imports coming in?
C. Michael Palmer: I think it's a combination of all those things to be honest and I think that the other thing that is happening as you know is the logistics systems continue to build out. So there's more line fill that's needed. I think that's one of the differences between this year and last year, but we certainly don't see this glut of this very light material that that producers have been worried about.
Chi Chow: Okay, great. Thanks for your comments, I appreciate it.
Operator: From RBC Capital Markets we have Brad Heffern on the line. Please go ahead.
Brad Heffern: Good morning everyone. One for Don maybe, you know, just looking at debt levels certainly they've ticked up since the Speedway acquisition. I'm wondering how you think about returning cash to shareholders versus maybe using some cash to paydown debt?
Donald C. Templin: Yes Brad, I think our view and our commitment is to maintain an investment grade credit profile. So that will guide sort of all of our actions around what our balance sheet looks like and you know, right now we feel comfortable that our balance sheet comfortably supports an investment grade credit profile. And as we make investments in the business and as we continue to look at M&A opportunities, we'll continue to evaluate what the balance sheet needs to look like to make sure that we don't cross the line or put any pressure on that investment grade credit profile.
Brad Heffern: Okay, great, and then I think that the Canton condensates that has been online for a little while now, can you talk about how that's running and sort of demands that you are seeing?
Richard D. Bedell: Yeah Brad, this is Rich Bedell. We put the Canton splitter online at right the end of the year and it's running, we run it up to designed capacity. We're running maybe 20,000 barrels a day right now. So it's running very well.
Brad Heffern: Great. Thanks.
Operator: From Citigroup we have Mohit Bhardwaj on the line. Please go ahead.
Mohit Bhardwaj: Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Gary we spent a lot of time looking at two different shells and also talking about your integrated business. But one of the things that a lot of people forget is about some of the other feedstock prices like VGO prices and they have been really low of late if you compare the differentials versus the traditional differentials that they had versus compared to say on lesser the Brent pricing. If you could just talk about that and how does that impact your business and what kind of benefit it has been over the last six months?
C. Michael Palmer: Yes, this is the Mike Palmer. Yeah, what I would say is that we are a big player in that feedstock market and generally when you're talking about VGO, as you know I mean the VGO is just extremely sensitive to the operations of those Gulf Coast refineries. If you have a CAT cracker go down and it is surplusing VGO into the market, you can get very attractive differentials and that’s true of planned turnarounds as well. So that's a market that we're involved in all the time buying and selling in VGO. Our position changes depending upon our turnaround schedule, but it's something that we always take advantage of.
Mohit Bhardwaj: Is there a number that you guys can provide like it wasn't anything different last year or is it really what your normal operations are and there was no significant impact of it?
C. Michael Palmer: You know, I don't think we really have any comparisons that we could provide today.
Mohit Bhardwaj: Okay. Thank you. I know that we are just running over the hour here, but one final question Don, you just mentioned M&A opportunities and if you just comment especially on the logistics side if you're seeing especially with the light of – in the light of the crude prices where they are and you're seeing more opportunities here just to grow MPLX as you guys want to, but with a higher rate of dropdowns and also higher rate of distribution growth over there?
Gary R. Heminger: Hey, Mohit, this is Gary. You know, the market that we're in and we are seeing many opportunities come across our desk throughout the entire market. I think we're very well positioned. If something made sense we're well positioned within our balance sheet and are very well positioned within MPLX. If something made sense within the logistics from midstream side of the business we would I think be in a good position to be able to act. But the key here is to be cautious and to do your - continue to do very strong due diligence on anything that might become available because I think there will be more and more things available in the marketplace as we go forward.
Mohit Bhardwaj: Yeah, thanks for your comments.
Gary R. Heminger: Yep.
Operator: We will now turn it back to Tim Griffith for final remarks.
Timothy T. Griffith: Okay, thanks Brandon. With that, we want to thank everyone for joining us today and for your interest in Marathon Petroleum. If there are additional questions you would like clarification on any of the topics discussed this morning, Jerry Ewing and Teresa Homan will be available to take your calls. Thanks for joining.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Marathon Petroleum Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. My name is Vivian, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Tim Griffith. Mr. Griffith, you may begin.
Timothy T. Griffith: Okay, thank you, Vivian. Welcome this morning to Marathon Petroleum's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Webcast and Conference Call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, President and CEO; Don Templin, Senior Vice President and CFO; Mike Palmer, Senior Vice President of Supply, Distribution and Planning; Pam Beall, Senior Vice President of Corporate Planning and Government and Public Affairs; and Tony Kenney, President of Speedway. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statements on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well, as in our filings with the SEC. Now I'll turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks and highlights.
Gary R. Heminger: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, and thank you for joining our call. We are pleased to report strong results for the quarter with $672 million of net income in the third quarter. The efficiency, flexibility and optionality in our integrated downstream system enabled us to continue capturing opportunities in the markets we serve. Our ability to supply refined products to the markets of greatest value continues to serve consumers and our shareholders well. Speedway, our company owned and operated retail system, achieved record results for the quarter. This was particularly impressive because they achieved these results while working to close the Hess retail acquisition, which occurred on September 30. This expansion makes Speedway the largest company-owned convenience store chain in the United States by revenue. Speedway's consistent ability to generate strong merchandise margins in the store will provide great synergies with a strong volume that Hess locations have historically experienced. We are confident we can leverage these potential synergies further as we introduce Speedway's focused merchandising approach to these 1,245 locations. We're also pleased to welcome our new employees to the Speedway family and are eager to expand the relationships with the new customers along the eastern seaboard, who will come to know us under our Speedway brand. Return on capital continues to be an important element of our strategy and our activity in the third quarter underscores this enduring commitment. We returned a total of $442 million to our shareholders during the third quarter with $301 million coming in the form of share repurchases. Don will talk a little further about our capital return activity over the last 12 months, but we continue to have one of the highest effective capital return yields in our competitor group. We are also announcing plans this morning to significantly accelerate the growth of MPLX. Initially coming in the form of larger drops into MPLX, our intent is to grow the partnership substantially and accelerate the annual distribution growth rate to average in the mid- 20% range over the next 5 years. As we evolve MPLX into a large cap diversified MLP, we will be focused on building size and scale in the partnership more rapidly in the near term. As a part of this acceleration, the MPC board has authorized the sale of the remaining 31% interest in pipeline holdings to MPLX. With the objective of growing MPLX's December 15 annualized EBITDA to at least $450 million. We can turn to the graphic on Slide 4, where you can see this is about 3x the annualized EBITDA of MPLX for the third quarter of 2014. The roughly $80 million of EBITDA represented by the remainder of pipeline holdings is an important piece of that growth plan. And we would expect those earnings to become part of the MPLX earnings stream in the near term. I wanted to provide some color on what has changed in our perspective and why we believe now is the right time to execute this acceleration strategy. Slide 5 provides a few of the elements, which have impacted our thinking and shift in strategy. Substantial growth in domestic oil and gas production and the tremendous midstream build-out in the U.S. create numerous opportunities where size and scale becomes strategically important to the midstream growth vehicles like MPLX. And it is fully our intent to participate in that development. The acquisition of the Hess Retail system has also expanded our opportunity set by providing an additional source of MLP qualifying income through the fuels distribution piece of the business. Adding the roughly 3 billion gallons, which have historically been part of Hess' business, to the volumes from MPC's total system, results and wholesale volumes totaling approximately 20 billion gallons. Attaching a reasonable margin to these volumes results in approximately $600 million in MLP qualifying earnings, which is in addition to the $1.1 billion we have discussed previously, bringing the total potential pool of eligible earnings to $1.7 billion. Finally, we remain convinced the market has failed to recognize the total value of our enterprise, including the substantial contribution of MPLX to the business. Accelerating the growth of this highly valued portion of our business, as we are doing with Speedway, will highlight the tremendous value of our business that we believe is being missed in our current valuation. With the amount of discussions surrounding the potential of crude oil exports from the U.S., I also want to provide some of our perspectives on these issues. Before we consider crude exports, it's important to acknowledge that we faced market distorting regulations and conditions both here and abroad that make it difficult and sometimes impossible for the free market to function. We also must keep in mind that the issue of crude exports is often based on the misperception that there is a glut of light sweet crude oil in the U.S. We are in the market buying $5 billion worth of crude oil every month. And we do not see a glut of light sweet crude. In fact, there have been times during the year when producers could not deliver the volumes they committed to sell us. MPC and the U.S. refining industry, as a whole, is keeping pace with the supply. The studies that encourage lifting the crude oil ban tend to make the same flawed assumption, that U.S. refiners cannot and will not be able to process the increasing supply of light crude being produced in this country. And we disagree with these assumptions. We and others in the industry are making significant investments today that will allow us to process more light sweet crude in the medium and long term. In fact, all the projects announced by refiners and midstream companies to process light oil add up to more capacity than MPC's forecast of incremental shale crude growth. We should also keep in mind that our country still imports up to 8 million barrels of crude oil per day. For decades, energy policy has been focused on energy security for our country. That vision can be a reality, but it can only be achieved with a vibrant refining industry to process the light crude oil we produced in this country into usable products. For that to happen, refiners need certainty. MPC remains an ardent supporter of free markets and the unrestricted movement of commodities, goods and services to the markets of greatest efficiency and value. We continue to support policy actions that move the U.S. economy in that direction, but we believe strongly that the underlying assumptions dictating any policy change must be based on facts, rather than the misperceptions about our industry. To wrap up my opening comments, I'd like to highlight that MPC shareholders now own the largest refining, logistics and retail systems east of the Mississippi. Our successful retail segment has almost doubled in size and our midstream business, increasingly represented by MPLX, is well positioned to grow along with considerable developments in North American energy production. Our world-class refining system is characterized by top-tier assets, located in attractive geographic markets. The investments we are making in the business continue to build stable cash flow, highly valued businesses. And we are fundamentally committed to long-term value creation for our shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Don to review our financial performance for the quarter. Don?
Donald C. Templin: Thanks, Gary. Slide 6 provides earnings both on an absolute and per share basis. Our third quarter 2014 earnings were $672 million compared to $168 million in the third quarter of 2013. Third quarter 2014 earnings included pretax pension settlement expenses of $21 million, while the third quarter of 2013 included $23 million of comparable expenses. Earnings per diluted share were $2.36 per share for the third quarter of 2014. We reported $0.54 per share for the same period last year. The bridge on Slide 7 shows the change in earnings by segment from the third quarter of 2013 to the third quarter of 2014. The primary driver for the change was the increase in refining and marketing segment income, which I will discuss shortly. Items not allocated to segments include $11 million related to acquisition costs for the Hess retail operations. As shown on Slide 8, refining and marketing segment income from operations was $971 million in the third quarter of 2014 compared with $227 million in the same quarter last year. The change from 2013 was primarily due to higher product price realizations and the improved crack spreads, partially offset by higher direct operating costs. As indicated in the earnings walk, the higher LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread had a positive impact on earnings of approximately $379 million. The blended crack spread was $8.70 per barrel in the third quarter of 2014, compared to $6.52 per barrel in 2013. The increase in LLS prompt versus delivered also had a favorable impact on earnings that was largely offset by backwardation in the market. Direct operating costs increased quarter-over-quarter due to higher turnaround and maintenance costs as well as higher natural gas prices versus last year. The impact of higher product price realizations is reflected in the $548 million change in other gross margin. You may recall that the third quarter of 2013 product price realizations compared to spot market values were negatively impacted by the effects of renewable identification numbers or RINs. RIN prices averaged approximately $0.085 on a per E [ph] 10-gallon basis for the third quarter of 2013 compared to $0.05 per gallon in the third quarter of 2014. In addition, consistent with last quarter, we continued to see strong product price realizations in the third quarter of 2014. Slide 9 provides a sequential earnings walk for our refining and marketing segment. The primary drivers for the decrease in income over the second quarter were lower crack spreads and higher refinery operating expenses. The LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread decreased $1.70 per barrel from second quarter, which reduced earnings by approximately $229 million. Refinery direct operating costs increased $62 million, primarily due to higher turnaround costs in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. Product price realizations are included in the other gross margin amount. Turning to Speedway segment results on Slide 10. Income from operations was $119 million in the third quarter of 2014 compared with $102 million in the third quarter of 2013. Excluding a $6 million impact from the Hess acquisition, Speedway's segment income was $125 million, which as Gary referenced, represents a record quarter for the business. Speedway's light product gross margin was $22 million higher in the third quarter of 2014 compared with the same quarter last year as gross margin increased by $1.09 per gallon. Merchandise margin was $235 million in the third quarter of 2014 compared with $224 million last year. This $11 million increase was due to higher merchandise sales and merchandise margin percentage. The unfavorable $16 million other variants primarily relates to Speedway's operating expenses, which were higher in the third quarter of 2014, largely driven by an increase in the number of stores versus previous year levels. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes decreased 0.8%; and merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes, increased 4.8% in the third quarter of 2014 compared to the third quarter of 2013. Activity in October has been positive with a 1.2% increase in same-store gasoline sales volumes versus the similar period last year. Slide 11 shows changes in our Pipeline Transportation segment income. Income from operations was $69 million in the third quarter of 2014 compared with $54 million in the third quarter of 2013. The increase of $15 million was primarily attributable to higher transportation revenue and pipeline affiliate income, partially offset by higher operating expenses, attributable mainly to the timing of pipeline maintenance and expenses related to MPLX's proposed Cornerstone pipeline project. $11 million of the $15 million increase in transportation revenue was attributable to the recognition of deferred transportation credits during the quarter. The remainder was primarily due to higher average tariff rates. Slide 12 presents the significant drivers of changes in our cash flow for the third quarter of 2014. At June 30, 2014, our cash balance was just over $2.1 billion and we ended the third quarter with just under $1.9 billion of cash. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was an approximately $1 billion source of cash due to the strong financial performance in the third quarter. We borrowed approximately $2.7 billion in debt during the quarter to finance the $2.8 billion acquisition of Hess' retail operations. This is shown separately from the $736 million of capital spending in the quarter. As Gary highlighted, we continued delivering on our commitment to balance investments in the business with return of capital to our shareholders. We repurchased $301 million worth of shares and paid $141 million of dividends in the third quarter, continuing the regular returns of capital Gary alluded to in his remarks. Slide 13 shows that at the end of the third quarter, we had $1.9 billion of cash and $6.3 billion of debt. With EBITDA of about $5.1 billion during the last 12 months, we continue to be in a very manageable debt position with leverage of 1.2x EBITDA and a debt-to-total capital ratio of 36%. Turning to Slide 14. During the last 12 months, we generated $4.1 billion in cash from operations and nearly $2 -- $1 billion of free cash flow, excluding the Hess Retail acquisition. Over this period, we've returned $2.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases or approximately 1.2x our adjusted free cash flow. During the third quarter of 2014, we purchased approximately 4 million shares for $301 million through open market repurchases. It is our intention to continue returning capital to our shareholders that is not currently needed to support the operational and investment needs of the business, and we continue to believe share repurchases are the most efficient way to do so. Slide 15 provides our outlook for key operating metrics for MPC for the fourth quarter of 2014. We are planning for fourth quarter throughput volumes to be slightly less than the third quarter of 2014, but up compared to fourth quarter last year due to less planned maintenance. Before I conclude my comments, I wanted to highlight one of the points Gary referred to earlier around the tremendous value contribution of MPLX to MPC. Slide 16 provides an illustration of the potential cash distributions for MPC's limited partner units and general partner interest over the next 5 years, assuming a 25% average growth rate of LP distortions. The chart on the right illustrates potential 2019 valuations using a range of recent market multiples for LPs and GPs. As I hope is clear from this illustration, the embedded value to MPC is considerable. Now, I will turn the call back to Tim Griffith.
Timothy T. Griffith: Thanks, Don. As we open up the call for questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. [Operator Instructions] With that Vivian, we're prepared to open up the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Congratulations on the strong earnings, and thanks for the slides on MPLX visibility. Just a quick question, I'm sure I could do the math. But what type of drop-downs are you assuming, say on an annual run rate, say from here through to 2019 to drive this GP distribution, LP distribution growth?
Gary R. Heminger: Don, you want to handle that?
Donald C. Templin: Sure, Ed. We haven't given specific drop-down guidance. I guess, what we are showing here is that over that time period, we would expect to grow the LP distributions by an average compounded annual growth rate of 25% and as we showed in the slide deck, that has an even more powerful impact on the GP distributions through our IDR ownerships or our IDR cash flows. But we've not given a specific guidance on individual drop-downs or the timing of those.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then on Slide 19, you've got the $1.7 billion of currently identified eligible MLP EBITDA sources, which presumably is part of MPLX as well as MPC. Maybe clarify whether that's held at the parent as opposed to the current MPLX EBITDA stream. And then does that include any growth or is all of the growth that you're obviously investing for on top of that $1.7 billion?
Donald C. Templin: Sure. The $1.7 billion, Ed, reflects the $800 million that we had originally pointed to at the time of the IPO of MPLX. So it would have included pipeline holdings as well, but there have been some additions there. Then there's been about $300 million of growth projects that we've identified and elaborated on over a period of time and that would include the investments in Sandpiper, Southern Access Extension, the condensate splitters. That broadly adds another $300 million. And then the fuels distribution is really incremental to that. For this purposes, we value that at approximately $600 million, which is 20 billion gallons at a $0.03 average.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And MLP of the fuels distribution business potentially?
Donald C. Templin: I mean those are MLP-qualifying EBIT. Those -- that's MLP-qualifying EBITDA. And it's -- our view that we want to continue to drive value for the MPC shareholders by making sure that we're maximizing that, which can be dropped into an MLP.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Very clear.
Gary R. Heminger: Ed, let me add to that. Our strategy was MPLX. And our whole midstream system is that, just like a production company looks at reserves, we want to keep a very strong reserve base of eligible assets that can be dropped into an MLP. But secondly, we plan to continue to have very strong organic growth from projects inside the company, very strong third-party growth as we continue to invest in the projects like Cornerstone that we've talked about. And then we've geared up and have been very active looking at projects in and around some of the production fields and other gathering type systems that could make sense to be bolt-ons to our system. So we're not just going to be limited. This is not a drop-down story, this is going to be an aggressive growth strategy. Yes, we see this -- the MLP business continues to consolidate.
Operator: And our next question comes from Doug Terreson from ISI Group.
Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Gary, this -- the retail transaction appears transformative for the business, for that business rather, as you indicate. And I have a couple of questions about that. First, how was the transaction financed? Meaning last quarter, I think we talked about available cash and debt. And then second, with your EBITDA per store much higher than Hess and the other peers too, you guys seem justifiably enthusiastic about the outlook for the combination. So now that it's closed and the team has had the opportunity to take a closer look, I want to see if you could spend just a minute on some of the financial or strategic opportunities that appear most obvious to the team and 1 to 2 guys are most excited about as you go through the integration process?
Gary R. Heminger: Sure Doug. Let me ask Don to take the first part, Don or Tim, to handle the financing piece. And I invited Tony to be on the call today, who runs all of Speedway. And I'll have Tony take the strategic and the synergistic questions. So Don?
Donald C. Templin: Sure. Doug, at the end of the third quarter, we had about $6.3 billion of debt and the increases of debt during the quarter were primarily in 2 areas. We had $700 million term loan and then we issued $1.95 billion of senior notes. So the transaction was largely funded with debt, but we also had available cash that we used.
Anthony R. Kenney: As far as the opportunity with the assets, what we see and you correctly pointed out, Doug, the difference in the EBITDA between the Speedway assets and the Hess assets, all of that is due to the difference in the performance inside the store. So from a light product perspective, Hess had always performed well on the volume and the margin outside. So the opportunity really is upgrading or enhancing the performance inside the store. And what really comes into play there is some of the elements that we bring in terms of some of our merchandising, and specifically, the loyalty program that we've had in place for over 10 years on the Speedway side. So we think while leveraging some opportunities in food service, general merchandise, in combination with partnerships with our key suppliers and consumer product companies, with our loyalty program is going to give us an opportunity to leverage the traditional Speedway performance into the Hess assets. So I think that's where the upside is. And along with that, we'll generate a number of synergies on those marketing enhancements.
Gary R. Heminger: Doug, just to let you know. We've been managing these for all of 30 days now. But what Tony and his team have learned is the administrative synergies that we have identified and some procurement type synergies, not getting into the marketing synergies that we expect due to the incremental merchandise sales. So just those that we identified, we're way ahead of what our first-year plan was and being able to capture synergies. So we've already identified significantly more than we had expected to achieve in the first year. So very pleased with how the transition has gone and how we're really starting up the operation.
Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: And Gary, we can just -- I can tell by your tone over the past several months, you've gotten more and more enthusiastic. It seems like this thing's really pulling it in a positive direction.
Operator: And our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Gary, great strategy shift this morning from midstream. It should begin to unlock some value for your shareholders. I know it's in line with your highest growth peers now. Can you discuss how you arrived at the new pace for distribution growth in the mid-20s over that 5-year period as you look at your potential? And then how does this stream of visible and less cyclical cash, less cyclical cash flow affect a potential pace on the buyback?
Gary R. Heminger: Sure. I'll take the first part and ask Don to talk about the potential buyback. We've been studying this strategy for quite some time. And with the Hess acquisition, this has always been part of our strategy with this acquisition that those assets should be able to be throw off eligible-type earnings. So we get -- got this transaction complete. And over this same period of time, we were doing this strategic study to determine what's the best way forward. And as I said in my speech that we believe now is the time. We believe first of all, we've recognized a significant underperformance, if you will in pull through that the market has not recognized in the assets of the company. And the question of how committed are we going to be to growing this MLP? I think this shows clearly how committed we are to growing this MLP. We've always been committed. It's just when was the right time to be able to bring all this together. So with the addition of the Hess wholesale fuels distribution, I'm talking about on top of the other 17 billion gallons that we already had, this was the perfect timing, we believe, to be able to highlight this and really to be able to communicate to the market how much value is underlining the value of MPC, but how fast we can grow MPLX and how fast therefore the GP should grow and we should get that pull-through back into the marketplace. And Don, do you want to handle the use of cash?
Donald C. Templin: Sure. Evan, I think that we will continue to view the cash that would come back to us from both the drops and the distributions and the ownership of the LP units similar to how we do it now. I mean we are and have been very committed to achieving a balance between investing in the business and returning capital to our shareholders. And we would expect that, that will certainly continue. One of the things that is nice about having these drops is that you will generate cash that can continue to be redeployed in the increased growth and build-out of the midstream infrastructure. And while we would like, to the maximum extent possible, have projects funded initially from MPLX, there may be times, or will be times when a project may be bigger or the timeline over the cash profile might be longer than we can -- that makes sense for us to have at an MPLX initially. And we'll use that cash to invest in midstream, hold it at MPC until it is MLP-ready and then drop it in. So I view this as being a continual cycle here of getting cash that we can return to our shareholders, but also getting cash that we can continue to invest in the midstream and infrastructure build-out.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: MLP clearly increases that, that cash amount. Maybe add some color specifically. I mean do you anticipate the drops that you laid out for cash or units or a combination of both. And secondly, do you see structures, other than taking units, that allow a capital gain deferral for some of your other MLPs have employed?
Donald C. Templin: I think we will, for every drop that occurs Evan, we will certainly evaluate the tax implications of those. And we will, I think, continually balance making sure that we're doing them in the most tax efficient way with also making sure that we're meeting the business needs of MPC and MPLX. And if there's a need for cash, either to return it to shareholders or to invest in the business, we're more likely to take cash. If there is an opportunity to do something in a tax-efficient way, we might end up taking back units or more units. So I think it will be a fact and circumstance-driven decision versus sort of a philosophical or a policy around how everyone is going to occur.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: That's great. Maybe one last one, if I may. It's somewhat related, but on your announcement that you and your partners are evaluating options for Capline. I mean while preliminary, do you see the need for reverse pipe of that size to the Gulf Coast? Or do you envision some coordinated project that would -- with other logistics that would move Canadian crudes into that Chicago market? Any preliminary thoughts there on how that might work out?
Gary R. Heminger: If you really look at this, this is just an announcement of a preliminary study. If you look at the Louisiana side of the refining sector, refining corridor in the Louisiana or Gulf Coast, you do not have an efficient manner to be able to get heavy crude down there. The Houston side of the Gulf is in great shape on pipelines. And we expect keystone will eventually be approved and we'll even be in better shape. So therefore, it opens itself the question, why not improve the logistics to the Gulf Coast. So this isn't a study to look at just Chicago. You look at the volumes that go south to north, and we were always going to need a good supply source from south to north to be able to feed the PADD II refineries. So this is a study to determine long term, does it makes sense to look at Capline in a different type of operation than it is today. And all of the things that you mentioned are on the table as we do this very detailed analysis.
Operator: And our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just want to say thank you for adding those information about MPLX into your presentation, really helpful. Maybe I have a couple of questions. First, on MPLX, Don, from a financial standpoint, can you tell us that what is the kind of comfortable level the balance sheet could support in terms of whether it's an outside acquisition or that an internal acquisition dropped down on a per year basis? I mean is it a $1 billion a year? Or that you think it is going to be -- the balance sheet will be able to support bigger?
Donald C. Templin: Well, I think the way we would look at the balance sheet, Paul, is by making sure that we have a good balance between issuing equity and maintaining a debt profile that we want to be investment grade. And so the way we think about investment grade profile would be to have a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of probably somewhere, managing to somewhere, no more than sort of 4x. So that's -- that is how we will look at and evaluate opportunities. And in a growing environment, when MPLX is growing quickly, our view around that 4x debt-to-EBITDA would be on sort of the last quarter annualized or a run rate EBITDA versus the last 12 months, just because you don't want to get yourself into a situation where you're getting -- you're incurring debt sort of at an acquisition date, but not giving any benefit for that EBITDA. So when I say 4x, it's really around a run rate EBITDA number. And we feel comfortable doing that because we believe that when something finds its way into MPLX, it is a revenue stream that's largely certain. And there won't be a lot of -- there's not a lot of volatility around commodity risk or something like that.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Maybe the second question is that for, maybe either Tony or Don, do you have a number that you can share after the Hess acquisition on the pro forma basis, the impact to your Speedway gross margin on the field and gross margin on the C store [ph] look like? And also Don, do you have the inventory market matter [ph] in excess of book and working capital and the long-term debt for the MPC C Corp level?
Donald C. Templin: So long-term debt is 6., just under $6.3 billion. The excess of fair value over book value for inventory is $5 billion, and working capital is $2.5 billion.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: The $2.5 billion is including cash or not including cash?
Donald C. Templin: It is including cash.
Anthony R. Kenney: Paul on the enhancements, I think what I would say is that with the synergies, and the synergies will cut across both the existing Speedway assets as well as the Hess assets, will enjoy some uplift in our gross margin inside the store from realizing those synergies. I don't have a specific number on that. We know what we've said publicly in terms of all of the marketing synergies in the deal. Year 3 run rate is $70 million in total, but I can't give you a split between how much of that is on the Speedway side and the existing Hess assets.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Tony, do you have a pro forma for the fourth quarter in terms of actual, if we just say, if you have closed the deal at June 30 and just 1 year, what will be the reported fuel margin and the C [ph] store margin in the third quarter, so that we can use it as a baseline to project forward?
Anthony R. Kenney: Paul, I don't have that number. I've really not done any work around that. We're really just now beginning to integrate the 2 financial systems to understand exactly what that would look like, but that's all I could say about that now.
Gary R. Heminger: And Paul, as you know, we've never given forward guidance.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I just want to look at say on the actual -- on a pro forma basis, what is the baseline we should use?
Gary R. Heminger: Let us continue to get this transition under our belt and we'll see what we can prepare.
Operator: And our next question comes from Brad Heffern of RBC Capital Markets.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Sort of attacking on previous question slightly different way. Looking at the acceleration in MPLX. How much of that is due to faster drops? And then you also mentioned potential consolidation in midstream. Are you assuming some incremental acquisitions in order to sort of triple the EBITDA there?
Donald C. Templin: So Brad, this is Don. When we did the modeling there, that is a projected EBITDA growth rate. And that was a projected EBITDA growth rate or distribution growth rate that we can easily support with the portfolio of assets that we currently have. Now that doesn't mean that we're -- in fact, we're very focused on growing organic projects, identifying the next big opportunity, identifying potentials for M&A that might make sense and be strategic to us, but we're very comfortable that we can support the growth rate that we've identified there solely with assets that exist at MPC. But knowing that we will certainly, over time, grow MPLX in other ways and that would be through organic means and through M&A.
Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, thanks. And talking about Capline, is that in the EBITDA drop inventory number you typically provide? And if ultimately it was reversed, do you think that, that would have a substantial impact on the drop to you going forward?
Gary R. Heminger: Don, you want to take the first part and I'll take the second.
Donald C. Templin: Yes. So currently we haven't indicated actual EBITDA from those types of assets, but the EBITDA from Capline right now would be not a significant number. And so to the extent there was a reversal and it was more fully utilized, I'm assuming that there would be incremental EBITDA that could accrue from that. But in terms of the numbers that we're showing here, there's a lot of other contributors that are probably more meaningful to that EBITDA number, Brad.
Gary R. Heminger: Right. Brad, the last part is it's too early to be able to put a forecast, but heavy crude from the Canadian region was available. There's substantial demand in the Louisiana refining corridor. Most of those refineries from Baton Rouge through Garyville and on are heavy refineries. So I think there could be a lot of volume that, that can go that direction someday. So we don't have any pro formas on what that is yet, but I think it could be a significant value.
Operator: And our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research.
Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: Did you talk about the Garyville hydrocracker expansion? I guess we were wondering whether there would be a decision on that this year and if the CapEx would then be starting next year.
Gary R. Heminger: Yes. Paul. We have not discussed that yet. We will -- our plan that we've always been on schedule with is to make that decision sometime around end of the year to the first part of next year. We're just wrapping up our front-end engineering and design work that then drives all of the capital investment type final numbers. So we won't make that decision again until the end of the year. If we were to go forward, the in 2015, the capital would not be that significant in 2015 because it takes a -- we would finish up the detailed design and engineering and start some of the land excavation work and piling it in 2015 and '16. So really the bigger part of that CapEx will not come for a couple of years yet.
Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: Understood Gary. Gary, on global oil markets, do you expect OPEC to cut production in the November meeting.
Gary R. Heminger: Well, I'm not close enough to OPEC to be able to give you a good answer on that. But the discussions so far, they've been very clear that they're not going to cut production this time. When you look though, a lot of analysis has been put out on countries such as OPEC. It would suggest that the majority of the countries need a higher price than is in the marketplace today in order to be able to support the budgets that they have. So I see -- I expect that the market's going to be continue to be volatile on the front end here. But based on lot of the discussion that's been going on, I would be surprised to see that there would be a change in the direction that has been stated so far.
Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: Thanks. And then finally, the bigger issue is demand. We just heard Tom O'Malley saying he thought that yesterday's draws in inventories of products were extraordinary bullish for refiners. Can you -- it seems that the distillates market may be a lot stronger than people realize globally. Would that be -- would you agree with that? Could you also, just talk about you -- I would ask you this, firstly about your exports distillates and gasoline; and secondly, about the demand that you're seeing across your networks.
Gary R. Heminger: Okay. Mike Palmer, do you want to handle the majority of those questions?
C. Michael Palmer: Sure, Gary. Paul with regard to our exports, the third quarter was still very strong. I guess we probably see just a little bit of weakness in Europe and a lot of strength in Latin America. But we're still, if those record kind of level of exports and don't have reason to believe that ought to change.
Donald C. Templin: And Paul, this is Don. The actual volumes were 299,000 barrels per day for the third quarter for exports. About 2/3 of that was distillate. The remainder was predominantly gasoline.
Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: And gasoline demand coming back with low prices in your networks?
Donald C. Templin: I think what we're seeing in October was that we're up slightly over 1% same-store gasoline demand.
Operator: And our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I'd like to dig in a little bit to how the balance, if I may, on the MLP growth impacts the cost base of the refining business. It's obviously, we've had a very strong refining environment with the benefit of crude spreads and so on. But if we had to go back to a normalized level, let's assume it was not as high as we are currently. I'm just trying to understand what the priority is in the MLP drop-downs and the context of what it means for the cost base for the refining business. So I wonder if you could help me with that, starting first with the $450 million run rate? What does that mean for the cost basis of the refining business?
Gary R. Heminger: Great question, the way we have always modeled things, the way we've always done our business, Doug, is we've tried to transfer our prices at market. And the way we value those assets are all at market. So I don't think it changes from a market competitive standpoint. It changes any of those dynamics. Don, you were going to add something?
Donald C. Templin: Doug, I wasn't exactly sure I understood what your question was around the sort of the impact on refining.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Let me try a different way, Don. So previously, before today, you talked about I think $1.1 billion of EBITDA, $300 million organic and $800 million within the existing system, so when you transfer that ratable EBITDA to the MLP, one has to imagine someone's paying for that. And that of course is, I'm guessing, is going to be a cost within your refining business. So I'm trying to understand where the transfer of cost takes place? And what it does to the base ratable stable earnings within the refining business, if you like. You see what I mean? Am I explaining that well or no?
Donald C. Templin: Yes, so in terms of the EBITDA, clearly, that is embedded now within MPC on a consolidated basis. I mean one of the things that ends up happening is that, if you drop those assets down, you get paid a reasonable multiple already for those assets. And then at MPC, we continue to participate in a portion of that EBITDA stream, just based upon our LP ownership. So our view around the kind of a drop-off in EBITDA or the cost transfer, I guess that you're speaking with, is that it, it is not that significant. We get proceeds back to MPC, we will evaluate how to deploy those proceeds. And sometimes they may end up getting deployed into capital projects at refining that continue to grow the refining EBITDA. A good example, would be, as we continue to consider the ROUX project. So to me, I think this is all about a growth story rather than a story where we're just moving EBITDA from sort of one legal entity to another legal entity. This is about an opportunity to grow MPC and MPLX to be able to take advantage of the capital markets in order to be able to grow both our midstream, but the rest of our business.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. I guess I'll take the details offline. I understand the IDP or the IDR benefit and all the rest of it. What I'm just kind of trying to wrestle with what happens in a down cycle for refining when you have got the added cost base. We can take it offline. My follow-up is that I may have missed this in your prepared remarks. On Slide 8 of the presentation, can you just quantify again, what the other gross margin, the of $548 million, what was that and what was absolute in the quarter?
Donald C. Templin: Yes. We did not -- the absolute in other gross margin for the quarter -- just 1 second here. It's -- the absolute is $501 million, which was on our appendix, Slide 26.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: What is that?
Donald C. Templin: It's a combination of a number of things would be in there. That includes our product price realizations, it includes refinery gain, it includes our purchase for resale activity. We have not given any color on sort of the individual components.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. I want to just go back very quickly, the $1.7 billion, is that inclusive of the original $1.1 billion or is that added to that? I assume it's inclusive of.
Donald C. Templin: The $1.7 billion is the original $800 million plus $300 million of projects, which would be SAX, Sandpiper, Condensate Splitters and what not. And then the $600 million of fuel distribution.
Operator: And our next question comes from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: First question was a clarification. I know you're talking about the uses of cash from the acceleration plan. With the leverage levels where they are, you've had a step function change with the Hess deal. Are you anticipating that we're just going to keep it at this new level moving forward? Or would some of that cash actually be used to kind of slowly delever the balance sheet for other opportunities, just your thinking around that?
Donald C. Templin: Phil, our expectation is that we would continue to -- we're committed to maintaining an investment grade credit profile. So we would maintain -- would not go past a leverage model that would put pressure on that, but we're very comfortable with where our balance sheet is currently on a leverage basis. And we think it has allowed us to access some attractively priced capital.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Got it. Okay. Second question is just on the gasoline markets. We're seeing a divergence in the fundamentals in the Gulf Coast cracks versus where we're seeing in the East Coast and Mid-Continent. So I'm just wondering if you could give a little bit of color what you're seeing there? And how you might expect that to play out in the fourth quarter?
Gary R. Heminger: Mike?
C. Michael Palmer: Yes. Gary. So Phil, I guess, what I would say is that, if you look at the gasoline market, it's kind of by region for most of the year. What you've really seen, I think, is that the Chicago area, the New York has been stronger than the Gulf Coast. And I think certainly, within the Gulf Coast, there is a lot more refining capacity to make gasoline than the region can absorb. And that gasoline must be exported to the other markets. And I think that's what you're seeing. So I think, from a macro standpoint, that's going to continue to be the case. The other thing that certainly happens is that during periods, during quarters, you get mini events that take place. You get pipeline issues, you get the refinery, planned maintenance as well as unplanned maintenance, and that can have a pretty significant impact on a specific region. And certainly, that's been the case. We've seen some refinery downtime in the Midwest region over the last several months, I think, that's contributed to margins.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Understood. Thanks for the color. Last question is just on the retail side. I appreciate the color on how things are going early days. Would you say that kind of for now, you guys are mostly just focused on the integration of Hess as opposed to organic store openings and/or additional acquisitions within the retail business. I know you talked about Hess slowing the pace of your organic store openings. But it sounds like things are going well. So just wondering the growth side of that story.
Anthony R. Kenney: As far as the integration, that's our #1 focus. But backing up from there, let me just say this, what was important was, as we transferred ownership and operations from Hess to Speedway, the most important thing was making sure there was no impact to the customer, and I think we have accomplished that. So as we move forward from there, then as day 2 and beyond progresses, we're looking to be able to integrate both the Hess and Speedway operations to take advantage of the synergies that are available there and the capital that we'll spend this year, as far as new store openings, we did have an organic growth plan in the base Speedway business and we're continuing to execute on that. We're probably going to complete approximately 60 new store or rebuild openings this year. So we're balancing the focus on both the existing or the base Speedway business as well as the integration, the reidentification and then eventually some remodeling of some of the Hess assets to bring the entire chain together under a common brand.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Got it. Okay. And then on the acquisition side of things?
Anthony R. Kenney: We don't comment on what we may or may not want to do in that arena. I think it's going to be opportunistic. We'll look at things, but beyond that, probably don't have much I can add to that.
Operator: And our next question comes from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank.
Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: A couple of follow-up questions. I know it's kind of theoretical at this point, but on Capline, if the decision were to be made following the study about a potential reversal, what would be the timing in terms of how long it would take to get that done?
Gary R. Heminger: Ryan, it's just way too early to look at that, including in the study. First of all, they're going to do a market study, supply demand study. Then if it would point towards -- let's look at from an engineering standpoint, what it would take. We've already done some work, but a lot of hydraulic analysis work needs to be complete. So we're not far enough yet that I can give you a good timeframe.
Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And another follow-up on the retail side on the MLP and the retail eligible income. The question is I think it sounds like the EBITDA is purely kind of throughput volume x margin on the retail business. Does that include at all any of the rental income or leasing income from the stations? And then on the -- would we expect, if this were eventually to make its way into an MLP, would it be a stand-alone MLP? Or would you drop it into MPLX?
Gary R. Heminger: Don?
Donald C. Templin: The calculation is truly a volume times $0.03 per gallon. So we're primarily focused in that analysis on -- or that estimation on refinery to rack volumes. It does not include anything that would be incremental to that. So it's 20 billion gallons times $0.03. With respect to sort of plans for how it gets dropped, when it gets dropped, we are going to get continue to evaluate the timing and what makes sense. And I guess, our view is, it's just increased our portfolio of opportunity. The opportunity set is now bigger and gives us even more confidence in our ability to really grow MPLX, so that we can participate in this midstream infrastructure build-out.
Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And I guess, if I can just one final one actually on the refining business. Your gasoline yield was down to probably the lowest level that we've seen in quite a while in the quarter. Is this a sustainable trend? And I mean I think you were at 45% yield in the quarter. And if we're moving in that direction, can you continue to reduce that yield and shift more towards distillate further going forward? Or how should we think about that going forward?
Richard D. Bedell: This is Rich Bedell. I think probably that's more a reflection of some of the turnarounds that were going on in the process units that were offline for turnaround than anything else. There hasn't really been a fundamental shift in our yields. We have been increasing our distillate percentage through some of the projects and that will continue on into some next year, but nothing that would have swung those volumes other than maybe turnarounds.
Operator: And our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I'd like to come back a bit on the Capline. Can you walk us through the ownership structure and what the decision-making process is there? I understand, too early to say what the timing would be and all that, but how exactly are decisions made there, what's your influence is , et cetera?
Gary R. Heminger: Right. There are 3 owners BP, Planes and Marathon. And in order to be able to make a change of service, like this study is going to be done, it takes all 3 to approve such change.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then coming back to the other gross margin that Doug asked about earlier. Obviously, it was a big component of the Q2 out performance and Q3's overall performance. Any guidance you can give us at this point? I know you're not big on guidance, but maybe some help you can give us on how to think about that kind of performance as we look forward, not just to the fourth quarter, but also to next year, is there some seasonality to that number? Is it just a function of market conditions at any given moment? Maybe any color you can offer us on that would be helpful?
Donald C. Templin: As Roger, I guess, what I would say is both the second quarter and this quarter, the comparable periods last year included some noise around sort of the RIN impact on the market. You'll recall that we use market indicators that start with the 6-3-2-1 crack and we try to build to it. One of the reasons that we wanted to show and have been showing a sequential walk is to maybe give a little bit of color or maybe the absence of a really big green bar or change quarter-to-quarter would suggest that maybe the unusual circumstances existed last year as opposed to the unusual circumstances existing this year.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: So if we were to compare to 2012, we might not see such a large green bar. Is this the other way to think about that?
Donald C. Templin: That might be -- I have not done that, but that might be another way to do it. We are also growing our portfolio and our sort of reach every year as well. But I think '13 was a little bit abnormal, and so that's why you're seeing maybe the big differences.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then the last question on the acceleration and the MLP, whether it's internal drop-downs or something on the other side. What would you look at in terms of acquisitions? I mean, should we think of something that's a fairly significant step out? Or is it -- you want to kind of stick close to your knitting? Or you want to something close to the assets you already hold?
Gary R. Heminger: Roger, it's too early to -- and we don't comment on M&A activity, but what I said in my script was, we expect to be a very big player in the -- for the development of the North America oil and gas transformation and renaissance. So and that includes all liquids, not just oil and refined products, but also the natural gas and LPG markets. So we have the capacity, it's from an operating and engineering standpoint, to operate in all of those different businesses. So we plan on being right on the forefront of that development.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: All right. Casting a wide net and now we are all going to be MLP analysts as well.
Gary R. Heminger: There you go.
Operator: And our last question comes from Allen Good from MorningStar.

Operator: Welcome to the Marathon Petroleum Corporation's Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. My name is Jeanette and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Tim Griffith. Mr. Griffith, you may begin.
Timothy T. Griffith: Okay. Thank you, Jeanette, and good morning. Welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's second quarter 2014 earnings webcast and conference call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, President and CEO; Don Templin, Senior Vice President and CFO; Mike Palmer, Senior Vice President of Supply, Distribution and Planning; Pam Beall, Senior Vice President of Corporate Planning and Government and Public Affairs; and Rich Bedell, Senior Vice President of Refining. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Slide #2 and to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well as in our filings with the SEC. Now I'm happy to turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks and highlights. Gary?
Gary R. Heminger: Thanks, Tim, and good morning to everyone. We are pleased to report a very strong quarter. Our focus on top-tier operational performance across the MPC refining, marketing and transportation system has continued to yield excellent results. This quarter, we were able to officially meet consumers' needs and capture higher product price realizations, which demonstrate the value of our integrated system. I'm especially pleased with our smooth ramp up following the largest concentration of turnaround activity in our company's history, which we executed in the first quarter. I am also very proud of the tremendous response by our team in Garyville, Louisiana, to bring the facility back up to full capacity quickly after it was impacted by a tornado in late May. Balancing return of capital to shareholders with investments in the business remains a priority. We purchased $459 million of shares in the second quarter. Yesterday, our Board of Directors authorized up to an additional $2 billion of share repurchases through July of 2016, and increased the quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share. During the 12 months ended June 30, we have returned $3.1 billion of capital to shareholders, representing a 13.5% yield against our average share price. This is one of the highest effective yields of any company in our comparator group. We also have made excellent progress on our strategic priority of growing our higher value to the stable cash flow of businesses, while we continue meaningful return of capital to our shareholders. In the midstream, we recently exercised our option to acquire a 35% ownership interest in Enbridge Inc.'s Southern Access Extension pipeline project. This investment will position us as an equity owner in a system that will increase our access to an important region for North American crude oil production growth, as well as provide a potential addition to MPLX over time. MPC expects to invest approximately $295 million in the pipeline project that is expected to be completed in mid 2015. On the retail side, we have received notice from the Federal Trade Commission that it concluded its review of the acquisition of Hess retail operations by our subsidiary, Speedway, which continues to prepare for a closing later this year. We continue to believe that there is significant opportunity to leverage the best of both businesses. Hess fuel sales volume with Speedway's industry-leading merchandise sales per store. We believe this acquisition will be a source of long-term value to MPC and provides for enhanced strategic opportunity for the business over time. I also want to address an item that is affecting perceptions of our industry: the recently publicized private rulings for limited condensate exports. Unfortunately, the rulings by the Commerce Department are not transparent and have created much uncertainty about exports going forward. We think the market has overreacted to the news that is not clear -- that is not a clear change in policy and an outcome that remains uncertain. We believe that our industry has the ability to handle much more of the light shale crude oil and condensate than is processed today. But the investments to do so will not likely be made in the environment of uncertainty that has been created. Whatever the outcome, refiners in the U.S. will continue to have a transportation advantage. Even if the export infrastructure is built, the cost advantage for U.S. refiners will continue to be significant due to proximity to the domestic production. We are confident the flexibility and optionality in our system positions of MPC -- positions MPC very well in any circumstance. In addition, we continue to believe the return profiles for the condensate splitters under construction at our Canton, Ohio and Catlettsburg refineries will be strong given the geographic proximity of those refineries to the Utica condensate production. With that, I'll turn it over to Don to review our financial performance for the quarter. Don?
Donald C. Templin: Thanks, Gary. Slide #4 provides earnings, both on an absolute and per share basis. Our second quarter 2014 earnings were $855 million compared to $593 million in the second quarter of 2013. Second quarter 2014 earnings include pretax pension settlement expenses of $5 million, while the second quarter of 2013 included $60 million of such expenses. Earnings per diluted share were $2.95 for the second quarter of 2014. We reported $1.83 per share for the same period last year. The bridge on Slide 5 shows the change in earnings by segment from the second quarter of 2013 to the second quarter of 2014. The primary driver for the change was the increase in Refining & Marketing segment income, which I will discuss shortly. The corporate and other unallocated item includes a $55 million favorable variance due to pension settlement expenses. As shown on Slide 6, Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was $1.260 billion in the second quarter of 2014 compared with $903 million in the same quarter last year. The change from 2013 was primarily due to higher product price realizations. That impact is reflected in the $657 million change in Other Gross Margin. You may recall that the second quarter 2013 product price realizations compared to spot market values were negatively impacted by volatility in the Chicago market and effects of the Renewable Fuel Standard. The effects of the Renewable Fuel Standard were more pronounced in the second quarter last year, causing the average RIN prices to be almost $0.35 higher than they were in the second quarter of this year. The increase in LLS prompt versus delivered also had a favorable impact on earnings that was offset by more narrow LLS to WTI crude differentials and backwardation in the market. Direct operating costs also increased quarter-over-quarter due to additional maintenance costs and higher natural gas prices versus last year. To help investors better understand the quarter, we've added Slide 7, which provides a sequential earnings walk for our Refining & Marketing segment. The primary drivers for the significant increase in income over the first quarter were higher crack spreads and lower refinery operating expenses. The LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread was $10.40 in the second quarter compared to $7.85 in the first quarter. This added about $568 million in additional earnings. Refinery direct operating costs provide a favorable variance of $398 million, primarily due to lower turnaround costs in the second quarter. The favorable other gross margin variance is primarily due to higher product price realizations. Turning to Speedway segment results on Slide 8, income from operations was $94 million in the second quarter of 2014 compared with $123 million in the second quarter of 2013. Speedway's light product gross margin was $32 million lower in the second quarter of 2014 compared to the same quarter last year, as gross margin decreased by $0.046 per gallon. Merchandise margin was $224 million in the second quarter of 2014 compared with $212 million in 2013. This $12 million increase was primarily due to higher merchandise sales and margin percentage. The unfavorable $9 million other variance primarily relates to Speedway's operating expenses. Operating expenses were higher during the second quarter of 2014, primarily driven by an increase in the number of stores versus previous-year levels. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes decreased 1.5% and merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes, increased 4.6% in the second quarter of 2014 compared to the second quarter of 2013. Activity in July has been positive with a 1% increase in same-store gasoline sales volumes versus the prior year. Slide 9 shows changes in our Pipeline Transportation segment income. Income from operations was $81 million in the second quarter of 2014 compared with $58 million in the second quarter of 2013. The increase of $23 million was primarily attributable to higher transportation revenue and pipeline affiliate income. $9 million of the $12 million increase in transportation revenue was attributable to the recognition of deferred transportation credits during the quarter. The remainder was primarily due to higher average tariff rates. The increase in pipeline affiliate income was primarily attributable to our ownership interest in LOOP. Slide 10 presents the significant drivers of changes in our cash flow for the second quarter of 2014. At June 30, our cash balance was just over $2.1 billion. Operating cash flow, before changes in working capital, was an approximately $1.1 billion source of cash due to the very strong financial performance in the second quarter. As Gary highlighted, we continued delivering on our commitment to balance investments in the business with return of capital to our shareholders. We repurchased $459 million of shares and paid $122 million of dividends in the second quarter. We also increased our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share. This increase represents a 32% compound annual growth rate from the dividend level established at the time of the spin in June 2011. Slide 11 shows that at the end of the second quarter, we had $2.1 billion of cash and just over $3.6 billion of debt. With EBITDA of about $4.3 billion during the last 12 months, we continue to be in a very manageable debt position with leverage of 0.8x EBITDA and a debt-to-total-capital ratio of 25%. Turning to Slide 12. During the last 12 months, we generated $3.4 billion in cash from operations and $1.7 billion of free cash flow. Over this period, we've returned $3.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases or approximately 1.8x our free cash flow. During the second quarter of 2014, we purchased approximately 5 million shares for $459 million through open market purchases. It is our intention to continue returning capital to our shareholders that is not currently needed to support the operational and investment needs of the business, and we continue to believe share repurchases are the most efficient way to do so. The additional $2 billion board authorization adds to the approximately $700 million remaining on previous share repurchase authorizations and reinforces our commitment to continuing this activity in the future. As Gary indicated and you've heard from us on multiple occasions, maintaining a balance between disciplined investments in the business and returning capital to shareholders continues to be a strategic focus. Slide 13 provides our outlook for key operating metrics for MPC for the third quarter of 2014. We are planning for third quarter throughput volumes to be comparable to the second quarter of 2014 and down slightly compared to the third quarter last year, due to higher planned maintenance. Now I will turn the call back over to Tim Griffith.
Timothy T. Griffith: Thanks, Don. [Operator Instructions] With that, Jeanette, we are prepared to open up the call to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from Ed Westlake of Crédit Suisse.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Congratulations and thanks for researching the cost advantages of the U.S. refiners. I was actually down at the BIS and they said, "As long as it goes through distillation towers and looks like product we can sell it," which sounds like a refinery to me. So the first question, just a small one, on the Garyville, it seems like the opportunity cost for this [ph] may be lower than you thought. I mean, do you have a number for that?
Donald C. Templin: Ed, we didn't -- we don't have a specific number, I guess. When we -- after the tornado had hit, we'd indicated that the impact on crude throughput would be less than 5%. And the team did an amazing job of getting that fully operational in about 14 or 15 days. So the impact on sort of crude throughputs was not that significant.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then, great color on the deltas and there's that other gross margin number, which obviously does vary over time. And obviously, thanks for shouting out how bad it was last year, which is some normalization this year. But is there any structural change, do you think, in terms of that contribution from, say, pricing over and above the cracks that you mentioned?
Gary R. Heminger: Ed, this is Gary. I wouldn't say there's a structural change. But if you compare the slides of the price realization, as Don was going to, as compared to Speedway, you can see that there was a change in Speedway's gross margin for the quarter, just illustrates how important our integrated system is and how we can take advantage of the marketplace and that dislocation as illustrated in those 2 slides. So I wouldn't to say it's a structural change, it's we have the ability to go to where the margin is.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. So then my just strategic question was just around the logistics business. Any sort of color or update you can provide in terms of where you see the EBITDA of your overall logistics business standing a few years out? And whether there's any change to your fairly consistent guidance in terms of a steady monetization of that via the MPLX?
Gary R. Heminger: I would say, first of all, we're still in pretty much the same steady state of, we said, about $800 million left from -- as compared to what we've already dropped down. That does not include the Sandpiper and SAX pipeline, nor does that include Cornerstone that we're working on now. So if you add those in, we're probably into circa $1.2 billion of EBITDA over time. As far as the ratability of drop downs and -- we look at MPLX as a great currency. And we want that currency to be very strong today, and we want it to be very strong as we drop down over many years to come. There certainly have been some other changes in the marketplace that some are employing. That continues to illustrate how important these MLPs and the growth trajectory of MLPs are. We expect to remain at a high level of compounded annual growth and -- which is what we have emphasized quarter-on-quarter, Ed. So we want this currency to be strong today, we want it to be strong tomorrow, and we're going to continue to manage within those parameters.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And vision-wise, I mean the North American infrastructure spend and opportunity set continues to get larger. Just a question, presume you are still looking very hard at additional projects over and above the ones that you mentioned on the call today.
Gary R. Heminger: We certainly are, Ed. As I've said many times, MPLX is going to be a growth vehicle for our midstream, but it's not going to be tied, like it has been historically, just to the volume that MPC moves. So we have the ability, the intellectual capabilities to branch out, whether it would be into NGLs, whether it's into transportation fuels or other opportunities that are eligible earnings for an MLP. We believe we have the capacity to do any.
Operator: And we have a question from Doug Leggate of Bank of America.
Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: It's actually Jason Smith on for Doug. So I just wanted to dig again into your strong catch [ph] rate relative to your peers. It looks like your distillate yield also increased relative to gasoline. Gary, if you can maybe talk about if there's any specific that was driving that, and is that sustainable going forward?
Gary R. Heminger: Let me ask Rich to talk about the distillate yield first.
Richard D. Bedell: Jason other than just optimizing on crude slates, we did finish a hydrocracker project at Garyville in the first quarter, which increased its capacity. The design capacity was to increase it by about 10,000 barrels a day -- excuse me, 20,000 barrels a day. And that was successfully put on stream at the end of the first quarter.
Gary R. Heminger: But I will say, Jason, that we really haven't had any other structural change in the way we're operating.
Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And to follow up. And I mean, so when you guys bring on the Garyville hydrocracker and some of your other projects, I mean where can you see that distillate yield potentially going to in time?
Gary R. Heminger: Are you talking about the Garyville reset hydrocracker?
Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Yes.
Gary R. Heminger: The project? Well, first of all, we haven't sanctioned that project. And it won't be until the fourth quarter, early first quarter, that we make our final determination. And we do not have all the engineering complete yet to be able to give you that number. We do expect, if we were to do that, it would add about 25,000 barrels a day of ultra low-sulfur [ph] diesel. But really what that project, and Rich can go into the details of what that project is doing as far as our feedstock slate.
Richard D. Bedell: Yes, I mean, that -- what we call the ROUX project, that reset hydrocracker project. It increases, like Gary said, I think it's about 28,000 barrels a day of distillate. It decreases our gas oil imports, and really, it's just -- it's a project based on the spreads between resid and ULSD.
Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Follow-up is maybe for Don. Don, so you mentioned that you guys want to keep the buybacks going. But given the retail acquisition and given that you guys have talked about a kind of $500 million to $1.5 billion targeted cash level, how should we think about the pace of buybacks going forward? Should we expect it to potentially slow from this kind of $400 million or $500 million a quarter?
Donald C. Templin: Well, I think, we've consistently said that it's very important for us to maintain our investment grade credit profile. And we've consistently said that we're going to manage the core liquidity, that's the $500 million to $1.5 billion you have referenced there, Jason. I think, we've also had conversations with you all about the fact that our balance sheet, even maintaining a strong investment grade credit profile, could take on incremental leverage. So we would expect that we would fund the acquisition with cash, but we'll also be accessing the debt markets to do that because we do think it's an important part of the investment thesis in MPC to be returning capital to shareholders and we're very confident and our board is very confident, based upon the recent announcement yesterday of the share repurchase authorization, that we can continue to do so.
Operator: And our next question comes from Paul Cheng of Barclays.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Before I ask my question, just want to have a request to Don. As over the next couple of years that the GP speed start to moving up to the high-speed, if possible that you would be really helpful, I think, for all of us, so that we don't have to check so many different 10-Q document, you actually on your press release, to list out what [ph] Is in your GP cash flow, and what is your unit of the LP given that sometime with the job done, you may change?
Donald C. Templin: Okay, Paul, good suggestion. We'll continue -- we think, MPLX, and particularly, the GP, is a real value adder. And so we'll do that in order to make -- highlight that important cash flow.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Yes, 2 questions. First, a simple one. Gary, there's a speculation CITGO may be selling their refining asset. From an M&A standpoint, how you look at your portfolio. You're pretty satisfied or that you think you have more appetite, you want to expand your refining footprint further from your current portfolio?
Gary R. Heminger: Well, I have read this rumor that CITGO might be interested in doing something, but I would say right now, we're pretty satisfied with our footprint.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. The second question, maybe, that's for both Don and Gary. If we're looking at the pace of your job done, comparing to some of your peers, is a formal measure. I think, that's 2 school of thoughts, and given the valuation for the GP is significantly different than any for the LP and the refiner C-corp. And also that from an investment standpoint, is it better off there for you to accelerate substantially on your job done pace so that you will allow the MPLX actually use their own balance sheet for their future organic growth, [indiscernible] instead of using the C-corp, and also, they're seeing the value of the GP grow at a much faster pace.
Gary R. Heminger: Well, Paul, I would say I agree with all of the above. But as I said, we think we have an outstanding currency. That currency has been very valuable today. It gives us the flexibility in the event we want to accelerate. If we need to accelerate for MPC purposes or we want to accelerate for MPLX purposes, we have that tremendous flexibility. But at the end of the day, we want to make sure the currency is valuable going forward. Yes, we have been measured and, yes, we're watching what's going on in the marketplace. But all of your suggestions, I think it was more of a statement than a question. I think all of your suggestions are spot on and is things that we study very, very carefully.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Can I just sneak in with a final question for clarification?
Donald C. Templin: Only for you, Paul.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: For the $800 million of the potential job done of the $1.2 billion, are those including the storage tank inside the refinery gate and the barges that you own?
Donald C. Templin: Yes, sir.
Operator: And our next question comes from Doug Terreson of ISI Group.
Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Gary, one of your mantras has been value-added investment and sustained focus on shareholder returns and obviously, the company has delivered in that area. And on this point, I wanted to see if there was some type of generic progress report that we could talk about on Galveston Bay synergy capture and projected capital that were referred to at the recent Analyst Meeting, that is if there is one. You highlighted a couple of slides and I just wanted to see if you could provide somewhat of a generic update as to how happy you are with the outcome there?
Gary R. Heminger: Yes, Doug, and good morning to you as well. We're very, very pleased with Galveston Bay. First of all, it's an outstanding employee base, an outstanding workforce with a great work ethic. Secondly, as we've gone through now about 16, 17 months of operation, we continue to get more and more comfortable with the asset. You recognized it was in our K and will be updated in the Q here. The -- what the earnout was that at the -- the earnout payment to -- that we had to the prior owner was right in line with what we said, which says, the refinery is performing on a financial basis very well. I had stated earlier in our last conference call that this is an important year. We've already finished a major turnaround in the plant where we went in and repaired and really got things up to standards on the -- I will call, the crude side of the equation. And as I said, it's an important year. We still have another big turnaround to complete this year on the aromatic side of the business. Once that is complete, we will have pretty much been through the refinery. Then we're going to go to the low hanging fruit. The preliminary meetings that Rich and his team have had with me suggest there is a lot of low-hanging high-return projects that we can do. So I'm very pleased with the value generation, very pleased with how this positions us in the marketplace. And now with the Hess acquisition and picking up additional Colonial line space, we now have been able to pick up 90,000 barrels a day of Colonial line space, which -- between these 2 transactions, which I think gives us significant advantage to the marketplace to have that assured line space all the way to the East Coast. So, Rich, I don't know if you have anything else to add, but -- operationally, but we are very pleased, Doug.
Richard D. Bedell: Yes, I'll just ditto Gary's comments that we see that the refinery has a lot of upside potential from where it is now. And that's part of our capital budget process, and we're going through those options today. And they become clear as we learn more and more about the facility.
Operator: And our next question comes from Jeff Dietert of Simmons.
Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Jeff Dietert with Simmons. My question is regarding domestic crude price discounts in the back half of the year given continued robust oil production growth, upcoming fall maintenance and belated startups of new pipes into the Gulf Coast. What's your outlook for the back half of the year? I think, the forward curve has got WTI-Brent, over $10 and LLS-Brent to widen out around $7. Do you think that's a reasonable outlook or do you expect wider or narrower?
C. Michael Palmer: Jeff, this is Mike Palmer. I think that when you look at the forward curves that have things widening out a bit, I think that, generally, that does make sense to us. We haven't seen the kind of price signal from the domestic light crude oil that I think really would test refiners to run as much as they possibly could. I do think, as production continues to rise, as the BridgeTex pipeline gets built into Houston, I do think that there is the likelihood that you could see these differentials widen a bit. So what we're seeing in the forward market just generally makes sense to us.
Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: And is there a point that you look at between, say, Mars and LLS, at which you really see a move towards lights being economically advantaged over mediums, does it need to get inside of a $3 discount or is there any kind of rule of thumb we can use to think about that?
C. Michael Palmer: No, I don't think I really could give you a rule of thumb. We're running our LPs every day. It really depends upon the product values in the market and which way we go between, say, LLS or Mars. I can tell you that with the recent price action generally over the last, I'll say, 6 months, that it's back and forth between whether you'd want to run LLS or Mars. But that's something we just have to look at every day.
Gary R. Heminger: And Jeff, one other key point. When we look at how much medium sour versus light we run, and it's a point that I make in D.C., it's a point that I make with the financial community, the market is far from saturated of running light sweet crude. We have the ability to run approximately 65% light sweet crude. We only ran approximately 45%, 46% in the quarter. So it's -- every barrel, as you know, is an alternative barrel. So again, that just shows there is tremendous opportunity, but we're always going to choose the most economical barrel.
Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Yes, and in weekly statistics, we're seeing Gulf Coast oil imports coming down and some of the pricing that's visible in the marketplace has increased on oil imports. Are you seeing a shift in your portfolio away from importing oil towards more domestic consumption?
Gary R. Heminger: Well, as I said, every barrel is an alternative barrel. So we're always going to look at what is the most economic barrel for us to purchase, and that's going to set the tone for us every day. As we look across the global supply chain. And again, this issue of condensate exports, I think, really is a sticky wicket in the marketplace today, if you will. Because the lack of transparency and the unknown has changed. I think some people, some foreign suppliers' ideas on how to supply the North American market, it's changed some of the South American suppliers and how they want to supply the North American market. I think it's going to take about 90 days, probably, for that stuff to sort itself out.
Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Public policy through private letter rulings is not a real efficient way of communicating the requirements.
Gary R. Heminger: I echo that.
Operator: And our next question comes from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research.
Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: I was extremely impressed that you just made a cricket analogy -- sticky wicket, Gary. Very impressive. I've just got a few follow-ups to the various discussions. Firstly, on the crude exports thing, would you guys have any possible incentive to export crude? And I'm thinking obviously of the LOOP.
Gary R. Heminger: That's something, Paul, that we've looked at as -- LOOP as a part of the infrastructure. But let me kind of share with you how LOOP is built. You have 3 SPMs to unload these ships. Everything flows from the gulf into the shore base. We do not have the capability to bidirectionally flow that. We've looked at it. There's been some consideration, but in order to be able to pay off that investment to bidirectionally load, you would have to have significant volume. So technically, it could be done over time, but you'd have to change everything from the caverns at Galliano and change the flow pattern from Galliano all the way back out to the unloading platform in order to be able to do that, which would be a significant project and very, very costly. But we have looked at it.
Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: I think, it's fair to say it's the only major offloading, onloading potential point in the U.S. right now, isn't it, for deepwater?
Gary R. Heminger: Yes, it is, Paul. And we'll just see -- I don't -- I do not believe that we're ever going to see that type of volume that would be required to be able to justify that type of a project. Certainly, not on the condensate export side. And when you look at the curves, long term, of domestic production versus whether or not we should export, I think, the markets are going to suggest, and the way the global producers are supplying the market, I think, long term, the global price will suggest that it's going to be very challenging to be able to support those type of economics and that type of investment.
Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: Sure. A quick follow-up is, did you mention -- apologies if you did, the product volumes of exports that you had this past quarter?
Donald C. Templin: Paul, this is Don. It was 298,000 barrels a day.
Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: Could we get gasoline-disti [ph] split?
Donald C. Templin: I'm sorry.
Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: Could you split the gasoline out for us?
Donald C. Templin: Yes, just 1 second, please.
Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: And I'll just follow up quickly rather than dominate the whole call. Obviously, a bit surprised that there was less contribution than I would have anticipated for the sweet/sour differential. Could you just talk a little bit about that and any outlook? I know you have already addressed some of this on the call, but any further thoughts on that particular differential, which I know you're very sensitive to?
Gary R. Heminger: Mike just reviewed the differentials on a prior question. Mike, you want to mention that again?
C. Michael Palmer: Yes. I mean, specifically, with regard to the sweet/sour differential, Paul, I think that -- during the second quarter, I think that when you look at the Canadian heavy, for example, we had fairly reasonable differentials. And we expect to see those in the same kind of level going forward. When you look at the LLS Mars, I don't think there was anything that was particularly noteworthy.
Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: Yes, I guess then -- no, I'm just looking at the variance as you mentioned on Slide 7, but I guess, essentially, those differentials were more or less flat with Q1. So that deals with that. Okay. And the gasoline?
Donald C. Templin: And Paul, it's 2/3 distillate, 1/3 gasoline. So just over 200,000 barrels a day of distillate and the remainder is gasoline.
Operator: And our next question comes from Roger Read of Wells Fargo.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I guess, the first thing I would like to maybe get a little more clarity on. I was just comparing your refining margins this year in the second quarter to last year, and then just kind of a quick skim across your peer group. A much better quarter relative to your numbers, and certainly, relative to your peers. I'm just wondering, as you walk through the various items, since everybody is dealing with the similar volumes of crude and pricing of the crude, was there a hedging impact? Was there something where you're able to move the crude around better? Do you believe it was mostly a geographical event? I'm just trying to understand kind of the moving parts here, maybe a function of how much downtime you had last year in the second quarter where you weren't able to realize as well against expected crack spreads?
Donald C. Templin: Yes, I guess -- Roger, this is Don. I would say it's more a function of our capability to be able to provide refined product to the markets where it was needed and the flexibility that we have with our logistics system, including our significant marine or barge system that allows us to be very flexible in moving product to markets where there is a good demand. So I think, historically, you've seen that we've been able to capture good margin from that -- price realizations compared to spot market prices. And we clearly were able to do that this quarter as well. I mean, if you saw the difference between sort of Slide 6 and Slide 7, Slide 6, that $657 million of other gross margin was really a comparator to a quarter where -- last year, where you had some unusual noise because of RINs and because of volatility in the Chicago market. One of the reasons we put in Slide 7 was we thought it also would demonstrate that $159 million is substantially or predominantly our ability to realize product realizations over spot. And we thought that would help people sort of triangulate, if you will, how we're doing in that area.
Gary R. Heminger: Roger, there were no onetime hedging gains or anything, either.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Yes, that's what I'm trying to understand. So basically, it's -- I mean, it's the flexibility in your system and it sounds like to some extent, downstream from the refining gate in terms of where you're able to move the product at a given moment.
Donald C. Templin: Yes, I would say definitely downstream from the refining gate.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's what I was just trying to understand. If it was simply a utilization thing or something more deep. And it sounds like it's on the more deep side. Follow-up question, CapEx, you've got the slide there first of the Appendix, and it looks like, if I do the math, you've got a huge spend in the Pipeline Transportation side coming up in the back half and a relatively healthy growth in Speedway. I'm assuming that's x anything going on with the acquisition of Hess's retail business. Just wondering if you could give us some clarity on kind of what the plans are there?
Gary R. Heminger: Yes, so I think, your presumption is correct. It is x Hess acquisition for Speedway. On the Pipeline Transportation side, we did expect that a good portion of that would be back-ended, particularly with our investments in SAX and Sandpiper. So we expect that we will broadly be at that $2.4 billion by the end of the year. It's just sort of how those dollars are being spent and the timing of when they're being spent, Roger.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And any particular project you could highlight for us in the Pipeline?
Gary R. Heminger: Well, for Pipeline Transportation, SAX and Sandpiper, are 2 of the bigger pieces.
Operator: Our next question comes from Faisel Khan of Citigroup.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just going back to the other sort of gross margin bucket. If I go to Slide 20, where you sort of look at the absolute numbers, the $477 million of sort of other gross margins. I just want to make sure I understand this right. So you're saying that this is sort of a function of your sort of spot to rack margins farther down between your refining gate and your terminals, is that a fair assumption in terms of --
Donald C. Templin: Yes. So Faisel, I mean, historically, I think when you guys -- when we provided the market metrics that get us to indicated gross margin, there has always been sort of the difference between that indicated gross margin, and our reported gross margin has broadly been, I would say, in the $200 million to $300 million range. And that in second quarter of '13, it was a -- it was under that number, due in large part to the sort of noise around the RINs and how it impacted the spot prices. So in this quarter, I would say the difference between sort of the $200 million or $300 million that you would normally expect to see is the ability to -- the product price -- incremental product price realization that we were able to realize during the quarter.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Is that just a function of basis, like if I look at either near New York Harbor or if I look at -- New York Harbor versus like Gulf Coast or sort of the Florida market versus the Gulf Coast in terms of gasoline and also distillate price?
Donald C. Templin: I think some of it is that, we're using, for example, in the Midwest, Chicago, 6-3-2-1 crack, and our activity in the Midwest is all over the Midwest, including markets that aren't in Chicago. So we're always -- we tell -- we think we have a lot of flexibility. We know we have a lot of flexibility in the ability to supply markets, and we use that flexibility to make sure that we're optimizing value.
Gary R. Heminger: Faisel, I would say, it's the -- it just illustrates the efficiency of our system probably to be able to move to the markets quicker than anyone else.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Yes, I know, and that's definitely clear from the results. I'm just trying to figure out if there's things that we can look at in the market quarter-to-quarter that might help us sort of gauge how much this other gross margin moves around. But I guess, following up on this is, with the Hess acquisition, how much is this other gross margin do you think going to change?
Donald C. Templin: That will remain to be seen. But as we said, when we roll out the Hess acquisition, it gives us -- it just helps with the efficiency of our system. Now we'll have nearly 75% of short volume that we know where the volume is going. We picked up tremendous pipeline space on Colonial, and other pipelines have been servicing the Northeast and some of the Southeast markets. So we think it will be an add-on to our business today.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: With the Hess piece, how much total capacity will you guys have on Colonial after this is all said and done?
Gary R. Heminger: I don't think that we have made that public individually.

Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2014 Earnings Marathon Petroleum Corporation Conference Call. My name is Sylvia, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Tim Griffith. Tim Griffith, you may begin.
Timothy T. Griffith: Okay. Thank you, Sylvia. And again, welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's First Quarter 2014 Earnings Webcast and Conference Call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab. On the call today are Gary Heminger, President and CEO; Don Templin, Senior Vice President and CFO; Mike Palmer, Senior Vice President of Supply, Distribution and Planning; Pam Beall, Senior Vice President of Corporate Planning and Government and Public Affairs and President of MPLX; and Rich Bedell, Senior Vice President of Refining. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well as in our filings with the SEC. Now, I'll turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks and highlights.
Gary R. Heminger: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, and thank you for joining our call. We reported this morning that we generated nearly $200 million of income during the first quarter despite the number of challenges. The MPC team successfully completed significant turnaround activity at our 2 largest refineries in Galveston Bay and Garyville. This was the first turnaround at Galveston Bay since we acquired the facility in February of last year, and we were pleased to complete the work on schedule with no major surprises. This project, along with other maintenance work across our operations, made up the largest quarterly combined turnaround activity in our history, with expenditures of approximately $470 million for the quarter. This continued investment in our system helps ensure we maintain the highest levels of asset integrity, and enables us to drive continued top-tier operational performance. Market conditions during the first quarter were challenging. Volatile but generally narrower crude differentials were partially offset by higher crack spreads. Adverse weather conditions in the form of low temperatures and heavy snow accumulations in most of our markets brought challenges to the entire supply chain, from crude deliveries to the gas pump. Despite the market challenges and adverse weather conditions, I was very pleased with the team's focus on strong operational performance. We also continued to diversify our asset portfolio during the quarter. On April 1, we expanded our renewable fuels capabilities with the purchase of a biodiesel manufacturing facility in Cincinnati, Ohio. This facility has the capacity of approximately 60 million gallons per year of biodiesel and is well positioned, logistically, near the Ohio River. This facility fits well with our existing marine and terminal system. We also acquired an additional 7% interest in Explorer Pipeline, which increased our ownership interest to 25% in that system. This investment is consistent with our strategic objective of meaningfully growing our midstream portfolio and adding to the stable cash flow segments of our business. Despite the challenging market conditions in our Refining & Marketing segment, we returned $812 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the quarter. Don will provide more information on this activity shortly, but I want to highlight that we remain confident in our ability to generate cash to continue our balanced approach to investing in value-enhancing investments in the business and returning capital to our shareholders over the long term. We are encouraged by the signs of improving market conditions, with Refining returning to full run rates that support our positive outlook for the business. Market dynamics, including inventory levels and continued increases in domestic production, are leading to widening crude differentials, which we believe will persist for some time. And with that, I'll turn over to Don to review our financial performance for the quarter.
Donald C. Templin: Thanks, Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings both on an absolute and per share basis. Our first quarter 2014 earnings were $199 million compared to $725 million in the first quarter of 2013. First quarter 2014 earnings include pretax settlement expenses of $64 million, which we've historically been presenting as a special item in arriving at adjusted earnings. First quarter earnings were also impacted by a $29 million pretax accrual for 2013 bonuses that were paid in 2014. As you know, our bonuses are based on relative performance to our peer group, and certain of that information was not available until 2014. Earnings per diluted share were $0.67 for the first quarter of 2014. We reported EPS of $2.17 per share for the same period last year. The waterfall chart on Slide 5 shows by segment the change in earnings from the first quarter of 2013 to the first quarter of 2014. The primary driver for the change was the decrease in Refining & Marketing segment income. As shown on Slide 6, Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was $362 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared with $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2013. The changes from 2013 was primarily due to the narrowing crude oil differentials and higher direct operating costs, partially offset by wider crack spreads. Results were also impacted by refining throughputs, which were lower than expected due to heavy turnaround activity and severe weather in the quarter. The unfavorable earnings impacts associated with the narrowing crude oil differentials are found in the columns for the sweet/sour differential and the LLS to WTI differential. The increase in direct operating costs quarter-over-quarter is primarily due to the significant turnarounds that occurred in the first quarter that Gary referred to earlier, as well as an additional month of operating expenses associated with the Galveston Bay refinery. Our earnings were favorably impacted by wider crack spreads as reflected in the LLS 6-3-2-1 crack. All of the gross margin indicators utilized spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and products sold. As a result, differences in our actual product price realizations, mix and crude costs quarter-to-quarter, as well as various other items like refinery yields, are reflected in the other gross margin column, which was a $148 million net benefit versus the same quarter last year. Turning to Speedway segment results from Slide 7. Income from operations were $58 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared with $67 million in the first quarter of last year. The cold weather impacted all aspects of Speedway's business. Light product gross margin was about $8 million lower in the first quarter of 2014 compared with the first quarter of 2013. The decrease was primarily due to $0.015 per gallon lower gross margin. Merchandise margin was $192 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared with $184 million in the same period last year. This $8 million increase was primarily due to higher merchandise sales and higher merchandise margins. Speedway's operating and other expenses were also $9 million higher during the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013, primarily driven by an increase in store count and additional operating costs associated with keeping our facility safe for our customers during the adverse weather conditions. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes decreased 0.7%, and merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes, increased 5.3% in the first quarter of 2014 compared with the 2013 first quarter. In April 2014, we've seen a slight decline in demand, with an approximately 1% decrease in same-store gasoline sales volumes versus the prior year, primarily due to higher average gasoline street prices. Slide 8 shows changes in our Pipeline Transportation segment income. Income from operations was $72 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared with $51 million in the first quarter of 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in transportation revenue and pipeline affiliate income, partially offset by higher operating expenses. $17 million of the $22 million increase in transportation revenue is attributable to the recognition of deferred transportation credits during the quarter. The remainder was primarily due to higher average tariff rates. Slide 9 presents the significant drivers of changes in our cash flow for the first quarter of 2014. At March 31, 2014, our cash balance was nearly $2.2 billion. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was a $641 million source of cash. A long-term debt increase of $264 million is primarily associated with MPLX's acquisition of additional midstream assets from MPC. As Gary highlighted, we continued delivering on our commitment to return capital to shareholders, with $689 million of share repurchases and $123 million of dividends paid in the first quarter. Slide 10 shows that at the end of the first quarter, we had nearly $2.2 billion of cash and approximately $3.7 billion of debt. With EBITDA of about $3.9 billion during the last 12 months, we continue to be in a very manageable debt position, with leverage of 0.9x EBITDA and a debt-to-total capital ratio of 25%. Turning to Slide 11. During the last 12 months, we generated $2.1 billion in cash from operations and $550 million of free cash flow. Over this period, we've returned $3.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This was more than 6x our free cash flow over that period. During the first quarter of 2014, we purchased approximately 8 million shares for $689 million through open market repurchases. It is our intention to continue returning capital to our shareholders that is not currently needed to support the operational and investment needs of the business, and we continue to believe share repurchases are the most efficient way to do so. There was $1.17 billion outstanding on our share repurchase authorization as of March 31, 2014. We intend to remain focused around our efforts to balance careful investment in the business with returning capital to our shareholders. Slide 12 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the second quarter of 2014. For comparative purposes, those same metrics for the second quarter of 2013 are also shown. Please note that estimated pension settlement expense is now included in the outlook information for corporate and on other unallocated items. With the recent published requirements around Tier 3 gasoline, I also wanted to provide an update on our projected compliance costs. Based on our current understanding of the standards and the changes necessary to our system, we broadly estimate that the costs could range from $750 million to $1 billion, and would be incurred between now and the end of 2019. We will continue to refine these estimates as well as identify opportunities to reduce the impact. I will note that the capital spending outlook we shared with you at our Investor Day in December included estimates for these costs. Now, I will turn the call back over to Tim Griffith.
Timothy T. Griffith: Thanks, Don. [Operator Instructions] With that, Sylvia, we're prepared to open up the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we have Ed Westlake from Crédit Suisse.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just on, obviously, the quarter there was obviously a lot of turnarounds at Galveston and Garyville. I -- Do you have a number for the opportunity costs? And then maybe if there were any sort of self-help improvements you've made at those refineries in terms of future profitability, if you could give us some color as to what changes you've made to the assets during the turnaround, if any.
Gary R. Heminger: Yes, Ed. We calculate the lost opportunity was approximately $150 million due to the maintenance activities that we had the first quarter. And we're very pleased with the -- as Galveston Bay has come back up and the run rates and how it's performing, and the same way with Garyville. Recall at Garyville we did 2 things. We had our normal maintenance of around the crude unit, but then we also had also did the big hydrocracker expansion. And Rich, you want to take a couple of minutes to talk about what you did at Garyville?
Richard D. Bedell: Yes, the hydrocracker expansion was one we talked about at the investor meeting last year. And that's where we took the capacity from 90,000 to 110,000 barrels a day, and that's online and running just fine. We did the -- there was a crude unit component to that distillate project that was done last fall and that was another 10,000 of distillate.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Great. And then a separate question just on the Mid-Con. Obviously, there's a lot of crude that's sloshing down to the Gulf, and that's helping profitability in the Gulf, but the Mid-Con crude markets seem relatively tight at the moment. I'm just -- any color in terms of what you're seeing in terms of the Mid-Con crude balances for light and heavy.
Gary R. Heminger: Let me turn that over to Mike.
C. Michael Palmer: Yes. Ed, right now, I don't think that there's anything particularly about the Mid-Con. I mean, I think you're referring to the lower balances of Cushing. And certainly, those balances are lower, but I think that really when we look out here at the second quarter, I think that what we're seeing right now are differentials are starting to come our way. The Brent TI spread has been widening. We're starting to see that some of this length that we've seen in the DOE numbers on inventories, we're starting to see that the differentials are starting to react to that. So it looks like we're heading into a pretty good period for crude differentials.
Operator: And we have Paul Cheng from Barclays.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Gary, after this major turnaround, do you view Galveston Bay now, from a hardware standpoint, has been raised to the standard that you want or that you need another turnaround cycle before you would get there?
Gary R. Heminger: Sure, Paul. And it's good to hear from you, I haven't heard from you in the last couple of quarters. And so the Galveston Bay turnaround, we're very pleased, and no, I don't think it takes another cycle. Of course, we will continue to improve as we go through the cycles. But then as I said in my remarks, we didn't have any surprises. And we implemented a -- our planning model and our plant maintenance model for doing turnarounds, we implemented that. We started it last year but this is the first big turnaround. And we had very, very good results of being able to control the timing, control the cost. And I'll turn it over to Rich to how he sees the plant, but as I said to Ed Westlake's question, we're very pleased coming out of this turnaround what we're seeing, and how we're seeing the crude unit run.
Richard D. Bedell: Yes, Paul. We just -- this was a sort of a basic turnaround where we went in and did a lot of cleaning and upgrading in both the crude unit and the rig [ph] Unit. It was our first chance to get a full turnaround in any of the units there. There are additional turnarounds out in the future years, '16 and '17 and -- but the upgrades on these were -- there's no big capital improvements on these units. Those will be continuing as we evaluate those opportunities. It was really just a routine turnaround.
Gary R. Heminger: And Paul, as we continue down the path here, and this was always in our original plan, we will continue to upgrade the safety environmental -- or excuse me, safety instrumented systems and relief valve projects. We'll continue to update those in coordination with our turnarounds. But as I said, very pleased with the management team there, very pleased with the workforce and how they were able to complete this turnaround.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: The second question I think is for Don and Mike, maybe I get 2 parts here. Don, on the corporate unallocated the first half runway [ph] seems to be about for the -- in the Refining business, about in the $200 million, $210 million a quarter, which is lower than what in the past. Is that a reasonable run rate going forward that we can use? And secondly, for Mike, any way to estimate what is the PADD III total crude storage capacity that you can share?
Donald C. Templin: Paul, I missed the first part of your question -- this is Don. I missed the first part of your question.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: If I look at in the first quarter and also your second quarter guideline on the corporate and other allocated item in the Refining business, seems to be now running at 200 million to 210 million barrels -- sorry, to $210 million a quarter, which is lower than the historical past. And so my question is that on a going forward basis, is that a reasonable run rate that we can use?
Donald C. Templin: Yes. I -- Paul, I believe that corporate and unallocated, it is -- that's a normal -- a more normalized rate. I will add though, that we will have pension settlement expense that goes into that number. This year, our pension settlement expense occurred this -- in the first quarter. Last year, our big charge for pension settlement expense occurred in the second quarter. So you would expect and you see it in our guidance here, you'd expect to see about $60 million of pension settlement expense into second quarter of '13, and our outlook for the second quarter of '14 is about $5 million. Mike?
C. Michael Palmer: Yes, okay, Paul. We had our economics group take a look at the inventory capacity in PADD III. And they tell us that the EIA estimates at about 273 million barrels. Of that, there's something like 73 million barrels in refinery tankage. So that's the information that we have, Paul.
Operator: We have Doug Terreson from ISI Group.
Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Staying with refinery costs, is there any segmentation on 100,000 barrels per day of loss throughput between turnarounds and whether -- is there any insight into the mix there?
Gary R. Heminger: Let me answer it this way, Doug. A lot of it was due to weather, and it wasn't necessarily crude but the subable was feedstocks, and we had planned because we have these 2 big turnarounds, being able to move feedstocks between refineries and moved some of the feedstocks back up into the Midwest during that period of time. And the polar vortex, we would get one in the Midwest and turnaround the next week, and get one in the Gulf Coast. And it kept hampering our ability to move some of the feedstocks that we have planned to move on the water, up the river system, as well as from refinery to refinery. So I would say more than 1/2 of it was due to the feedstock movements.
Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, I see. And then just to clarify, Gary, a minute ago, you mentioned that the opportunity cost was around $150 million. And then, when you think about the higher turnaround expenses versus 1 year ago, which looked to me to be about over $380 million. It seems like these 2 factors affected profits by $400 million, $500 million versus the year ago period. Is that the way you guys are thinking about it?
Gary R. Heminger: Yes, it is, Doug. I believe, Don, it was about $300 million incremental?
Donald C. Templin: Yes, the incremental turnaround cost was about $300 million, Doug, you got that, correct.
Gary R. Heminger: So, and then around -- another $150 million of what we call lost opportunity. And then just some of the incremental demurrage cost you're setting with fog-related issues going back and forth with -- trying to move from refinery to refinery on the water would have had some additional operating costs that was not included in this number.
Donald C. Templin: And Doug, I think there's -- the $300 million is a pretax number. The $150 million that Gary was talking to you about was an after-tax number. So make sure we're not mixing apples and oranges there.
Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's not an insignificant number either way.
Operator: And we have Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Gary, can I ask you to dig a little bit deeper into the capture rate? One of the moving parts that we don't really get great transparency on is rack margins. And I'm just wondering if you could help us understand a little bit of what's happening there sequentially from Q4 to Q1, but also how things are kind of shaping up as oil prices kind of start to stabilize here a little bit. And I've got a follow-up, please.
Gary R. Heminger: Sure, Doug. As you know, that is one of our probably biggest competitive advantages and -- is our logistics system and our terminals and the way we can move products, and therefore, I can't get into the rack margins on a quarter-to-quarter basis or even a current basis. But I will say, if you look at the inventories and if you look at the inventories Q4, looked at the inventories Q1 and looked at them by PADD, and you can see where there have been some real challenges in the marketplace of being able to supply some markets. And I think that can give you a hint that there's some markets that have been very advantageous to supply.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: So is it fair to assume that you guys can benefit from that in the current quarter as oil prices stabilize?
Gary R. Heminger: It's not necessarily driven by oil prices, it's delivered -- it's driven by supply and how you can get that supply into the market. So yes, we have been able to move our product into some very key markets and, I think, have done very well being able to accomplish that.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I guess, I was just assuming there was some kind of lag effect on tight oil prices denting your margins and then things kind of stabilize out again. But I'll take it off-line. [indiscernible]
Gary R. Heminger: But you are -- Doug, you are correct. The higher oil prices, if you go all the way down to the retail level and looked at Speedway's performance for the quarter, being able to, with higher oil prices, move that price all the way to the street at the retail level, it takes time to be able to accomplish that. And so you are correct there on how the oil prices reflect. But I would say, from a wholesale standpoint, it's really been driven more by the supply and, again, some weather-related issues, being able to get that supply into the marketplace both first quarter and as we lean into the second quarter.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I appreciate that, Gary. My follow-up, I'm not sure who wants to take this, but it's really going more back to the inventory situation on the Gulf Coast and the shift that we've seen from PADD II to PADD III. I'm just curious on your opinion on this because utilization rates and yourselves included have, obviously, you're doing a terrific job running as hard as you possibly can, I guess, for the whole industry as well as Marathon. But because of that it seems that on an adjusted basis, supply basis that inventories in the Gulf may not be as tight as they look. So I'm just kind of curious on your perspective on how that plays out as we go into peak run rate season, if you like, in terms of your expectations for how those differentials relative to Brent could play out, how we get there.
C. Michael Palmer: Yes, Doug, this is Mike Palmer. And it's an interesting comment you make with regard to days of supply because I think you're right. When you do the calculation, the days of supply that we have right now, the calculation that you guys went through, I think, is right. The days supply is not in that bad a shape. But I guess what we expect to have happen is we do know that these inventories are building. And we've been surprised that we haven't seen more of a differentials widening on the sweet crude than what we've seen to date. In fact, we've seen probably a little more on the sour side. So what we expect is, as these inventories continue to build, we do expect to see the light differentials widen out a bit and give us an opportunity.
Operator: And our next question comes from Chi Chow from Macquarie Capital.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: Mike, I just want to follow-up on that last comment there when you said the sours are widening out more than the sweets. What is causing that? Is there a specific dynamic you're seeing on the relative weakness on the mediums?
C. Michael Palmer: Well, I think, probably a part of that is just due to individual refinery issues that have occurred in the Gulf. So as we watch these differentials kind of, not just on a monthly basis but on a daily basis, we've seen opportunities where the sour crudes -- the sour Gulf of Mexico crudes have looked pretty attractive, and that will constantly shift. I think right now, it's starting to shift back more in favor of the light sweets.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: We can't really see the data on our end with the details. But how do you see the inventories in the Gulf Coast stacking up between the Texas Gulf Coast region and Louisiana? And are there some inefficiencies still in getting barrels into St. James that may be holding up that LLS price?
C. Michael Palmer: I think, there still are inefficiencies in the Gulf Coast. I think that's very true. I mean, the most dramatic thing that we've seen, I think, would have to come back to Midland. And if you track West Texas sour or if you track Midland WTI, I think you've seen that those differentials have widened out. So the capacity, the pipeline capacity to move barrels out of the Midland area has certainly been a factor. We don't have a lot of great data with regard to inventories in the different parts of the Gulf either, but we suspect that probably there are some additional inventory in the Nederland area. Again, as the pipes have expanded and allowed crude to move down into Nederland, we're not sure that the takeaway logistics have kept pace. So that may be, those 2 areas may be where we're seeing a reasonable amount of this Gulf Coast surplus.
Gary R. Heminger: Chi, this is Gary, let me add a couple more comments. So in fact, we were just yesterday, looking at some of the production that's coming in -- the new production that's coming in from the Gulf this year, and that's going to really land over in the St. James area and some significant increase in the Gulf Coast production. So that's something to keep an eye on. And the other thing that we're watching very carefully is as you look at inventory growing in the Gulf Coast, therefor PADD III and how that has continued to grow, week after week, I think the DOE showed yesterday, was up 5.7 million barrels of additional inventory, is the time that it starts backing up to the Mid-Con or backing up to Cushing is where we're keeping a close eye on that to show how much inventory, as Mike related earlier how much inventory or shelf capacity there is in the Gulf Coast. As that starts to fill up in the -- in PADD III and move back to Cushing is when you know that, I think, things are going to even lighten out more.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: All right, a lot of dynamics going on right now. Just as a follow-up on Gary, I just want to ask if you had any updated views on how regulators in Washington may be considering the whole discussion on crude oil exports, changes in the Jones Act, RFS, any updated thoughts on that end?
Gary R. Heminger: We continue to be -- work on these issues and be very close to the discussions back in the mid part of the quarter we had some meetings on the export discussions. And then at the same -- in the same discussions talked about how inefficient the Jones Act is to the transportation sector and how inefficient the renewable fuel system is to being able to deliver products to consumers. And I will say all of that is caught up with a number of other discussions that are going on in D.C. right now, and I don't see any movement on any of those. Of course, we're waiting on the final rule to come out of the EPA on the ethanol blending requirement for this year. Still expecting that. That's probably going to be the latter part of this quarter before we hear what the final rule making is on the ethanol blend component for this year. A lot of discussion continues on with the Jones Act, but I think Senator Landrieu was very forward in her comments that she does not support any change to that legislation. So accompanied with the Jones Act and very top level Discussion on crude oil exports. We don't see anything moving on either side.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: Okay. Was there a general acknowledgment that all these issues are somewhat interrelated and it's not -- that everything has to be considered, I suppose?
Gary R. Heminger: I would say that most of the folks that we have met with understand that this is a dynamic situation and that you just can't peel the onion back one layer and come up with a decision. You have to look at the total market. And yes, there totally is an understanding of the dynamics involved.
Operator: And we have Paul Sankey, Wolfe Research, online with a question.
Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: Gary, there's been obviously a ton of questions on the turnarounds, and I think you fairly clearly stated that these were not capital improvement cost overruns, they were more weather related. What I was wondering is the extent to which now, looking forward, creep is back. You're coming out of these turnarounds with higher capacity and, I assume, yet higher ability to run light sweets. Can you just talk about the outlook for how the industry is increasing its capacity and specifically Marathon is and the extent to which you were able to increase your light sweet throughputs by the same token?
Gary R. Heminger: Yes. And I think that -- and I stated on one of the first calls on the turnaround we're very pleased with how Galveston Bay came out. And anytime you'd want to do a big revamp and turnaround of a crude unit, you would expect that it's going to run better than as you go into a turnaround. It's just going to run better. As I look at creep across the entire industry, it certainly is hard to separate between creep and those who have just -- are replacing a medium barrel with a lighter barrel, therefore you can get more throughput in a crude unit, generally. So it's really hard, Paul, to calculate creep. I'll let Mike or Rich here add into what they're seeing in the industry and/or our refining.
Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: Yes, Gary, I mean, if I could interrupt. So is it -- can you give us a sense as to how your capacity specifically has grown? Just for example, as we head for summer, is it a given percentage higher than it was 1 year ago? And any observations, obviously, on the industry would also be very interesting.
Gary R. Heminger: So yes, Mike's prepared to talk about that.
C. Michael Palmer: Yes, Paul, let me just give you a couple of thoughts, I guess, that I have and maybe Rich can add to it. But it's very interesting. In the first quarter, kind of Gary alluded to some of the weather-related issues we had. But one of the problems that we had during the first quarter was that we were buying light sweet crude and it was not being delivered. There were production issues, there were issues with moving crude by water. The trains were a problem. Our big problem in the first quarter, one of them, was that we weren't getting all the light sweet crude that we were trying to buy, and we're now just now starting to come out of that. The other thing that I would say is that the amount of light sweet crude that refineries can run, there are hard limits that Rich can talk about, but it's very much a function of pricing. And I can tell you that within our system, we still need to see wider discounts when we look at, for example, Light Louisiana Sweet versus Gulf of Mexico sour or Mars. We see these differentials really kind of on the breakeven so that we go either way from week to week. So I think once we start to see additional production of the shale crudes, we should get to a point where it really gives us incentive to bring more of this light sweet crude in the system, which we can still do. Up to this point, that -- we have not run into any problems with regard to how much we can run. We can run more.
Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: So could you give us a number on that? Is it 100,000, 200,000, 300,000 more a day?
C. Michael Palmer: Well, I don't -- I'm not sure that I can really give you a good number. As I say, it's a function of price.
Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: Okay, good answer. But okay, interesting. Was I going to...
Pamela K. M. Beall: Oh.
Richard D. Bedell: Plus, I guess, Paul, the other question you had about are we increasing our crude capacity, nameplate-wise, we're not doing that now. We usually do that based on a full year run in what we do. But coming out of the turnaround, especially with Galveston Bay and Garyville, you're coming out with clean exchangers. Everything's ready to go, and we typically run a little bit more during those time periods. But when we talk about our overall refining capacity, we use the annual averages.
Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: Great. And I just had a follow-up, which is the old question about how much you're exporting of what products and the same store sales demand numbers that you're seeing.
Gary R. Heminger: Yes, Mike will take care of the export numbers.
Donald C. Templin: So Paul, this is Don. Our exports for the first quarter were 223,000 barrels a day, and of that amount about 50,000 barrels a day was gasoline.
C. Michael Palmer: Yes, and let me just add to that, Paul, by saying that our exports in the first quarter were down, and they were certainly impacted by the turnaround activity that we had. We didn't have the volumes to export that we would have without the turnarounds. And as we got out of the first quarter back into the April kind of time period, I think we're returning to more normal levels.
Operator: Okay. And our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I guess my question, Gary, there's a lot of embedded value in MPC, and I'm sure that drives the buyback and then drives the buyback condition for you. But on midstream specifically, do you believe that MPC is being valued or fully credited for the embedded midstream value at the C-corp? And how do you think about ways to potentially call that out or pull that forward?
Gary R. Heminger: Well, that's a very pertinent question, Evan. And no, I do not believe that -- as we started the MLP in October of 2012, that's one of the key factors that we looked at as a lot of people advised, they saw that value. That value has not pulled through. I think a very small part of that value has pulled through into MPC. We certainly are being recognized with MPLX and how we're growing MPLX, and we're -- it's being recognized not only on the amount of drop-down capacity that we have but also the organic work that we've been doing and how we're trying to get ahead of the curve on the organic work being the Sandpiper-SAX pipeline that we spoke about, the incremental investment in Explorer, and we talked about the splitters. So that is being recognized -- it's being recognized with MPLX that we're growing that midstream reserve, if you will. But it still is not being pulled through at the level that we think we deserve. And that was a big part of our analyst briefing that we had in December, is that we still believe, and it's why we continue to buy back shares, is that we believe there's a tremendous value still embedded within our strong and stable cash flow businesses that is not being fully recognized.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Do you think a faster or bigger pace of monetizations would result in unlocking the value at the MPC level?
Gary R. Heminger: We continue to look at the pace. In fact, I think the market has been very, very receptive of the rhythm that we've put in place within MPLX. To go in and say, let's just do a faster monetization is -- that is -- also can lead to destroying value if you do not have, again, this reserve base teed up. So I think it's a delicate balance, a fine line in what that rhythm of growth. And you just take the compounding effect out for a number of years at the growth rate that we have been public with in our midstream business so -- in between a 15% to 20% number, and that compounding is -- becomes quite a big number quickly. And that's why we've been so aggressive, and I think we've been very fortunate in how we're growing this business and growing the stable. But we continue to look at our rate of growth, continue to look at our midstream assets. Pam Beall is here with us who is the President of MPLX. Pam, do you want to add anything to this?
Pamela K. M. Beall: Well, really Gary, I think you summed it up right. We think that we created MPLX to participate in the growth and build out the infrastructure to support the production of oil and natural gas. We also did it to highlight the substantial value that our midstream assets can provide to MPC and the flexibility it provides to the company. We think a more measured pace is the right way to go to retain flexibility both for MPC, and we think that's what the MLP's investment community really favors, is the ability to see that the MLP, especially sponsored MLP, have a long runway of potential growth potential. Because part of the total return is the growth rate, and part of the return is [indiscernible]. We like this measured approach.
Gary R. Heminger: And I'll say, Evan, that you'll recall my closing remarks in our analyst meeting in December were that we're going to grow our stable cash flow businesses, and that being midstream and retail, and we've been very successful in the balance of the fourth quarter and the first quarter of continuing to add to those base.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I mean, that's a good segue for a question to the retail, another segment that's valued in the market on a higher stand-alone basis. I mean, how do you think about that segment or even MLP potential within the wholesale fuels business or even, conversely, retail inorganic growth potential? I'll leave it there.
Gary R. Heminger: Right. You're right, Evan. And the way we look at this is that we have multiple levels of optionality. The -- we are fully aware of some of those different structures. But I also want to be consistent that we believe there's a tremendous value and a value around synergy within MPC of having this very strong retail base and knowing how you're going to move your product and the efficiencies of moving your product through the marketplace that we've been able to capture historically. However, that does not say that we will forever maintain that type of a structure. We're fully aware, and we continue to do a lot of analysis on what the best way forward would be. And -- but for now, we think we're in a very good position.
Operator: And now we have Roger Read, Wells Fargo Securities, online with a question.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I guess one follow-up off of Galveston Bay following the turnaround. I think Paul asked it earlier, Paul Cheng. But now that you've done the turnaround and you're thinking about how the unit operates relative to what it was doing before or what you think it can do now, can you give us any quantifiable way to think about how the unit runs better, whether it's a yield, whether it's lower cost, a combination of the 2?
Gary R. Heminger: All right, I'll let -- Rich, you want to please handle this?
Richard D. Bedell: Well, we definitely see better yields, better cut points that -- off of the crude unit that just went through the turnaround. And again, you get a little bit better throughput, too, because of the clean exchangers, but the cuts are also much better, especially between resid and gas oil. So we're seeing that, and that's just a matter of getting everything cleaned up and running it. So there wasn't any real big revamp of the unit. It's all based on just getting it in better condition.
Gary R. Heminger: And Roger, you'll recall at the analyst meeting that I said at the end we need 1 more year to really get our arms around and get this plant running like we want it. This was the first big turnaround that we've accomplished, and we accomplished it under our control of how we do turnarounds, and that went very well. So my outlook -- and I know Rich and I spent a lot of time on this, our outlook for this refinery is that with the strides that we've made in a very short time, we're expecting it to get better and better. And -- but the thing I want to come back on, we're very impressed with the workforce that we acquired when we bought this plant. And they know how to run refineries, and we have a great management team there as well. So I'm very pleased with what we're seeing on the front end.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, so that's helpful. So a quick summary would be you feel better about the acquisition today than you did at the time you made it in terms of just the quantifiable things you can achieve with it?
Gary R. Heminger: I felt very good on the day we announced the acquisition, and I even feel better.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then the last question I had, just on the exports. Obviously, you addressed the issues that held them back in Q1. You've had time to spend a little money and time expanding some of the key side issues and then the work here at Galveston Bay. So if you were to think about what max export capacity is, can you give us an idea of what that is today and maybe what that'll do over the next 12 to 24 months?
Gary R. Heminger: Well, what we've said, Roger, in our Analyst Day briefing, as well as I believe we updated this in the fourth quarter, we would expect by 2016 to be able to move this out to around 450,000 to 475,000 barrels per day of exports by -- in that time frame. I mean, in fact, I think it's 2018 because we have to tie the kind of the last piece to a turnaround that we have scheduled down the road.
Donald C. Templin: Yes, I would say Roger, this is Don, our view before that sort of major incremental leap is that we would get to about 350,000 barrels a day, and then there will be an incremental leap that will take us -- that will require capital but will get us then to that 475,000 number that Gary referred to.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. So you did I think it was about 250,000 in the third quarter and a similar level in the fourth quarter, fell back a little bit here and then what, by 1 year from now the 350,000? Or are we thinking more like 2 years to get to that level?
Donald C. Templin: Well, for the fourth quarter, I think we were just under 300,000 barrels a day. So that incremental 50,000, I think, will -- we're doing a great job of evaluating how to be more efficient and how to make sure that we're maximizing the product placement with crude receipts and with making sure that we're taking advantage of both the availability at Garyville and at Galveston Bay. So I think the 350,000 is not that far away from the 300,000 that we had at the end of the fourth quarter -- or for the fourth quarter.
Operator: And our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.
Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: I had a question for you on condensate splitters. Gary, I know you've already kind of addressed your thoughts on crude exports, but there had been some rumblings in the industry from the E&P side that they may be able to export condensate, and it seems like some of your peers are taking a little bit more of a measured approach to it. If I recall, I'm looking at some of your previous slide packs, you had a decent amount of spending in '14 on condensate splitters. So just any updated thoughts there, I would appreciate it.
Gary R. Heminger: Right. Blake, the condensate splitters that we've talked about on the front end here of our business and technical plan are in Canton and Catlettsburg. So they're really all around the Utica and Marcellus, which would not -- I don't think would -- because of the transportation costs to be able to move the river system, that I don't see that the Utica and Marcellus really tees up that well for export. So I'll ask Rich to talk about the spending that we plan and the timing that we have planned for Canton and Catlettsburg, and those 2 splitters are ongoing right now.
Richard D. Bedell: Yes, the Canton project will be completed at the end of this year. And then in the second quarter, we'll have the Catlettsburg project finished. Canton is 25,000 barrels a day, and Catlettsburg is 35,000 barrels a day of the condensate.
Gary R. Heminger: So -- and so that is all Midwest production at, I should say, really Eastern side of PADD II production that will go into those splitters. And I understand that the measured approach and the desire by some to be able to look at condensate splitting or -- condensate that has been split for export, and we'll continue to see how that moves down the path.
Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Perfect, that's helpful. The second question was, I guess, more a clarification. I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks a decline in demand. And I guess if I heard correctly in April, that doesn't seem to be kind of consistent with the DOE numbers we're getting. I was just hoping maybe you could give a little clarity around that.
Donald C. Templin: Yes, Blake, this is Don. The decline that I mentioned was just Speedway demand, and I would say that our -- and that market, obviously, is a Midwest market. So we think the recent run-up in prices at retail have had an impact on that.
Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. So that's really not winter related or anything that we saw in 1Q? This is more recent, right?
Donald C. Templin: Yes, the 1Q was down I want to say 0.7%, so -- on a same-store basis. This was the -- we were trying to give an April number, and that's down about 1%. But once again, we think a lot of that is really reflective of the fact that the price at the pump is $0.20 or $0.25 generally higher than it was 1 year ago.
Operator: And the next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons & Company.
Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: It's Jeff Dietert. I was hoping to get a comment on your expectations for oil imports into PADD III. And they've been relatively sticky so far this year, roughly flat year-on-year. And we've got increased pipeline barrels, rail barrels and flat imports coming in, which is contributing to the build here in April in front of what looks like a relatively active maintenance period on the Gulf Coast. Could you talk about your expectations for those imports?
C. Michael Palmer: Well, Jeff, this is Mike Palmer. As we all know, most of the light sweet crude is no longer coming into the Gulf. It's pretty much been eliminated. So the next step is going to be starting to back out either light sour or medium sour crudes. And I think, as I mentioned earlier, that certainly could happen as the spreads start to give us incentive to do that. So I would think that if production continues in this country along the growth path that we've seen, that you're going to start to see some of that foreign light sour and medium sour start to get backed out.
Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: And they've been a little bit sticky so far. I mean, most of the oil imports are priced off of domestic grades, which have to be priced attractively for the U.S. Gulf Coast refining market. Some of the exporters have joint ventures, term sales, strategic interest in sustaining U.S. market share. Do you think we need to see a substantial discount relative to international prices in order to reduce those imports?
C. Michael Palmer: Well, I guess my feeling is that yes, you're going to need to see and have a perception that you're going to have this discount that's going to be ongoing. But up to this point, what I would argue is that, again, it's breakeven between some of the -- even the U.S. Gulf of Mexico sour crudes and the light crudes on the Gulf Coast are close. So you can go back and forth between those 2 grades in terms of economics. So we need to start to see the light sweet crudes -- if that's where the surplus is going to be, which we would expect, we need to see the discounts start to widen and last for a period of time.
Gary R. Heminger: And Jeff, if you look at the kind of the world economics and the producers in West Africa, in the North Sea, not that much of the North Sea production comes to the U.S. anymore but mainly West Africa and some of the South American countries. As Gulf Coast production continues to increase, there's going to be friction because those producers are still looking for a home for their crude. And the home, of course, they can take some to Asia. However, you look at some of the Middle East producers and how they're increasing and ramping up their production to Asia, there's a -- quite a bit of friction and pressure on being able to deliver those barrels into Asia. So I think this bodes well, back for our initial comments, that we see spreads will persist, the wider spreads will persist, because those countries are still looking for a home for their crude, and I think the friction point becomes the Gulf Coast.
Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Okay. And secondly, could you provide an update on the Garyville Resid Hydrocracker Project? I think I saw some news that you were applying for permits. Anything to dissuade you from continuing to analyze that project?
Gary R. Heminger: I'll let Rich handle that.
Richard D. Bedell: That was the resid hydrocracker project that we submitted our air permit. But throughout this year, we have a more detailed engineering effort going on. Our decision point on this project will be in the first quarter of next year. But everything still looks very good on the project.
Operator: And our next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citigroup.
Mohit Bhardwaj - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: This is actually Mohit Bhardwaj for Faisel. Gary, just looking on the Gulf Coast, there's a lot of crude coming over there, and there are new inventories building up. Just from a logistic standpoint, you mentioned some of the factors that are getting crude into Texas City or into Garyville and also supplying product into the Florida markets, which you are sort of benefiting from. Are there any opportunities that you see right now that you can share with us?
Gary R. Heminger: I'm sorry, opportunities -- I missed the...
Mohit Bhardwaj - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Oh, On the logistics side to smoothen some of the transportation on the crude side. And also, products are getting into the Florida markets that you -- that are sort of tight and you sort of benefit as well from it because of the wholesale margins.
Gary R. Heminger: Yes, the way we have been having our transportation of refined products into the Florida market, and we have a virtual pipeline on the water -- on the Gulf that we're supplying both out of Texas City, Galveston Bay and Garyville into the Florida and some of the other Gulf Coast terminals into that marketplace. So we're in very good shape as far as the transportation mode that we're using there. The -- this incremental production that I've talked about coming from the Gulf Coast from a crude standpoint, we are in great shape because a lot of that is going to be plumbed up to come through LOOP.
Mohit Bhardwaj - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: All right. All right. And just one final quick one for me. Any indication on the RIN expense for this quarter?
Gary R. Heminger: RINs?
Donald C. Templin: The RIN expense was $71 million for the quarter. That was purchased RINs.
Operator: And our last question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just a quick follow-up. Gary, when we're looking at Galveston Bay based on your unit cost estimate in the second quarter for the Gulf Coast, they seems to be still high comparing to the Garyville. Any plan what you may be able to do in terms of reducing the costs there? And also there for Mike, in your conversation with whether the Mexican -- or with the Mexican, have the tone or the attitude have changed now in terms of how they're looking at the Gulf Coast market?
Donald C. Templin: Paul, this is Don. Let me take the unit cost question. We don't provide specific information on individual refineries, but I think it's fair to say that Garyville is, if not the most efficient, one of the most efficient refineries from an operating cost perspective. And so, there will always, I think at least in the foreseeable future, be a gap between their operating costs and those at Galveston Bay. There's also a structural difference in that Galveston Bay has a very large aromatics complex and this very large resid hydrocracker complex. So the -- you -- I don't think you'd ever expect to see a parity on that because of the different configurations.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Sure. But, I mean, I guess my question is that are you comfortable and happy about the current unit cost in Galveston Bay or that this is an area of focus?
Gary R. Heminger: Paul, this is Gary. As I mentioned in December, this is top of mind, top of mind every day as an area of focus. Rich is doing a great job. Just completed the largest turnaround they've ever had there in one cycle and did it right according to our plan. And our plan through these turnarounds is to improve the operability, to improve the mechanical availability, therefore lowering the unit cost. Are we where we want to get to yet? No. Are we making progress? Yes.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: How about...?
C. Michael Palmer: Yes, Paul, Paul, this is Mike Palmer. Paul, we really don't have any indication that the Mexicans have changed their thoughts about the U.S. Gulf Coast. I really don't have anything that I can tell you there.
Operator: And we have no further questions at this time.
Timothy T. Griffith: Okay. Thanks, Sylvia. Well, again, we'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning and for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation.

Operator: Welcome to the Marathon Petroleum Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Christine, and I will be the operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Tim Griffith. You may begin.
Timothy T. Griffith: Okay, thank you, Christine, and good morning. I'll remind everyone that the synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investor Center tab. On the call this morning are Gary Heminger, President and CEO; Don Templin, Senior Vice President and CFO; Mike Palmer, Senior Vice President, Supply, Distribution and Planning; and Pam Beall, Senior Vice President of Corporate Planning and Governance and Public Affairs and President of MPLX. We invite you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. And factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well as in our filings with the SEC. Now I'll turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks and highlights.
Gary R. Heminger: Thank you, Tim, and good morning. I want to thank you for joining our call and webcast. Before I give my comments, I want -- on our results, I wanted to mention a few changes we have made as a result of Garry Peiffer's retirement in December. Pam Beall, who many of you have come to know in her prior role as Vice President of Investor Relations, has taken executive responsibility for Corporate Planning, which encompasses business development, economics and global procurement, as well as she's become President of MPLX. Tim Griffith, who just introduced me and will be hosting our call has added Investor Relations to his current responsibilities as Vice President of Finance and Treasurer. Beth Hunter has been promoted to Director of Investor Relations supporting Tim and will serve as the day-to-day contact for investors and analysts with help from Jerry Ewing. This is a strong team that demonstrates the importance we place on continued succession planning, growing MPLX and maintaining a robust dialogue with our shareholders and the investment community. We'll be making the appropriate personal introductions as the opportunities present themselves over the next several months. Now moving on to our highlights. The fourth quarter of 2013 was a strong finish to an excellent year for MPC. Operating performance was outstanding and our financial performance in the fourth quarter reflected a nice rebound from some of the challenging market conditions we faced in the third quarter. Speedway also had an excellent year with record annual earnings and operational excellence throughout our nearly 1,500 locations. Don will provide a little deeper look at the drivers to our financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year shortly. Importantly, our focus continues to be on the future and balancing value accretive investments with a commitment to return capital to shareholders over an extended period of time. The acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery in February was an attractive addition to our refining portfolio, and we have been pleased with the developments there in our first 11 months of ownership. As we continue to evaluate the asset configuration and leverage the talents of the skilled workforce who have joined the Marathon Petroleum team, we believe this facility will become our second powerhouse refinery on the Gulf Coast, further enhancing the operational and logistical flexibility within our system. As part of our Investor Day in December, we highlighted the focus we have on expanding the higher value and more stable cash flow businesses in our portfolio. Our recently announced planned equity investments in the Southern Access Extension and Sandpiper Pipeline projects are 2 examples of that focus. The committed space and equity options we have on these pipelines will enable us to participate in the movement of increasing amounts of North American crude into our Midwest refining region through our Patoka hub, as well as introduce another potential earnings stream to MPLX over time. We are moving aggressively toward expanding our retail footprint through investments in Speedway and continued efforts to convert the branded contract assignments we acquired as part of the Galveston Bay acquisition to the Marathon brand. As we highlighted in December, we have almost tripled the amount of capital invested per year and rebuilt in new locations in our Speedway business over the previous 5 year period. This includes expansion into attractive contiguous markets in Western Pennsylvania and Tennessee where we opened our first Speedway locations in 2013 and are planning to expand further. We also remain mindful of opportunities to enhance margins and optimize the configuration of the other 6 refineries in our system. Among many of the opportunities we're evaluating is the resid hydrocracker at our Garyville refinery. If we decide to move forward after the front-end engineering and design study we are conducting this year, this investment will give us the opportunity to upgrade resid, a refinery by-product of decreasing value and to offer low sulfur diesel using hydrogen produced by our low-cost natural gas. Once operational, such a hydrocracker could add approximately $1 billion of annual EBITDA to our earnings base. An additional benefit is that nearly 70% of the resid will come from our own refining system. We will continue to invest in our future, while maintaining our commitment to capital discipline and focus return of capital to our shareholders throughout the refining cycle. Combining dividends and share repurchases, we returned $3.3 billion in capital to shareholders in 2013, which represented almost 6x the free cash flow we generated over the same time period. It is worth noting that we have completed about 70% of the $6 billion of share repurchases our board has authorized since the spin in 2011. To date, this activity represents 18% of the shares outstanding at that time. Our shareholders have been rewarded by our focus on value creation, enjoying total returns of 48% in calendar 2013. The performance places MPC in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 firms in total returns and follows a very strong 2012 total return of 94%. Our mission continues to be long-term value creation for our shareholders. And although we believe the market has not reflected the full value of our business in our valuation, we remain relentlessly focused on driving that value. We believe our best days are still in front of us. With that, I'll ask Don to provide a little deeper dive on our results for the fourth quarter and financial performance for the full year. Don?
Donald C. Templin: Thanks, Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings both on an absolute and per-share basis. Our fourth quarter and full year 2013 financial performance was strong. MPC had adjusted earnings of $633 million or $2.10 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to $760 million or $2.26 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2012. For the full year 2013, our adjusted earnings were nearly $2.2 billion compared to a very strong $3.4 billion in 2012. Adjusted earnings per share was $6.84 for the full year 2013 compared to $9.79 for 2012. The waterfall chart on Slide 5 shows by segment the change in adjusted earnings from the fourth quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2013. The primary driver for the change was the decrease in Refining & Marketing segment income, which I will describe in more detail on the next slide. As shown on Slide 6, Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was $971 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared with $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012. The change from 2012 was primarily due to narrowing crude oil differentials and higher direct operating costs, partially offset by wider crack spreads, higher product price realizations and increased refinery throughput volume. The unfavorable earnings impacts associated with the narrowing crude oil differentials are found in the price columns for the sweet/sour differential and LLS to WTI differential. The increase in direct operating costs quarter-over-quarter is primarily due to the acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery and higher turnaround expenses and is consistent with the guidance we've previously provided. Our earnings were favorably impacted by wider crack spreads as shown in the LLS 6-3-2-1 crack price column. All of the gross margin indicators utilize spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and products sold. As a result, differences in our actual product price realizations, mix and crude costs quarter-to-quarter are reflected in the other gross margin column. So let me make a few comments about a couple of these items. First, our actual crude and feedstock acquisition costs compared to the market indicators were more favorable during the fourth quarter of this year than the fourth quarter of last year. Second, our product price realizations were more favorable in the 2013 fourth quarter than they were in the comparable period last year, primarily due to overall higher margin and the mix in volume of products sold. During the 2013 fourth quarter, our earnings were also favorably impacted by increased refinery throughput volumes due in large part to the acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery. These impacts can be found in the volume columns for the LLS 6-3-2-1 crack, the sweet/sour differential and the LLS to WTI differential. Slide 7 provides a similar earnings walk for the Refining & Marketing segment on a year-over-year basis. As you will see from the graph, the blended 6-3-2-1 crack spread had a slightly favorable impact on earnings, while the primary driver of the unfavorable variance was narrower crude oil differentials. The change in crude oil differentials from 2013 compared to 2012 is found in the market indicator columns labeled, Sweet/Sour Differential price, WTI to LLS Differential Price and the LLS Prompt Versus Delivered. Direct operating expenses were higher by $1.6 billion, primarily due to the acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery and higher turnaround expenses in 2013. The primary favorable earnings impact shown are associated with increased volumes due in large part to the acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery. On the next few slides, we provide earnings walks for each of our other operating segments. Speedway's income from operations was $83 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared with $77 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Light product gross margin was about $4 million lower in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared with the fourth quarter of 2012. The decrease was primarily due to a $0.01 per gallon lower gross margin. This, however, was more than offset by merchandise margin, which was $205 million in the fourth quarter 2013 compared with $196 million in the same period last year. This $9 million increase was primarily due to higher merchandise sales and margin. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes increased 0.2% and merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes, increased 5.6% in the fourth quarter 2013 compared with the 2012 fourth quarter. Speedway's average retail gasoline price was $3.14 per gallon during the fourth quarter of 2013 compared with $3.32 per gallon for the comparable quarter last year. In January 2014, we've seen a slight decrease in demand with an approximately 1.5% decrease in same-store gasoline sales volumes versus the prior year. This is primarily due to the extreme weather conditions that we've seen through most of the Midwest during the month. Speedway's income from operations for all of 2013 was $375 million compared with $310 million for 2012. Light product margins increased by $54 million as margins averaged $0.144 per gallon in 2013, about $0.01 higher than the 2012 average of $0.132. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes increased 0.5% in 2013 compared to 2012. Merchandise margins were $825 million in 2013 compared to $795 million in 2012 or an increase of $30 million. The increase in light product and merchandise margins were partially offset by increased expenses of $19 million, primarily due to an increase in the number of stores operated in 2013 as compared to 2012. Slide 9 shows fourth quarter and full year changes in our Pipeline Transportation segment. Income from operations was $47 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared with $72 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in earnings from pipeline affiliates and higher operating costs. A decrease in earnings from pipeline affiliates is primarily from our investments in LOOP, Explorer and the Centennial pipeline. 2013 income from operations was $210 million compared with $216 million in 2012. This reduction is primarily attributable to higher operating expenses and depreciation and a reduction in pipeline affiliate income, partially offset by higher transportation revenue in 2013. The higher operating expenses and the higher transportation revenue primarily relate to the formation of MPLX. Slide 10 presents the significant drivers of changes in our cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2013. At December 31, 2013, our cash balance was $2.3 billion. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was a $827 million source of cash. The working capital benefit of $528 million noted on the slide primarily relates to a reduction in our inventory levels at year end. As Gary highlighted earlier, we continued delivering on our commitment to return capital to shareholders with $452 million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter. Slide 11 shows that at the end of the fourth quarter, we had $2.3 billion of cash and approximately $3.4 billion of debt. With EBITDA of over $4.6 billion during the last 12 months, we continue to be in a very manageable debt position, with leverage of 0.7x EBITDA and a debt-to-total capital ratio of 23%. Turning to Slide 12. During the last 12 months, we generated $3.4 billion in cash from operations and $560 million of free cash flow. Over this period, we returned almost $3.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This was almost 6x our free cash flow over that period. During the fourth quarter 2013, we purchased approximately 6 million shares for $452 million through open market purchases. It is our intention to continue returning capital to our shareholders that is not currently needed to support the operational and investment needs of the business. There is $1.86 billion outstanding on our share repurchase authorization as of December 31, 2013. MPC leads its peer group in 2013 on the measure of total capital return yield with 14.4% for the year, and we intend to remain focused around our efforts to balance careful investment in the business with returning capital to shareholders. Slide 13 provides updated outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the first quarter of 2014. For comparative purposes, those same metrics for the first quarter 2013 are also shown. Consistent with our commitment to provide incremental information, the outlook data is presented in a regional format, with key statistics provided for our Gulf Coast and Midwest regions. Historical information by region for 2013 can be found on our website in the quarterly investor packet, the Regional Data tab. And I want to highlight that this regional breakout is also provided in our earnings release. You will also note that we modified our gross margin calculation to be more consistent with the gross margin information provided by several of our peers. Now I will turn the call back over to Tim Griffith.
Timothy T. Griffith: Thank you, Don. [Operator Instructions] With that, Christine, we're prepared to open up the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Arjun Murti from Goldman Sachs.
Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Thanks for the additional breakdown between the Gulf Coast and Midwest, which is helpful. My question, Gary, is there's obviously a lot of questions right now with the growing light sweet shale oil production, where you can stick all of it in, in terms of the U.S. refining system. And you all highlight, for example, in your disclosures, 65% of your Gulf Coast throughput is sour crude oil. Can you provide any color in terms of, if the price incentives were there, how much light sweet could you run? I know there are various limitations, but where you desire to run it, can you provide any color on how flexible your system is?
Gary R. Heminger: Sure, Arjun, I'm going to turn this over to Mike Palmer. Let me give you one statistic as -- before Mike talks though. In the fourth quarter and year-to-date, we ran approximately 53% sour for the entire year and almost the same amount in the fourth quarter. So while there's a significant amount of light sweet that's available, the economics versus alternative barrel still guide us to run the light sour and medium sours. While we can run about 25 -- or 65% of our entire slate, that's not just the Gulf Coast. The entire slate, we can run about 65% in light sweet. It illustrates that we ran around 53% sour that the economics still drive us towards that decision. But Mike, if you can add some additional color.
C. Michael Palmer: Yes, Arjun, I guess, probably what I'd have to say is that the amount of light sweet crude that we can actually run in the Gulf Coast or at any plant is really a function of the price. It's a function of the discount relative to our alternatives. And we really can't give you a specific number. What I can tell you is that we know that within our system, we know that we still have some logistical constraints, for example, that keep us from running as much light sweet as we would like to at certain times when the differential gets really wide. We're working to get rid of those constraints. We're also going to be taking on additional barging as we go forward because we think that'll help alleviate some of the constraints. At the refineries, it's really a function of the price. So the object that we always have is to maximize our profitability. As that light discount widens, we can run more light sweet crude at these refineries. And that's what we'll do. That's what we'll do. One of the real issues is how do you handle the naphtha. And I think you know that at our refineries, we're in pretty good shape from a reformer standpoint relative to the industry average. So that's about as good as I can do for you, Arjun. We will take advantage of light sweet crude depending upon what that differential is.
Gary R. Heminger: Arjun, let me add one more thing. I read the piece that was published this morning by you on volatility of the crude and the light sweet and the saturation. And I thought you were spot on that we're going to continue to have a tremendous amount of volatility. But one thing I want to really put out in more detail was that if you look at the end of the fourth quarter with the extreme weather conditions that we've had across the U.S. and a number of issues in the Gulf Coast, there's been more volatility and a pull on inventory. I'm sure you know that there was a major pipeline in the Gulf offshore, Gulf Coast, that was down due to some operating issues, which took some light sour off the market then it was going to be blended with some of the light sweet. And that really upsets some of the inventory, and there's been a big draw of inventory in the Gulf Coast and up into the Cushing area. So I think this is a temporary aberration in the crude market. But again, I think your presentation that you published this morning was spot on with volatility. Once we get through these reports or get through this inventory cycle, I would expect things to settle down and for that spread to widen back out.
Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Gary, that's very helpful. Just a very quick follow-up here. You gave the $1 billion of potential EBITDA on the resid hydrocracker. Did you give a volume throughput and order of magnitude CapEx that goes with that as well?
Gary R. Heminger: Yes, the CapEx that we gave was $2.2 billion was our estimate, and that's what the feed is going to confirm and verify. That number that we expect the feed to be done by the end of the year. Timing wise, we would expect, if we were to go forward with this project to be complete at the end of 2017, mechanically complete there and start up the first part of '18. And it increases ultra-low sulfur diesel by 28,000 barrels per day. And as I said earlier, about 70% of the resid comes from within our own system today. So we're confident already with the feedstock supply that's verifying and confirming the capital that it'll take to build this.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Crédit Suisse.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: So I was just trying to get a sense of in the fourth quarter versus the first quarter. Obviously, there's a lot of changes in terms of the profitability. Now when we think about it, there's crude discounts, there's butane blending in fourth quarter. There's losses on secondary products. Maybe give us some color as to which one of those factors you felt was the biggest quarter-over-quarter.
Gary R. Heminger: Yes, I guess, Ed, if you noticed on sort of our Slide 6, where we showed that other gross margin, and there's a big $540 million of gross margin. Broadly, I would say about 45% of that impact was favorable crude acquisition costs. And about 75% of that amount was favorable crude acquisition costs and refined product realization and sale -- purchase for resale. So 75% of that $540 million was explained by sort of those 3 factors.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Yes, and some other companies have been saying that in the winter period, they were able to beat the cracks in the Gulf by doing more exports. Is that explaining the sort of 30%?
Donald C. Templin: Well, we had a very -- we had a very strong export quarter. We averaged, I think, 298,000 barrels a day for the quarter, the fourth quarter. So that was spread between Galveston Bay and the Garyville refinery.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Right, and the final question, just more strategically just on light crude runs. Maybe just remind us, if you can or willing to, about the changes that you're making perhaps at the plant level to process more light crude. Any additional thoughts in terms of adding things like pre-flash towers and splitters over and above the plans that you've already announced?
Gary R. Heminger: Ed, let me take you back. When we first built the Garyville expansion that opened at the end of '09, our intent was to run that at about 180,000 barrels per day. And as you'll recall, we're running this about 110,000 barrels a day above what the design capacity. And the reason is we filled up all the downstream process units from heavy and light sour to medium sour crudes that we're running, and we still have this run to room or amount to run space in the crude unit. So we have 110,000 barrel a day basically free crude system to run. Beyond that, as we said, we're becoming the anchor shipper on the Sandpiper and SAX line. We're doing crude unit work at Robinson this year. We're building the condensate splitters at Canton and Catlettsburg, and then we're working on logistical constraints in the U.S. Gulf Coast, as well as expanding our margin flexibility. So we have a number of things. And this is top of our mind on how to be able to take advantage of this light sweet crude.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chi Chow from Macquarie Capital.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: I want to follow up on your answer to Arjun's question earlier. You seem to suggest that you didn't really change the percentage of sour crude runs in the fourth quarter. I'm just wondering if you could comment on the pricing dynamic you saw on the sour and medium crudes in the quarter. Did they -- I'm assuming that they were just discounted along with what we saw in the LLS spread, but any comments on how the pricing dynamic work on those crudes?
C. Michael Palmer: Chi, this is Mike Palmer. When we look at the fourth quarter, the pricing dynamics for domestic crude were very favorable. Of course, that was a period when the Brent-WTI spread was widening out. The domestic crudes, LLS and Mars, were both priced very attractively relative to the ARB. And that's one of the keys to the profitability in the fourth quarter. Domestic crudes were at discount, made a lot of sense. Actually, when you look at LLS versus Mars over the fourth quarter, it didn't vary all that much. I mean, it was between $4.50 and $5.50 generally. And then when you look to the really heavy barrels in Canada, they were very attractively priced as well, getting probably between $25 and $35 a barrel discount. So I think what I would say for the fourth quarter again is just domestic crudes were very well priced for our system.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: Hey, Mike, how about the foreign crudes? I know you still bring in the foreign mediums, in particular, into the Gulf. Were those pricing right along with Mars?
C. Michael Palmer: Yes, the foreign crudes that we bring in were attractive relative to the sour alternative in the Gulf.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: Okay, I guess that suggests that both Mars and the foreign barrels, that they're moving with LLS then. And is that dynamic going to continue long term in your view that these crudes seem like they're going to be priced off where LLS moves?
C. Michael Palmer: Yes, I think going back to the basic dynamic, we're going to have this continued production growth in the light sweet crude that's going to end up on the Gulf Coast. But I think as we've said before that other barrels, the other sour barrels, if they want to find a place in the refineries, they're going to have to compete. So we would expect -- there's going to be changes in differentials, don't get me wrong. But these other sour barrels are going to have to compete as well, and we believe they will.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: And one final question, your guidance for the first quarter, thanks for breaking out the expense per barrel and by region. I'm just wondering about the turnaround expense, looks pretty high in both regions. Are the turnarounds going to be concentrated here in the first quarter? Or can you say what might be ahead for the rest of the year?
Donald C. Templin: Sure, Chi, this is Don. Yes, we'll have a very heavy turnaround activity in the first quarter compared to probably all of the other quarters. But we will -- when we have big turnarounds coming up, we will continue to incorporate that in our outlook guidance with enough time period for you all to be able to model that.
Gary R. Heminger: And Chi, you'll recall at our Analyst Day meeting, we spoke about Galveston Bay. And I think I -- the quote that I used was we need 1 more year of -- to be able to really get the -- with the turnarounds to be able to get this plant like we want it, and so you'll see that turnaround expense. A part of it is around that plant. But our strategy and the plant is performing very, very well. Our strategy is to go in and get this plant tuned up like we want it to be. And we expect by the end of this year to have the majority of the heavy turnaround complete at that plant. And as I said, this becomes the second powerhouse refinery we have in the Gulf.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Kessler from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: My question is somewhat related to Chi's in the North America pricing dynamics for the mediums and heavies. You had some comments about the fourth quarter. I'm interested in the first quarter, what you're seeing today. A couple of things piqued my interest. One is more pipeline capacity, I'd say heavy pipeline capacity now coming down the Gulf Coast with market lengths switching to heavy barrels. Seems to have helped narrow the Canadian differential and presumably put more heavy barrels in the Gulf Coast region on the market. What are you seeing in the first quarter as it relates to availability and pricing structure for those heavy barrels? And then somewhat related to that, the imported heavy, say, Saudis and others coming in with mediums or heavies, the Saudis appear to have narrowed their price discount versus ASCI, albeit very slightly to say $0.80 for February versus $1.90 in December. Are they effectively pulling out of the market very slightly? And is that kind of price change in the posted prices matched with any noticeable change in your kind of commercial discussions with them?
C. Michael Palmer: Robert, this is Mike Palmer. If you come back to your first question relating to the heavy crude, as you know, the TransCanada MarketLink line did come onstream here in January. And right now, it's primarily the light sweet line fill I think that's moving to Nederland, but we do understand that, that will be followed by heavy crude more than likely. We had already seen the Canadian heavy, and if you look at the benchmark, Western Canadian Select. We'd already seen that differential that had been as high as $35, $36 earlier, come into around minus 20 to minus 18. And it looks -- if you look at the forward curve, I mean, it appears to be fairly stable at that kind of a level. I think that part of what was happening there, even though there continues to be growth in the Canadian heavy, as you know, the BP Whiting facility did get its coker project complete and there was an additional demand in the market for the Canadian heavy. But I think as we look forward, we would expect that Canadian heavy to be still an important crude. It'll still be attractive, although we may not see the very wide differentials that we've seen in the past once you have that ability to clear it into the Gulf Coast. So I guess that's the situation that we see for the heavy crude. In terms of Middle Eastern crudes, I would -- certainly from our standpoint, that continues to be a very important part of our crude slate. And we don't have any reason to believe that it's not going to be competitive going out in the future. We would expect to see the barrels in the same basic kind of pricing relationship that we've seen in the recent past.
Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay, can I ask for some clarification? You mentioned alleviating some logistical bottlenecks in the Gulf Coast region relating to crude access. Can you specify what those are? You also mentioned some more barge capacity, it sounded like. Are those related to that Gulf Coast region barge purchases or something like that?
C. Michael Palmer: Yes, let me -- I can't give you a lot of detail, but let me just give you my thoughts. We know -- when these pipelines get built, and Seaway was a good example, the TransCanada MarketLink is another good example. You get a trunk line that completes. And you've got trunk line capacity, but you don't have necessarily all the connectivity that you need for all the different plants that have a potential requirement for those crudes. And that sort of thing continues in the marketplace where you get basic pipeline capacity, but you don't have all the connectivity you need to bring all those barrels in. And every refiner has to look at their own specific logistics to see where the constraints are, if any, and then to correct those. So while I'm not going to get into detail, I can tell you that within our own system, we know that we continue to have these various constraints around the system. And we're constantly working on those to try and remove those constraints to bring in more crude. And we believe that most of the refiners have the same sorts of issues. That's why you see when you look at exports that continue to rise, you look at the very -- and we talk about the fact that we're not saturated with light sweet, that's what our engineers do every day, is to find ways to alleviate these bottlenecks to continue to increase when the price signals are there. So does that answer your question?
Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. And just a quick one for me on the new regional disclosure. Did I miss it, and do you intend to break out the gross margin as well in addition to cost by region?
Donald C. Templin: No, we don't intend to break out the gross margin. We intended to provide operating data that allowed people to model the -- model that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons & Company.
Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Marathon's been a leader in kind of condensate splitters and activity in the Utica, but condensate's a big issue in the Eagle Ford. And we're hearing condensate volume's rising in the Permian as well. Could you talk about the condensate supply opportunities on the Gulf Coast? Is condensate an even bigger challenge than light crudes within the Gulf Coast market? Is it tougher to blend? Talk a little bit about the condensate market on the Gulf Coast and how you see that evolving.
Gary R. Heminger: Jeff, this is Gary. In fact, we look at condensate as an opportunity, not necessarily a challenge. And we agree that there's going to be a tremendous amount of condensate. There are already a number of projects in position. I'm not going to get out ahead of ourselves here and give away some of our competitive thoughts. But we certainly are looking at some opportunities in and around the Gulf Coast as well. Today, we can blend some of that condensate into our system. Of course, some of the condensate is looked at as diluent to move up into Canada to bring the heavy barrel down. But we are looking more at the opportunities we have to be able to bring that condensate into our system, along with the Utica condensate that we've already announced. Mike, any more color on that?
C. Michael Palmer: No, Gary. I think you've answered the question. Obviously, we watch very closely the production growth that's coming from all the shale plays. And we understand and recognize that there's significant condensate. And we're looking at various ways to handle that condensate, including projects.
Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Time line kind of 2016 type in service date, so that was quickly as you could react?
Gary R. Heminger: Here in -- 2 splitters in Utica are one at the end of '14, one mid-'15. And then if you want to look at something ground up in the Gulf Coast, I would say your timing is pretty close, '16 and '15 time frame.
Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Great. And secondly, your 290,000 barrels a day of product exports are ahead of your expected capacity that you presented at the Analyst Day. Can you talk about some of your success in growing that export capacity more rapidly than anticipated?
C. Michael Palmer: Yes, Jeff. I mean, the market continues to be very robust without a doubt. And it's very interesting. It kind of comes back to what I was talking about with -- when we think about how much light sweet can we actually refine. We're well above the -- what we thought the limits were going to be in terms of our dock facilities to export finished products. But when the opportunity presents itself and the economics work, that's one of the things that we're really good at is we're really good at getting around constraints and debottlenecking. And that's exactly what we've done. And it's not only hardware, but it's the way that we schedule. It's being able to move certain products away from docks to other means of moving that product out so that we can make room for exports. It's all kinds of things that we do to maximize our profitability. And as I say, I mean that's really what we do.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.
Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: This is actually Jason Smith on for Doug. I'm just curious. We spent a lot of time on crude, but just on the product side, as a country, we're now exporting as much gasoline as we're importing. And you guys are obviously a part of that. So what do you guys see as the impact on the U.S. being balanced on the gasoline price? Do you think we continue to price off Brent, or do you think we eventually will price off of domestic crudes?
Gary R. Heminger: I would think for the near future that we'll continue to price off of Brent because if you look at -- it's not necessarily gasoline. You need to look at the entire pool. We're exporting more diesel, but in order to be able to get that diesel, gasoline is going to follow along, and diesel is being priced off of the Brent market. So we would expect for quite some time that we'll continue to be priced off of the Brent market.
Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, thanks. And just a quick follow-up, Gary, just on the quarter. I think Garyville was down for a bit in the quarter. Could you just quantify maybe the lost opportunity cost there?
Gary R. Heminger: We do not give that information out, Jason. But it just went down for some turnaround work, which is typical. At the end in the fourth quarter, early first quarter, it's a good time to be doing turnaround work at Garyville.
Donald C. Templin: Jason, this is Don. I mean our guidance around throughput would have contemplated the Garyville refinery and any activity that was...
Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Oh yes, sorry. I meant more just on the margin side on any lost opportunity cost.
Gary R. Heminger: Yes, we do not give that information out. We think that's too competitive.
Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And if I could just sneak one more quick one in. I mean in terms of the export debate within the country, it's -- obviously, chatter has picked up a little bit. I mean, what are you guys hearing now in terms of the potential to export crude at this point?
Gary R. Heminger: Well, in fact, I've spoken at a couple of conferences, and that was a theme at both conferences earlier in January. We do not oppose export. We support free markets. And we are not in the camp of any government mandates. However, I think as this thing continues to evolve, this discussion continues to evolve, you're going to see it's going to turn into a very comprehensive discussion. It needs to consider -- when you consider accrued exports, it needs to consider the Jones Act. Jones Act is a restriction on moving both crude oil and refined product in the U.S. today. You need to consider Renewable Fuel Standard, which is a restriction on moving refined products in the market today. You need to consider the restrictions on pipeline permits, not only the one that has been in the news for a long time around Keystone, but other pipelines that are being considered in and around the U.S. So -- and then just lately, you have the -- some of the very serious rail incidents that have happened. So I think all that is going to need to be taken into context into a comprehensive discussion, Jason. And I think this will take a long time to have this debate in D.C.
Operator: Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.
Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Gary, you've already answered one of my questions on the resid hydrocracker as far as reaching FIB [ph] potentially by year end. I wanted to confirm that the CapEx budget of $2.47 billion does not include any spending for that project.
Donald C. Templin: The current year's budget includes the capital for the engineering work that's being done this year, but it does not include any construction costs or anything like that.
Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Okay, so Don, just to be clear, if it were approved, let's say before year end, is there a chance that, that budget could nudge up just a tad?
Donald C. Templin: I don't believe so. If we decided to go forward, we wouldn't be in the field for construction until '15 and the early part of construction will be all land piling and so on, so forth. So you wouldn't really ramp up until mid-'15 into '16.
Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Okay, got it. The second question, if we could move away from refining a bit. On Speedway, if I look at your supplemental, trying to get a sense of free cash flow, it looks like you're free cash flow negative in '12, and then you move to a positive position in '13. And then looking at your CapEx budget for '14, at least, by our numbers, it looks like you're slightly free cash flow positive. I guess I'm wondering at this point, it seems like you're scalable enough, sizable enough to maybe be a stand-alone. And I just wondered if you've given any consideration to a spinout like we've seen others in the industry do.
Donald C. Templin: Yes, like I've said many times and will continue to say, Speedway is an integral part of our business. We measure something that's called controlled volume, where we know every day because it improves our efficiency and the way we move products through pipelines, through terminals, through trucks, finally, to the consumer. We think that's the most efficient way to move your product. And it gives us the opportunity to capture margin across that entire supply chain. And that's what Speedway does for us. We think Speedway is one of the best operators in the business, and that's seen in their new record this year in income and cash flow. When you step back then and look at a spin versus continuing to have this, as I said, a key part of our business, having -- and I've looked at others who have spun off their retail, it has varying degrees of how many years you may have a supply agreement. And 10 years, 15 years is a very short time. And then you don't have that supply, you don't have that synergy that we have today. So I'm not going to say we would never do that. We continue to look at this and study this. But I think Speedway has a long way to run as far as growing and continuing to be efficient. And I think they have one of the best backroom platforms in the business. And -- which should help it continue to grow and become more efficient. So not now, but we'll continue to watch it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just on Slide 21 of your quarterly presentation, and I think you've answered a little bit of this, but I want to clarify it. So on the other gross margin that was above and beyond what you guys realized in the indicator margins, the $658 million. I believe when you were talking about the year-over-year numbers, you said -- I assume it's the same for this number, too, is that, of the $658 million, roughly 50% is related to crude acquisition cost and the rest is related to other stuff. Is that the right way to read Slide 21 and that $658 million?
Donald C. Templin: Faisel, this is Don. That $658 million is much more weighted towards refined product price realization than the $540 million that I talked about that was quarter-over-quarter. So a much higher percentage of that $658 million is product realization.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, can you just go into a little more granularity? Because obviously, we're using the indicator margins, and then I'm not going to be able -- we're not going to be able to pick up a $658 million swing in some sort of other product categories. Can you go into a little more granularity in terms of what's in that number that allowed you to exceed the indicator margins?
Donald C. Templin: Well, the biggest -- as I said, the biggest piece of that is the price realization. We also -- and it's always been consistently one of the items that shows up in that column is our purchase for resell activity. So that has a meaningful impact as well. But we're not going to provide any more color on that. As a much -- I would just say it's a much higher percentage. As I said, the $540 million was probably 45% crude and 30-or-so percent related to refined product realization. This is a majority of the $658 million as refined product realization.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, okay, that helps. And then last question from me. With the Ho-Ho pipeline potentially for sale, do you guys have capacity on that line? And is than an asset you'd be interested in?
C. Michael Palmer: Well, it's certainly a pipeline, Faisel, that we're interested in. And it can be a good pipeline for us to take barrels coming from the Houston area into the Garyville refinery. That's probably about the only thing that I can say to you today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I know there's been a lot of questions on light imports and Saudi imports, of which you take some Arab light. Clearly, it's a more important topic today. Can you discuss generally how that contract works? I guess I'm asking, if economics permitted, how you could replace those barrels. How does the timing on the contract work given the shipment? And how easy is it to run, given I know APIs are close? But clearly, crudes have different yields, et cetera, how easy is that to replace those barrels with local crudes, which also vary on the Gulf Coast?
Gary R. Heminger: Yes, Evan, as we've stated before, we cannot get into any details about our foreign contracts. And they are term contracts. But I'll just leave it that these barrels have to be priced competitively for us to continue to be interested in that supply. And I think that tells you that obviously, they are competitive or we wouldn't be running them. But that's as far as we can go with talking about those contracts.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, then maybe away from the contract, just I mean, could -- from a refinery level, could you run other local crudes versus that crude or any other kind of run issues that relate to that?
Gary R. Heminger: Sure, I mean as I've said earlier, we can run up to 65%, we believe, of our total crude slate in a light sweet crude. Some of the Middle East crudes have different properties than some of the domestic crudes and vice versa. And some have different yield characteristics, but all those went into the equation and the calculus when we make our decision. And we have been -- if you look in total, there's still, I don't know, 1.5 million barrels or so of light sour coming into the marketplace, 1.5 million to 2 million of light sour coming into the marketplace. It's just not light sweet. It's light sour that you look at, too. So every day we're looking across the range of crudes that are imported into the U.S. to determine what is the maximum profit -- profitable crudes to run.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Well, inventories inflected this morning here, so some tailwind for those assets today. And maybe a second question, just to get your outlook on Tier 3. I know that, that was proposed last year. And I think EPA's to come out with that at some point in the first quarter. But I mean have you -- are you prepared to discuss potential impact and potential spending relative to Marathon spending that might be in the '15, '16, '17 time frame? Any thoughts at this juncture?
Gary R. Heminger: Right. We did state at our analyst meeting, we had some comment that we are prepared on Tier 3. We are not prepared yet, Evan, to get into the details because the details have not been completed yet by the EPA. We expect that probably in the first half of the year. It might even slip a little bit beyond the first half. It looks as though things are going to be spread out and give us more time to be able to get the investments made in the different plants. But it's certainly, from what we know in the early discussions, it's not onerous.
Operator: Our final question comes from Allen Good from Morningstar.
Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Just a couple quick questions on the exports. You mentioned the efforts you made in debottlenecking that increased your exports above, I guess, what you previously state your capacity to be. Could we assume that, that 400,000 barrels per day that you previously targeted for 2008, it's either may be conservative or could be realized earlier in light of some of this debottlenecking? Or is it a case where you actually need some new facilities now?
Gary R. Heminger: Allen, that's a great question. I had that same question of the team when I saw the results for the fourth quarter. But obviously, the position that we took in the fourth quarter and being able to increase the throughput was very strong, and I applaud the team that's working on this. So yes, we think we're going to get there sooner, but we do have to do some capital work by -- for the next big jump, we're going to have to do some capital work in order to be able to get to that 400,000.
Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just secondly, a lot of talk on the light crude and processing more and your ability to do so. Can you talk a little bit about the impact on yields and maybe your gasoline distillates? But specifically, how would that may change if you do increase light crude runs to the potential you have?
Gary R. Heminger: I'll let Mike answer that.
C. Michael Palmer: Allen, I guess, the main thing that you can say is that when you -- obviously, when you look at these light crudes, they do have a different yield fractions than other crude it would be replacing. And I think I mentioned to you that one of the issues you get into is most of these have a pretty good-sized naphtha cut. So you've got to be able to upgrade that naphtha. You've got to be able to reform it and make higher octane material. And that's where we've said before that we're in pretty good shape relative to the industry. But again, as those volumes grow, all refiners, including ourselves, will look at ways to handle the fractions that first provide bottlenecks. And it'll just be an ongoing iterative process to continue to run more and more of the light sweet crude.
Gary R. Heminger: Okay. With that, we'll wrap up the call. We want to thank everyone for joining us this morning and for your interest in Marathon Petroleum Corporation. If there are other questions or anything that requires clarification, please, Beth Hunter and Jerry Ewing will be available the rest of the day. Thank you very much for joining.
Operator: Thank you. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. My name is Cliff, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Pam Beall. Ms. Beall, you may begin.
Pamela K. M. Beall: Yes. Good morning. Thank you, Cliff. Thanks for joining us today on Marathon Petroleum Corporation's 2013 third quarter earnings webcast and conference call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website. On the call today are Gary Heminger, President and CEO; Garry Peiffer, Executive Vice President of Corporate Planning and Investor and Government Relations; Don Templin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rich Bedell, our Senior Vice President of Refining; Mike Palmer, Senior Vice President of Supply, Distribution and Planning. Please read Slide 2. This is our Safe Harbor statement, and it is a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and during the question-and-answer session. Our actual results may differ materially from what we expect today and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well as in our filings with the SEC. Just as a reminder, we will be hosting an Analyst and Investor Day at the Saint Regis Hotel in New York on December 4. If you have not received an invitation and would like to attend, please contact me. And now, I'll turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks.
Gary R. Heminger: Thank you, Pam, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. The third quarter was challenging for MPC and the entire U.S. refining sector with declining frac spread's, narrowing crude oil differentials and backwardation in the crude market. We believe much of the pressure on industry fundamentals was due to high industry crude runs. Incremental inventories held within the U.S. during the hurricane season also contributed to excess transportation fuel inventories since there were no significant adverse weather impacts this year. Our assets performed well during the third quarter, and we are pleased with the ongoing integration process at the Galveston Bay refinery. We continue to recognize synergies with Galveston Bay and our other refineries. In addition, we are evaluating further opportunities to unlock the earnings potential of this recently acquired asset. Our Pipeline Transportation segment provided consistent results for the quarter. We continue to advance organic investments in our midstream businesses that are catalysts for significant growth in the future. In addition to our participation in the recently announced Southern Access Extension project, we are developing a new pipeline project in the Utica Shale region that will initially connect multiple production facilities in Eastern Ohio with our Canton refinery and other MPLX pipelines in the area. This project will complement the existing condensate and crude oil truck unloading facility at Canton and our truck to barge logistics operations at Wellsville, Ohio, that was brought online in October. Speedway delivered strong performance for the quarter, resulting in more than a 34% increase in income from operations compared to the same quarter last year. This was driven in part as a result of an increase in same-store sales volumes and margins and cost control. Speedway continues its expansion in contiguous markets with construction of new stores in Pennsylvania and Tennessee, as well as its growth in commercial fueling locations for increasing sales of diesel fuel. Despite the challenging market conditions in our Refining & Marketing segment, we returned $1.2 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the 2013 third quarter. We remain confident in our ability to generate cash to continue our balanced approach to investing in value-enhancing investments in the business and returning capital to our shareholders. This confidence was underscored in September when our Board of Directors approved an additional $2 billion share repurchase authorization. As of the end of September, we have repurchased 17% of our shares since its spinoff in June of 2011. As we look forward to 2014, we are optimistic industry fundamentals will improve. We are encouraged that EPA has acknowledged its renewable volume obligation for 2014 is unworkable. We remain cautiously optimistic that EPA will establish reasonable targets for 2014. We, along with others in the industry, continue to press Congress for a permanent legislative remedy to renewable fuel standards to provide the markets great certainty over future renewable fuel obligations. Exports of gasoline and distillates continue to provide refiners incremental markets to distribute transportation fuels. Our exports reached a record 245,000 barrels per day for the quarter compared to 124,000 barrels per day during the same quarter last year. The low cost of natural gas and projected increase in supply of North American crude oil will continue to benefit U.S. refiners. In addition, U.S. refiners have the ability to produce a low sulfur refined products being increasingly required around the world. We believe these advantages will continue to provide U.S. Gulf Coast refiners with a global competitive advantage. And it should allow U.S. Gulf Coast refiners to capture growing share of demand for transportation fuels, particularly in Latin America and Europe. With that, I will ask Don Templin to review the quarter results in more detail. Don?
Donald C. Templin: Thanks, Garry. Slide 4 provides earnings and adjusted earnings data both on an absolute and per-share basis. Our third quarter 2013 adjusted earnings were $183 million compared to $1.1 billion of adjusted earnings in the third quarter of 2012. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.59 for the third quarter compared to an exceptionally strong $3.31 during the same period last year. The adjusted third quarter 2013 earnings excluded $23 million pretax for cumulative pension settlement expenses resulting from the level of employee lump-sum retirement distributions occurring in 2013. The adjusted third quarter 2012 earnings excluded $33 million of pretax pension settlement expenses and a $183 million pretax gain on the settlement of items relating to the sale of most of our Minnesota assets in 2010. The earnings walk on Chart 5 -- on Slide 5, shows by segment, the change in adjusted earnings from the third quarter of 2012 to the third quarter of 2013. The primary driver for the change in our adjusted earnings was the decrease in income from our Refining & Marketing segment, partially offset by an increase in income from our Speedway and Pipeline Transportation segments and lower income taxes. As shown on Slide 6, Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was $227 million in the third quarter of 2013, compared with just under $1.7 billion in the third quarter of 2012. We've expanded this chart to show both price and volume impasse. The change from 2012 was primarily due to lower crack spreads, narrower crude differentials and lower product price realizations, partially offset by increased volumes due in large part to the acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery, along with operations at the Detroit refinery. The unfavorable earnings impacts associated with the lower crack spreads and narrowing crude oil differentials are found in the price columns for the following 4 market metrics: LLS 6-3-2-1 crack, the sweet/sour differential, the LLS to WTI differential and the LLS prompt versus delivered column. All of these indicators utilize spot market values. As a result, differences in our actual product price realizations and our actual crude cost quarter-to-quarter are reflected in the Other Gross Margin column. So let me make a few comments about each of these items. First, our product price realizations compared to spot market values were lower in the third quarter of this year than in the third quarter of last year, due in part to the impact of renewable identification numbers or RINs. RIN prices averaged approximately $0.085 on a per E10 gallon basis for the third quarter 2013, compared to $0.015 per gallon in the third quarter of 2012. Our cash cost for the RINs we purchased to meet our RFS obligation was approximately $25 million per month for the third quarter of 2013. We continue to believe that the traditional crack spreads using neat gasoline and distillate spot market values versus the biofuel blends that are actually sold likely overstate refiners' earnings due to the impact of RINs. Second, our actual crude and feedstock acquisition cost compared to the market indicators were more favorable during the 2013 third quarter than they were in the comparable period last year. The increase in direct operating costs quarter-over-quarter, is primarily due to the acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery and is consistent with our guidance. On the next 2 slides, we provide earnings walks for each of our other operating segments. Slide 7 show Speedway's income from operations was $102 million in the third quarter of 2013 compared with $76 million the third quarter of 2012. Speedway's light product gross margin was $27 million higher in the third quarter of 2013 compared with the third quarter of 2012. This increase was primarily due to a $0.03 per gallon higher gross margin. Merchandise margin was $224 million in the third quarter of 2013 compared with $217 million during the same period last year. This $7 million increase was primarily due to margin expansion from increasing merchandise and food sales. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes were up 1% in the third quarter 2013 compared with 2012 third quarter. Speedway's same-store merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes, increased 5.6% over the third quarter last year, which is noteworthy, considering the third quarter last year was up 4.1% from the same quarter in 2011. Speedway's average retail gasoline price during the third quarter of 2013 was $3.44 compared to $3.62 in the same period last year. Slide 8 shows changes in our Pipeline Transportation segment income. Income from operations was $54 million in the third quarter of 2013 compared with $52 million in the third quarter of 2012. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in transportation tariffs offset by higher operating expenses and depreciation. A portion of the increase in transportation tariffs is related to the formation of MPLX. A number of items that made up the unfavorable operating expense variance, the largest of which were costs now incurred by MPLX as a standalone entity. Slide 9 presents the significant drivers of changes in our cash flow for the third quarter of 2013. At September 30, 2013, our cash balance was just over $2 billion. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was up $475 million source of cash. As shown on this slide, the primary driver of the reduction in cash balance for the third quarter is the over $1 billion of cash used for share repurchases that Gary Heminger highlighted earlier. Slide 10 shows that at the end of the third quarter, we had just over $2 billion of cash and approximately $3.4 billion of debt. With EBITDA of almost $4.8 billion during the last 12 months, we continue to be in a very manageable debt position, with leverage of 0.7x EBITDA and a debt to total capital ratio of 23%. Turning to Slide 11. During the last 12 months, we generated nearly $4.1 billion in cash from operations and $1.3 billion of free cash flow. Over that same period, we returned over $3.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This was about 2.5x our free cash flow over that period. During the third quarter 2013, we purchased approximately 14 million shares for about $1 billion through open market repurchases. It is our intention to continue returning capital to our shareholders that is not currently needed in the business. Slide 12 provides outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the fourth quarter of 2013. For competitive purposes, those same metrics for the fourth quarter of 2012 are also shown. As you can see, turnaround costs are expected to be substantial in the fourth quarter at approximately $350 million or just over $2 per barrel of total throughput. Looking forward, we also expect significant turnaround costs in the first quarter of 2014, estimated to approximate $500 million. The October market data document will be published tomorrow on our investor website. Our mission continues to be value creation for our shareholders. We are committed to pursuing opportunities to create near and long-term value and believe the returns to our shareholders reflect that focus. We will be balanced and disciplined in our approach to capital allocation as we continue to assess the opportunities in front of us. And now, I will return the call back to Pam Beall.
Pamela K. M. Beall: Okay. Thank you, Don. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll open up the call to questions. Cliff?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ed Westlake from Crédit Suisse.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: My first comment is actually on the MLP, I don't know if you -- I'm sure you've seen the market response to the other transactions that we've seen in the MLP space. I'm thinking Devon and Crosstex being a little bit more aggressive in terms of bringing forward the value of the MLP. Does that change the way you're thinking about your sort of progressive drop-down strategy?
Garry L. Peiffer: Yes, Ed. This is Garry Peiffer. Sure, we're watching all those transactions and activities very closely and considering that, when we set our growth -- annual distribution growth targets, and I think you know in those cases, we just celebrated essentially today, our 1 year anniversary, so we've only been in the MLP space for a relatively short period of time but we watch them all. And that's why I think in the last quarter, we gave a little more definitive guidance to the market when we said that we're projecting annual distribution growth in the 15% to 20% range for at least the next several years, to give a little more specificity, if you will, to what we're expecting and how we're expecting to grow the MLP. So we're definitely watching, aware of and analyzing all those activities.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then a specific question on the data pack and the RIN distortions. Obviously RIN prices have pulled back thanks to what it seems like the EPA is looking to do. Have you started to see those distortions versus the data back on the pricing reduce?
Garry L. Peiffer: Yes. This is Garry, again. Yes, definitely. I think yesterday RINs we assessed maybe about $0.25 a gallon per RIN or about $0.025 per E10 gallon. In the third quarter, we averaged closer to about $0.85 or so and that was about the same in the second quarter. So the distortion that you saw in the second and third quarter is obviously less at $0.025 a gallon versus $0.085 a gallon so I think we're getting better clarity of what impact that has on the bottom line. And as you know, we've talked last time, it's really an impact whether you write a check to acquire RIN or you sell at the wholesale level, that effect really comes through financially, no matter which way you go about acquiring your RINs.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: So your thought process is that the RIN has been driving these distortions, it's not other factors such as gasoline oversupply, et cetera?
Garry L. Peiffer: Well, I think that's obviously affecting the overall market but I think the distortion, when you try to translate the gross, neat, spot values into a bottom line profit after RINs, that's where the distortion comes in.
Operator: Our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Maybe a follow-up to Ed's question and on a longer-term basis, given your higher multiple MPLX, it translates to a lower yield, it all relates to the parent affiliation with MPC and the drop-down potential there. I mean, do you believe MPLX, over the longer term, is a natural consolidator within the midstream space?
Gary R. Heminger: Evan, this is Gary. Yes, we do and as we continue to follow MPLX and back to Ed's question, certainly, we're following everything that's in the marketplace and as we discussed many times with our logistics assets that we have inside of MPC, as well as the remaining ownership that we have, this -- not the drop-down yet, into MPLX from our initial start of the company, we have much flexibility in many avenues in which we can turn. On top of that, I think it's very important to understand, we're working on many organic opportunities. As we stated when we first started this company, this was not just going to be a drop-down story of MPC assets. We are working very hard and expect to be able to give you some more color when we're together in early December around that strategy. So again, it's not just around MPC, it's what we can do to grow this business and really tee it up for the long-term. And as I said, we'll give you more information on that when we're together in early December.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, perfect. Second question on capital allocation. That was an aggressive buyback in the quarter, as representing a much higher percentage of relative free cash flow. I mean, could you talk about that change? I mean are you making a statement that you believe weaker 3Q conditions are transitory and you're using associated weakness to retire shares? And in addition to the cash that remains on the balance sheet, do you also view MLP-able assets as another potential source of liquidity that could fund a lot of different things, including a buyback? [indiscernible]
Donald C. Templin: Yes. Evan, this is Don. I mean, we have consistently said that we are committed to returning cash that's in excess of the needs of our business and core liquidity needs to our investors, and we've discussed a number of times, our view around sort of our core liquidity needs, including the cash balance that needs to support that core liquidity needs. And the activity that we've been undertaking really in the last 12 to 18 months has been very focused at getting our cash balance down, working it down and returning that excess cash that isn't being deployed to the business to our shareholders. I do think that we have a lot of tools in the future that are available to allow us, in addition to sort of our strong earnings growth profile and what we think we continue to grow in the midstream, MPLX is a great tool and we can generate cash by dropping assets down to support return of capital to shareholders. We have LP units, as you know, that we can monetize if we need to. So I feel great about our ability, over the long term, to continue to return capital to our shareholders in a very disciplined way.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Great. One last, if I might. Just can you provide an update on turnarounds in the quarter? I believe Garry, it was your only asset currently in turnaround. Any update when you expect to exit there or what the -- more of the utilization impact in the quarter might be other than what you already gave as you said was a turnaround of events? I'll leave it there.
Donald C. Templin: With respect to the utilization impact, our outlook information, that includes the projected crude throughput at the refinery. So that data that we projected forward there includes the volumes or decrease in volumes arising from the turnaround. We don't give specific information on which refinery it is and how long the turnaround lasts.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank.
Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: We've done a little work over the past 3 years on crude discounts and I think we buy into the idea, obviously, of a structural discount of U.S. crude to international. Our concern is the product markets, in your case, particularly around Chicago and whether or not we may just end up with an oversupply of product in those internal markets. Gary, can you talk a bit more about how you can mitigate the risk of products oversupply inland U.S. as a way of maintaining excess profit and refining, as opposed to just cheap crudes simply leading to cheap gasoline?
Gary R. Heminger: Right. Well, that's a very delicate situation, as you outlined, Paul. What we could do to mitigate is really a strategy that we have employed for many years. Being one of the larger suppliers into the Midwest PADD II and having pipeline logistics that we can move from PADD III into PADD II and then using our barge system that we also can move products out of PADD II, we optimize every day and we are a big buyer of additional products in the Midwest, as well. And over the years, what we have done to mitigate that is to be able to take advantage of excess -- at times, excess product, mainly gasoline. Distillate is fairly balanced in PADD II, but mainly gasoline. If there's excess product available, we buy it for different turnaround cycles, different maintenance cycles and we can deploy that around the Midwest instead of shipping it up from the South. I'm sure that you have noticed over time that pipeline shipments from the South in various of the big common carrier systems has certainly declined over time and that's because of the way we have tried to resupply some of those markets by using that product in the Midwest. I will agree with you that when you look at the shoulder quarters and especially the inventory that was in place, as I said in my talk earlier, the inventory that was in place over the summer, building for hurricanes just don't build inventory in the Gulf Coast for hurricanes but in the form of either crude or refined products. We moved that up into some of the Midwest terminals, as well. So as that inventory was there and you reduce that inventory and use it up, it's -- I think that is what has caused some of the downturn in the crack spreads over this period of time. But those are the types of things that we have done to try to mitigate and be a leader in the marketplace.
Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Yes, I guess, it speaks to your integration strategy. The follow-on question which is beyond on the obvious question, which would be on product exports. Can you talk about the dynamics there? How much they're growing, how the outlook looks, and what you're doing to invest in increasing those exports?
Gary R. Heminger: Yes, let's have Mike Palmer talk about this.
C. Michael Palmer: Yes, Paul, and I know you've seen our numbers and obviously, we've been growing these exports considerably, probably more than anybody expected over the last couple of years. And I can tell you that we have no shortage of opportunities to export both distillate and gasoline. Things are looking real good in that area. We are doing things to debottleneck that allow us to export more over the docks. We have an export tank that's coming on at Garyville that will allow us to export gasoline more than we do today. We see this as a core part of our business and we would expect to continue to grow it.
Operator: This question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Real quick. If I'm looking at in the third quarter, comparing to the market data, it seems like sequential data, the second quarter, your margin capture rate actually is somewhat better. Is there any particular factors that we should be aware?
Garry L. Peiffer: Paul, this is Garry Peiffer. Nothing that strikes me off the top directly. I guess, the one thing that probably has happened is kind of like we talked about earlier in terms of the RINs. I think there's better -- a little bit better understanding of the RINs effect going on between the second quarter and the third quarter, which was similar and the value of those RINs were similar. So I think the market, as you know, it takes a while for it to get a little clarity when you have a sudden shock to the system like when the WTI LLS spreads collapsed or when these RINs kind of enter into the equation and everything takes a little bit of time to recalibrate itself and I think that's going on now. The people understand impact of RINs on spot market prices, on crack spreads and on people's bottom lines. So I think it's more's maybe the market is getting itself a little more acclimated and recalibrated to this new world of -- you have to consider RINs in the calculation of how much you charge and how much you make.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Garry, in the second quarter, one of the factor that you guys point out hurting your reseller stand [ph], rest of the Midwest region where your refinery locate, the porter prices did not move up as much as Chicago, so regional differences. And I think in the third quarter, that still have that issue. So what have you seen so far in the quarter? Have we start to see the reversal that the rest of the Midwest market catch up with the Chicago pricing?
Gary R. Heminger: Paul, this Gary. What we have seen -- and you're right, and I think it goes back to the discussion I had before about mitigating prices due to -- at times, excess supply in PADD II. As we go in now to PADD IV and just looking here at some of the terminal prices, we are seeing a rebound in both gas and distillate pricing so far here in the fourth quarter. And again, it's using up that inventory that was on hand for hurricane and other weather impacts, so we...
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Gary, I guess my question is more on that. Let's say if I'm looking at country [ph] or Ohio, is the port of pricing relative to Chicago return back to a more historical level now? Or that they are still being disadvantaged, as what we have seen in the second quarter and perhaps in the third quarter?
Gary R. Heminger: Go ahead, Mike.
C. Michael Palmer: Paul, we're trying to understand what you're asking. Are you asking about wholesale rack prices?
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Yes. I mean, what I'm saying is that in the second quarter then you guys pinpoint upon a -- or highlight one of the reason behind why you did not capture as much as what the market indicators suggest is that in the Midwest market, you think that Chicago porter pricing as a benchmark, but that the rest of the Midwest market in the second quarter did not rise up to the same extent. So that there's a regional basis different between the rest of the Midwest and the Chicago pricing. And my question is that the have we seen that trend be worse?
Gary R. Heminger: Yes. I'm sorry, Paul. We now understand your question.
Garry L. Peiffer: And I guess -- this is Garry, again. I guess, in the second quarter, we had pretty sudden increases in prices in the Midwest driven by some turnaround activity primarily, plus compounded by a bit of the confusion related to the RINs. So I think that has been mitigated in the third quarter. And I think as we've looked at the demand, we see demand as being relatively good for gasoline here in the last few months. So I think all those things are translating in a little bit better realization in terms of how much we put in our pocket at the end of the day versus those spot market values, unlike that sudden run-up in the second quarter for Chicago.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Garry Heminger, you were very early to share your thoughts about the structural discount on crude pricing. I wonder if could just ask you to bring us up-to-date with your latest thoughts and specifically, what I'm thinking is the view that you take as to how the discounts are crossing grades, particularly towards sour grades in the Gulf Coast and how that might perhaps change the way you think about your slate going forward.
Gary R. Heminger: Sure. And you're right, Doug. We've talked about this and maybe we're one of the early ones to come out and chat. Let me turn this over to Mike because Mike has a lot more detail in the crude markets right now. So Mike, if you'll take that question.
C. Michael Palmer: Okay, and Doug, I want to be sure I understand your question. Are you interested about sour spreads in the Gulf Coast?
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Basically. Because it's not just -- obviously, it appears that with LLS with a discount to Brent, that everything that typically trades on the Gulf Coast is not pricing off LLS. I just wanted to get your perspective as to how sustainable you think that may be and how it might change your views to keep yourself going forward.
C. Michael Palmer: Well, again, coming back to this whole LLS situation and I would throw Mars into the same package, I think. One of the things that's happening right now in the Gulf Coast, I mean obviously, you've seen these very wide LLS to Brent spreads. I mean, we're talking $10, $11. And that's -- we think that's pretty unusual right now. And the inventories on the Gulf Coast, the crude inventories are very high. There was a massive amount of turnaround activity that took place. I think there was something like 700,000 barrels a day of refining capacity that was off-line for a period here in October. And that's led to near record-high inventories on the Gulf and I think as a result of that, you've seen LLS spreads that have been extremely wide relative to Brent. We've said for some time that structurally, as the production of the shale plays continues, we've said for some time that we expect LLS to trade at a discount to Brent. And we still believe that and that should be several dollars. So we think that, that's going to be a benefit longer-term. It's probably something that, as these inventories start to come down, you'll probably see this $10, $11 spread start to come back together again. Now LLS and Mars -- and Mars obviously being the sour crude in the Gulf, those 2 have traded in a very similar trade differential over the last several months. It's been that $4.50 to $6.50 kind of level. It hasn't changed very much.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I appreciate your comments on that. Gary if I could use my follow-up to talk about -- something that doesn't get a lot of attention often as a retail business. As it relates to your growth plans, some time ago, you had mentioned that you were -- you saw a very competitive and attractive business in the Hess retail network. I don't want to be too specific here, but I'm just wondering, how are you feeling currently about expanding your retail business both organically or through acquisition? I'll leave it there.
Gary R. Heminger: Well, as I said earlier in my speech, Doug, we have expanded into both Tennessee and Western Pennsylvania. With our Canton refinery with Utica Shale and moving this product into Western Pennsylvania, especially as you see some of the logistics change from the East Coast that used to bring refined product back to Western Pennsylvania, we have seen a great opportunity to move into that market. And Speedway has done so, same as in Tennessee. So they're expanding those markets as well as continuing to fill in the flanks, if you will, in the current markets in which we have operated. More so with rebuilds stations than with new builds in those states. But we're going to continue to step out with Speedway. I doubt that we will do a leapfrog of several states unless we can do something that has some market density. Your question pertaining to Hess, my compliments to John Hess, he has developed, I think, one of the best looking retail chains across the eastern seaboard. And we'll just continue to see what plays out as they make their strategic decisions on that part. But as I say, my hats off to them. I think they have one of the best looking systems on the East Coast.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Good fit with Marathon, Gary?
Gary R. Heminger: I'm sorry?
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Would it be a good fit with Marathon?
Gary R. Heminger: I think it would be an excellent fit. We'd be an excellent fit with Speedway. Marathon is the upper side of our business whereas Speedway is the company-owned and operated side. So we'd be a good fit there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chi Chow from Macquarie Capital.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: I got a question on Galveston Bay. Gary, you mentioned this in your remarks but can you talk more about specifics on the opportunities you're undertaking at the plant now that you've had it for 9 months? And in particular, I'm interested in what sort of crude changes you've made so far.
Gary R. Heminger: Sure, Chi. And that's a very fair question. And what we've decided to do, Chi, we have several things to talk about at Galveston Bay. Instead of using the conference or earnings call here to the talk about this, this is going to be one of the primary things we discuss at our meeting in December. So if I could ask your forgiveness to give me 6 weeks and we'll give you a lot more detail. Out of the synergies that we've been able to capture so far, the different crude runs we've been able to change and capture that Mike's group has done and then Rich's group on what some of the opportunities are as we see, to really capture additional, what we see, potential value. That's really going to be one of the centerpieces of our presentation in December.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: Okay. Gary, you're forgiven on that one. Let me try this one on Galveston Bay. Can you just, from a modeling standpoint, going forward here, how does Galveston Bay now impact the capture rate of your system relative to the historical pattern? Any comments on that end?
Gary R. Heminger: Well, as you know, we have not given individual refining information and our plan is competitively -- and I know there are several of you that -- and probably all of you, that will like us to give individual refining information going forward and we're not -- our plan is at this time, not to do that. I think Garry might have some comments about the capture rate itself.
Garry L. Peiffer: I guess, Chi -- this is Garry Peiffer. What we've given in the way of some market metrics in terms of some moves in crack spreads and sweet/sours, we've incorporated in those calculations, our best estimates of what the Galveston Bay refinery impact is on those metrics. So we try to incorporate those into the metrics we've given already and when crack spreads change $1, we're saying that's roughly a $450 million or $425 million bottom-line effect. And so those all metrics, they all incorporate our best estimate of Galveston Bay.
Gary R. Heminger: And Chi, just a year ago, when we were outlining Galveston Bay and what our plans were, and then we closed that transaction February. I'll leave a little bit forward here and talk about -- we're very pleased with the operation of the plant and how it's performing on a volumetric basis. We've gone in and repaired and really brought this refinery up to our standards in many areas. As I said, this was not a dash that we were entering, this was going to be a journey and this was going to be a longer-term run here. And so that's why we're going to outline for you in December, what some of the opportunities are. But I would say, no surprises. We continue to gather synergies at a faster clip than we had expected and we're very pleased with the asset to date.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: Don, on the CapEx budget, are you still at -- I think it was a little over $1.6 billion for 2013, is that still accurate?
Donald C. Templin: Yes, Chi, that's an accurate budget and what we'll do at our December Investor Day, we'll plan to give you the '14 budget, as well, that we have a board meeting coming up where that gets approved and the timing of that meeting was scheduled so that we could communicate the '14 budget to you all.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: Okay. Well, that suggests a pretty high capital spend in the fourth quarter. Can you give any details on sort of the components of that spending in 4Q and...
Donald C. Templin: I guess, in terms of your -- I guess, I'd interpret your question, do you think you'll go over your $1.6 billion? I mean, we are not expecting to go over the $1.6 billion. We might come under that $1.6 billion, if that's your question.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: Well, no. I was just -- given the spending through third quarter here today, it's just suggesting a significant bump up in the fourth quarter from what I see, so I'm just wondering the components of that spending. And then, maybe if you can reminds us of what your minimum cash balance is that you're comfortable with, you may have mentioned that earlier though.
Donald C. Templin: Yes, in the minimum -- on the core liquidity, I think we've consistently said that we believe that the core liquidity for MPC is somewhere in the $4.5 billion to $5 billion range, and that's currently satisfied by the $2.5 billion revolver, the $1 billion AR securitization and then the cash balance makes up the rest of that commitment. So I think we've said $1 billion to $1.5 billion of cash is what we believe -- is sort of a core component of our balance sheet.
Garry L. Peiffer: And, Chi, this is Garry Peiffer. Regarding the capital, just by the way we've historically constructed things and being here in the Midwest with a lot of sea stores that we're building at the moment, it's fairly traditional that we tend to spend not necessarily half, but a good share of our budget in the fourth quarter finishing up projects that we don't necessarily start in a lot of cases till the second quarter. So I have every confidence that we will spend close to the $1.6 billion, barring some major issue that we're not aware of at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Terreson from ISI.
Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Gary, this might be the same question that Chi just asked, but it's a little bit different but if you want to defer, that's fine. But when I think about Galveston Bay and the longer-term perspective there and I guess the questions' really about, has your perspective on the scoped had value longer-term changed? And I asked the question because you guys significantly surpassed everybody's expectations at Garyville during the past 4 or 5 years that [ph] on production growth and capital productivity. So the question is when you think about this longer term, do you sense that there may be a parallel -- I mean I know that the movement continues at Garyville today and performance is fantastic but might we see a similar type of outcome at Galveston Bay whether it be additional debottlenecking or petrochemicals that is over and above some of the things that you commonly talk about when you refer to synergies?
Gary R. Heminger: Well, Doug, that's a very fair question. Again, I want to be very careful that we don't lean too far forward here until we're ready to make a full, sum presentation on Galveston Bay. But let me ask Rich Bedell here to make a few comments.
Richard D. Bedell: Doug, just looking at Galveston Bay, it has a lot of the similarities in that it's got the size, it has the complexity, it has the logistical options, both for all the crudes that are coming into the area and also the logistical options to export products. So in that regard, it has a lot of the same qualities that Garyville has. And I think if we think long term, where we're thinking of having 2 powerhouse Gulf Coast refineries there with a lot of crude, a lot of upgrading capacity and a lot of export potential, and that's our vision.
Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's great. We'll look forward to seeing the details in December.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons.
Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: I was hoping I could get you to talk a little bit about the rail strategy. You've obviously got a big logistical footprint existing but you haven't been as aggressive as some of the peers in buying new rail cars and announcing new rail unloading facilities. So your responses seem to be more muted. Are you less excited about the potential for rail than others in the industry or do you believe that people are underestimating the cost or could you talk a little bit about your rail strategy?
C. Michael Palmer: Yes, Jeff. This is Mike Palmer, I'd be happy to do that. We have spent a lot of time doing analysis and really looking at rails. It's not as if we haven't done that. In fact, I can tell you that we have -- we've even experimented with rail. We've brought in both North Dakota crude into the system, we've brought some heavy Canadian into the system by rail. So we've watched it, we've looked at the costs, but I can tell you that it is a high-cost transportation alternative. And maybe one of the reasons that we're a little different than others is that we are pretty well connected by pipeline. And I think that everybody in the industry would agree that with rail, it can't compete with pipe if you have pipe that's connected to your refining system and that's really where we're at. So we always look at it, we can continue to look at it to see if there's any opportunities. But by and large, we are well connected to pipelines and we're kind of committed to that strategy.
Gary R. Heminger: And Jeff, we've previously talked about the SAX extension. We've been public about that and things we're working on as to everyday is to provide a cheaper alternative. And if rail's a cheaper alternative, we certainly were to -- would be investing in that. But where our refineries are and the way we're situated, totally agree with Mike's comments. We're blessed with a very strong midstream system, continue to grow that midstream system and we'll more than likely do that with pipes and possibly barges rather than rail.
Operator: Our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I guess maybe following up on the logistics question. Could you give us a little more of an idea maybe of, kind of the volumes you're starting to see in the Utica? I know you've talked historically about maybe being able to use about 30,000 barrels a day of condensate without additional investments in the units there. Are you seeing enough barrels now moving forward with this pipeline that we should expect to see some investments in the units to maybe, expand the number of barrels of condensate or very light oil?
C. Michael Palmer: Roger, this is Mike Palmer again. Yes, the answer is absolutely. We're still very optimistic about the Utica and I think as you know, there have been a lot more wells permitted and drilled and are actually producing and that's have been a result really, of the gas takeaway capacity. That's coming on so we have been ramping up. At Canton today at the truck rack, I think we're bringing in roughly 10,000 barrels a day of mostly condensate. If you look at Catlettsburg, we just brought in our first barge over the Wellsville dock and that will continue. So I think that what we expect is that over -- certainly over '14 and '15, as this gas infrastructure gets hooked up, these wells will come on and we will be ramping up the volume of condensate that we can process at these plants.
Donald C. Templin: And Roger, this is Don. In fact, we have 2 capital projects that we talked about. Condensate, splitters that both Canton and Catlettsburg that get our -- allow us to probably use up to 60,000 barrels a day of condensate. We staged them 1 for completion in '14 and 1 for completion in '15, really to be consistent with our expectations around the increase and the growth in that Utica production.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And could you probably go into a little more detail than you want to do, but if you could give us any idea maybe, of the advantage that you're able to achieve on condensate in that part of the country relative to say, other markers, WTI, Syncrude, something like that.
Donald C. Templin: Yes, Roger, we really don't get into the pricing on individual crudes. As you could expect, Utica is a WTI based kind of crude and being a condensate, you're going to get a discount. But we really don't want to share more than that.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And I guess my final question, you talked earlier about exports as much as you can or -- I don't remember the exact wording but I was curious, as you look out, say, 2 years, where you think your exports might be versus where your exports are today.
Gary R. Heminger: Well, the big thing, Roger, with our exports, when we built our GME project and started up in '09, we built a brand new dock. At the time, we thought that the dock had a capacity of about 75,000 barrels per day. We've been able to de-bottleneck, we've been able to add some incremental tankage. And in fact, Rich has a big gasoline tank that will done at the end of this year, early part of next year, to even provide us more flexibility. So what we have done is we've been able to de-bottleneck the Garyville docks, using the crude and other product dock space to be able to optimize way beyond what we thought. We have the same thing at Galveston Bay and we're continuing to optimize Galveston Bay and then we have a big study on how sort -- your question is asking number of years down the road. We have a big study on how we can optimize Galveston Bay's dock down the road to be able to get more capacity. So every quarter, the guys tell me we're at capacity and we find ways to get more out of the plants and over the docs. So we will continue to do that.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: If I missed it earlier, did you give an export number for this quarter?
Gary R. Heminger: Yes. We were 245,000 barrels per day for this quarter.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And the breakdown between gasoline and diesel?
Gary R. Heminger: We don't break that down.
Pamela K. M. Beall: Cliff, do we have another question?
Operator: We do have a question from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just given your expanded, sort of position in the Gulf Coast and your preference to use pipelines rather than rail, do you think that you need to expand, sort of your pipeline capacity portfolio, your lease capacity and even some of the investments you're making right now? Is there a need for expansion beyond kind of what you're doing or what you have right now?
Gary R. Heminger: Well, Faisel, there are many pipeline projects being talked about, especially in the Gulf Coast. A lot of people announced projects before they had done sometimes. A lot of competition for pipeline capacity coming out of the Eagle Ford. There's some pipeline reversals and some incremental pipelines being discussed in between LOOP and in the Houston ship channel. The SAX pipeline that we already talked about is going to give us that niche that is missing today to be able to get us to get to more crude eventually down into the Gulf Coast area. So there are many opportunities going, some that we're looking at being investors in through MPLX and some that might just be shipping on. And I'll ask Mike to -- maybe to add a little more color here.
C. Michael Palmer: Yes, Faisel, I guess what I would say too, is that if you look at the plans that various companies have for pipeline activity in the Gulf coast and you think about our Galveston Bay plant, certainly you've seen the pipelines that are being built from the Permian Basin into Houston. The Longhorn reversal, there's another pipeline called BridgeTex that will be coming on next year. There is a lot of capacity for us to utilize in order to bring, for example, the Permian Basin crude into Galveston Bay. The Eagle Ford infrastructure, there's a lot there already, as I'm sure you know, and then it's supplemented with vessels, with barges. And the other thing that you need to think about as well is for example, the big pipelines that are getting built from Canada to come down. Obviously, XL [ph] has not been approved yet. No one knows for sure if it will but Enbridge as a Gulf Coast access project where they're going to build a new piece of pipe from South Chicago down to Cushing. They're going to loop the Seaway line. It provides and a lot of additional capacity into that Houston, Galveston Bay area. And I'm sure that there will be smaller things that we need to do ourselves in the area. But there's some major assets that are being built.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. Fair enough. Last question for me, and it's just a little more of a controversial question I mean, with all this crude sort of hitting the Gulf Coast by pipeline and sort of production growth continuing to accelerate in the U.S., do you have any -- Gary, do you have any opinions on the crude oil export ban in the U.S. and whether you think there's any chance that something happens to that ban or do you just think that it just stays the same?
Gary R. Heminger: Well, there continues to be discussion, obviously, with the RIN issue and all the work that we've done inside of the beltway on the RIN issue. There's been some discussion at the same time about exporting crude. We'll see. We're really exporting crude today. It just happens to look like refined product and that is the mechanism to export crude today. We'll see where it goes. I think it's more than likely down the road that, that would even be considered. The second thing you look at is if you were to export crude, whether the markets that are really clamoring for types of light sweet crude that are available today. And I think Mike outlined it very well when he was talking about the number of the pipelines in the Eagle Ford to the Permian, trying to get this into the refining suite that uses these types of crudes is really what's going on right now. But we will wait and see what happens on the crude side. There's not a lot of discussion on it right now.
Operator: We have time for one more question. Our question comes from Allen Good from Morningstar.
Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Just a quick one on the retail. Is there any way to gauge your appetite for increasing the size of Speedway. Whether it be a number of stores or percent of the shirt sales or anything along those lines we could sort of get an idea of how far you want to take the acquisition strategy and grow that business?
Gary R. Heminger: Well, Allen, what we have said about Speedway and the Marathon Brand also is that we think it's important to continue to increase the amount of -- our definition is called controlled volume. That's where we can use our pipeline assets, our terminal assets, our refining assets in order to be able to have a steady, gradable movement of that product into the marketplace. And we would like to grow that number, get it back up into the 70% or so range. We used to be at about 65% before we bought Galveston Bay. Granted, we got a number of retail stores or retail supply, I should say, to the Marathon Brand when we bought Galveston Bay. But that number is probably down in the high 50% to 60% type range today. So we have a strong appetite to continue to grow. We think Speedway continues to show very strong return on invested capital-type numbers and expect that into the future. And we think retail in the future is really going to be -- the winners in that market are the ones who are going to have the best back room and the best cost control. And I think Speedway ranks up there in both of those as a top-tier, best-in-class performer. But the amount of capital it's going to take, as I said earlier in my comments, be hard for us to leapfrog markets just to go buy a chain somewhere that does not give us synergies that we have today. But we do have a strong appetite to grow our retail.
Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: And when you add incremental stores, are you gaining operating leverage as you add more stores to that business or it's just a case of adding incremental sales and earnings per store?
Gary R. Heminger: No, we're increasing operating leverage, as well. As long as it's contiguous to the operations we have today and that's why I say we find our economics -- it does not benefit us to leapfrog into a market that we don't have density in. So yes, we do get operating leverage and it's because we think we have a very sophisticated, low-cost backroom platform that manages inventory, manages the stores and Tony Kenney and his team have been, I think, have outperformed this market. When you look at a total margin per gallon or margin per merchandise dollars sold, I think that they stand at -- they're definitely a top-tier performer.
Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: If I could just -- one quick one on exports. I believe previously you said or may have been last year, that exports are pretty evenly split between Europe and Latin America. Is that still the case or are you opening up new markets or has demand shifted from maybe Europe to Latin America or vice versa?
Gary R. Heminger: It's hard to say because the manifest that we have -- we're loading FOB Garyville or FOB Galveston Bay. In some cases, we're selling to the end-user in both markets but in some cases, we're selling to an aggregator who might be moving it into markets that we're not aware of. So I can't say right now what the split is.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Pam Beall for closing remarks.
Pamela K. M. Beall: Yes. Thank you, Cliff. And thanks for joining us on the call today, recognizing that we need to cut it off at an hour. If there are some follow-up questions, please give us a call and we'll be in the office today. Beth Hunter, Jerry Ewing and myself. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Call for Marathon Petroleum Corporation. My name is Cliff, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Pam Beall. Ms. Beall, you may begin.
Pamela K. M. Beall: All right. Thank you, Cliff, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2013 earnings webcast and conference call. You can find the synchronized slides that accompany the call on our website. And on the call today are Gary Heminger, President and CEO; Garry Peiffer, Executive Vice President of Corporate Planning and Investor and Government Relations; Don Templin, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rich Bedell, our Senior Vice President of Refining; Tom Kelly, our Senior Vice President of Marketing; and Mike Palmer, our Senior Vice President of Supply, Distribution and Planning. If you turn to Slide 2, please read the Safe Harbor statement on this slide. It is a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation, as well as the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today. And factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now, I'll turn the call over to Gary Heminger for our opening remarks.
Gary R. Heminger: Thank you, Pam, and good morning to everyone. Thanks for joining us today. If you'd please turn to Slide 3. MPC had a strong operating quarter. At our Detroit refinery, our upgraded units ran well, and we continue to be pleased with these operations, where we were able to process additional volumes of lower-priced Canadian heavy oil. We are also pleased with the integration process of the Galveston Bay refinery, and the plant there is operating well. Light product exports from our Garyville and Galveston Bay refineries increased significantly to 190,000 barrels per day during the second quarter of 2013, which is the highest level of exports we have achieved. Speedway posted strong financial results, primarily due to an increase in the fuel and merchandise gross margins. In May, MPLX, the master limited partnership we formed last year, acquired an additional 5% equity interest in MPLX Pipe Line Holdings, LP. MPLX also increased its second quarter distribution 4.6%. We remain committed to positioning MPLX among the top MLPs, and we are targeting a distribution growth rate of 15% to 20% for, at least, the next several years. We will continue to pursue opportunities that support that intent. Several developments resulted in lower earnings for our second quarter of 2013 compared to a very strong quarter we achieved a year ago. During the second quarter of 2013, the industry experienced refinery crude runs that were higher than both the last year and the 5-year average, with much of the increase in PADD III. This contributed to a drawdown of crude inventories to meet refining demand and a narrowing of crude spreads. In addition, gasoline inventories were higher than last year and the 5-year average. As a result, the U.S. Gulf Coast market was weaker, and cracks were lower compared to the second quarter of last year. The Chicago market experienced greater-than-usual volatility during the quarter, primarily due to significant maintenance at area refineries. When the Chicago refinery -- Chicago area refineries came back online, a short supply situation in the Midwest quickly reversed into a long supply situation. Rapid movement in spot prices in the market are not always reflected immediately, as wholesale racks -- at wholesale racks or on the street. We believe another factor impacting the market realizations was the rapid rise in the price of RINs, or renewable identification numbers. Our product price realizations, when compared to spot market values, were lower in the second quarter of this year than in the second quarter of last year. In the meantime, we, along with the rest of the industry, are urging the EPA, the administration and members of Congress, to address this unworkable Renewable Fuel Standard to avert potentially a significant harm to consumers and the economy in both the short term and long term. Now going forward, we expect 2013 demand to remain flat for gasoline, but up approximately 3.2% for diesel, Brent-WTI crude spreads to revert to quality and transportation cost differentials and indicators of a forward curve would suggest the spread will be in the $7 to $8 range. However, we expect continued volatility. We expect the market to fully recover the cost of compliance with the Renewable Fuel Standard in the long term. For MPC, our ongoing commitment to returning capital to our shareholders was demonstrated by the nearly $1 billion MPC returned to its investors through dividend payments and share repurchases during the second quarter. Our confidence in the cash flow prospects of MPC's business was further underscored by the 20% increase in the regular quarterly dividend announced yesterday. Disciplined investing in MPC's business and regular return of capital to our shareholders will continue to be critical elements of our business model. And now, I'll turn the call over to Don Templin to review the financial results for the second quarter. Don?
Donald C. Templin: Thanks, Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings and adjusted earnings data, both on an absolute and per share basis. Our second quarter 2013 adjusted earnings were $632 million compared to $867 million of adjusted earnings in the second quarter of 2012. Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.95 for the second quarter of 2013 compared to $2.53 during the same period last year. The second quarter 2013 earnings included a $60 million pre-tax adjustment for cumulative pension settlement expenses resulting from the level of employee lump-sum retirement distributions occurring in 2013. The second quarter 2012 earnings included a similar $83 million pre-tax pension settlement adjustment. The earnings lock chart on Slide 5 shows, by segment, the change in adjusted earnings from the second quarter of 2012 to the second quarter of 2013. The primary driver for the change in our adjusted earnings was the decrease in income from our Refining & Marketing segment, partially offset by an increase in income from Speedway and the Pipeline Transportation segments and lower income taxes. As shown on Slide 6, Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was $903 million in the second quarter of 2013 compared with just over $1.3 billion in the second quarter of 2012. The change was primarily due to narrower crude oil differentials and lower product price realizations relative to benchmark neat fuels. The unfavorable earnings impacts associated with the narrowing crude oil differentials are found in the sweet/sour, LLS to WTI and prompt versus delivered margin indicators on the slide. Since all of these indicators utilize spot market values, any change in our actual product realizations quarter-to-quarter are reflected in the other gross margin column also shown here. Our product price realizations compared to spot market values were lower in the second quarter of this year than in the second quarter of last year due to a number of factors, 2 of which are worth noting. First, about 40% of our refining capacity and almost all of our purchase for resale activity is in PADD II. The Chicago refined product spot market experienced significant volatility in the second quarter of 2013, primarily due to refinery maintenance activities in the Greater Chicago area. As a result of that volatility, our actual product price realizations relative to spot market prices were lower quarter-to-quarter. The second factor affecting our product price realizations was the impact of the increase in the price of renewable identification numbers, or RINs. When the cost of a RIN was less than $0.01 for E10 gallon, the relative impact of RINs on spot market values and on wholesale product price realizations was immaterial. Therefore, the only RINs impact we discussed previously was the financial impact of the RINs we purchased from third parties to cover our needs as an obligated party. Our cash cost for RINs was approximately $20 million per month for the second quarter of 2013. In addition, we believe our product price realizations relative to spot market prices were also impacted by the dramatic increase in RIN prices. During the quarter we believe that the prices of ethanol-blended fuels, exported fuels and other transportation fuels that do not trade our RIN obligation were generally lower than spot market values. We believe this occurred because non-obligated blenders and retailers could make an acceptable margin discounting to some degree the RIN value from the cost of the renewable fuel. As you know, we utilized an LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread that includes neat gasoline and diesel fuel spot market values for approximately 5/6 of the product value. We believe the traditional crack spreads using neat gasoline and distillate spot market values versus the biofuel blends that are actually sold could overstate refiners' earnings due to the impact of RINs. The increase in direct operating costs quarter-over-quarter is primarily due to the acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery and is consistent with our guidance. The Galveston Bay refinery did contribute positive earnings during the second quarter. On the next 2 slides, we provide earnings walks for each of our other operating segments. On Slide 7, Speedway's income from operations was $123 million in the second quarter of 2013 compared with $107 million in the second quarter of 2012. Speedway's light product gross margin was about $12 million higher in the second quarter of 2013 compared with the second quarter of 2012. The increase was primarily due to a $0.01 per gallon higher gross margin for the second quarter of 2013 compared with the second quarter of last year. Merchandise margin was $212 million in the second quarter of 2013 compared with $203 million during the same period last year. This $9 million increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of convenience stores we operated last quarter. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes were flat in the second quarter of 2013 compared with the 2012 second quarter. Speedway's same-store merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes, increased 4.5% over the second quarter last year, which is noteworthy, considering the second quarter last year was up 10.1% from the same quarter in 2011. Speedway's average retail gasoline price during the second quarter of 2013 was nearly the same as the second quarter of last year. Slide 8 shows changes in our Pipeline Transportation segment income. Income from operations was $58 million in the second quarter of 2013 compared with $50 million in the second quarter of 2012. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in transportation tariffs, offset by higher operating expenses and depreciation. A portion of the increase in transportation tariffs was related to the formation of MPLX. A number of items made up the unfavorable operating expense variance, the largest of which were costs now incurred by MPLX following its IPO in October 2012. Slide 9 presents the more significant drivers of changes in our cash flow for the second quarter of 2013. At June 30, our cash balance was just over $3 billion. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was a nearly $900 million source of cash. The working capital use of cash of almost $1.3 billion noted on the slide primarily relates to the timing of receipts and mix of crude and feedstock volumes as of the close of the second quarter of 2013. In addition, we had a decrease in the crude taxes payable due to the timing of estimated tax payments. Also, as shown on the slide, is the $882 million of cash used in the second quarter share repurchases that Gary highlighted earlier. Slide 10 shows that, at the end of the second quarter, we had just over $3 billion of cash and approximately $3.4 billion of debt. With EBITDA of over $6.3 billion during the last 12 months, we continue to be in a very manageable debt position, with leverage of 0.5x EBITDA and a debt to total capital ratio of 22%. This strong liquidity position enables us to support our core liquidity requirements and continue our focus on capital return to shareholders. Turning to Slide 11. During the last 12 months, we generated over $5.5 billion in cash from operations and $2.8 billion of free cash flow. Over this period, we've returned 81% of this free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. During the 2013 second quarter, we returned nearly $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This exceeded the free cash flow in the quarter. We purchased approximately 11 million shares for $882 million through open market repurchases, and we continued to repurchase shares into July. In July, we repurchased approximately 3.9 million shares for about $273 million. It is our intention to continue returning capital beyond the needs of the business to our shareholders. Slide 12 provides outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the third quarter of 2013. For comparative purposes, those same metrics for the third quarter of 2012 are also shown. The July market data document will be published later today on our Investor website. We will continue to work to identify market metrics that enhance visibility to MPC's earnings in light of the recent volatility in RINs, just like we did in early 2012 when we first experienced the big difference between crude oil prompt and delivered prices. Our mission continues to be value creation for our shareholders. We are committed to pursuing opportunities to create near- and long-term value and believe the returns to our shareholders will reflect that focus. We will be balanced and disciplined in our approach to capital allocation, as we continue to assess the opportunities in front of us. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Pam Beall.
Pamela K. M. Beall: Thanks, Don. [Operator Instructions] And with that, now, Cliff, I'd like to open the call to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ed Westlake from Crédit Suisse.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Thanks for the waterfall chart on the Refining & Marketing Q-over-Q. One question on the $313 million other gross margin. You said that include RINs, $60 million, for 2Q, leaving $250 million left over. How much -- how would you separate that between being short product in the Chicago area and having that spike? And how much do you think, if you had to guess, would be this difference between product pricing that we see on the screen versus actual product prices as you sell it out of the refinery? That would be helpful.
Garry L. Peiffer: Hello, Ed. This is Garry Peiffer. Well, as you've heard from others, it's very difficult to try to separate out the impact of -- fundamental supply and demand impacts from the RIN impact on our relative price realizations. But what Don was trying to describe in his remarks was the fact that, in addition to that $65-or-so million that we actually expended to buy RINs from third parties, there's also other effects that go on in terms of our product price realizations at the wholesale level, if you will. So we would say that the majority of that amount, the $313-or-so million, was impacted by the spike in crack spreads and product prices in the Chicago market and the effect that RINs had on our product realizations and costs in the second quarter.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And, I guess the...
Garry L. Peiffer: Compared to spot -- that's compared to spot, Ed. So we're comparing it to spot values.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And so, as that spike is unwounded in the third quarter, spot should be a bit more relevant, but RINs will still be an issue?
Garry L. Peiffer: That would be correct, assuming they stay at the high levels also.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then, the other comment, you said Galveston Bay was still profitable. Would you be able to give us a sort of a run rate of EBITDA in the third quarter -- in the second quarter as you did for the first quarter?
Gary R. Heminger: Ed, this is Gary. What we've decided, as you know, we gave you that number at the end of the first quarter. We've just operated it for 2 months. But for competitive reasons, and as you know, we have never broken our refineries out individually. We gave that because it was just after starting up Detroit and just after acquiring Galveston Bay. For separate competitive reasons, we're not going to give out the numbers individually going forward.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Would you give a Gulf versus Mid-Con split?
Gary R. Heminger: Not at this time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank.
Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Gary, one of the big positives out there is the export number that you spoke about. Could you just remind us where you were in Q1? You said -- I think you said 190,000 barrels a day in Q2. Could you give us an indication firstly of the split between gasoline and distillate there; and, secondly, where that product is going and how much more you think you can grow that number?
Gary R. Heminger: Right. Yes, we had 190,000 barrels per day here in the second quarter. It's 151,000 barrels per day in the first quarter. And, Garry, do you have the breakdown of...
Garry L. Peiffer: It's primary diesel fuel, what we're exporting. Roughly, 170,000 to 190,000 was diesel fuel. And I guess, as a practical limit, I think we're pretty close to a capacity, although every time we seem to say that, our schedulers and engineers find a way to eke a little more out. But at 190,000 barrels a day, that compares to second quarter last year of 121,000. But obviously, we have Galveston Bay in there as well that's accounting for some of that difference. So roughly, that's probably our practical limit in that neighborhood of 190,000 to 200,000 barrels a day.
Gary R. Heminger: And the other thing, Paul, that we're doing is -- you've heard us talk about this before, both at Galveston -- excuse me, at Garyville where we're doing some capital expenditures in order to be able to improve on our gasoline exports. Today, you need to be able to let the gasoline settle out. And so, the way we operate today is basically online and straight through the tanks. But in order to be able to certify it and go into some foreign countries, you need to be able to settle it out. And we're investing in some incremental tankage to be able to do that. So in the future, we will be increasing our gasoline exports. And then, we're also now looking at how we can improve on the exports out of Galveston Bay. So Garry is right, from the assets, as they set today, we think we're pretty much at the peak. But we are investing in both to be able to increase that number into the future.
Garry L. Peiffer: Maybe 1 slight clarification. The 151,000 Gary referred to was fourth quarter of 2012 and first quarter of about 121,000. So we have a little bit of a dip there. But 121,000, first quarter of 2013; 151,000, fourth quarter of 2012.
Gary R. Heminger: Right. Thank you.
Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: In fairness to what you're saying and I know you said you don't want to break down individual refineries, but you had been running Garyville and you had permitted, I think, for it to be a much bigger refinery than it was originally nameplate, if you like. Can you talk a little bit more about where you are in terms of, firstly, Garyville, and, secondly, your overall capacity and how much you think that will grow with the CapEx that you're expending?
Gary R. Heminger: Right. And the CapEx I was speaking to, Paul, is not in the processing side, it's on the actual logistics side and how we move the barrels out of the refinery, either through pipelines or via the dock and exports. Let me ask Rich to clarify -- Rich Bedell here to clarify 1 thing. There was some discussion this week about a certain permit. And Garyville continues to run very well. And as you recall, we had ability to run incrementally 180,000 barrels per day. We now have a permit to run 290,000. That's in the new expansion we put on, and it's running very, very well. But, Rich, why don't you talk about the question we had earlier this week about the permit?
Richard D. Bedell: Yes, there was -- an article came out that said the hydrocracker expansion at Garyville was going to be completed in the third quarter of this year. It's actually going to be in the first quarter of next year. The -- it's all part of a -- it's really 4 segments to a diesel optimization project that Garyville that go in, in various phases, and 1 phase of it is in the third quarter of '13, which is going to be a crude improvement diesel recovery project there and then the hydrocrackers in the first quarter of 2014.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Two quick questions, if I could. One is a simple one. What is -- Gary, based on your best guess, how much do you think is the RIN cost being passed through so far or that you guys have been able to pass through?
Garry L. Peiffer: Well, Paul, this is Garry Peiffer. As I said, it's really difficult to estimate the RIN effect versus just normal supply and demand. So I wouldn't even want at this point hazard a guess how much is actually being passed through to the consumer. However, I guess, I would add, as Don suggested, that we do believe a substantial part of that is being reflected in the spot market values that you're seeing for gasoline and diesel fuels. So we do think that the -- if you look at, kind of, what the economic additions were in the second quarter and what we would have expected the crack spreads to be in the second quarter adjusted for how the Brent and LLS prices move, plus the fact that gasoline imports were similar to past years, so that means the importers will have to acquire a RIN, we're still making money, bringing barrels to the U.S. versus their next best alternative that we still think that there is some of -- there is a substantial amount of RIN being reflected in the spot market value.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Say, along that line, Garry, can you help me understand? I'm trying to think of -- in the ethanol market, when you guys sell a refined gasoline in your billing invoice to your customer, you identified that what is the output price and then what is the ethanol in the past fuel cost in the invoice? Why can't the industry do something similarly to the RIN? Is there anything that stop you guys in doing it? Because by doing it this way, a, then we know that whether it's been possible; and, b, it will also allow a transparent way for the consumer to know that how much they're being get hit. And if you really want MPC to act to change the role to a million more realistic program, it seems like you need the consumer to speak up.
Garry L. Peiffer: Yes. We've thought about that suggestion over the last few weeks and months. And I guess, it's really going to be impacted by competitive conditions, Paul, and we obviously are not the only marketer so we'd have to consider the -- what the competition is doing. But because there's some marketers out there what we would call non-obligated marketers that Don referred to who are net sellers of RINs. And then, we have obligated parties who are buyers of RINs comminuting at the wholesale level, it's going to be very confusing for the buyer of those E10s and other biofuels to say, is there a tax added on or not a tax added on or separate line charge. So probably, if it were to be done most effectively, it would have to be done at the spot market level, but I don't think you're going to see it happen there either. So we're not optimistic that that's going to happen, unless competitive conditions dictate it does.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Can I just sneak in a real short one for Don? What is the market value of the inventory overall?
Donald C. Templin: $5.1 billion.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chi Chow from Macquarie Capital.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: I'm curious on, here in the third quarter, the impact of the backwardated WTI market. Could you give us some comments and maybe your outlook on what impacts this is going to have on market structure measured here in the third quarter, what percent of crudes you purchased on a CMA basis and any thoughts on the outlook on how the curve will trend going forward here the rest of the year?
C. Michael Palmer: Yes. Chi, this is Mike Palmer. It's pretty -- I think it's pretty hard to forecast the extent of that backwardation and how long it's going to last. Obviously, what that tells us about the market is that there are companies out there that believe that supply is short today, and that's the reason that the market is in this backwardated phase. As I said, again, we don't try and forecast what those numbers are going to be going out. I think that there are a number of reasons that you could point to, to say that worldwide that there has been some shortages. It's hard for us to see that in the Gulf Coast. We have no problems supplying our refineries.
Garry L. Peiffer: And, Chi, this is Garry Peiffer. On the CMA question, obviously, when you buy on a CMA basis and you're in backwardation, that otherwise increases the cost versus the calculation if you're in contango. So that would have a negative effect on the crack spread calculation if we're in backwardation. So I'd say the majority -- or most of the domestic crudes that we buy have a CMA pricing basis to them. So most of our domestic crudes are affected by that market structure in terms of what we acquire. So if they're in backwardation, that's going to be a bit of a drag versus a contango, which is a bit of a benefit.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: Are your Canadian barrels priced on a CMA basis as well?
C. Michael Palmer: No, they're not.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: No? Okay, okay. And then, secondly, can you give us some comments on the EBITDA contribution of DHOUP in the third quarter?
Gary R. Heminger: Yes. Chi, I just had that discussion. I'm sorry, you must have missed it. But what we have decided -- we did give that number after the first quarter and the same for Galveston Bay after 2 months in the first quarter. And competitively, we've decided not to give those numbers out individually going forward. I had the same question. We break them out kind of Midwest versus Gulf Coast. And at this time, we decided not to go that direction either. And as we've had discussion with many -- I should say, most of you in the past, these are very competitive numbers for us in the way we source our crude, and we just think that's the best thing for us to do going forward.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: Okay. That's fair. So maybe I'll try this then. We've seen some volatility on the WCS pricing and differentials. Can you talk about your outlook on how you see the Canadian heavy dips trending here going forward?
Gary R. Heminger: Right. I'll -- let me have Mike cover that. But as you know, here in the second quarter, there are several production issues on the Canadian side, different producers who had downtime, a couple of upgraders that had some downtime. So that really affected the market in the second quarter and narrowed the spreads significantly. They have since widened out and widened out quickly. And let me have Mike go over the forward curve and what he sees now.
C. Michael Palmer: Yes. I guess, what I would say is, as Gary pointed out, we did hit a patch here where there were several production issues in Canada, and it doesn't take a lot to move the differentials. But as we look out through the end of the year, we know that there is a significant additional Canadian heavy that's due to come online. The Exxon crude volume is one of the major pieces, and it's been continually pushed back. But it will be available later in the year. And that, coupled with several other projects -- we believe that the differentials are probably going to widen out a bit from the point they're at today.
Gary R. Heminger: In that same -- to that same question, let me add one more thing, Chi. As you look going into the remainder of the year, as some of our competitors possibly bring up some heavier crude units, that's also going to change the historical shipping patterns and probably some of the historical marketers some of the sweet barrels are being replaced by these heavy barrels that we think will also have a positive effect on Midwest refineries running those sweet barrels.
Operator: Our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: On Galveston Bay, and not asking a break-out question here, yet you've been running the unit for an entire quarter. Could you discuss what you've learned there, good or bad, and update on the pace of potential feed changes to improve profitability, primarily the pace to source more Houston or Corpus-based crudes given the current discounts and, I guess, our expectation of forward and balance in that market?
Gary R. Heminger: Let me ask Rich to talk about, as you say, the pace of play on the refinery operations itself, how he's seeing some of the changes and operating practices and safety practices that he's been able to achieve. And then, Mike Palmer will take the latter question.
Richard D. Bedell: Yes. Evan, this is Rich. Overall, we're very pleased with the Galveston Bay refinery and how it's operating. The safety record, both personal and process safety, has been excellent there for the 6 months we've been running it, and we've been working to incorporate our standards and our operating philosophies in the plant, and they've been very well received by the workforce. So overall, the direction of the refinery, we're very pleased with it in the short time that we've had it. I think Mike can comment a little bit about the crude changes.
C. Michael Palmer: Yes, sure will. Evan, we've made some pretty substantial changes already when we -- and of course, a lot of that is the fact that we're optimizing this plant every day. But the pipeline infrastructure continues to be built out. So what we've been able to do up to this point is pretty much displace the foreign sweet crude that have been coming into the plant with the domestic crudes that you had mentioned. I mean, we're running more West Texas sour, Eagle Ford, those types of domestic crudes. And frankly, we -- what we did was we look at the markets every day to optimize those slates. So it's not to say we won't run the foreign cargo crude, but we're always looking for the best barrels. We think, going forward, domestic is where it's at.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Great. If I -- a second question, if I could. I know we've discussed -- but PADD II gasoline imports have tapered since 2010 from all regions with some uptick recently into driving season. And as you look forward primarily in the first quarter when that market is more balanced due to seasonal demand, could you update us how you see the potential to move more product out of region and potentially into the East Coast?
Gary R. Heminger: Well, Evan, we don't want to get into our detailed strategy on how we're going to move products out, but you are correct. And if you go back in history, the PADD II certainly imported more from PADD III and some from PADD I historically. And due to the significant increase in run rates by PADD II refiners, that has negated the need to import as much. But certainly, we are looking at how and probably more so on the diesel side than the gasoline side and diesel side in the shorter quarters on how you balance things. But I'm sorry, we can't get into our individual strategy of how we're going to move our product into additional regions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.
Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: I had a question for you on Capline. I'm not sure how specific you can be, but there's been a lot of chatter that some of the strength we've seen in LLS pricing recently has been attributable to increased flows on Capline, basically the feed via BP/Whiting ramp-up. And I was just curious if you could provide any color there.
Gary R. Heminger: Yes. I don't know, Blake, that we can provide you any information on what any competitors are doing. I think, overall, again, what we do is we look at LLS or other crudes that we might move up Capline relative to other alternative crudes that we can run. I don't think that we've seen major changes -- major shifts on Capline over the past couple of quarters.
Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Okay, okay. The other question for you is a bit of a one-off, but it's on the chemicals side. Some of your peers are obviously evaluating some opportunities to use existing infrastructure and enter the chemicals business. And I didn't know if you've looked at that or if any of your facilities may have some opportunities there.
Gary R. Heminger: Right. Let me have Rich take that. This isn't the chemicals side but just to refresh that we have talked about a couple of splitters, 1 in Canton, 1 in Catlettsburg as a way to be able to utilize the feedstock that doesn't get into the chemicals side of the business. But that is something that we certainly have ongoing. But Rich will cover some of the chemicals as -- because we're -- also just took over a big chemical operation. About 1/3 of the output of Galveston Bay is really on the chemicals side. So, Rich?
Richard D. Bedell: Yes. I mean -- and we continue to look for opportunities to where to invest. But our focus lately has really been on the condensate splitters, to take advantage in the Utica, moving more of the light crudes through our system and then optimizing in Galveston Bay and its aromatics picture there. So if you're talking about -- referring to Valero's methanol plant, no, we're not looking at anything in regard to a methanol plant.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons.
Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: A question for Mike, and this would be a bit of a follow-up, I think on Evan's question, but it looks like your WTI-based feedstocks have been declining in recent quarters and other sweets have been increasing. I suspect a lot of that is the integration of the Galveston Bay refinery. But are there other factors impacting those shifts and how do you expect that to go going forward?
C. Michael Palmer: Yes. Jeff, I guess, what I would say is, if you look at the chart that we published in the second quarter, the percentage of the WTI-based crudes remained about the same. It has gone down from previous quarters, and I think that was a result of bringing Galveston Bay on that didn't have access to as much WTI-based crude. But the interesting thing about the second quarter is that we actually ran a higher crude rate. So in order to maintain that 22% level, we actually did increase the volume of the WTI-based crudes that went into the system. The other thing I think you'll find -- I think the other thing you'll find of interest on that chart is that the other sour crude went down, whereas the sweet crude did go up. And that's pretty much just a result of, I guess, the story that we've been telling you guys, and that is that the sweet crudes are getting more attractive as -- through time, as they continue to grow. And we've been very much focused on the crudes from North Dakota or the Eagle Ford.
Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Very well. Mike, you guys have a good view into -- about the Gulf Coast and the Mid-Con and crude markets. Could you talk to us about what you expect the WTI-Brent differentials to look like through the second half of this year and what 2014 average might look like?
C. Michael Palmer: I guess, Jeff, the way I'd answer that is just to say that, if you go back and take a look at the second quarter, we began the second quarter with a Brent-TI spread around $12.5, and it moved out to around $4.5. By the end, it changed about $8. We then moved to flat. And after it was at flat, it moved to about $3.80 again. And now, it's in another dollar. So the one thing I would say to you is that it's going to remain extremely volatile, and that's the only thing we know with certainty. I think that, as Gary said earlier, when we think about the ARB, really, what we think about is that you've got a transportation cost to get those barrels from Cushing to the Eastern Gulf, where they need to go to clear. And so, when we look at the forward curve and see that it's around that $7 or $8 level, that makes some sense to us. But at the same time, we know that there is a lot of emphasis on these spreads and there's going to be a lot of trading activity. So the pendulum will move back-and-forth. There's going to be a lot of volatility.
Gary R. Heminger: And, Jeff, that's why I made my comment earlier that you're going to see possibly a big swing later in the year, as some other refiners possibly bring up heavier crude units. That's going to put more light sweet crude back on the market in different regions of the country. And I think it's going to change some pressure points and also lead to that widening out that we're talking -- that Mike was just talking about and I spoke about earlier.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Kessler from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: I just wanted to push a point that you made earlier on light crude supply tightness. You said that globally, at least, there are some signs of shortages, but you, of course, had no problem sourcing your crude in the U.S. Gulf Coast. And I just wanted to push that point a little bit. Obviously, if we look at LLS and it's at a premium of Brent. So on that benchmark, that would imply the Gulf Coast is actually tighter than Brent or has been in recent history. That's, of course, if you believe LLS is representative of the coastal delivered price, and I think we generally don't. But that's really my question is what does your average coastal delivered price look like relative to LLS, particularly with Galveston Bay?
C. Michael Palmer: Well, I think, again, when you look at LLS, it's not a huge stream today. And on the margin, obviously, it couldn't command a premium to Brent that wouldn't be happening today. But I guess, again, as I tend to look forward and we think that the light sweet crude coming from, again, the Permian Basin or the Eagle Ford, perhaps even North Dakota continuing to move south, we just believe that, that LLS differential can't last, that it will turn into a discount at some point. Exactly when that happens is very difficult to understand.
Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: What would you say you're getting for delivered price in Houston today relative to LLS?
C. Michael Palmer: Well, I guess, we just don't get into that kind of a detail. We probably can't answer that question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jason Smith from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: It's Jason on for Doug. Just come back to Galveston Bay again. I know we've spent some time on the crude slate. I mean, now that you've had a few months at the plant, have you found any incremental opportunities maybe with the existing Texas City refinery nearby?
Gary R. Heminger: Rich?
Richard D. Bedell: Yes, we have -- we found a number of synergies between the 2 plants in moving feedstocks and optimizing the operations between the 2. And we have projects that we're looking at to further increase that.
Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And should we maybe expect a synergy update at the Analyst Day later this year?
Gary R. Heminger: Yes, it's one of our plans, Jason, to be able to give you a little more color around Galveston Bay. We'll have many more months of operation at that time, but we'll give you more color then.
Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got you. And on the Garyville hydrocracker, is there any chance you'd be willing to share a cost and potential EBITDA estimate there?
Gary R. Heminger: We do not -- this is a revamp. This is not a brand-new hydrocracker. It's a revamp of our big plant that we put on because we could see some low-hanging fruit. And, Rich, do you have any more color?
Richard D. Bedell: Well, I mean, at our first Analyst Meeting in New York, we did give some guidance around that. And it's basically 4 different projects that, at that time, we said it was about $250 million over 4 years. And the EBITDA based on 2011 prices was $160 million is what we told you all.
Operator: Our final question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: The question I had is maybe fairly straightforward, but I noticed the yield to gasoline lower in this quarter. I'm presuming at Galveston Bay its different product output. But is there anything else going on? I mean, is this a function of cracks in the market, RINs cost, anything like that that's taken it down from the low 50s to the upper 40% of gasoline blend stocks yields?
Gary R. Heminger: No, I think it all has to be due to Galveston Bay coming on. As I said, approximately 1/3 of their output is on the chemicals side. So that would account for the majority. Then you'll have a little maintenance in different plants here and there. So that could be maybe less than 1% as you take refineries down for maintenance. It just depends on which unit, but the most should be GBR.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And the only other question I had, with the Ho-Ho line expected to be shut down here at the end of this month, I believe, for the reversal later this year, any thoughts on the impact that will have on pricing of crudes out of the Gulf of Mexico or LLS in terms of the very near term and anything you can provide in terms of thoughts on that?
C. Michael Palmer: Yes. This is Mike Palmer. I guess, it's bound to have some impact, although a part of that line is already down. So I wouldn't think that, that's -- I wouldn't think there would be anything that would be dramatic.
Operator: I'd like to turn the call back over to Pam for closing remarks.
Pamela K. M. Beall: Okay. Well, thank you, Cliff. Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today, and we'll be in the office for the rest of the day. So you can call and ask for myself, Beth Hunter and Jerry Ewing [ph], who's new to -- a recent addition to our team. So thanks, everybody, for your interest. Bye-bye.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Marathon Petroleum Corporation First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Pam Beall, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Pamela K. M. Beall: Hey, Christine, I'd like to make sure that I'm coming through okay because your initial opening remarks were garbled. So can you hear me okay?
Operator: I can hear you. Would you like me to repeat again?
Pamela K. M. Beall: No, but when you speak, you are breaking up. So I just want to make sure if there's a way to make sure that the audience can hear okay, and that we'll be able to hear them okay as well.
Operator: You're coming in clear on my end.
Pamela K. M. Beall: Okay, all right, very good. Well, we're going to go ahead and proceed then. Good morning, and welcome, everybody, to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Webcast and Conference Call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website. And on the call today, we have Gary Heminger, President and CEO; Garry Peiffer, Executive Vice President of Corporate Planning and Investor and Government Relations; Don Templin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Palmer, Senior Vice President of Supply, Distribution and Planning; and Rich Bedell, Senior Vice President of Refining. If you turn to Slide 2, please read the Safe Harbor statement. It is a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and during the question-and-answer session. Our actual results may differ materially from what we expect today, and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now, I'll turn the call over to Gary Heminger for some opening remarks.
Gary R. Heminger: Thanks, Pam, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us. If you'll please turn to Slide 3. Our strong financial results this quarter reflect the strategic expansion and optimization of our refining system, favorable market conditions and increased income from Speedway. Since the completion of our Detroit Heavy Oil Upgrade Project in November of last year, this project has provided our system with greater flexibility to refine larger volumes of price-advantaged crudes, including Canadian heavy. The refinery quickly reached its design capacity and performed very well during its first quarter of operation. Also contributing to our financial performance this quarter was the acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery on February 1. Results from the first 2 months of operation have been consistent with our expectations. Located on the Texas Gulf Coast, our Galveston Bay refinery is well positioned to process growing supplies in North American crude oil, with expanding access to price-advantaged feedstocks and an array of complex processing units, we're enthusiastic about the prospects of this facility to enhance margins and further leverage dynamic market trends through this strategic acquisition. We are working hard to integrate this large, very complex refinery and the related assets we acquired into our system, and we are pleased with the enthusiasm and professionalism of the employee team. Speedway also had a very strong quarter. It posted increased segment income, primarily due to higher fuel margins and additional revenue from the stores that were acquired last year. We announced today that we have agreed to sell MPLX an additional 5% interest in Pipeline Holdings for $100 million. This transaction, which is expected to close on May 1, will increase MPLX's interest to 56% from the 51% it held since initial public offering in October of 2012. We believe this drop-down, along with expected throughput increases, positions MPLX to support distribution growth in the near term and is consistent with our intent to provide an attractive growth profile over the long term. MPLX also announced today an increase of $0.01 per unit to its quarterly distribution, raising it to $0.2725 per unit. This is the first drop-down following the IPO. This transaction, along with the increase in its quarterly distribution, demonstrates our commitment to support the growth of MPLX. We continue to focus on our commitment to balance investments in the business with returning capital to shareholders. During the first quarter, we returned $547 million to the shareholders through share repurchases and the payment of $116 million in dividends. As of the end of the quarter, the total remaining share repurchase authorization was $2.2 billion. And now I will turn the call over to Don Templin to review our financial results for the first quarter.
Donald C. Templin: Thanks, Gary. Slide 4 provides earnings both on an absolute and per share basis. Our first quarter 2013 earnings of $725 million reflects $129 million increase from the $596 million we earned in the first quarter of 2012. Earnings per diluted share were $2.17 for the first quarter 2013 compared to $1.70 during the same period last year. I should note that, as a result of our share repurchases, the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during the 2013 first quarter was 333 million compared to 350 million in the first quarter 2012. As of March 31, 2013, 327 million common shares were outstanding. The waterfall chart on Slide 5 shows, by segment, the change in earnings from the first quarter of 2012 to the first quarter of 2013. The primary driver for the change in our earnings was the increase in Refining & Marketing income, partially offset by additional income tax expense. The improvement in Refining & Marketing segment income was primarily the result of a higher refined product production and sales volumes attributable, in large part, to the acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery on February 1, 2013. The increase in income tax expense is primarily a function of higher earnings during the first quarter of 2013. As shown on Slide 6, Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was just over $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2013 compared with $943 million in the first quarter of 2012. The primary drivers of this increase were the contributions from 2 months of operating the Galveston Bay refinery and the first full quarter of upgraded operations at Detroit, partially offset by increased operating expenses or costs. Utilizing market indicators and actual refinery throughputs, we estimate that the Galveston Bay refinery contributed approximately $150 million of EBITDA for the 2 months we operated the facility during the quarter. This income impact is reflected in the changes in market indicators on this slide, and the incremental costs make up a majority of the direct operating cost variance. In addition to Galveston Bay's success, we estimate the first full quarter of operating the Detroit refinery, following the upgrade project, contributed approximately $100 million of incremental EBITDA to our quarterly results. On Slide 7, Speedway's income from operations was $67 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared with $50 million in the first quarter of 2012. Light product and merchandise gross margin combined were about $25 million higher than the first quarter of 2013 compared with the first quarter of 2012. Light product margins increased by $20 million as margins averaged $0.1301 per gallon compared to $0.1096 in the first quarter of 2012. The light product margin increase also reflected the impacts of a higher number of stores in the first quarter of 2013 as compared to the same quarter in 2012. Merchandise margin was $184 million in the first quarter 2013 compared with $179 million in the same period last year. This $5 million merchandise margin increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of stores compared to the same period last year. The $8 million increase in expenses also reflects the increase in the number of stores compared to the same quarter of last year. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes increased 0.7%, and merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes, increased 0.8% in the first quarter 2013 compared with the 2012 first quarter. Speedway's average retail gasoline price was $3.47 per gallon during the first quarter of 2013, compared with $3.48 per gallon for the comparable quarter last year. Slide 8 shows changes in our transportation -- Pipeline Transportation segment income. Income from operations was $51 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared with $42 million in the first quarter of 2012. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in transportation tariffs and earnings from pipeline affiliates. Offsetting these increases are higher costs associated with mechanical integrity and depreciation expenses. Some of the increase in the transportation tariffs was related to the formation of MPLX. The chart on Slide 9 presents the more significant drivers of changes in our cash flow for the first quarter of 2013. At March 31, 2013, our cash balance was just over $4.7 billion. Operating cash flow, before changes in working capital, was a little over $1 billion source of cash. The working capital benefit of $1 billion noted on the slide, primarily relates to an increase in payables that were partially offset by an increase in receivables, both due, in large part, to the acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery and related assets. Payables also increased due to higher crude oil prices at the end of the first quarter of 2013 compared to year end. Excluding the Galveston Bay purchase price, capital expenditures and acquisitions were $197 million during the first quarter. On February 1, we also made a payment of approximately $1.5 billion to the seller for the Galveston Bay refinery and related assets. This amount included the purchase price as well as the acquired inventory. As shown on this slide is a $431 million use of cash for the first quarter of share repurchases that Gary mentioned earlier. Slide 10 shows that at the end of the first quarter, we had just over $4.7 billion of cash and approximately $3.4 billion of debt. With EBITDA of nearly $6.6 billion during the last 12 months, we continue to be in a very manageable debt position with leverage of 0.5x EBITDA and a debt-to-total capital ratio of 22%. This strong liquidity position enables us to support our core liquidity and continue to focus on capital return to shareholders. Turning to Slide 11. During the last 12 months, we generated $6.2 billion in cash from operations and nearly $3.3 billion of free cash flow. Over the last 12 months, we've returned 42% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. During the quarter, we purchased approximately 5.1 million shares for $431 million through open market repurchases. When combined, the dividend payment and share repurchases accounted for 140% of our free cash flow for the first quarter of 2013. We remain committed to balancing investments in the business with returning capital to shareholders. Slide 12 provides outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the second quarter of 2013. For comparative purposes, those same metrics for the second quarter 2012 are also shown. The April market data document will be published tomorrow on our investor website. I might add, with respect to our outlook information, we received some calls today about our tax rate, and we would -- I would suggest using a tax rate of 35% for modeling purposes going forward. Our mission continues to be value creation for our shareholders. We are committed to pursuing opportunities to create near- and long-term value. We will be balanced in our approach to capital allocation as we continue to assess the opportunities in front of us. Now I will turn the call back to Pam Beall.
Pamela K. M. Beall: Thanks, Don. [Operator Instructions] And with that, we are now going to open the call, Christine, to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just on Galveston, could you give us an idea of the crude cost in the quarter, perhaps relative to LLS? I understand, I think, you're still running the old slate and just wondering, in terms of progress of switching out imports for domestic crudes, and general comments there.
C. Michael Palmer: This is Mike Palmer. Ed, I'm not sure that we can give you the number, the difference between the crude slate and WTI or LLS. But I can tell you that, if you look at the first quarter, we closed on this transaction in February and, of course, the February supply was arranged by the previous owner during the month of January. So we've really been involved in formulating the crude slates just during March in that quarter. When you look at this plant, overall, and if you looked in the appendix, at the MPC Crude Slate, you can see that we -- at this plant, we don't run, at least in the first quarter, quite as much WTI-based crude as we did in the 6-plant system. And of course, that'll be dictated by the marketplace over time. The other thing is that's important in this plant is that we do continue to see value in some foreign sweet cargo crudes, which is related to the aromatics business at the plant. So again, we're working to optimize the crude slate everyday and the market will dictate the crudes that we purchase.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: But in terms of being able to capture a discount to crude, is there any sort of sense of how many thousand barrels a day you could process at Galveston to take advantage of domestic discounts?
C. Michael Palmer: Ed, what I would say is that, if you look at the -- where this plant is located and its access to domestically produced crudes, what we're starting to see is that pipelines are getting built into the Houston area. And I'm sure you're aware that the Longhorn pipeline has just recently begun. Permian Express will begin shortly. We're going to continue to have a buildout of pipelines that are going to feed this refinery. So as domestic crude continues to grow, we expect that we're going to see that crude being run by this plant. We think it's very well positioned for that going forward.
Operator: Our next question is from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: My question, my first question -- yet, I'm just trying to understand the sizing and the overall drop-down strategy. What you sold, 5% in Pipeline Holdings for $100 million, but you're still in net cash position, MPLX debt-free, $500 million of credit. I know you got assets in the quarter with the Texas City acquisition. So, I mean, can you just kind of talk me through the strategy on the sizing of the first drop? And I have a different question, please.
Garry L. Peiffer: Sure, this is Garry Peiffer. I think we've been consistent, both when we did the roadshow before the IPO and since the IPO, that we're looking at this MPLX as a long-term, very transparent, consistent growth type of vehicle here, and we plan to grow this business both through tariff increases, organic projects that add value and acquisitions. And when we look at the fact that our goal and it's our strategy to have annual distribution growth in the top quartile of a high-growth, drop-down peers, this is the amount of distribution, or, excuse me, drop, that we felt we needed to lease from a first-drop standpoint, put into the new entity, only 6 months after we went through an IPO as well. I think dependent upon everybody's outlook, well, I think a lot people might have expected us to do the drop a little bit later than 6 months, but we felt the timing was good to get the first drop done at this point, which gives us more earnings power from that drop earlier on in the life of MPLX. So it's really our goal to achieve this top quartile annual distribution growth that -- not dictated, drove us to this type of drop.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: That could -- certainly have the assets at the parent level. Let me ask you a different question yet related. I believe you guys are investing in condensate splinters associated around your Ohio asset in Canton and Catlettsburg, to process and provide advantage condensate as it grows from Utica. Can you provide any details on kind of costs and potential volumes and when you potentially could see those units on stream and also whether you think those are suitable, potentially, for MLP? I'll leave it at that.
Gary R. Heminger: Well, the last part of your question, yes, they're suitable, they qualify for an MLP. So that's the easy part of the answer, but I think what our goal is here, is to -- today, we've said that, at our Canton and Catlettsburg refinery, we believe without any additional investment, we can run roughly 20,000 to 30,000 barrels a day in total of condensate at those 2 facilities. As the amount of condensate grows there, we want to be in a position to make sure that we can handle more than that amount of volume, which we expect to come online maybe in a year or 2. But we are not in the exploration business, we are just in the refining business. So we're positioning ourselves with these condensate splinters, which we announced, that when completed, we could go from about 20,000 to 30,000 barrels a day to about 60,000 barrels a day of total condensate throughput. We've kind of pegged end of 2015, 2016 type of timeframe for these new units to come online. That's going to really be driven by how quickly the condensate production ramps up there. So we're doing the engineering. But we haven't finalized exactly when we're going to come online with those new units. But again, we'll be in a position, that once we exceed that 30,000 barrels a day or so, that we will have -- be in a position to have the condensate splinters there, to be able to process the higher volumes.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Great. Any estimate on cost as well? And I'll leave it at that.
Garry L. Peiffer: I think, we've said previously that when you look at all of the investments we're making in the Utica, we're investing in some barges, as you know, we announced that we're -- signed a letter of intent to convert our Wellsville terminal into a barge-loading facility for crude and condensate. So the whole complement of investments in that area is about $300 million over the next few years is what we're looking at. So we haven't split that out into particular assets, but roughly $300 million over the next 2 to 3 years.
Operator: Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I'm not sure who wants to take this one, but it was being -- before it came onstream, I guess, you've given some indication as to how you expected the contribution to look. I think you mentioned the numbers on your prepared remarks. So I'm just wondering if you can kind of characterize how the project's actually behaving, relative to expectations and any differences in your view going forward. And I have a follow up please.
Gary R. Heminger: Doug, this is Gary. Yes, we had given some earlier indications of $200 million to $350 million, and we believe after our first quarter of operations that we are right in that sweet spot, and the plant performed very, very well, as we stated in our remarks in the first quarter. So I'd say we're right on target.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. Great. Is there any debottlenecking potential down the road, Gary? Or is it pretty much running at capacity now?
Gary R. Heminger: Well, let me -- may I ask Rich Bedell to talk about the next step after -- we brought it up, as we said, and quickly got it up to its designed capacity, and now they are -- they will work on the next steps. Rich?
Richard D. Bedell: Yes, that's right, Gary, I mean, Doug, as you know, we've got it up and it's running very well at that design. And as we go forward, we're looking at debottlenecking opportunities, as we find -- as we gather more information, do more engineering. So I'm sure with -- as with any of the expansions, there's going to be some debottlenecking in the future.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. Gary, my follow up is really -- you've been quite vocal about your views on differentials. And obviously, there's been a lot of moving parts this past quarter. So I'm just curious if you could bring us up-to-date with how you're seeing -- or your view of the world as in terms of the sustainability of the end line versus international -- the discounts, and then perhaps a comment on the heavy outlook as well? I'll leave it at that.
Gary R. Heminger: All right. Thanks, Doug, and you're right. We have talked about that a number of times, but let me ask Mike Palmer, who runs all of our daily supply operation to give you his view. Mike?
C. Michael Palmer: Okay, yes. Thanks, Gary. Obviously, you've watched the transatlantic arb, the difference between Brent and WTI, that's come in since early February from a level around 2,200 or 2,300, to around 10 today. A lot of that, I think, that we believe was caused by the weakness in Europe in a very, very heavy turnaround season. And if you look at the WTI side of the equation, the inventories at Cushing really have not come down. They're still around 51 million barrels. But again, I talked earlier, I mentioned a couple of pipelines from the Permian that will direct Permian crude into Houston. So we do think that we're going to see the Cushing inventory start to come down this year. So I guess what we would say is that, with this big move that's taken place down to just a little bit below $10 on the spread, I don't think we'd be at all surprised if that spread would start to move out a little bit again. I don't think, personally, that it's going to reach the kind of levels that we saw before in the $20 level. But to have that arb trade between $10 and $15 would certainly not be a surprise.
Operator: Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.
Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just as a direct follow up, you did a nice job there on WTI-Brent. Can you talk a bit about heavy versus lighter crude spreads? And also, for you guys particularly, the sweet/sour ratios, that would be interesting, too.
C. Michael Palmer: Yes, this is Mike Palmer. I guess, probably the most important one to talk about would probably just be the Canadian crude. And if you watch the heavy Canadian closely, you would have seen kind of an unusual pattern that occurred this year. We did have the spreads that started to come in, basically in May, to around $15 on Western Canadian Select. And now -- and that really was related to a number of production problems that were occurring in Canada. Many of those have been resolved. Production is now increasing, and you watch the spread that it started to move apart again to more, what I guess I would call, seasonal levels. I guess when we look at what's happening in Canada, we're still very optimistic. Exxon is bringing on their Kearl project. We believe that, that crude will start to flow into the marketplace in July. I think that'll be a very important source of heavy crude oil for the market. And in addition to that, if you look at some of the other production for the rest of the year, we think it's very likely that we're going to see Canadian heavy production increase another 250,000 barrels a day by the end of 2013, in addition to the Kearl. So we continue to be very optimistic about the heavy Canadian supply.
Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Great. And then sours?
C. Michael Palmer: I'm sorry.
Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Sour crude. That's obviously a very important differential that we look out for you guys, the sweet/sour spread.
C. Michael Palmer: And you're thinking in terms of what? LLS March?
Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just in the context of what Doug asked, which is where we've been, where we are today and where we're going to, from here.
C. Michael Palmer: I think, again, when you look at the very big picture, certainly, one of the things that is going to continue to happen is that, in the U.S. is we're going to continue to see this light sweet crude continue to grow. So I guess I would expect that as we move forward, you're going to continue to see probably the most attractive differentials being in terms of these light sweet crudes, the Bakken, the Eagle Ford, the Utica, that sort of crude going forward. But having said that, I think that, at the same time, we see very good production growth in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. So we would expect to see the Gulf of Mexico being attractive as well.
Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Yes, I guess, the anomalous one would be the premium of LLS that we're seeing. I assume that you're not expecting that to continue as the pipes are developed on the Gulf.
C. Michael Palmer: No. We're not, and I think that, actually, if you look at it today, we can reconcile Brent -- LLS being $2 to $3 over Brent today. On the Gulf Coast, there's probably $1 difference in the quality, the value of the 2 crudes. And in addition to that, it cost a couple of dollars to bring a barrel of Brent into the U.S. Gulf Coast. So with LLS $2 to $3 over Brent, I think that a U.S. Gulf Coast refiner today would probably be indifferent, on average. Everybody's a little different. But as we move forward and we continue to see the growth in the U.S. domestic shale plays, we would very much expect that LLS will trade at a discount to Brent.
Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Great. If I could throw in one key question, which would be, Gary, can you just talk a little bit more about Galveston Bay? There's an earn out there, I think, but can you also talk about how you feel about the costs and how you can change performance there, given that you're now 2 months in? And I'll leave it there, I promise.
Gary R. Heminger: Well, thanks, Paul. I was hoping you're going to ask a question about Chicago dips instead of Galveston Bay, but I'll leave that for another time. Paul, we're very pleased with Galveston Bay, on the front end. We only have 2 months of operations that were just reported. The processing kit, we're very pleased with, we had a turnaround right after we took over the asset, which was planned. And we came out of that turnaround in very good shape, but we have a lot of work to do. And I will say that the employee base that -- in the acquisition, is very energized and very pleased to be working with Marathon. And I think that is -- since we have a very strong base, our employee base and interest in the plant, I think that is probably the most important thing. Now as we go forward, to go in and get some of the units turnaround over the next couple of years, our plans are such that, that'll happen. But you look at the financial performance, $150 million of EBITDA in the first 2 months. We're very pleased with that. And we have a very, very strong team that we put in place to operate this plant, and I think we will perform well there.
Operator: Our next question is from Chi Chow of Macquarie Capital.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: Great. Just further on Galveston Bay. Mike, you talked a little bit about crude slate optimization activities going forward, but can you give us some guidance on what to expect on yields between gasoline, distillate and pet chems?
Garry L. Peiffer: Chi, this is Garry Peiffer. I think, in the past we pretty much said and, for the time being, it's probably reasonable that it's roughly 1/3 gasoline, 1/3 distillate and 1/3 petrochemicals, at the moment. So intermediates, I mean, the intermediates, so we're going to continue to optimize that and, again, we've only been operating it here for a few months so we're trying to see where the sweet spot is for yield and the crude slate. So that's kind of where we're at the moment, and it is a bit less, in terms of gasoline yield than our other facilities would be, but that's just the market and the processes that they have in place there at the Galveston Bay refinery.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: Okay. On the pet chem side, what sort of products are you producing at the plant? Are they mostly aromatics? Or there's...
Richard D. Bedell: Yes, Chi. This is Rich Bedell. Yes, we have a large aromatics production, as well as propylene. And so that's primarily at this benzene, toluene, xylene and propylene.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: Okay. I guess, Gary, you talked a little bit or mentioned Chicago, I kind of want to ask you about near term here. There's been certainly a lot of flooding activity in the whole Midwest region, can you talk about any impact to your refineries or your other assets due to the flooding? And maybe comment on the margin strength there, we're seeing.
Gary R. Heminger: Well, fortunately, Chi, we've not had any flooding or any problems with our refineries. Robinson, Detroit, Catlettsburg are running full out. We have a little bit of a maintenance going on at Canton, but it's still running well. But the -- what you look at, with the problems of the river system, being able to get product down the river, due to the flooding, I think are -- were possibly some turnarounds from some of our competitors in the Midwest. And thus, led to very high crack spreads. They've been in the high teens to low $20 on the Chicago side here for the last couple of weeks. So we expect, and you look at the pipelines, certainly, the market is looking to replenish the inventory, when you look at Explorer and some of the other pipelines that are full coming north. But we've been very fortunate. We haven't had any problems in our plants.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: Good. So it sounds like you're capturing a lot of the upside?
Gary R. Heminger: Yes, sir.
Operator: Our next question is from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil.
Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: I was hoping you could maybe give us an update on the export market? Obviously, we see natural gas prices moving up a bit. Differentials have come in, at least, at the beginning of 2Q, and I think rumblings of Venezuela ramping back up. I was just curious if you could give us a feel for how that arb spread looks.
C. Michael Palmer: Blake, this is Mike Palmer. If you -- again, if you looked at the numbers, you'd see that in the first quarter, we did export about 121,000 barrels a day of diesel and about 9,000 barrels a day gasoline. And in the fourth quarter, we were just -- we were a little higher than that. We were about 151,000 barrels a day of diesel. The market will dictate to us kind of everyday how much we actually export. We are always looking at the tradeoff between selling export barrels and selling bulk into the pipelines. So we're looking at economics every day. I think that, in the first quarter, there were a number of factors that tended to cause a bit of a weakness in the export market. Certainly, there was Europe. Europe was fairly weak. We had more competition in the U.S. Gulf Coast with Motiva coming on. And with a weak harbor, New York Harbor, I think that there was competition from the New York Harbor that was a little unusual as well. And there may have even been some volatility from the uncertainty surrounding RINs. So it was a little weaker in the first quarter. We continue to expect that exports are going to be a very important part of our business, and we're very positive about exports going forward.
Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. Great. The second question, you mentioned RINs, and I don't mean to get into the regulatory front too much, but I am curious on the earn out that you have on Texas City. Can you help me understand, is any potential RINs increase, is that part of the margin calculation that dictates your payout or does that come in after the fact?
Gary R. Heminger: No, Blake. It's based on a gross margin calculation, and you look at the ASCI index, and Garry Peiffer, I think, has the details here.
Garry L. Peiffer: Yes, this is Garry Peiffer. It's just based upon the spot market values for the refined products. So whatever the spot market values are for the refined products, that's what goes into calculation. Now to the extent that RINs affects the spot market values, there will be an impact. But the actual calculations, just based on spot market values, for the ASCI index, as well as for the refined products.
Gary R. Heminger: And also, Blake, you need to look at the output, as Gary had mentioned earlier, about 1/3 of the output is on the petrochemical side, and that does not carry a RIN with it. It's not in the calculations. It's just a 3, 2, 1.
Gary R. Heminger: Right.
Operator: Our next question is from Doug Terreson of ISI.
Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: My question's also on Galveston Bay, but it's a little bit more broad. I think a few minutes ago, you mentioned the opportunity related to advantaged crude oil, and it just sounds like you guys are just scratching the surface in that area. But there were other categories, too, that were opportunities on this transaction. Meaning product logistics and synergies with other Marathon refineries, market integration and some more. And so, I realize it's early, but I just wanted to see if you could provide any insight or color on the opportunities that may materialize related to that plant, thus far.
Gary R. Heminger: Sure, Doug. And our strategy, when we purchased this plant, is that we were not going to purchase just a merchant refinery. We picked up 1,200 branded locations, approximately 1,200 branded locations, 4 terminals and Colonial line space. We have been able to utilize some of our Colonial line space. So far, 3 other intrastate pipelines we picked up. So all these things encompass opportunities and synergies. As Mike mentioned earlier, the month of February, the crude has already been purchased and we needed that to have a smooth transition. But as we go forward, certainly, we're looking at synergies, not only with our current Texas City plant, but other plants, and because we have the distribution assets that we can move feedstocks into the Midwest if we need to, or we can move things from our Texas City refinery over to this plant and vice versa. The other thing that we're looking at, that we think are going to give us some opportunities -- and we're a very big supplier into the State of Florida and, heretofore, we had supplied a lot of that out of Garyville. Well now, we can move bigger ships into Florida and be -- and pick up synergies from just the efficiency and the way, as Mike Palmer was just talking about, exporting into the South America, Latin America markets vis-a-vis Europe, and how we -- the parallels we have out of Garyville versus Galveston Bay. We have some good logistics that we can pick up there. So all of those things are in the works right now. Again, we've only been operating for a few months, but we certainly have all those things in our plans and how I think we can pick up some further efficiencies on the way we loads ships.
Operator: Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I have to apologize. I joined late. So some of the questions that you may already answer. Gary, have you guys provided any financial information in terms of the BP Texas City for 2 months? What kind of financial contribution there may have been?
Donald C. Templin: Yes, Paul. This is Don Templin. We indicated on the call that the incremental -- estimated incremental EBITDA from Galveston Bay for the 2 months was $150 million.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: After tax or before tax, Don?
Donald C. Templin: EBITDA.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: EBITDA, okay. Don, do have some balance sheet data, what is the market value in excess of book for your inventory?
Donald C. Templin: $6.1 billion.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: $6.1 billion. And Don, the working capital for the quarter is a positive $1 billion. Is it related primarily to the timing of the tax payment or there is something else?
Donald C. Templin: No. It's a combination of a number of things, Paul. But broadly, our payables are up $2.5 billion, and that payable increase is a combination of 3 things: a price increase, crude oil prices were higher at the end of the year -- at the end of March than they were at the end of the year; and then a volume increase because of Galveston Bay; and then there's also a volume increase because, in December, we were heading into a turnaround period and now, we're heading out of a turnaround period. So payables were up about $2.5 billion. Receivables were up $900 million, primarily related to Galveston Bay. And then net inventories, after the inventories that we acquired, we acquired about $900 million worth of inventories as part of the Galveston Bay acquisition, but net inventories were up about $500 million and that was largely related to price changes.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, very good. And Gary, just curious that with Hess putting up their retail and wholesale terminal business up for sale, strategically speaking, does it fit into your system or that is the -- they really is primary in the Northeast and that doesn't really fit to you guys?
Gary R. Heminger: Well, Paul, if you look at their terminals, they're not only in the Northeast, they're also in the Southeast. So they're across the entire Eastern Seaboard. And their retail really encompasses the Eastern Seaboard as well. The only place we would have -- we don't have any direct control of retail in the Southeast markets today. We have a large branded presence. So I would say if there's any overlap, certainly, it would be a step out and we're -- I complement Hess, I think they have very looking good-looking assets.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And on -- I think, earlier, that you probably may have already mentioned, on BP Texas City with their crude purchase agreement that is going to be over soon and you start to utilizing your own trading department and all of that, what kind of potential benefit that we may be seeing? I mean, will you be able to quantify the amount?
Gary R. Heminger: Well, Paul, that agreement was only for one month. It was just in transition. They purchased for the month that we were taking over. So there was no agreement beyond that, and we're going to be very careful not to get into the types of crudes and stuff that we're going to buy for competitive reasons. But we are -- Mike and his team are deep into optimizing this plant as we speak.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And for the month of May, is it still their old purchase agreement or that is based on your new agreement already?
Gary R. Heminger: No. It's our own, and we started our -- Mike, we started our own in March?
Garry L. Peiffer: It would have been March, Gary.
Gary R. Heminger: March. So we've done March, April already has been our own crude purchases.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. A final question for me. I think there's a debate in the industry, at least in the investment community, that butane and naptha may be increasingly become so abundant that pricing will be very attractive. So the question is that, can you bring more of those products into your gasoline pool? Or that you're already maxed out? And if the price really become very attractive, what needs to be done in order for you to be able to bring more and that how much more, what is the maximum you can do?
Richard D. Bedell: This is Rich Bedell, Paul. On butane, you're really limited by the gasoline specs on vapor pressure, and we already blend up to the max there. On naptha, it's just going to be a play between intermediate price or running crude and generate your own naptha. So we'll just take a look at that, how it happens.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: But, I mean, can you actually blend more of the naptha than what you currently already existing in the gasoline pool, I guess that's the question. That's stretching between what you buy from the crude and generate your own naptha or that you purchase. I'm talking about on an absolute level, can you blend even more than what you already did, to date?
Richard D. Bedell: Theoretically, yes, you can do that. You can -- you have to adjust your octane, you have to adjust the -- re-optimize your plants and that may not be the optimal solution, but we look at those economics all the time and decide how we want to blend it and what's optimal.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: But there's no -- so that means that just probably need capital investment in order for you to do substantially more?
Garry L. Peiffer: I wouldn't say investment, Paul. I would say it's optimizing. If it's the optimal way to blend today, we would be doing that. So what Rich is saying is, we have some room. It's just, everyday, we will run our optimization models to determine what is the best.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeff Dietert of Simmons.
Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: TransCanada recently announced that Keystone XL, the Northern Atlantic, has been delayed into the second half of 2015, and I was hoping I could get some commentary from you on how you think that impacts potential logistics? Does it make rail more attractive? Would you consider rail at Garyville and Galveston Bay? And how does that impact your plans on the pipeline side as well?
C. Michael Palmer: Jeff, this is Mike Palmer. Yes, the delay doesn't come as a big surprise to us. We were expecting that it would be delayed from what they had earlier said. But the other thing is that you have to also factor in, the Enbridge Gulf Coast Access pipeline that should be complete in 2014. So I mean, as you know, we're already -- there's already the Seaway line that was reversed, from Cushing down to the Gulf, and that line is -- the plans are to twin that line, and then Enbridge is going to build another large diameter line that's basically going to twin Spearhead. So it's not as if there won't be an outlet for significant additional volumes of Canadian crude into the U.S. system. So -- and I think that when that happens, it will have an impact, certainly, on the incremental supply, it will give the incremental supply out of Canada another home. There could be some additional railing that occurs as well, but that's very expensive, and I don't see that as a long-term solution for Canadian heavy crude.
Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: And just quickly, with the Permian pipes coming in and the Seaway volumes that are already there, are you seeing a price differential from Houston versus St. James for similar quality crudes? And how much might that be?
C. Michael Palmer: Well, the Longhorn pipe just began and the Permian Express has yet to come on, so it's not as if we have a lot of pipeline capacity that's come in yet. But we will always expect that there will be some differential between Houston and St. James, because the crude is being produced in the West and the transportation cost into Houston is going to be less than it is into St. James. And that's going to be several -- $2 to $3, depending upon how you move it.
Operator: Our next question is from Faisel Khan of Citigroup.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I just want to get a clarification on Slide 2. The percentage of WTI-priced crude at 22% for the second quarter, does that also include WCS?
Donald C. Templin: It does not.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, what would that number be for the quarter?
Donald C. Templin: We don't give that number.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then just one last question on the -- you guys talked about the chemicals product yield out of the Galveston Bay facility, but can you give a little bit more detail on that, between aromatics and olefins, because they're widely different sort of products and product margins, so that would help us understand a little bit the profitability of the refinery.
Garry L. Peiffer: This is Garry Peiffer. We really haven't broken it down to that level of detail, and it's really change within valuation, U.S. pricing, so, at this point, we just don't break it down to that level of detail.
Operator: Our next question is from Robert Kessler of Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: A question about your Utica investment plans there and the incremental condensate splitting you've got planned. Having done the engineering now, presumably you've profiled the yield structure out of a typical barrel of Utica condensate. Can you give some indication as to what the product mix looks like, as you've engineered it?
Gary R. Heminger: Okay, Robert. We are in the -- when we say we've engineered, the conceptual engineering is complete. We are just in now to the front-end engineering and we do not have the yield structures and optimizations complete at this time yet. So it'll be awhile until we have that finished.
Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Can you provide a rough indication on what you're seeing for total Utica volumes right now? And maybe some kind of split between crude and condensate?
Gary R. Heminger: Mike can handle this for you.
C. Michael Palmer: Yes. I can give you a little information. Obviously, the Utica production has come on more slowly than was anticipated. I think we've talked before about our volumes being in the 2,000 to 3,000 barrel a day range. That's still the case today, and it's somewhat volatile. But I think the important point with the Utica is that there have been a lot of wells drilled. I think the latest numbers that I have is there have been over 600 permits issued, there have been just slightly over 300 wells drilled and you've only got 89 of those that are producing. So you've got 70% of the wells that have been drilled and are waiting to get hooked up to gas processing and that, really, is the bottleneck right now. You've got companies out there that are spending billions of dollars on this infrastructure, and we fully expect to see our Utica condensate volumes ramp up significantly this year and then significantly, again, in 2014. So it still looks very optimistic to us.
Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Last one for me. Can you provide the average throughput for the quarter with the 2 months that you owned Galveston Bay?
Donald C. Templin: No. We can't. We do not give out individual refinery information.
Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: . You did say that you went in and turned around just after purchase. Can you give some indication of how many days and what portion of the refinery was down for that turnaround?
Gary R. Heminger: Yes. Rich can handle that here.
Richard D. Bedell: Yes. There was a section of the residual hydrocracker unit, so that was just that portion of it and some catalyst change and so some hydrotreaters.
Operator: Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I guess to keep on with the Galveston Bay parade here, at the time you acquired this unit, you indicated, I believe, $700 million to about $1.2 billion in annual EBITDA. Obviously, good start with the first 2 months in the first quarter. I was wondering with the crude changes with, I would say, overall, the ability to probably run it a little more efficiently than the previous owner, are we thinking the top end of that range now for 2013? And can we think of it as better in '14, again, as you pursue the turnarounds and improve efficiencies?
Garry L. Peiffer: This is Garry Peiffer. When we gave that previous guidance, we were anticipating some of those things occurring in that guidance. So we're still in that same band of EBITDA, and the first 2 months, as suggested, kind of puts us right in the middle of those numbers. So I think we still feel comfortable, that range of the guidance that we gave previously.
Donald C. Templin: And Roger, this is Don Templin. I mean, in that range, the price that was used was -- that the top end of the range was at $15 or so, for the ASCI 3, 2, 1 and the bottom end of the range was $11, and we're right in the middle of that. So I mean, I think, from a modeling perspective, that's how you would think about it.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And that actually kind of helps me lead into the next question which is, we look at the -- there are a lot talk about the kind of light-light spreads here. But if we look at the light-heavy spreads, we've seen those tighten up quite considerably, kind of from the end of last year into beginning of the second quarter. Can you maybe help us understand a little bit how you can move around? Which heavies you're able to use? Maybe how much flexibility you have, in just a broad sense along the Gulf Coast, to kind of counteract that contracted spread?
C. Michael Palmer: Yes, Roger. This is Mike Palmer. As these spreads move around, Roger, I can tell you that we have almost complete flexibility. We're very closely watching spreads, for example, between Mars, Poseidon, Southern Green Canyon, the medium sours, as opposed to LLS or Eagle Ford, or one of the other light grades, light sweet grades on the Gulf, and these volumes are basically all spot. So from month-to-month, we -- and not only month to month but from day-to-day, we will back out sour and bring in sweet, if that's what the economics say to do or vice versa. So we have tremendous flexibility.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, but, I mean, fair to say that as the spreads have closed, overall, that's going to impact, I mean, obviously, pick a better crude on a given day. But I mean, all in all, we have seen a contraction as we kick off Q2 here. I was just wondering what kind of impact that could have on sort of a broader Gulf Coast refining margin.
Gary R. Heminger: Roger, why don't we get back to you and we'll be able to answer that question in more detail. Pam will call you back to review that, okay?
Operator: Our next question is a follow up from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I thought this would have been asked already, but just on the RINs. Maybe -- I don't want to get your blood pressure up by the end of the call, but what are you doing to reduce exposure and any thoughts about things like using biodiesel to meet ethanol RINs, et cetera, just to limit the potential upside to those costs next year?
C. Michael Palmer: Ed, this is Mike Palmer. Obviously, this has been on our minds and not just in the current market, but we've been looking at this for, obviously, the last several years. And we've made investments within our system to be able to blend as much, not only ethanol as possible, but also the biodiesel. So we're in relatively good shape. Obviously, we still have a purchase requirement for RINs. But we've got a very good team that's looking at various ways that we can produce RINs outside of the norm, and that could be in a number of different ways. So just rest assured that we have a number of things that we're looking at doing that could reduce our RIN exposure and too early to talk about anything specifically, but we're going to continue to look at that.
Donald C. Templin: This is Don Templin. We did, for the first quarter, we were -- we paid about or we expensed about $15 million, or purchased about $15 million of RIN a month. And last year the comparable number was about $10 million a month.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Yes, I guess sort of March was probably much higher than the average in the first quarter. I don't know if you have that number.
Donald C. Templin: We don't give it by month. I'm sorry, Ed.
Garry L. Peiffer: This is Garry Peiffer, again. On that sweet/sour differential, we've given the sensitivities in the past but now with the more capacity or the bigger capacity with Galveston Bay, every dollar change in that sweet/sour differential that we included in our market metrics, that we put on our website, equates about $225 million of after-tax financial effect. So every dollar has that type of sensitivity to our bottom line. $225 million annually per dollar change after tax.
Operator: And our next question is a follow up from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.
Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Yes, I just thought of the RINs thing, I just wondered how you expect 2014 to play out? Because obviously it looks like it's going to be a major shortage, that gets even worse in 2015.
Gary R. Heminger: Well, Paul, I will say it and it'd be very hard to forecast other than if you look at the total math and reaching the blend wall here in 2013 and not having available the cellulosic option and advance cellulosic is in question, certainly we've had -- the industry had several conversations with the EPA and members of the administration to really talk through how to combat this issue. So I would just say, stay tuned. The administration focused on Washington, D.C. are very cognizant of this problem, the blend wall came at them much faster than they were expecting. So we are working this issue hard within the industry, and we will continue to do so.
Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: But my understanding, Gary, is the EPA is pointing to the legislators, and the legislators don't really care because the gasoline price is low.
Gary R. Heminger: Well, there are 2 ways that you can handle this. The first is that the EPA does have a waiver opportunity within their jurisdiction on a year-by-year basis. So that's something that they certainly could employ if there is a shortage of RINs. And secondly, you have the legislative piece. Legislative, obviously, would take longer than the waiver option. But we're working both sides very hard, Paul.
Operator: We have no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to Pam Beall.
Pamela K. M. Beall: Thank you, Christine, and thanks to everybody for joining us today and for your interest in Marathon Petroleum. And should you have additional questions, Beth Hunter and I will be in the office today to take your calls. So, thanks again.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Marathon Petroleum Corporation Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. My name is John, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Pam Beall. Ms. Beall, you may begin.
Pamela Beall: Thank you, John. Good morning everybody and welcome to our fourth quarter 2012 earnings webcast and conference call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website. On the call today are Gary Heminger, President and CEO; Garry Peiffer, Executive Vice President of Corporate Planning and Investor & Government Relations; Don Templin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Palmer, Senior Vice President of Supply, Distribution and Planning. Now, if you turn to slide two, please read the Safe Harbor statement. It is a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and during the question-and-answer session today.  Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now, I will turn the call over to Gary Heminger for some opening remarks.
Gary Heminger: Thanks Pam and good morning. Thank you for joining us. If you please turn to slide three, during our first full calendar year as an independent company, our commitment to safety and operational excellence underpinned our ability to capture value and deliver strong financial results. Our employees and contractors achieved record safety performance across our operations, including the world-class safety record for the DHOUP project. As a result of MPC’s outstanding operational and financial performance in 2012, our continued strong financial position and positive outlook, we were able to allocate capital to value accretive investments and return significant capital to shareholders. We returned approximately $1.76 billion to shareholders during the year. This was accomplished through two accelerated share repurchase programs totaling $1.35 billion and a 40% increase in our dividend. Earlier today, we announced the board authorized an additional $2 billion share repurchase, augmenting the $650 million remaining authorization that was announced in the first quarter of 2012. This provides a total outstanding authorization of $2.650 billion through 2014.  The expansion of our share repurchase authorization reflects our intent to continue balancing our use of capital and our recognition of the trust that our investors have placed in us to be good stewards of their capital. In 2012, the U.S. energy industry continued to adapt the growing North American crude oil and natural gas resources and to transportation bottlenecks for those resources. These forces will continue to influence the domestic energy market for years to come, and MPC will invest to remain strategically positioned to create value from these shifts, as they reshape our energy landscape. While we returned substantial capital to our shareholders, we balance that commitment with critical investments that will enhance MPC’s ability to benefit from changing market conditions. Most significant among these was the very successful initial public offering of MPLX LP, our new midstream master limited partnership, the completion of the $2.2 billion heavy oil upgrade project at our Detroit refinery and the agreement to acquire a world-class refinery in the Western Gulf Coast of Mexico. First, I will highlight the strategy for MPLX and how it will add value for MPC shareholders. We believe we have created a premier MLP, one that has some very attractive features. MPLX is a fee-based business with stable cash flows and multiple avenues to grow earnings and distributions over an extended period of time. With multiple avenues to expand, MPLX will be our primary vehicle to grow our midstream business and to participate in the infrastructure investments needed to meet the changing North American energy landscape. MPLX assets are integral to MPC’s integrated logistics and marketing system, providing MPC's refineries access to foreign, Canadian and domestic crude sources and finished products to its wholesale and retail marketing customers. The growing production of crude oil and natural gas liquids and changing supply patterns create opportunities for MPLX to play a vital role in the fast-changing energy landscape. In addition to organic investments, MPC has a significant and growing portfolio of logistics assets that could be acquired by MPLX in the future.  MPC's interest in MPLX, including its ownership of the general partner, will allow MPC shareholders to participate in the value created by growing the fee-based stable cash flow business of MPLX.  Turning to another significant accomplishment for the year, in November, we enhanced our feedstock acquisition economics by completing the Detroit Heavy Oil Upgrade Project known as DHOUP. This project increased our Detroit refinery’s heavy oil processing capacity from 20,000 barrels per calendar day to 100,000 barrels per calendar day, while increasing our total crude oil refining capacity at the facility from 106,000 barrels per day to 120,000 barrels per calendar day. Our Detroit refinery’s strong financial prospects are validation of the investment decision we made several years ago that now enables MPC to benefit from discounted Canadian heavy crudes. DHOUP also set a new standard for megaproject execution. The $2.2 billion project was completed on schedule and on budget. And just as importantly, it also achieved extraordinary safety records since we started construction of this project in the mid-2008. Early indication of Detroit's operations and financial performance are promising. The third accomplishment I wanted to highlight is the agreement we reached last year to purchase BP’s Texas City refinery near Galveston Bay. As the North American energy industry continues to adapt to a significant crude supply shifts, we see the Western Gulf Coast as a primary destination for the surge in crude supply. This transaction will expand our presence in this increasingly important region. The agreement includes a world scale refinery, along with related midstream assets and branded job or contract assignments. We plan to complete the transaction on February 1st, 2013. The transaction is expected to be funded with cash on hand and be accretive to earnings in the first year of operation. This acquisition will enhance our ability to refine price advantage crude oil and it expands our distribution options for refined products, including greater export opportunities. They will provide immediate scale to enable further expansion of our Marathon brand presence in the southeast. This refinery is one of the largest and most complex in the U.S., and is considered to be one of the most technologically advanced and flexible refineries in the world.  It will be the most complex refinery in our portfolio and it will increase our overall refinery complexity index and significantly increase our participation in the chemicals value chain. In addition to major accomplishments such as DHOUP, the creation of MPLX, initiation, other refinery acquisition, 2012 was a busy year for other improvements for MPC’s operational capabilities. Our Speedway retail segment increased its store count by about 7% last year, after acquiring 97 convenient stores in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. The acquisitions included 87 GasAmerica stores and 10 Road Ranger stores, bringing its total count to now around 1,460 stores. In addition to strengthening its presence in key marketing areas, Speedway also achieved record segment income and EBITDA per store. At the same time, Speedway grew its merchandise same-store sales for the 15th consecutive quarter and achieved its best ever safety record. Speedway same-store merchandise sales, excluding cigarettes increased 4% compared to the same quarter last year, which achieved a 7.2% same-store increase over the prior year. And moving on, we strengthened our position as a customer of choice for hydrocarbon liquids productions from the Utica shale by building additional infrastructure at our refinery in Canton, Ohio to received crude oil and condensate deliveries by transports from nearby wells. We entered into a letter of intent to jointly develop infrastructure intended to facilitate transportation of hydrocarbon liquids production from the Utica shale. The project will result and up to 24,000 barrels per day of truck unloading capacity and a terminal capable of loading up to 50,000 barrels per day onto barges on the Ohio River at MPC's current Wellsville, Ohio asphalt terminal.  To increase access to Bakken and Canadian crude, MPC agree to be the anchor shipper on Enbridge's proposed southern access extension with an option to acquire a 25% equity interest in the pipeline. This line will originate in finding in Illinois, near Chicago and terminate in Patoka, Illinois, a critical crude storage and blending hub and the origination point for crude supply for our four Midwest refineries. Recently, Marathon pipeline and the owners of Capline have agreed to terms for formalizing a new operating agreement for Marathon pipeline to become the operator of the Capline system effective in September of this year. Capline is a 633-mile 40-inch crude oil pipeline, running from St. James, Louisiana to Patoka, Illinois. It was constructed in the 1967-68 period and has been operated by Shell since that time. Marathon was one of the original owners and today, MPC retains a 32.6% interest. I have spoken about balance often, and the balance between investing in the business and returning capital to shareholders has been and we expect will continue to be a powerful driver of value. Our share price rose 89% from year-end 2011 to year-end 2012. Combined with dividends, total 2012 shareholder return was approximately 93%.  The value we have provided for our shareholders as a result of our continuous efforts to meet the needs of our customers in the most efficient way as possible, whether it’s sourcing the most price advantage crude slate, identifying the most cost-effective transportation for crude oil and finished products, or determining where our products will be needed most at any given time. We believe our focus on safe and efficient operations strategically located, refining access to virtually just take some multiple marketing options positions us to make the most of opportunities wherever and whenever they may occur. If you please turn to slide four, and looking ahead to 2013, we remain committed to operating our assets in a safe and reliable manner, with a continuous improvement in our safety record across all of our operations. Our outlook for U.S. gasoline demand for 2013 is flat and U.S. distillate demand to be up about 3.5%. In addition, we expect export opportunities to remain attractive in 2013. Our distillate exports rose to 151,000 barrels per day during the fourth quarter, compared to 94,000 barrels per day in the same quarter last year. We remain optimistic about the global competitive position of our U.S. Gulf Coast refineries and the prospects for future exports of gasoline and distillate. Our 2013 capital investment plan totals $1.5 billion, excluding the Galveston Bay refinery purchase price. It allocates capital across all our operating segments to capture value from ships in the energy landscape in North America and to increase our exposure to stable cash flow businesses. Don will go into more detail on specific projects, but I want to highlight a few key points.  We will continue our expansion projects in the pipeline transportation segment, including investments in MPLX operations, and we will pursue additional growth opportunities for this critical logistics operation to support both MPC and third-party business. We will continue to invest in our Speedway segment through a combination of selective acquisitions and organic projects for new stores, rebuilds, remodels and site acquisitions. This channel of distribution generates stable cash flow from crude and merchandise sales inside the store. Our 2013 plan includes high return projects in our refining and marketing segment that will increase higher value distillate yields, expand our export capacity, allow us to process higher volumes of light hydrocarbons expected to be produced in greater volumes from the Utica Shale, and to continue upgrades at the new Galveston Bay refinery. And all above, we just completed our first year as an independent company in 2012. We celebrated our 125th anniversary, having been founded in this part of Ohio in 1887. Our long-term success will continue to be built on our ability to adapt the changing marketing conditions and a commitment to value us of health and safety, environmental stewardship and integrity.  We look forward to new opportunities in 2013. As we do, we have recognized the trust our shareholders have placed on us. Our mission continues to be value-creation for our investors, incorporating a balance between internal and external investment and return of capital to shareholders through a strong and growing base dividend over the long term and share repurchases.  In all, we were pleased with what we were able to accomplish in 2012 and we remain very enthusiastic about our prospects into 2013. Now, I will turn the call over to Don Templin to review the financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2012. Don?
Donald Templin: Thanks, Gary. Slide five provides earnings both on an absolute and per share basis. Our fourth quarter and full-year 2012 financial performance was very strong. MPC had adjusted earnings of nearly $760 million or $2.26 per share during the fourth quarter of 2012. This was compared to a loss of $75 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. For the full-year of 2012, our adjusted earnings were $3.3 billion, almost $1 billion over the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share was $9.79 for the full year of 2012, compared to $6.72 for 2011. The waterfall chart on slide six shows by segment the change in adjusted earnings from the fourth quarter of 2011 to the fourth quarter of 2012. The primary driver for the change in our adjusted earnings was the increase in refining and marketing segment income, partially offset by additional income tax expense. The significant improvement in refining the market segment income was primarily the result of higher crack spreads and wider solid crude differentials in the quarter. The increase in income tax expense is a function of higher 2012 earnings. As shown on slide seven, refining and marketing segment income from operations was almost $1.14 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012. This was compared with a loss of $182 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. In explaining the key components of the refining and marketing gross margin, I will refer to the changes in market indicators applied to MPC actual volumes to arrive at the quarter-over-quarter variances. First, the blended LLS 6321 crack spread. It was $2.73 per barrel higher in the fourth quarter of 2012 than the fourth quarter of 2011, resulting in an estimated favorable variable of $371 million. Both Chicago and Gulf Coast crack spreads were higher in the fourth quarter of this year compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The most significant variance quarter-over-quarter relates to the sweet-sour differential. The sweet-sour differential for the 2012 fourth quarter was $13.41 per barrel, which was $12.44 per barrel higher than the comparable quarter last year and represents an estimated $809 million favorable variance. The LLS WTI differential was $21.29 for the fourth quarter of 2012, compared with $16.77 for the fourth quarter of 2011. This increase in our differential resulted in an estimated $81 million favorable gross margin variance between the two quarters. The first three market indicators are calculated by reference to a LLS Prompt price. Rapid changes in crude prices can cause significant differences between the LLS Prompt prices embedded in the market indicators and the actual amount we pay. On average, the delivered LLS crude cost was $1.36 per barrel less than the prompt LLS price during the fourth quarter of 2012, while the average delivered crude cost for the same quarter last year was $6.52 per barrel higher than the prompt price. This $7.88 difference resulted in an estimated $182 million favorable variance. You may recall there was a dramatic narrowing of the WTI to LLS crude differential at the end of last year, which had a significant impact on our crude oil acquisition costs in the fourth quarter of 2011. Direct operating costs had an unfavorable quarter-over-quarter effect of $90 million. This was primarily due to higher depreciation expense associated with the completion of DHOUP and higher planned turnaround cost in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared with the fourth quarter of 2011. As you know, we completed the turnaround at our Detroit refinery in the 2012 fourth quarter.  The gross margin column captures a number of other factors that need to be considered when reconciling the market-based metrics to the change in our gross margin. They include items such as actual realized prices, refinery yields, other feedstock costs and crude slate variances compared to the values assumed when we calculate the market indicators. It also includes refinery volumetric gains and purchase for resale activity. As you can see from the waterfall chart, this combination of factors led to an estimated $24 million unfavorable impact in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Slide eight provides a similar earnings walk for the refining and marketing segment on a year-over-year basis. The blended LLS 6321 crack spread in 2012 was double to $3.35 per barrel of crack spread of 2011, resulting in an estimated favorable variance of almost 1.7 billion. The sweet-sour differential accounted for an estimated favorable variance of $870 million, as the differential was $3.36 per barrel higher than the average for 2011. The WTI to LLS differential was $0.26 per barrel higher in 2012 compared to 2011, which resulted in estimated of $119 million of favorable gross margin variance between the two years. The LLS Prompt versus Delivered price variance was not significant when comparing the annual results. The total prompt versus delivered LLS crude variance accounted for an approximately $49 million positive impact in the full-year comparison. Market structure had an estimated unfavorable variance of $126 million, that was $0.39 per barrel less of contango in the NYMEX WTI market structure in 2012 compared to 2011. Our direct-to-operating costs were $197 million higher in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to higher planned turnaround expenses and higher depreciation expense in 2012. With respect to other gross margin, a number of factors impacted the change year-over-year. The mix of crudes we actually processed versus the market indicators was the primary contributor of this difference. On the next few slides, we include earnings walks for each of our other operating segments. Turning to slide nine, Speedway’s income from operations was $77 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to $73 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Light Product and Merchandise gross margin combined were about $21 million higher in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared with the fourth quarter of 2011. Life Product margins increased by $8 million as margins averaged $0.1424 per gallon compared to $0.14 in the fourth quarter of 2011. Merchandise margin was $196 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared with $183 million in the same period last year. This $13 million increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of stores compared with the same period last year. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes decreased 0.2% and merchandise sales increased 0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared with the 2011 fourth quarter. The lower same-store gasoline sales volumes primarily reflect the impact of the higher absolute price of gasoline. Speedway's average retail gasoline price was $3.32 per gallon during the fourth quarter of '12 compared with $3.20 per gallon for the comparable quarter last year. In January 2013 we've seen an increase in demand with an approximately 2% increase in same-store gasoline sales volumes at Speedway. Speedway's income from operations for all of 2012 was $310 million compared with $271 million for 2011. Light product margins increased by $15 million as margins averaged $13.18 per gallon in 2012 slightly higher than the 2011 average. On a same-store basis, gasoline sales volumes decreased 0.8% in 2012 compared to 2011. The decrease in same-store gasoline sales reflects lower gasoline demand in our market area. Merchandise margins were $795 million in 2012 compared to $719 million in 2011 or an increase of $76 million. The increase in light product and merchandise margins were partially offset by increased expenses of $52 million primarily due to an increase in the number of stores operated in 2012 as compared to 2011. Slide 10 shows fourth quarter and full year changes in our Pipeline Transportation segment income from operations was $72 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared with $38 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in transportation tariffs and earnings from pipeline affiliates offset by slightly higher mechanical integrity costs. Some of the increase in the transportation tariffs were related to the formation of the MPLX, 2012 income from operations was $216 million compared with $199 million in 2011. This improvement is primarily attributable to an increase in transportation tariffs partially offset by higher mechanical integrity costs and a reduction in pipeline affiliate income in 2012. The chart on Slide 11 provides an analysis of cash flows for the fourth quarter of 2012. At December 31, 2012 our cash balance was nearly $4.9 billion. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was just over $1.1 billion. The working capital benefit of $919 million noted on the slide primarily relates to the impact of lower refined product prices on our ending receivables and a reduction in our inventory levels at year-end. Capital expenditures and investments during the quarter were $403 million including amounts related to the completion of our Detroit heavy oil upgrade project also shown on this slide is the $500 million of cash used in connection with our second accelerated share repurchase program and the cash we received related to the initial public offering of MPLX. Slide 12, shows that at the end of the fourth quarter, we had nearly $4.9 billion of cash and approximately $3.4 billion of debt. With EBITDA of over $6.3 billion during the last 12 months. We continue to be in a very manageable debt position with leverage of 0.5 times EBITDA and a debt to total capital ratio of 22%. This strong liquidity position will enable us to fund the Galveston Bay refinery in cash with sufficient remaining balances to support our core liquidity position and continue to focus on capital return. Turning to Slide 13, during the last 12 months we generated almost $4.5 billion in cash from operations and nearly $3 billion of free cash flow. Consistent with our commitment to return capital to shareholders we distributed 60% of our free cash flow in the form of dividends and share repurchases during this past year. We are committed to being a leader in our peer group in terms of total shareholder return going forward. As Gary mentioned earlier, our strong liquidity position has supported the board’s authorization of the repurchase of an additional $2 billion of common stock for a total outstanding authorization of $2.65 billion through 2014. We will periodically update you on the progress of the share repurchase program. Regarding the $500 million accelerated share repurchase program we initiated in November. We expect the program to complete tomorrow. The total shares to be received will be based on the average share price over the three-month period of the program based on share prices to date we expect to receive approximately 930,000 shares in addition to the 7.4 million shares received at the inception of the program. This will bring the total shares acquired under the program to approximately 8.3 million shares or about 2.4% of the shares outstanding when the program began. Slide 14 provides outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the first quarter of 2013. This information assumes the February 1 closing date for the Galveston Bay acquisition. For comparative purposes those same metrics for the first quarter 2012 are also shown. Slide 15 provides a breakdown by segment of our actual 2012 capital expenditures and investments along with our approved capital budget for 2013. Slide 16 indicates the significant capital projects that we’ll be working on in 2013 and beyond. Total capital spending in 2013 associated with planned upgrading of the Galveston Bay refinery and related assets is expected to be approximately $400 million. We will continue infrastructure investments and complete several programs that are underway at this time. In addition, we've identified synergies that we should begin to capture during our first year of operation. Executing on our commitment to expand our assured sales, we have allocated $255 million for organic and acquisition opportunities within our Speedway segment in 2013. At our Garyville refinery, we are continuing our projects to optimize diesel and gasoline yield through modifications to the older crude unit, hydrocracker and the distillate hydro-treaters. Total capital spending is estimated at $225 million with the hydrocracker revamp to be completed in 2014 and completion of the final phase of the program in 2015. We intend to be a first mover in the Utica Shale play and will position MPC to be the customer of choice for the crude oil and condensate. Total spending is estimated at approximately $300 million through 2014 to accomplish to these objectives. New barges will be purchased to allow Utica production to be transported to Catlettsburg from the Wellsville facility. We plan to invest in condensate splitters at Canton and Catlettsburg to allow the refineries to process up to 60,000 barrels per day of condensate from the Utica field. In 2013 we should complete our Wellsville truck-to-barge crude system project and begin a condensate gathering line project that will connect production via pipeline to both our Wellsville terminal and the Canton refinery. The Patoka to Catlettsburg crude oil pipeline upgrade project is within MPLX and has been prefunded with a $160 million of proceeds received from the initial public offering. This major upgrade project is expected to increase capacity and reliability and will be completed in September of 2014. The Robinson uni-cracker project is a planned revamp of our distiller hydrocracker to improve margins by processing more feedstock at a lower conversion and shifting approximately 10,000 barrels per day of other products to diesel production. Estimated total capital spending for the project is $75 million and it should be complete in 2015. With respect to our gasoline and distill export project to Garyville we are progressing well and plan to have the final phase of the project complete ahead of schedule in late 2013. This $40 million capital project along with some minor optimization work has already allowed us to increase our diesel export capacity by 50,000 barrels per day while the addition of a tank will expand our ability to export gasoline as well. The Catlettsburg vacuum cut-point project is a revamp that will recover additional volumes of gas oil from the refinery's residual oil production to be processed in the Cat cracker, thus increasing the production of higher valued gasoline and diesel. This project is expected to be completed in 2014. Now I’ll turn the call back to Pam Beall.
Pamela Beall: Thanks Don. Many of you have asked about the assets in MPC's refining and marketing segment that could potentially be acquired by MPLX in the future. You will find in our 10-K which will be filed next month additional disclosure about those assets that we believe will be useful to investors. Now, as we open up the call for questions we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up and then of course you may re-prompt for additional questions as time permits. So, John with that we would like to open the call to questions.
Operator: Thank you, we will now begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Chi Chow from Macquarie Capital, please go ahead.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Capital: Alright. Thanks and good morning. Gary, you mentioned in your remarks the news on Capline and I am wondering with Marathon becoming operator does that change your thoughts at all on a possible reversal of line or are you still happy with the crude supply optionality from the Gulf Coast longer term?
Gary Heminger: Thanks Chi and good morning to you. The operatorship -- this has been under discussion for some time and so I would find that separate from whether or not there is an opportunity to reverse the line. We continue to study those opportunities. As we’ve said before there were three owners and it takes all of us to agree on which direction that pipeline might flow. So, we will continue to analyze this going forward and determine if there's any change in that direction.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Capital: So, the ownership structure doesn’t change at all?
Gary Heminger: No, it does not.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Capital: Okay, and does the upcoming decision on the Keystone XL line influence your thoughts or I guess, all three owners thoughts?
Gary Heminger:  Well it’s going to be very interesting if Keystone XL gets approved or if its delayed, that is, I think it’s going to take longer to get that decision made than we had initially thought. But certainly if something would to happen in that pipeline doesn’t get built to the Western Gulf, then that would put I think a different view maybe for some of the owners on Capline, but all remains to be seen.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Capital:  Okay, Thanks Gary. And then a second question on DHOUP. Can you talk about how the unit is operating so far? You’re in January and I think you have put out a $350 million EBITDA accretion number out there on 2011 pricing. What are your thoughts on handicapping upside or downside on that increase at this point?
Gary Heminger: Right, the numbers that you have quoted are correct that we put out numbers to both the 2006 to 2010 timeframe and 2011. The number you have quoted is correct and Chi we are very pleased, I really congratulate and complement our refining team that built this project and had it up and running. It’s running very well. It's been able to meet its stated capacity very early on and so we are in the process now of testing to see, it’s too early yet Chi. If I take you back to how we brought Garyville up, we are in some very early stages, so I don’t have any of the test data yet on if it can outrun its design capacity, so it’s too early. But its running very well, and it came up relatively seamless.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Capital: Great, what type of barrels are you displacing with the increased runs of the heavy Canadian?
Gary Heminger:  Let me ask Mike Palmer to answer that.
Michael Palmer:  Oh yes Chi, obviously, we talked before about the ability of bringing in an incremental 80,000 barrels a day of heavy Canadian and we've been ramping that up. But basically we've been bringing in the heavy Canadian, which we've been very successful at acquiring and moving, and just backing out a really what is a variety of other lighter in some sweet crudes.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Capital: Okay, great, thanks Mike, appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America, please go ahead.
Doug Leggate – Bank of America:  Well, thanks, good morning everybody. I've got a couple as well, hopefully I won't take too long. You guys mentioned that you're getting ready to basically or you'd be able to process increasing amounts of condensate opened from the Utica, have you already got line up sight as to where the supplies are coming from and have you been in negotiations with suppliers already, because obviously volumes are still somewhat fairly sparse, as we understand it?
Michael Palmer: 
 :
Doug Leggate - Bank of America: Great, thanks. Two quick follow-ups if I may. Gary, the accelerated or rather the step-up in the buyback program, could you give us some idea as to how you're thinking about prioritizing that between competitive dividend growth and buybacks. And perhaps what the likely pace you would anticipate given the cash in your balance sheet of executing that buyback program, and have got one final input?
Gary Heminger:  Sure Doug. Let me ask Don to take that one.
Donald Templin: 
 :
Doug Leggate - Bank of America: Great, thank you. I apologize to squeezing the third one in, but just very quickly on the micro Gary. If I could just ask for your perspective on the outlook for Canadian heavy differentials, I know that you guys are essentially a fairly significant buyer of that, and I'll leave it there, thank you.
Gary Heminger:  Yes Doug, there are going to be many changes in the Canadian heavy market this year. Now, of course it depends on what happens with the Excel pipeline, but that won't be completed even if they were approved first half of this year, probably won't be completed into the 15th timeframe or so, somewhere in that arena. But we just brought Detroit up, DHOUP in November, and there is another very large project up in Whiting that will come up, we understand later this year. So we really would expect to have strong differentials through the front half of this year, and then we'll see what happens when those other project comes up. But at the same time you're going to see one or two more fields come on stream. And I still think it's going to come down to the pipelines and the pipeline capacity, and where and what regions that heavy crude can move. And then of course that will be tempered by any turnarounds and not any downtime in any of the Canadian upgraders or Canadian production operations.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America: Got it, thanks for the answers Gary, I appreciate that.
Gary Heminger: Thanks Doug.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse, please go ahead.
Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse: Hey, good morning Gary and everyone and congrats on the results. Just trying to focus in on Texas City, obviously we'll actually see the EBITDA soon enough. But, could you give us any updates on say OpEx per barrel, or the logistics EBITDA within Texas City, or the potential capture rate that you think relative to Gulf Coast margins given that you've got lot of aromatics and propylene production in Texas City?
Gary Heminger: Right, let me ask. Thanks for the comments there Ed, and let me ask Don to cover this.
Donald Templin: Yes. Ed, with respect to I would say the operating expenses or manufacturing costs, we have embedded those manufacturing costs in the outlook information that we have included in our slides. So that includes two months’ worth of Galveston Bay or the Texas City refinery in those amounts. So, you can see kind of those numbers as reflected or compared to 2012. With respect to the EBITDA, we don’t give specific EBITDA per plant or by refinery, but at the time that we did announce the acquisition last year we used two different price decks and the incremental EBITDA associated with the refinery using those two price decks was between $700 million and $1.2 billion.
Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities: Great.
Donald Templin: Ed, the other thing with your question on aromatics, we are just going to take over on Friday. We just received the LP, late in the process here and because the former owner that was their property and we need to make sure the same got to the finish line, as I said, it will on this Friday. So, we just got that LP. We will be refining that and really get into the details of that starting next week. So, we really can’t breakout the aromatics yet. But all of that value is embedded in the numbers, the 700 or 1.2, that John just gave you. Those numbers were based on a 12-month and of course, this is going to be an 11-month period.
Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities: Yes. The other question is around gasoline versus diesel. Oversea gasoline prices have been depressed partly because of American demand and partly because refineries in the US are running as hard as they can whereas diesel obviously has been a little bit more profitable. When you think about uses of the free cash flow that you have. What sort of thoughts do you have around making some larger investments to improve the diesel yield at the refinery system?
Donald Templin: Well, Ed, we have made and I think we were a little bit ahead of the curve going back to when built Garyville. We built Garyville to be a balanced refinery about 50% gasoline and 50% diesel. Then when we did DHOUP the same thing to get more diesel output and to be able to lessen the amount of reset in the marketplace and then further investments we made at Garyville to even expand the hydrocracker to make more diesel and with the help of other process units and then lastly to be able to export that diesel out of the marketplace in an efficient manner. So we have made a lot of investments in what I call low hanging fruit early on and probably ahead of some.
Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities: But no plans to do a major sort of hydrocracker build?
Donald Templin: Not at this time, Ed.
Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.: Hi, good morning, guys. 
Gary Heminger : Good morning, Evan.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.:  Question on your 2013 CapEx. I guess first can you quantify how much of the $1.6 billion is midstream including dock capacity, I am trying to understand the better the organic growth or kind of more of the conventional growth in MLP assets within the portfolio? I have a second question.
Donald Templin: Evan, this is Don. We have not typically broken that out. I mean, you can see what we have included for pipeline transportation but a big piece of that number relates to the Patoka, the Catlettsburg upgrade expansion project. We have not separately detailed the other projects.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.: Right. But the fact is listed number two would mean it’s a pretty big priority item you are spending here? I guess my second question is -- I mean maybe you are just saying you want to answer that but in terms of the Galveston Bay or the Texas City CapEx, I mean, can you mention how much is regulatory maintenance versus growth, just trying to understand how much invested capital could drive incremental returns on a flat crack basis rather than aggregate amount of what’s being invested?
Gary Heminger: I think $400 million is our expectation of the spend that we would have related to Galveston Bay this year, Evan. I would say substantially of all that relates to either regulatory or projects that were ongoing. Our view around expansion opportunities actually occurs in subsequent years.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.: Okay. Maybe finally a question is, obviously, it’s very topical around midstream and downstream this quarter but do you see any role for rail in your system or do you really think you are kind of best served by pipe given your location? I would leave with that. Thanks.
Michael Palmer: Evan, this is Mike Palmer. We have looked at rail over and over again. If you look at our system, again, with our plants in the Midwest and the plants in the Gulf Coast, we just don’t think that our investing in rail makes a lot of sense. We think that we can accomplish much lower transportation costs through pipeline. We understand why others do it, but what we have looked at it and just can’t make sense of it.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.:  Okay. It makes sense. Appreciate you guys. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Terreson from ISI, please go ahead.
Doug Terreson - ISI Group: Good morning, everybody and congratulations on your great results. 
Gary Heminger: Thanks, Doug.
Doug Terreson - ISI Group: Gary, industry exports or net exports seem to have slowed during the past year although I think you pointed out that you didn’t have any problems because yours was -- increased further with the expansion in Garyville. My question involves any insights that you may have into the slowdown in the industry exports, meaning, are there supply or demand side features that are present here and what you consider your major advantage is in this area? Also how the new refinery will affect your export capabilities in coming years? Meaning, will you have to make investments or is it readymade for exports. So if you could just comment on couple of those items I would appreciate it?
Gary Heminger : Sure, Doug. Our numbers on exports appear to be about flat for distillate and I can talk about distillate because that’s the commodity that we export the most. So about flat to last year. One of the things that I think give us a good position in the market is the quality of the distillate that we are making out of Garyville as a high cetane rate which is sought after in the marketplace. So I think that is, say, it gives us a strong position. You will notice that we substantially increased quarter-over-quarter last year, the numbers were 151 this year to 94 last year. So we substantially increased that and continue to have a strong demand for our distillate.  As we take on Galveston Bay and the way -- part of the synergies and the way that we are going to operate there, the day we move some of our products, I would say we kind of crisscrossed with Galveston Bay because Galveston Bay is a very large supplier into the Florida market as same as Garyville is and then we also both plants were exporters into the Latin America, South America market and some to Europe. So, we will be able to pick up some synergy and be able to optimize how we move those products to marketplace and I think take advantage of some good transportation savings both in distance and in the volume or the metric tons that you are going to ship in one batch. So, that’s what we are looking at upfront, Doug.
Doug Terreson - ISI Group : Okay. I had a couple of other questions about inventory. I think you guys mentioned that there was an inventory gain in the quarter, so I want to find out the magnitude? And then Gary, you are (inaudible) for the industry in Washington, so I wanted to see if we could get some updated insights from you on, potential changes in industry tax policy and specifically, while it doesn’t sound like there is going to be some type of mandate whereby the refiners migrate from LIFO to FIFO, just want to see what your views might be in that area and also the level of your current LIFO reserves, so there is three question there.
Gary Heminger: Right. Donald, go over the inventory first.
Donald Templin: Yes. So, with respect to inventory I think the comment I made was in the fourth quarter as part of our cash flow or working capital items our inventories at year-end were slightly below or were lower than our inventories at the end of the third quarter. On a year-on-year basis our inventories are just slightly up, maybe $200 million I want to say roughly. So, that’s the inventory.
Doug Terreson - ISI Group :  And industry tax policy Gary, your view?
Gary Heminger: Right. A couple of things, industry tax policy of course the industry would certainly embrace staying with LIFO and that’s the direction that we are working hard and trying to explain in Washington. I would say the biggest item in Washington that we are dealing with short-term will be the renewable fuel standard. It’s unworkable in its current approach. You see that there was a decision that came out this week that said that a decision was made that EPA oversteps some boundaries within the biodiesel side of the business. I would say Renewable Fuel Standard because as we come to hit the blend wall and the requirements that are there for blending and the lack of cellulosic and the lack of some other advanced cellulosic type of materials it really puts us in an unworkable solution, or unworkable position, I should say. The next discussion point is going to be around E15 and we don’t think that works either and it’s going to be something that we continue to work very hard inside the beltway. From a tax position, we certainly embrace staying with LIFO. I will let Don discuss.
Donald Templin: Yes. I think you had asked about LIFO but I don’t have the reserve number with me right now. If you are asking about the replacement cost, I mean, fair value exceeds our carrying cost by somewhere around $5.4 billion at the end of the year.
Doug Terreson - ISI Group : Okay, great guys. Thanks a lot.
Gary Heminger: See you, Doug.
Operator: Our next question comes from Blake Hernandez from Howard Weil, please go ahead.
Blake Hernandez - Howard Weil:  Hi, guys, good morning. I had a question for you on Texas City, understanding you are about to close but just kind of the history of the facility, it’s obviously been run somewhat inefficiently I am just curious if you have had a chance to get in there and assess some cost cutting and efficiency opportunities yet?
Gary Heminger: Yes, Blake. First and most important to us is to bring this on a very safe manner, safety to the employees, safety to the community and the environment and that’s really where we are focused. We have set up a complete separate team to be able to bring this on and turn this over so that they are not distracted with their job back at one of their other refineries they are there to look after this plant. We have named the new management team and we have confidence in their abilities. We are not going to focus on cost cutting early on. We really need to, as Don outlined a little bit ago, that the capital that is on our plate this year is mainly to this and the next couple of years is to complete the regulatory or consent decree capital if you want to call it then that is required in this plant. Then we will focus on what is the best way in our opinion to operate. Mike Palmer’s group is going to focus on the best way to optimize the feedstocks and then how we sell it into the marketplace. I want to be very clear, we are not going to step out and try to reduce operating cost immediately until we totally get this under control and a safe turnover the operation.
Blake Hernandez - Howard Weil: Understood. Thanks, Gary. And then the second question was -- one of your peers yesterday talked about I guess the opportunity to where they have pushed out all the foreign barrels that we are using along the Gulf Coast and replaced it with domestic barrels. I am just curious, do you have a similar opportunity with Garyville and of course Texas City coming online. I don’t know if you have a mix offhand of what foreign crude you run, is there a chance to replace those?
Michael Palmer: Yes, Blake. This is Mike Palmer. We certainly believe that here in 2013 that there really won’t be any material volume of foreign cargo sweet crude left in the Gulf. We always look to optimize our crude slates and where we can bring in a domestic barrel that’s priced better and provides higher profitability than a foreign barrel, we do that. So, there is not a lot of foreign sweet crude that we bring into the Gulf anymore. There may be some at Galveston Bay and once we get the LP and we are looking at that refinery closely will determine what the best crude slate is there. The other thing I would say is, while they won’t be any real material light sweet cargo crude coming into the Gulf, there will always be opportunities that various refiners will look at to bring special crudes in that provide value to that refinery. So, it’s not as if this crude is going to go completely away.
Blake Hernandez - Howard Weil: Got it. Perfect, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons, please go ahead.
Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International: Good morning. I know we are late in the hour. My question is regarding barging activity on the Mississippi River. I think historically you have moved something like 50,000 barrels a day and by barged down to Garyville. Are you being impacted by the low water levels and what are the constraints to moving more (inaudible) crude down to Garyville?
Garry Peiffer: Yes, this is Garry Peiffer. Regarding the Mississippi River, at moment it’s pretty much operating as normal. We are operating at Wood River dock with 9 foot drafts, so that’s pretty much what we normally operate at. So the good news is we had some pretty good precipitation here lately. So from a operation standpoint, other than the incident that occurred down in the southern part of the river here over the weekend that they expect to have up and running in the next couple of days, the river levels are not impeding our flow on the or activity on the Mississippi.
Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International: Is the 50,000 barrel a day movement the right ballpark and what’s the constraining factor to keep these from moving more?
Michael Palmer: Yes, this is Mike Palmer. Let me answer that. As you well know, the reason for these very wide differentials that we are seeing on the heavy Canadian now is due to pipeline constraints and that’s for everybody. What we will do as we go forward is we will have to look at the logistics space, the pipeline space that we have and how we best utilize that space within the system. So, whether or not the heavy barrels that we can get into say the Patoka area, whether those move on to Garyville by barge or whether we move those by pipe down to Galveston Bay or whether we move those to the Midwest system will be part of the optimization process that we will do each and every month. But there are pipeline constraints.
Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International: Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Garry.
Pamela Beall: John, we will take one last question and then we will call it a wrap.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We have a question from Thomas Stinball from Brokerage [ph], please go ahead.
Thomas Stinball - Brokerage [ph]: Hi, good morning guys and congratulations on a great year. My question to you is on how you are acting as a blender and producer of gasoline in response to the moves higher and RINs over the last few weeks. You alluded to sort of the structural question on the blend wall, but we have incurred RIN economics and shortage of ethanol after last year’s crop year, how are you planning to comply with the renewable mandates for ‘12 and ’13?
Gary Heminger: We don’t see that we will have any problem meeting the renewable mandate. Please understand the way that RINs work is you can carry some RINs forward and then we buy RINs on the third party market as well and of course there was a bit of issue a couple of years ago with the validity of some RINs but that has pretty much been all straightened out and we feel confident that it is not going to give us any problem in meeting that window.
Thomas Stinball - Brokerage [ph]: Would you prefer if you could get term ethanol supply agreement or buying RINS from the third party market as a means to fulfill that obligation?
Gary Heminger: We don’t have any problem, we have term ethanol agreements already. So that’s not a problem to us. 
Thomas Stinball - Brokerage [ph]:  Alright, thank you.
Gary Heminger:  Alright. Pam let me state that, I mentioned something in my speech that I thought afterward, for the folks at Speedway I said 15 straight quarters, it’s really 15 straight years that they have increased their merchandise sales and my compliments to them.
Pamela Beall: Okay. Well thank you Gary. Thanks everyone for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions I will be in the office this afternoon if you want to give us a call. Thank you. Bye, bye.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today’s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Marathon Petroleum Corporation Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sandra, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Pam Beall. Ms. Beall, you may begin.
Pamela K. M. Beall: Thank you, Sandra, and welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's Third Quarter Earnings Webcast and Conference Call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website in the Investors section. On the call today are Gary Heminger, President and CEO; Garry Peiffer, Executive Vice President of Corporate Planning and Investor and Government Relations; Don Templin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rich Bedell, Senior Vice President of Refining; and Mike Palmer, Senior Vice President of Supply, Distribution and Planning. If you look at Slide 2, please read the Safe Harbor statement that we have provided. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and also during the question-and-answer session today. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today, and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I'll turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks.
Gary R. Heminger: Thank you, Pam, and good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us. I know that many of you that are listening today are from the Northeast. And just let us mention that we are thinking of you, and we wish you the very best and to be safe in this very difficult and challenging time. We posted another strong financial and operational performance in the third quarter, with adjusted net income of $1.1 billion, which is comparable with our results for the third quarter last year. These positive financial results are primarily attributed to our Refining & Marketing segment, where we were able to capture benefits from favorable market conditions. In addition, we believe our focus on safe and efficient operations allowed us to utilize our assets at optimal levels and provide us a strategic advantage. Upgrades to our Detroit refinery are nearly complete and remain on-budget and on-schedule. Shortly after Labor Day, we began a 70-day planned turnaround to tie in the new units. The turnaround has gone according to plan, and we are in the early stages of startup and gradually ramping up operations with the upgraded and expanded refinery online later this month. When completed, these upgrades should allow us to lower our feedstock cost and capture incremental value from a heavier crude oil slate. Once the refinery is running at its new capacity of 120,000 barrels per day, the plant's heavy crude oil processing capacity will increase from 20,000 to 100,000 barrels per day. As we've shared in the past, using the LLS to WCS spread of 2006 to 2010 and for 2011, respectively, the incremental EBITDA from this project could be $200 million to $350 million per year. Over the past few weeks, we announced 2 significant corporate developments. On October 8, we announced we had signed an agreement to acquire BP's Texas City Texas refinery and relay the logistics and marketing assets. The refinery is one of the largest and most complex refineries in the U.S., with a Nelson Complexity Index of 15.3. This is unique opportunity to acquire world-scale refining assets at an attractive price. In addition to the 451,000 barrel per calendar day refinery, the agreement also includes 1,040 megawatt cogen facility, 4 terminals, 3 intrastate NGL pipelines, contracts representing 1,200 brand locations and 50,000 barrels per day of assigned shipper history on Colonial Pipeline. This refinery and related assets will strategically complement our existing business and provide an opportunity to create additional long-term value for our shareholders. We expect to close the transaction early in 2013. Also, early in October, our 80,000 barrel per day Texas City refinery was certified as a Voluntary Protection Program Star site by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. I'm proud of our employees' commitment to safety and operational excellence, and I commend all of our Texas City refinery personnel on this significant achievement. I firmly believe that our commitment to safety is one of the strongest components of our operational advantage in this very challenging industry. And last week, we announced the completion of an Initial Public Offering of MPLX. We intend for MPLX to be MPC's primary vehicle for ownership, operation and growth of our midstream business. The common units are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MPLX. Garry Peiffer is President of MPLX, and I've asked Garry to cover this in more detail in just a few minutes. We believe the formation and Initial Public Offering of MPLX has the potential to unlock shareholder value and improve our ability to participate in the ongoing expansion of logistics to transport the rapidly growing North American crude and natural gas production to consuming markets. Turning to demand. We estimate that U.S. gasoline demand was down about 0.3% and distillate demand was down 3% in the third quarter 2012 compared to a year ago. We expect U.S. gasoline demand to remain soft through the remainder of 2012 and expect total year 2012 demand to be down approximately 0.2%. Full year distillate demand is expected to decline about 1.9% in 2012. Looking ahead into 2013, we expect U.S. gasoline demand to be flat and distillate demand to be up about 3.7%. In addition, we expect export opportunities to remain attractive in 2013. Our distillate exports rose to 112,000 barrels per day during the third quarter compared to 73,000 barrels per day in the same quarter last year. Strong cash flow from operations provides a means for organic investments in the business, to make selective acquisitions like the BP transaction and to return capital to shareholders. Since becoming an independent public company in 2011 -- excuse me, in July of 2011, we have returned over $1.2 billion to shareholders through a combination of a 75% increase in our base dividend and share repurchases. We also have $1.15 billion remaining under the current board authorization for the repurchase of shares. Our mission continues to be value creation for our investors, incorporating a balance between internal and external investment and return of capital to shareholders. Now I will ask Garry Peiffer to provide a little more color on the recently-completed IPO of MPLX.
Garry L. Peiffer: Thanks, Gary. As Gary just said, MPC intends for MPLX to be its primary vehicle to own, operate and grow its midstream business. MPLX's initial assets include a 51% equity interest in a network of FERC-regulated common carrier crude oil and product pipeline assets located in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions, and a 100% interest in a recently-constructed 1 million barrel butane cavern located in West Virginia near our Catlettsburg, Kentucky refinery. This equity infrastructure gives MPC the opportunity to offer additional equity interests in these assets to MPLX over time. This provides MPLX distribution growth opportunities in addition to the growth we expect from increased revenues, organic investments, acquisitions and drop downs of other midstream assets retained by MPC. We announced on October 26 that we sold 19.9 million common units or 26.4% of MPLX in the IPO. MPC, through its subsidiaries, holds a 2% general partnership interest and the remaining limited partner interest in MPLX. These percentages reflect the fact that the underwriters did exercise in full their option to purchase an additional 15% of the common units offered in the IPO. We priced the common units at $22 per common unit, which was above the initial offering range of $19 to $21. The initial annualized minimum quarterly distribution on these units will be $1.05, which equates to a yield of 4.77%. This annualized yield represents the lowest yield ever for the Initial Public Offering of an MLP. We believe this record low IPO yield reflects the attractive initial assets and growth potential of MPLX. IPO proceeds totaled $438 million, of which MPC received $203 million. The balance was retained by MPLX to cover fees and expenses of the initial public offering and to pre-fund $192 million of organic growth projects. At MPC, our goal is to make every business we operate best-in-class, and we are focused on making MPLX a best-in-class MLP. Highlighted on this next chart are the 4 primary pillars that should allow MPLX to accomplish this objective. MPLX's initial assets will be fee-based businesses and will primarily consist of one of the largest pipeline systems in the U.S. based on the volume of crude and refined products delivered. The initial MPLX asset base has attractive organic growth prospects, anchored by increasing FERC-based tariffs and stable throughput volumes. To foster this organic growth, MPLX has retained $192 million of IPO proceeds to pre-fund identified organic capital spending over the next 2 years. Additionally, our assets are located in the heart of the Midwest infrastructure buildout, where we believe there are significant additional potential organic investment opportunities to grow MPLX. MPC has a large portfolio of MLP qualifying assets, including the 49% retained interest in MPLX's initial pipeline assets that can be offered to MPLX over time to help us achieve our desired annual distribution growth rate. MPLX also has -- also will have significant third-party opportunities that can evaluate independently or in conjunction with MPC. A recent example of these opportunities is the Letter of Intent that MPC signed with Harvest Pipeline Company to jointly develop infrastructure that will facilitate transportation on the Ohio River of hydrocarbon liquids production from the Utica Shale in Eastern Ohio and Western Pennsylvania. At MPC, we pride ourselves on maintaining our assets in a first-class manner, and we'll continue to do so at MPLX. We have studied the MPL universe for many years, and we believe we know what it takes to position MPLX to be a best-in-class MLP as demonstrated by the success of MPLX's initial public offering. Now I'll turn over the call to Don Templin to provide a more detailed update on the financial results for the third quarter.
Donald C. Templin: Thanks, Garry. Slide 6 provides net income both on an absolute and per-share basis. Our third quarter 2012 adjusted net income of $1.1 billion is comparable to the $1.1 billion we earned in the third quarter of 2011. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.31 for the third quarter 2012 compared to $3.16 during the same period last year. The 2012 third quarter earnings per share data reflects the impact of shares acquired in our share repurchase program. The waterfall chart on Slide 7 shows by segment the change in adjusted net income from the third quarter of 2011 to the third quarter of 2012. All 3 segments had comparable results to the same period last year. As shown on Slide 8, Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was $1.69 billion in the third quarter of 2012 compared with $1.71 billion in the third quarter of 2011. Although the segment results were comparable, the drivers of those results differed from quarter-to-quarter. In explaining the key components of the Refining & Marketing gross margin, I will refer to the changes in the market indicators applied to MPC actual volumes to arrive at the quarter-over-quarter variances. First, the blended LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread was $5.83 per barrel higher in the third quarter of 2012 than the third quarter 2011, resulting in an estimated favorable variance of $709 million. The Chicago crack spread was $6.44 per barrel higher than the third quarter 2011, and the Gulf Coast crack spread was also higher, up $5.19 per barrel. The sweet/sour differential increased slightly, up $0.31 per barrel over the third quarter last year and resulted in an estimated favorable variance of $90 million. The LLS/WTI differential was $17.21 for the third quarter 2012 compared with $22.92 for the third quarter of 2011. This decrease in the differential resulted in an estimated $193 million unfavorable gross margin variance between the 2 quarters. The first 3 market indicators I discussed are calculated by referenced to an LLS prompt price. Rapid changes in crude prices can cause significant differences between the LLS prompt prices embedded in the market indicators and the actual amount we pay. On average, the delivered LLS crude cost was almost $2 per barrel higher than the prompt LLS price during the third quarter of 2012 when compared to the third quarter of 2011. This accounted for an estimated unfavorable variance of $59 million. Direct operating cost had an unfavorable quarter-over-quarter effect of $118 million, primarily due to higher planned turnaround costs in the third quarter 2012 compared with the third quarter 2011. As you know, we completed the Robinson turnaround in July and began the Detroit turnaround in early September. The other gross margin column captures a number of other factors that need to be considered when reconciling the market-based metrics that changed in our gross margin. There are 2 primary factors affecting the $428 million unfavorable variance. First, as a result of changing crude oil differentials, our actual crude acquisition prices were higher than the market indicators due to differences in the mix of the crudes acquired versus the crudes used in those market indicators. The second factor was lower wholesale price realizations compared to the market indicators, primarily due to rising product prices. On the next 2 slides, we provide earnings walks for each of our other operating segments. On Slide 9, Speedway's income from operations was $76 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared with $85 million in the third quarter of 2011. Speedway's light product gross margin was $12 million lower in the third quarter of 2012 compared with the third quarter of 2011. The decrease was primarily due to a nearly $0.016 per gallon lower gross margin for the third quarter 2012 compared with the similar period in 2011. Merchandise margin was $217 million in the third quarter 2012 compared with $200 million during the same period last year. This $17 million increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of stores compared to the same period last year. Same-store gasoline sales volumes decreased 3.9% in the third quarter 2012 compared with the 2011 third quarter. Speedway's October same-store gasoline volumes were up approximately 1%, which puts their same-store sales down about 1% year-to-date. Same-store merchandise sales decreased 0.8% in the third quarter 2012 compared with the 2011 third quarter. However, same-store merchandise sales, excluding tobacco, increased 4.1% compared to the same quarter last year, which had a 7.2% same-store increase over 2010. Slide 10 shows changes in our Pipeline Transportation segment income. Income from operations was $52 million in the third quarter of 2012 compared with $56 million in the third quarter of 2011. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in earnings from pipeline affiliates. The chart on Slide 11 provides an analysis of cash flows for the third quarter of 2012. At September 30, 2012, our cash balance was nearly $3.4 billion. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was $1.3 billion. The working capital benefit of $513 million noted on the slide primarily relates to an increase in payables and a decrease in inventory, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivables since June 30. Capital expenditures and acquisitions during the quarter were $358 million, including amounts related to our Detroit heavy oil refinery project. Slide 12 shows that at the end of the third quarter, we had almost $3.4 billion of cash and approximately $3.3 billion of debt. With EBITDA of almost $5 billion during the last 12 months, we continue to be in a very manageable debt position, with leverage of 0.7x EBITDA and a debt-to-total capital ratio of 23%. Turning to Slide 13. During the last 12 months, we generated almost $3.1 billion in cash from operations and nearly $1.6 billion of free cash flow. Consistent with our commitment to return capital to shareholders, we have distributed 77% of our free cash flow in the form of dividends and share repurchases during this past year. And we are committed to being a leader in our peer group in terms of total shareholder return going forward. Slide 14 provides outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the fourth quarter of 2012. For comparative purposes, those same metrics for the fourth quarter 2011 are also shown. Now I will turn the call back to Pam Beall.
Pamela K. M. Beall: Thank you, Don. Before we open the call to questions, I want to remind you that we remain in a quiet period for 25 days following the completion of the Initial Public Offering. So our comments will be limited with respect to discussions about the future potential [Audio Gap] I do want you to know that we will be holding separate conference calls for MPLX beginning with the fourth quarter 2012 results that will be reported early in 2013. We open the call for your questions, and we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up. And of course, you may re-prompt for additional questions as time permits. And with that, we're going to open up the call to your questions. Sandra?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question is from Edward Westlake from Crédit Suisse.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I'm going to try anyway on the logistics side. Just on the EBITDA in the Refining & Marketing segment at MPC, not obviously MPLX, I mean, are you able to give a rough range of that now that MPLX is done?
Garry L. Peiffer: This is Garry Peiffer. We're basically limited to what we disclosed in the prospectus, the S-1, which in the S-1, essentially we disclosed the physical characteristics of those assets but not the EBITDA, which at this point we haven't done a calculation on a GAAP basis of. So the answer to that question is no. But as you know, and as I said, the one asset we do have that has obvious EBITDA associated with it is the 49% interest in the MPLX's pipeline assets we're retaining. So that had an EBITDA of roughly $90 million in our pro forma 2013 results. So that is the one fairly obvious indicator we have of a drop-down type of asset.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. Great. And then switching to Texas City. I believe on the call on Columbus Day, you weren't able to talk about operating costs I think because you hadn't had a chance to sit down with the regulators. Are you able to sort of give a range of operating costs for Texas City asset?
Gary R. Heminger: No, Ed. We have not been able to do that yet. Of course, we have our forecasts internally, but we have not sat down with the regulators nor through our CA can we make that available yet. But as we go through the process here of preparing to complete this transaction, we'll be meeting with the regulators later in the quarter.
Operator: And the next question is from Chi Chow from Macquarie.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: Gary, one of your remarks in your opening comments caught my attention. You mentioned that you expect distillate demand growth to be up 3.7% next year. Is that correct?
Gary R. Heminger: Yes, sir.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: What's your underlying assumption there?
Gary R. Heminger: Well, as we look at the total demand so far this year -- and we're up against a period -- while we were down here this quarter, if you look at last year, it appears the economy had picked up a little bit then last year. So we were up against a strong quarter in 2011. But as we look at over-the-road diesel, we're looking at the portal movements, we're looking at the over-the-road 18-wheel transportation movements as well as the exports to Latin America, Europe, South America, we're expecting to see that type of growth across our system.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: Okay. So this 3.7% is your demand from your system?
Gary R. Heminger: Well, that's the U.S. demand, but that's also we expect to play in that basically in line.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: Okay. So exports are on top of this 3.7%?
Gary R. Heminger: No. Excuse me a second. Garry is telling me something different.
Garry L. Peiffer: Well, yes, this is Garry Peiffer. That is just our estimate of what U.S. demand growth will be in 2013. And really, it's offsetting the dramatic loss this year of almost -- we're figuring probably 2% to 2.5%. So when you combine the negative effect this year with the positive net effect next year, it's a fairly small gain overall.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: Right. Okay. I guess my second question, I'll just keep it more macro, what is your outlook for non-Canadian light/heavy differentials? They seem to be widening out a bit here lately.
Gary R. Heminger: I'll let Mike Palmer discuss this.
C. Michael Palmer: Yes, the non-Canadian light/heavy differentials?
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: Yes, so like the Maya spread certainly looks to be widening out. What's your outlook into 2013 on light/heavy spreads?
C. Michael Palmer: Well, I guess when we look at light/heavy, to be honest, I mean, the most important thing that we look at is really on the Canadian side because that's where most of the heavy crude is going to come from. And we -- you've seen those spreads that have widened out. We expect that certainly into the first and second quarter, that those spreads will remain wide. I think if you look at an LLS/Mars differential, those kinds of spreads ought to be very related to whatever the heavy product market does. It should follow closely.
Operator: And the next question is from Arjun Murti from Goldman Sachs.
Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just wanted to make sure I understood how you were thinking about the stock buyback. You did the, I think, accelerated repurchase at the beginning of the year. You still have the $1.15 billion. Now that MPLX will soon be done and you'll be at a quiet period, is it meant to be opportunistic going forward but stock price is weak? If you can just provide any color, that'd be great.
Donald C. Templin: Arjun, this is Don. I think it's probably not appropriate for me to comment on sort of our specific plans. But I will say that over the last year, I think we've had a really strong track record of returning capital to shareholders. And I think you should expect that, that will continue into the future. We have a discussion with our board regularly about the most appropriate ways to return capital to shareholders, and they are committed as we are to doing that regularly.
Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. Any update on how you're thinking about 2013 CapEx, I guess either with or without Texas City, however you want to phrase it?
Donald C. Templin: We have not put out a 2013 CapEx number yet, Arjun. I would say that from a -- as we're thinking about a MPC excluding BP Texas City, we would probably be in the range that we were 2011 and 2012. And then we're working through, obviously, the budget related to the acquisition itself. So we're more likely to be able to give that color in a couple of months' time.
Operator: And the next question is from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: On MPLX, and it's not related to what you can't talk about. But as the parent drop-down provide you another lever for cash flow to MPC in addition to the $3.4 billion of cash in the balance sheet and the $500 million undrawn in the revolver at MPLX is gun powder to fund future drops, I mean, can you discuss how this additional potential source of cash impacts your return strategy? I mean, are you more or less inclined to use a special dividend that could be associated with future drop-downs? Or how are you incorporating that?
Garry L. Peiffer: Yes, this is Garry Peiffer. I think it's hopefully fairly obvious, and this is what we stated in the prospectus of that, we didn't essentially [ph] do this Initial Public Offering as a means to generate cash flow. Obviously, we don't have a balance sheet that needs repairing or anything like that. So our primary objective by the creation of MPLX is to, as we stated, own and operate and really grow our downstream -- our midstream assets. So our primary focus is on growing MPLX. And I think our dividend strategy, and Don can comment as well, isn't changing. We're looking at dividends like we always have, and this is just another part of the levers that we have to grow our cash at the MPC level as well.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. That's great. And then maybe a follow-up on -- I know MPC had something like $230 million in CapEx that was Pipeline and Transportation for 2012. I mean, has that changed with this new vehicle? I mean, should we expect spending on organic midstream projects at both levels or that would fund potential drops? Or would it -- has that shifted to the MPLX with the -- leaving some of the cash proceeds at that level?
Garry L. Peiffer: Yes, and this is Garry again. It's a little bit of both. As we -- as I stated, we're leaving $192 million of the IPO proceeds within MPLX to really fund some organic projects we've identified at this point, primarily related to 2013 -- excuse me, 2014. But we've also been doing things at the MPC level, like I mentioned, with the Harvest Pipeline to expand some of our transportation, logistical assets in the Utica area. So it's going to really depend upon what is the profile of the project in terms of EBITDA growth in the future. Because the thing we did, obviously, with the MLP assets we contributed originally to the MPLX was these are fee-based, very stable, very predictable type of assets that we want to continue to grow MPLX using that same profile if possible.
Operator: And the next question is from Jeff Dietert from Simmons.
Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: I had a question regarding Canadian heavy. Canadian heavy discounts have recently widened from about $15 a barrel at the middle of October to now currently $30 a barrel under WTI. So the Canadian heavy discounts are widening substantially right in front of the Detroit upgrader completion. So it looks as though you should be off to a strong start with profitability at Detroit. Mike, could you comment on what's driving those wide differentials for the Canadian heavies in the current market?
C. Michael Palmer: Yes, Jeff, I'd be happy to. I guess there's probably 3 things that I would comment on. First of all, I think that the widening, the severe widening of the differentials started when Keystone discovered an anomaly in their pipeline. I think it was in the Missouri area. And they had to shut down for maintenance, and they were down for about 5 days. So when they're operating a little over 500,000 barrels a day, they backed 2.5 million barrels of primarily heavy crude back into the market. And the differentials started widening out considerably at that point. Of course, that happened just recently, and we're at a point where we're ending the asphalt season. And historically, the heavy dis in Canada has started to widen up during that period anyway. And then there have been some upgrader problems of late as well. So with the particular problem that I'm thinking of, it's going to reduce the amount of light synthetic available, but it's going to increase the amount of heavy crude that they'll be blending and making available in the market. So as usual, there's a number of issues that are going on. But we would expect that these wider differentials are normal, now that we're out of the asphalt season, will continue.
Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: If I could ask a quick question on Slide 8. It's a very helpful slide. On the other gross margin, you talked about the $428 million negative impact and the 2 factors: actual crude prices and wholesale prices rising. Could you break down those 2 factors? And what percentage of the $428 million was from each of those 2 factors?
Garry L. Peiffer: Jeff, we've not disclosed -- I guess it's probably appropriate to follow up maybe on the details with Beth after the call, I guess. In terms of kind of the 2 driving factors, in our -- as an example, in our sweet/sour differential calculation, there's an assumed sour basket in there. And when our actual crudes that we acquire differ from that assumed sour basket, we have a mix differential that drives that. And same thing in the 6-3-2-1 crack spread, there's a spot, there's an assumed spot product price. And when our wholesale realizations differ from those assumed spot product prices, we also have a differential. So probably best for Beth to walk you through kind of the details on that offline.
Operator: And the next question is from Doug Terreson from ISI Group.
Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Some of your competitors have been fairly vocal about the changing dynamic between the environmental regulator at the federal and also at the state level in Texas during the past couple of years. And while this obviously may change, I just wanted to get your perspective on this item and whether you even consider it an issue as it relates to future permitting. And along these lines, BP invested significantly in Port Arthur. And it may be too early to know, but when you did your economic assessment of the plant, did you envision meaningful investment anyway? So those are my 2 questions.
Gary R. Heminger: Say, Doug, on the permitting process, I must admit that we have been, I think, very pleased our permitting if we go back to Garyville and Detroit. And then some additional permitting we've done, we have in the areas of the country in which we operate and the transparency in which we operate, I think we've been very successful in being able to gain the permits in a timely manner. So I do understand some of the issues that some of the competitors have discussed, possibly on the West Coast and those issues. But the markets, again, in which we operate, we've been very successful. Now you asked on when we're looking at -- when we were looking at BP, I didn't catch the last part of your question.
Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Yes, so the question was, so when you were assessing the economics of the plant, I mean obviously, they've spent a ton on this refinery over the years. Did you -- do you guys really envision a lot of investment that would make permitting anyway?
Gary R. Heminger: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I missed the permitting word. No. In fact, the majority of the investment going forward is going to be to complete work that already is what's in a either a consent decree or some other agreements that have been made in that plant. So there should not be any incremental permits that are required. And Rich Bedell is here with me. Rich can chime in. Rich, are you aware of any big permits we need?
Richard D. Bedell: No. I mean, we've looked at that, and we're in good shape. I mean, they're operating with their permits right now and those will be assigned over, we'll transfer those permits, operating permits, over to Marathon. In fact, that process is ongoing right now.
Operator: And the next question is from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: A couple of questions. So the first one is, if you could elaborate a little bit more on the same-store sales for the quarter down 3.9% I think. What exactly caused that quarterly drop? Is it timing or are we -- was there something more extreme in the quarter that caused that?
Gary R. Heminger: Faisel, I think it's all price. If you look at the retail price this year versus the same time last year, if you look at the last 3 or 4 years how that retail price and the -- really the discretionary demand, how it changed the different retail price levels, I would say that, that price level now seems to be $3.50. Once you get over $3.50, the discretionary demand seems to drop. We're seeing right now here in the month of October that demand has picked up because we got below the $3.50 range. So I would say it's all price level. And as you know, over the summer, early fall, we got up close to $4, and that's really been the determining factor.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then my follow-up question is on the deal with the Harvest Pipeline Company. Are you now more confident that the oil volumes in the Eagle Ford are picking up, and there's -- you're going to see material growth over the next 12 to 18 months? Or is this more of an option in case things accelerate?
Gary R. Heminger: What we have always said, Faisel, is that we want to make sure that we are in position to have first mover advantage. The Utica area is still under the front end of trying to determine what the flow properties are going to be and how that area is going to be produced. Again, it is just -- it is ramping up slowly. So we have set up the option in order to be able to, if we want and working with Harvest, to be able to develop this way to offload crude. And again, we believe our 2 refineries, Canton, Ohio, and then Catlettsburg, probably provide the best 2 transportation alternatives in the marketplace. So therefore, we want to be out front in determining what the best options are going forward.
Operator: And the next question is from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I guess I'd like to follow up given your commentary earlier on the distillate or the diesel demand side, what can you do inside your facilities? I mean, I guess we could ask it 2 ways, both excluding Texas City and then your expectations once you have that inside your operations in terms of taking advantage of higher diesel against flat gasoline demand. In other words, what can you do on the yield side, throughput side, et cetera?
Gary R. Heminger: Let's let Rich, who runs our Refining, talk about this.
Richard D. Bedell: Yes, normally, what we're talking there you're swinging maybe about 5% of your output you can swing from gasoline and diesel on those lines.
Gary R. Heminger: And recall, Roger, when we built Garyville, our strategy was to, unlike most refineries in the U.S., to make this a much heavier output of diesel -- around 50% is gasoline, 50% is diesel. We've been able to outperform on the capacity throughput from what our initial design was, therefore make some additional diesel. And then also, we've had some projects in the budget here in 2012 and '13 that we're increasing some of our throughput. Let me ask Rich to go a little more into detail, your increase out of the cat and the hydrocracker at Garyville.
Richard D. Bedell: At Garyville, the increase in...
Gary R. Heminger: Not the absolute, but what the projects that you have going on.
Richard D. Bedell: Oh, okay. Sure. I will. Certainly, the hydrocracker, and we've also talked about the expansion of the hydrocracker project there and the expansion of the cat cracker that we did, both those bring more distillate stocks out. So we've got projects there as well as Catlettsburg for recovering more distillate and gas oil out of our existing crude units. So all those are projects. And the other one is the Robinson. We've announced that we're -- we have a hydrocracker project there which will shift the yields from gasoline to more towards distillate.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. So as we look at '13, you should be able to generate a, let's say, meaningfully -- statistically meaningful volume of diesel to hit that growth that's going to be out there, that you expect to be out there?
Gary R. Heminger: Those projects are more '14, '15.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. So what we're looking at in '13 should be very similar to '12?
Gary R. Heminger: I think that's a fair assumption, yes.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. So even with margins already favoring distillate, there's not a whole lot that's -- within your operations that would necessarily change?
Gary R. Heminger: Correct.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then can you give any comments at all about Texas City, kind of the expectation or how maybe it would compare to your operations, higher, lower, in that gasoline-diesel kind of yield?
Gary R. Heminger: The Texas City refinery is more on the lower diesel distillate yield, probably in the low 30% type number. And it has a much larger petrochemical output. It has a very large aromatics, para-xylene and those sort of yields. So it is actually, like I say, low 30% type distillate yields. It's a combination of diesel and jet fuel.
Operator: And the next question is from Eli Bauman from Barclays.
Eli Bauman - Barclays Capital, Research Division: It's Eli for Paul. I wanted to quickly see if I could get the standard balance sheet data, the working capital, market value of inventory in excess of book and long-term debt?
Donald C. Templin: Sure. Eli, this is Don. Working capital is $4.2 billion, current assets were $12.5 billion, and current liabilities were $8.3 billion. The amount by which the fair market value of inventory exceeds our book inventory is about $6.2 billion.
Eli Bauman - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then the long-term debt, please?
Donald C. Templin: $3.3 billion.
Eli Bauman - Barclays Capital, Research Division: $3.3 billion. Okay. And then finally, you guys have been really consistent on returning cash to shareholders. But just wanted to see if I could get specifically on the regular dividends, more color about how management and the board thinks about timing and size of increases.
Donald C. Templin: Well, I guess we have said that we think having a very strong base dividend is really important. I mean it's important to management and the board, and we know it's important to our investors. So we will continue, and we have a regular discussion with our board at least quarterly about base dividend. We did increase it 40% just 1 quarter ago, and so we will continue to evaluate it every quarter and have meaningful discussion with our board about it. I mean, we think that's the sort of the base around which we target return on capital. So we always want to have a very strong base dividend.
Operator: We have a follow-up question from Edward Westlake from Crédit Suisse.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: This is just around disclosure. I guess post-Texas City, are there any plans to sort of break out the Gulf from the MidCon region? I think that would clearly be helpful for us, although it does involve a bit more work.
Gary R. Heminger: Ed, it's too early for us to decide until we get this transaction under our belt. But I would expect that we will not be breaking things out in that micro of a level going forward.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then on Texas City, how concerned are you that on the aromatics and I guess propylene component of the output of the refinery, that as you get more and more sort of cracking based off gas put into the Gulf Coast, I mean, should we be concerned about some margin impacts on that part of the barrel?
Gary R. Heminger: Well actually, if the ethylene crackers go to more of an ethane feedstock, their propylene yields decline considerably. So you look at the overall propylene balance as these crackers go to lighter and lighter feedstocks, the propylene market -- the propylene supply declines. So I think that the propylene market will be fine.
Operator: We have another follow-up question from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Your throughput guidance on Slide 14 is a bit higher. I mean, can you walk me through that? Are you guys running higher Garyville volumes in addition to Detroit coming back up? Or is there kind of something else driving that throughput guide there?
Gary R. Heminger: I guess, I don't think we're running any -- I mean, I'm not sure I can point to anything specific, Evan. I mean, Garyville is running very well, and I guess our view around fourth quarter is that all of our plants will be up and running, including Detroit. The other thing is that, as you remember, Robinson was in turnaround for part of July. And so I think it's really a combination of all those factors that's driving that. I'm not sure one individual facility is making the difference.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. That's great. Just a quick one on Detroit. I mean, is WCS a good market there for what you intend to run? And do you have capacity through Enbridge, Lakehead and I guess via that new line 79? Is that where you're sourcing heavies from?
C. Michael Palmer: Yes, that's primarily where the heavies will be sourced from, on the Enbridge line. And yes, we're in very good shape from a capacity standpoint, that shouldn't be a problem. And we'll have a basket of heavy crudes that actually come into Detroit. But WCS is the typical heavy marker.
Operator: The next question is a follow-up question from Chi Chow from Macquarie.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: Two quick follow-ups. On DHOUP, are there any product yield changes with the new coker coming on line? And secondly, can you give us any sort of guidance on upcoming turnarounds here in the fourth quarter into 2013?
Gary R. Heminger: The yields on Detroit, I think that we have slightly more gasoline and slightly more diesel because we're raising the crude rate, but proportions are pretty close to what they are right now. And Chi, you know that we'll stay with our plan of not giving forward guidance on turnarounds.
Garry L. Peiffer: And Chi, one additional thing I thought of after your question on diesel demand. As you probably recall, although you didn't experience maybe in Denver, the East Coast had unusually warm first quarter this first year. PADD I demand was down 13%. So we're not expecting a repeat of the demand we had in 2013 -- that we had in 2012. So that is really getting more back to normal winter weather would be also a big contributor to the increase in 2013.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: Okay. So better comps on heating oil in the northeast.
Garry L. Peiffer: Correct.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session for today's call. I will now turn the call back over to Pam Beall for closing remarks.

Operator: Welcome to the Marathon Petroleum Corporation's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Donna, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that the conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Pam Beall, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Beall, you may begin.
Pamela K. M. Beall: Thank you, Dawn. And welcome, everyone, to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's Second Quarter Conference Call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website, marathonpetroleum.com. On the call today are Gary Heminger, President and Chief Executive Officer; Garry Peiffer, Executive Vice President of Corporate Planning and Investor and Government Relations; Don Templin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Palmer, Senior Vice President of Supply, Distribution and Planning. Please read the Safe Harbor statement you'll find on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today, and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now I'll turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks. Gary?
Gary R. Heminger: Thank you, Pam, and good morning to everyone. The second quarter ended June 30 marked our 1-year anniversary as a standalone public company. During this first year, we have created significant value for our shareholders, and we continue to take steps to do so well into the future. We had a strong second quarter in both our R&M and Speedway segments. Don will review the results in more detail, but I want to say that the strong results are no coincidence. Our geographic footprint and the logistics assets that connect our operations give us unique and significant operational flexibility to capture value wherever it exists throughout the value chain such as allowing us to access -- allowing us access to price-advantage crude. In addition, our Gulf Coast presence gives us the ability to make fuel sales into higher-value export markets where our sales increased 110,000 barrels per day in the second quarter. And we believe these are enduring advantages. Since becoming a standalone company, our shareholder focus and perspective on capital allocation have been consistent. We will continue to carefully manage our projected capitalization and liquidity position to support our long-term strategic intent to maintain an investment grade credit profile and protect our business from volatility in the refining industry and the capital markets. We will also evaluate organic investment opportunities as well as selective acquisitions that complement our existing operations, leverage our knowledge of the markets in which we operate and provide appropriate returns, further enhancing the value proposition to our shareholders. We will continue to balance investments in our business with returning capital to shareholders. We are very pleased that, over the past 12 months, we have returned over $1 billion of capital to shareholders, which represented over 3/4 of our free cash flow. This was accomplished through a combination of a 25% increase to our base dividend last November and a share repurchase program announced in February. We recently completed an $850 million accelerated share repurchase program through which 20.4 million shares or 6% of our initial shares outstanding were acquired at a volume-weighted average price of $41.75 per share. This was the initial phase of our $2 billion share repurchase authorization, leaving us $1.15 billion available under our current authorization. Under this existing authorization, we expect to repurchase shares opportunistically in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions from time to time which are subject to market conditions, corporate, regulatory and other considerations. Part of our capital allocation strategy is to establish a growing base dividend that's sustainable for the economic cycles. We also believe our competitive position, the market dynamics and steps we are taking to further unlock shareholder value will allow us to generate significant free cash flow. It is for these reasons we recently announced another increase in the base dividend, this time by 40%. Based on yesterday's closing share price, our annualized cash dividend yield is approximately 3% and the total annualized capital return to shareholders is nearly 9%. On July 2, we took an important strategic step for MPC and its shareholders. We filed a registration statement in anticipation of our proposed initial public offering of common units of a master limited partnership for MPLX LP. MPLX LP was formed initially with a planned contribution of an interest in certain onshore common carrier pipeline assets located in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions of the U.S., along with a butane storage cavern near our Catlettsburg refinery. As our own subsidiary, MPLX LP was formed to be MPC's primary vehicle to own, operate, develop and acquire hydrocarbon-based pipelines and other midstream assets. Since the initial filing is preliminary and it has not been reviewed by the SEC, our remarks about the MLP on this call will be limited. One of the key elements of our capital allocation strategy is investing in the business through organic projects and acquisitions. Disciplined investments in the business over many years have positioned MPC with the ability to generate earnings and cash flow throughout economic cycles. We have a number of ongoing investments that provide visibility on continuing growth in earnings and cash flow. The most significant current capital project is the upgrade for our Detroit refinery which was approximately 96% complete as of June 30. This project remains on budget and on schedule, with the completion of the construction phase anticipated in the third quarter. Immediately following completion, a planned 70-day turnaround will enable us to tie in the new units, and we expect that the upgraded and expanded refinery to be online by year end. This investment is focused on enhancing margins by allowing us to process lower-cost crude stock and capturing value from crude oil differentials. We believe this project will enable us to process an incremental 80,000 barrels per day of heavy crude, including Canadian bitumen-type crudes. In addition, this project increases Detroit's crude oil refining capacity about 15% to 120,000 barrels per day. Based on the historical average, heavy Canadian crude differentials from 2006 to 2010 and the average for 2011, this upgrade could add $200 million to the $350 million of EBITDA per year. As we recently announced, we are celebrating the turnaround in our Robinson refinery from July to June, and this turnaround is now complete. One of the benefits of this acceleration was to increase the amount of time available before beginning our Detroit turnaround this fall. Our Speedway retail operations continued to deliver best-in-class results and national recognition. The 2012 Harris Poll EquiTrend survey has named Speedway the Highest Ranked Convenience Store Brand in the nation. Speedway has been honored as the category leader in the survey for the last 3 years. However, this year, the company has been named Convenience Store Brand of the Year. And this is particularly notable as Speedway operates in only 7 states. This is a business we -- in which we intend to invest and grow through acquisitions. Speedway acquired 87 GasAmerica locations in the second quarter and 10 Road Ranger store locations in mid-July. Both of these acquisitions are in Speedway's current markets and will leverage its support infrastructure as well as our field distribution logistics network. We believe global demand for gasoline and distillates will continue to provide an opportunity to sell products into higher-value export markets, including Europe and Latin and South America. The investments we are making should further increase our export capability for diesel and gasoline. As we look forward to the remainder of 2012 and beyond, we believe the U.S. refiners with access to attractively priced crude oil and natural gas will have competitive cost advantages in the global markets for some time to come. And now, I will turn the call over to Don Templin to provide a more detailed financial update on the quarter.
Donald C. Templin: Thanks, Gary. Slide 4 provides net income and adjusted net income data both on an absolute and per share basis. Our second quarter 2012 adjusted net income of $867 million reflects a 6% increase from the $819 million we earned in the second quarter of 2011. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $2.53 for the second quarter 2012 compared to $2.29 during the same period last year. The second quarter 2012 earnings included an $83 million pretax adjustment for cumulative pension settlement expenses resulting from the level of employee lump sum retirement distributions that occurred in 2012. The second quarter 2011 earnings included a $17 million adjustment for the unfavorable tax impact of certain income -- state income tax changes that were enacted in 2011. The waterfall chart on Slide 5 shows by segment the change in adjusted net income from the second quarter of 2011 to the second quarter of 2012. The primary drivers for the increase in our adjusted net income were the increases in income from our Refining & Marketing segment and from our Speedway segment, partially offset by higher interest and other corporate expenses. Before I move to a discussion of the results of our operating segments, I wanted to comment briefly on the change in interest and other expense. The $48 million quarter-over-quarter change in interest and other items primarily relates to the absence of related-party dividend income generated when we were part of Marathon Oil Corporation and higher corporate-related costs associated with being a standalone company. As shown on Slide 6, Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was $1.325 billion in the second quarter of 2012 compared with $1.26 billion in the second quarter of 2011. The change was the result of higher Refining & Marketing gross margin. In explaining the key components of the Refining & Marketing gross margin, I will refer to the changes in market indicators applied to MPC actual volumes to arrive at the quarter-over-quarter variances. First, the blended LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread was $2.93 per barrel higher in the second quarter of 2012 than the second quarter of 2011, resulting in an estimated favorable variance of $341 million. While the Chicago crack spread was $1.73 per barrel higher than the second quarter of 2011, the Gulf Coast crack spread was substantially higher, up $4.31 per barrel. The sweet/sour differential declined slightly from just over $11 per barrel in the second quarter of 2011 to $10.50 in the second quarter of 2012, resulting in an unfavorable variance of $30 million. WTI price-based crudes accounted for approximately 28% of the crude we processed during the 2012 second quarter, 2 percentage points higher than the second quarter of 2011. This increase in volume more than offset the lower per-barrel LLS-WTI differential and resulted in an estimated $6 million favorable gross margin variance between the 2 quarters. The first 3 market indicators I discussed are calculated by reference to an LLS prompt price. Rapid changes in crude prices can cause significant differences between the LLS prompt prices embedded in the market indicators and the actual amount we pay. On average, the delivered LLS crude cost was $4 per barrel higher than the prompt LLS price during the second quarter of 2012 when compared to the second quarter of 2011. This accounted for an estimated unfavorable variance of $79 million. Market structure also had a quarter-over-quarter effect on our gross margin. It was $0.33 per barrel less contained over the NYMEX WTI market structure in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the second quarter 2011 with an estimated unfavorable impact of $30 million. Direct operating costs had an unfavorable quarter-over-quarter effect of $43 million primarily due to higher turnaround costs in the second quarter of 2012 compared with the second quarter of 2011. The other gross margin column captures a number of other factors that need to be considered when reconciling the market-based metrics to the change in our gross margin. Such items include our actual realized prices, refinery yields and crudes slate variances compared to the market indicators. They also include other factors such as refinery volume metric gains, purchase for resale activity and primary transportation. On the next 2 slides, we provide earnings walks for each of our other operating segments. Turning to Slide 7. Speedway's income from operations was $107 million in the second quarter of 2012 compared with $80 million in the second quarter of 2011. Speedway's light product gross margin was about $15 million higher in the second quarter of 2012 compared with the second quarter of 2011. The increase was primarily due to a nearly 1.4 cents per gallon higher gross margin for the second quarter of 2012. Merchandise margin was $203 million in the second quarter of 2012 compared with $178 million during the same period last year. This $25 million increase was primarily due to margin expansion resulting from increasing merchandise and food sales. Same-store gasoline sales increased 2% and same-store merchandise sales also increased 2% in the second quarter 2012 compared with the 2011 second quarter. Slide 8 shows changes in our Pipeline Transportation segment income. Income from operations was $50 million in the second quarter of 2012 compared with $54 million in the second quarter of 2011. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in earnings from pipeline affiliates. Slide 9 presents the more significant drivers of changes in our cash flows for the second quarter of 2012. At June 30, 2012, our cash balance was just under $1.9 billion. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was a nearly $1.4 billion source of cash. The use of cash related to working capital of almost $1.1 billion is primarily due to an increase in inventory levels as well as the effect of lower crude prices on our payables and receivables. Inventory levels were higher in the second quarter due to seasonal crude inventory builds and additional product inventory due to the turnaround at our Robinson refinery. Capital expenditures and acquisitions during the quarter totaled $489 million primarily related to Speedway's acquisition of the GasAmerica locations and the continuing investment in our Detroit Heavy Oil Upgrade Project. Slide 10 provides some summary financial statistics. At the end of the second quarter, we had almost $1.9 billion of cash and approximately $3.3 billion of debt. With EBITDA of almost $4.8 billion during our first 12 months as a standalone company, we continue to be in a very manageable debt position with a leverage of 0.7x EBITDA and a debt-to-total capital ratio of 24%. On Slide 11, cash flows provided by operations is shown for the last 12 months. During MPC's first full year as a standalone company, we generated almost $3 billion in cash from operations and $1.5 billion of free cash flow. Consistent with our commitment to return capital to shareholders, we have distributed 76% of our free cash flow in the form of dividends and share repurchases during the past year. And we intend to be one of the leaders of our peer group in terms of total shareholder return going forward. Slide 12 provides outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the third quarter of 2012. For comparative purposes, those same metrics for the third quarter of 2011 are also shown. With respect to outlook information, I wanted to mention one other item. As you know, in May of this year, we entered into a settlement agreement with the buyers of our Minnesota assets to finalize a number of matters contained in the original sales agreement. That settlement agreement was contingent upon the buyers' completing a successful IPO. As a result of their recent IPO, we expect to record a gain in the third quarter of 2012. More information on this transaction can be found in our second quarter 10-Q to be filed next week. In addition to this outlook information, the July market data document will be published tomorrow on our investor website. Our mission continues to be value creation for our shareholders. We are committed to pursuing opportunities to create near- and long-term value. Examples of that commitment include the return of capital through 2 increases in our base dividend of the last 9 months and our share repurchase program. We will be balanced in our approach to capital allocation as we continue to assess the opportunities in front of them. Now I will turn the call back to Pam Beall.
Pamela K. M. Beall: [Operator Instructions] And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dawn to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Real quick, Don, can you give me, what is the working capital and the market value of inventory overall?
Donald C. Templin: Sure. Current assets were $10.7 billion, current liabilities were $7.6 billion for a working capital of $3.1 billion, and the excess of fair value of inventory was $5 billion.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And Don, and maybe this is the -- for Gary, and that -- you have a nice bump in your dividend just several weeks ago, but that absolute dividend payout comparing to your earning power, it seems like is still quite affordable. So question is that, with that in mind, is that -- with this increase that -- that means that the dividend in December we're not going to see, or is not being consider or for a potential increase? Or we should not read anything on that? And also from a cash flow standpoint, your second quarter, you have about $1.1 billion on the negative working capital usage of cash. Otherwise, that -- your cash is going to be, say, close to $3 billion. So is there any reason why that you didn't announce another share buyback or another actual program like what you did in the last quarter?
Donald C. Templin: Paul, I think you covered a number of subjects there about returning capital or repatriating capital to shareholders. I guess our commitment continues to be, to the extent that we have excess cash, we will return that to shareholders and we will look to the best form of doing that. We obviously did announce a dividend increase this quarter, and we will regularly review the dividend both with our board and with our management team. So I don't think you should read anything into a third quarter dividend. I mean, that's a quarterly evaluation that we do. With respect to share repurchase, we will continue to evaluate what the best opportunities are and what the best timing is for returning capital to shareholders, Paul, but I think our commitment remains steadfast in terms of returning excess cash.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I guess, looking at the filings, it may appear that you were interested in the Sunoco acquisition. Obviously, if I -- my math is correct, that's something like -- obviously a big transaction but something like 10x EBITDA. Could you maybe outline the levers which you think you would be able to use to create value from a large transaction of this type? And then I have a follow-on.
Garry L. Peiffer: Ed, this is Garry. [indiscernible], but obviously, we can't comment on what things we are or we are not looking at, but I think we've been pretty consistent in the past saying that, for us to pursue an acquisition, it would have to be some synergistic effect or leverage which we could have with our existing assets. So I think, from our perspective, when we look at any potential opportunity to enhance shareholder value, it's really driven by what we can leverage our existing assets and infrastructure to create more value which then allows us to be able to afford the price needed to pay the type of multiples that are being commanded, say, in the marketplace. So I think our consistent message is it's basically a synergistic effect with our existing asset base, is what we primarily focus on when we're looking at acquisitions or other investments in the business.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And in terms of the multiples, and maybe there are some synergies which lower those, but that presumably would mean that your own retail system probably is undervalued. You've seen the announcement this morning. Any thoughts about spinning out or crystallizing the value that you have in the retail business?
Garry L. Peiffer: I think -- this is Garry again, Ed. We're continuing to look at any way we can to increase value. I think what we've been also fairly consistent in saying, though, is we believe in the integrated approach to the downstream business. We happen to be at a point in the business cycle when refining is doing relatively well. That always isn't the case. And we like to have the advantage of having 2 or 3, in this case, 3 businesses -- the Pipeline Transportation, the Speedway and the R&M business -- to give us a very good complement of cash flows and assets to meet what our #1 objective is, and that is to have a investment-grade credit profile. So we're going to look at these things, we'll continue to look at these things. And I think, though, at the moment, our objective and our goal is still the integrated approach to how we run our business.
Operator: Our next question is from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank.
Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: If I could just follow up to Gary on the acquisition question. So you've been very consistent, firstly, in your message about what would interest you and, secondly, I guess, about the prioritization which has come through on this call of cash return to shareholders. I guess it's just notable that you've raised acquisitions on your opening slide, Gary, and I wondered if you could just talk a little bit more about why you did that. You said you're not interested in non-synergistic assets, which I think rules out Europe and I assume it rules out the West Coast. One obvious candidate which BP was talking about this morning is Texas City. Could you make any comments about, firstly, that specific asset and, secondly, what else comprises synergy? Because I'm aware that you're also referring to the potential for retail acquisitions.
Gary R. Heminger: Well, Paul, as we've always been consistent, when we look at our portfolio, acquisitions are a part of that portfolio, return of capital to shareholders is a part of that portfolio. And further as we look down, whether it's dividends, whether it's buying back shares, all those go into consideration. As we look at acquisitions and what we -- the result has been, we've made 2 -- in fact, 3 if we include the Gas City stores last summer, we've made 3 retail acquisitions. And we continue to look at those types of opportunities in the marketplace. So we just wanted to highlight that we look at everything that is available in the marketplace and we will continue to do that. But that is one of the possibilities that we have is to look at those acquisitions as we go forward. And then of course, I already outlined, and Don and I hope we're very clear in our message, that returning cash to -- or capital, I should say, not just cash but returning capital to the shareholders and exercising discipline in acquisitions will continue to be front and center.
Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Yes, I guess, with respect to this, that you've been through a major CapEx cycle that really isn't complete quite yet with Detroit but obviously with Garyville as well. And it would be -- I think it would be encouraging if the language on acquisitions was more -- less aggressive, if you like, than it seems to come across.
Gary R. Heminger: Well, that's fair enough, then. And I've stated several times on these calls that it is time to harvest on the acquisitions that we've made. I know that there was some conjecture at the time that we did Garyville and it has proven to be a very, very strong asset and cash flow provider. And we're just on the heels of -- to about complete Detroit and then we'll complete the turnaround and start it up late in this year. A $2.2 billion acquisition -- excuse me, $2.2 billion of capital expenditure that we've had on the books for some time, we don't believe that any of market has reflected the opportunity yet of that asset as it comes to market. So we would expect to see that as we finish up this year and get into early next year and have it fully operating. But I understand what you're saying, and we -- as I said, we will continue to exercise a very strong discipline around any CapEx.
Operator: Our next question comes from Arjun Murti from Goldman Sachs.
Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Gary, one of the questions out there is all these pipelines are taking the shale oil to the Gulf Coast area where, of course, most of the refiners are more medium sour or heavy coking. Can you talk about how you see that dynamic playing out? And maybe specific to your assets, is there a practical limit on how much light sweet you can run, or at the right discount, could Garyville, as an example, run all light sweet if you so chose to?
Gary R. Heminger: All right, Mike Palmer will handle that.
C. Michael Palmer: Sure, be happy to. We constantly get questions that ask about how much sweet crude we can actually run at a particular refinery around our system. And it's a difficult question to answer because it really depends on pricing. But the answer is that we can run a lot of sweet light crude. I think we've estimated that, in our whole system, as a real rough ballpark number, it's something around 75% that we can run is very light crude. But it really does depend upon the market circumstances because, if the advantage is with this light sweet crude, then we can make adjustments to the refineries. Our engineers can do that such that we could even run more. So there's just a lot of flexibility.
Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And is it your sense that your system is representative? Or you all have invested more over time to ensure you have this flexibility?
C. Michael Palmer: Well, no. And In fact, if you look at our -- especially at our Midwest system, I mean, we have been predominantly a light sweet refiner through time. Obviously, we've made a change to Detroit to give us the option of running heavy Canadian crude, which is the intent. But it's -- really, you have to think of it in terms of an option because if the light sweet crude is really the most attractive, that's what we'll run. And in fact, when you look at our operation right now at Garyville, we're running a lot more light sweet crude than we'd ever forecast in the past. So we have a lot of flexibility to go where we can earn the best margin.
Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: That's terrific. And just to follow up on the retail spinoff question. Again, I don't mean to make you repeat yourself, but when we looked at Marathon over a long period of time, it seems like you have generated very good returns on capital by being integrated, whether it's the pipelines into the refineries and the gas stations, and that business model has served you well for a long period of time. I think you more or less were concurring with that type of sentiment, but just wanted to clarify that.
Garry L. Peiffer: This is Garry again. Yes, no, that's exactly right. And it's not to say that things don't change, either. I think we're continuously looking at the marketplace, looking at what makes the most sense from a optimization of operation standpoint. And as we said, when we talked about MLPs in the past, never say never, so -- but at the moment, we think the present configuration that we have of Refining & Marketing and pipelines is the best for us given our objectives in terms of shareholder -- creating shareholder value.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chi Chow from Macquarie Capital.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: I'd like to get your thoughts near term on the possible waiver of the RFS mandate for ethanol given the recent request from the livestock producers. Is that something you think will come through? What's the probability of that?
Garry L. Peiffer: Mike?
C. Michael Palmer: Yes. I guess, to be honest, our thought with that is that the -- we understand that the -- what the situation is with the expensive corn right now. And there are some ethanol plants that certainly have closed down. But honestly, I guess our thought is that it's very difficult to understand what the government might do with regard to any waiver on ethanol. And in fact, the EPA has stated that they're not interested in considering an RFS waiver. So I guess that would be our thought.
Chi Chow - Macquarie Research: And then, Don, maybe a couple of cash flow questions. What's the remaining CapEx on DHOUP at the end of the second quarter? And then do you expect additional builds in inventories in the third quarter for the DHOUP turnaround? Is that going to cause ongoing pull [ph] on working capital that's going to impact cash here in the third quarter?
Donald C. Templin: On the first question, Chi, $200 million is the remaining expenditures on DHOUP. And, I guess, with respect to working capital, but there's a lot of moving pieces around working capital. Yes, we will build some working capital related to DHOUP, but when Robinson came back online, that will have a positive effect in terms of reducing our working capital.
Operator: Our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Everybody, I appreciate the comments on cash returns and I applaud the selective buyback approach similar to HFC and OXY. And I also thought the approach for Sun [ph] looked smart relating to an MLP uplift potential. And then my question, my first question, really, is a follow-up on the dividend discussion. I mean, how do you analyze your maximum dividend commitment for dividend that you'd obviously rather never cut? I mean, do you run varied case margin scenarios, say, 2009 crack plus some more nominal crude spread through your current system that defines how high you could go on a longer-term supportable dividend? Or how do you analyze that level?
Garry L. Peiffer: Yes, Evan, this is Garry Peiffer. That's -- obviously, trying to forecast this business is a difficult process. And I'm not even sure -- if you look back to 2009, as a most recent example, it was a tough year for all refiners. So I think what we've obviously did last week in increasing our dividend to $0.35 a quarter, demonstrates, at least our opinion, that, through those cycles, that we think we can afford to continue that type of dividend pay to shareholders. So I don't think we can get -- we try to run all kind of models to estimate what is -- from a cash requirement standpoint, what is our minimum cash requirements. But I think that the 40% increase in regular dividend we announced last week is our demonstration of our belief that we can sustain that through the cycles. And as -- 2009 did not include Garyville, the impact of the benefit we've been able to enjoy from the Garyville expansion. And hopefully going forward, we'll have the benefit of DHOUP contributing substantially to our cash flows in the future as well. So those things all add on top of our confidence and why we did what we did last week in terms of increasing our dividend.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Great, that's helpful. Can you also provide an update on Utica crude runs, status of your infrastructure developments there? And really, I guess, whether you're -- I guess, you're blending the condensate there. And maybe kind of related to Arjun's question, what sort of theoretic run max, at least in the Ohio refineries, the 2 refineries based upon yield in Utica configuration?
Gary R. Heminger: Mike?
C. Michael Palmer: The Utica has probably progressed a little slower than some of the original production forecast would've led people to believe. But there's a lot of activity that's going on right now in terms of new permits and rigs that are running. We continue to process on the order of about 1,500 barrels a day of a mix of crude and condensate. We do expect that that will start to ramp up in the second half of the year, and then in '13 and '14, it'll start to ramp up even more. And we can, again, run a lot of this crude and condensate within our plants in the Midwest. We have the permanent truck rack that is now complete at Canton. It has a capacity of 12,000 barrels a day right now. We've got a truck rack at Catlettsburg and it's got a capacity, I think, of about 18,000 barrels a day. We have opportunities to expand those. We're working on a truck-to-barge operation that we've talked to you guys about before. And I guess I would make the same comment with regard to the volume that we can actually refine that I did before. We have a lot of flexibility in these plants to run both the condensate and the crude oil, again depending upon -- on how it's priced. So it's going to be quite some time before the Utica production actually catches up to a point where we're going to have difficulty running it in the plants.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Terreson from ISI Group.
Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Most of my questions were answered, and I apologize if I missed this, but I just wanted to get the update on when the Detroit turnaround began and also how long you expect that to last in the second half.
Garry L. Peiffer: Yes, Doug, this is Garry Peiffer. We're expecting the turnaround to start shortly after Labor Day. And we would expect it to last about 70 days, so that puts you into early November 'til it'd be complete. So that's the present plan. Now I think, for modeling purposes, we've been pretty consistent all along that we wouldn't expect to see any contribution -- or any major contribution to our bottom line 'til next year from a cash or earnings standpoint. So the goal is to get everything online by the end of the year and operational, up in a safe and efficient manner.
Operator: Our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Quick question I guess I had, kind of following on with the questions on the light sweet crude. As you ramp up the volumes of light sweet, or if you're able to ramp up the volumes of light sweet, what are -- how should we think about the impact on volumes? I mean, generally, I would expect they'd come in a little bit. Is that the right way to think about it? Is there any sort of rule of thumb we can use?
Gary R. Heminger: Mike?
Garry L. Peiffer: So this is Garry here. I guess -- unless we get to the beyond 75% range that Mike referred to, I guess we wouldn't expect to see any major impact on total volumes. Now if the price became so attractive that all of Garyville's throughputs were light sweet crude, then there would be an impact on probably what we would be able to run in total. But that's going to be a long way down the road, I think, because we would try to balance the slate with heavy crudes as well as the light crudes such that we would hopefully have a fairly minimal impact on total inputs and outputs. But to have any input, there's got to be a lot of light sweet crude before we'd have any total output impact.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And then the only other question I had, on the export side. If I heard correctly, I think you said it was up 110,000 barrels a day, Q2.
Garry L. Peiffer: It was up to 110,000 barrels a day in Q2.
Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Where do you think that can go over the next several years? Or what's your goal on that front?
Garry L. Peiffer: Well, that is pretty much stretching the system. All the stars were aligned for us to be able to do that in the second quarter. I think, our previous best month -- or quarter, excuse me, quarter, was somewhere in the 80,000 barrel a day range. So we're making investments now at Garyville that will probably not increase the total throughput capacity much beyond that 110,000 barrel a day range but will allow us additional tankage such that we can sell different products, principally gasoline. So we're making investments at Garyville to allow us to sell additional products, but probably the total isn't going to change much, at least in the near term.
Operator: Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.
Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: A couple of questions for you. One, I wanted to go back on the buybacks. If I recall, when the program was originally authorized, it was $2 billion over a 2-year period. Obviously, you've exhausted the accelerated portion, but I'm just trying to understand the mindset on the balance, the $1.15 billion. If things were to stay where they are today, should we assume that you'd plan to fully execute that $2 billion over the next 1.5 years?
Donald C. Templin: I think, Blake, what -- this is Don. I think what we have said and we as a management team and board believe is that, to the extent that we have excess cash, we want to return it to, and we expect to return it to, our shareholders in one form or another. We will make evaluations around our current authorization and we have discussions regularly with our board about that. So it's hard to know what the cash position will be and forecast it out every quarter out for the next 1.5 years. But I think our track record over the last year, 12 months, has demonstrated that, to the extent there is excess cash, we will look for ways to repatriate it back to our shareholders.
Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division: Don, the second one, for you. This may be premature, but I was just hoping for CapEx potentially into '13. Any broad strokes on where you see that shaking out compared to this year?
Donald C. Templin: We have not provided that information, Blake. But I guess, in terms of thinking about capital expenditures, we've consistently said that our maintenance CapEx is somewhere in the $600 million to $800 million range per year. And that is really focused on maintaining our assets at their current cash-generation capabilities. So that would be -- in a Speedway example, that would include rebuilds and remodels. We've also said that, at any point in time, we have probably a portfolio of projects in the $200 million to $500 million range that we believe are easy to implement. They're under our control, they have high rates of return. And if you think about even sort of our profile in 2012, how we spend capital, our capital expenditure budget was $1.4 billion and that included roughly $350 million for DHOUP, so the remainder really fit nicely in the -- kind of that range, $600 million to $800 million for maintenance CapEx, $200 million to $500 million for growth projects.
Operator: Our next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: On the 110,000 barrels a day of exports, which I believe is an uptick from the first quarter, what kind of pricing uplift do you get on that -- on those products vis-à-vis what we see in the Gulf Coast? And then I have a follow-up on crude oil.
Garry L. Peiffer: This is Garry Peiffer. We don't really want to disclose what type of uptick we get. But we do obviously get a better price than we would otherwise get, and our next best alternative is in the spot market. So we're able to achieve returns better than the smart -- spot market values, net of all the other considerations we have to go to through, whether it be time, value or money and what-have-you. So it is a benefit to running an overall alternative to the spot market.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then on the crude oil side, can you give us an idea of how much WCS you ran across your entire system? And there were some reports that Canadian bitumen was being railed down to the Gulf Coast, and if that's something you'd be running through your system, too?
Garry L. Peiffer: We -- Mike Palmer can confirm this. We don't -- we haven't railed any Canadian bitumen. We have been running somewhere around 50,000 barrels a day from the Patoka, north of St. Louis area down to Garyville. So our major Gulf Coast WCS is that 50,000 barrels a day or so of WCS we put on the barge and shipped from Patoka to Garyville.
Operator: Our next question comes from Cory Garcia from Raymond James.
Cory J. Garcia - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: I apologize if I missed this earlier. But clearly, your same-store sales in your Speedway system is improving [ph] pretty strong, I think, up 2%, you guys, in the prior quarter. Just wondering what it looked like through July, particularly in light of the recent run-up in prices? I think that the DOE data is showing down just slightly, so I'm wondering if you guys could reconcile that for me.
Gary R. Heminger: Well, in fact -- this is Gary. Cory, July has been a little soft because of the run-up in price and we have seen demand fall a little bit here in July. But again, we're comparing against one of the difficult things when you're looking at same-store sales, I guess, same month last year. This year, Fourth of July was midweek. Last year, it attached to a weekend. So July was much better for that point last year. And this year, the extreme hot weather, we think, has curtailed some driving as well. So on a same-store basis, it's more difficult to be able to put in some of those concerns. But I would say it's a little bit of soft this year as we start July than we saw in June.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons & Company.
Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: My question is related to Detroit. I expected to see maybe a tick-up in turnaround expenses in the third quarter when we got a quick look at the guidance slide, but it didn't appear to be there. Is that mainly going to fall in the fourth quarter as far as the increase in turnaround cost?
Donald C. Templin: Jeff, we'll have turnaround costs in both third quarter and fourth quarter. And the guidance information that we did provide, the outlook information, includes the costs related to the Detroit turnaround that will be incurred in the third quarter. So the $1.15 that we have in our outlook information includes that. If you look at the comparative period last year, it was only $0.36, so there's some heavy activity in this third quarter.
Operator: We have a follow-up from Paul Cheng from Barclays.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Actually, 2 quick ones. One, there's a interesting one, one of your old refinery now that is a MLP. Have you guys looked at that and think whether that this is something you could be interested?
Garry L. Peiffer: Yes, Paul, this is Garry Peiffer. I think, as you know, we try to keep our eye on what's ever new and different going on out there, but I guess our focus at the moment obviously is MPLX and what we can do there to increase shareholder value. But we look at everything and we're -- but at the moment, though, we're focused on MPLX.
Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I understand that, Garry. And I guess my question is more that, fundamentally, do you guys object to have your refinery to be in an MLP and you are concerned losing control or that after your study in the MLP for the pipeline that you don't really have that fundamental concern?
Garry L. Peiffer: Well, I think this is a fairly new idea or a fairly new mode they're going about to create an MLP. So I think we just have to understand what it means not only in maybe the good part of the cycle but also what it could mean in the bad part of the cycle. So we -- it's fairly new. We're starting it and we're watching it closely. So I think we -- at this point, we're just trying to understand the benefits of any type of opportunity to increase shareholder value.
Operator: We have a follow-up question from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank.
Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Guys, I just wanted to ask you about product trade and the dynamics that we're seeing there. Is there any kind of a shift going on between who's buying all the products? Can you just remind us how much you're exporting and where the major destinations are?
C. Michael Palmer: Yes, Paul. This is Mike Palmer. A lot of what we export out of Garyville, we sell FOB Garyville. So there's a lot of the cargoes that we can't be certain where they go. I mean, it is a mix between South America, Latin America and Europe, and it changes from time to time depending upon what the arbitrages look like.
Operator: We have a follow-up from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.
Edward Westlake - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I was -- I apologize for traveling last call [ph], so I'll ask another question. Just on the MLP, obviously, you've disclosed EBITDA, sorry, and the assets for MPLX, so I won't ask about that. But you've obviously got a massive chunk of assets still within the MPC umbrella. If I look at those assets, I mean, is it fair to say that we can just gross up sort of EBITDA in terms of the capacity? Or are there some other things that we should be thinking about when we're trying to forecast the EBITDA for your overall logistics footprint?
Garry L. Peiffer: I think -- this is Garry Peiffer, Ed. I think we're obviously into the quiet period with our S-1 here so we really can't comment on what is the remainder of the assets. We gave a high-level summary of our MPC assets in the S-1, and to this point, that's really all we can go, we can really talk about regarding the other assets that we have that are qualified for an MLP.
Operator: Our last question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.
Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just a follow-up on the same-store gasoline sales volumes being up 2% -- or 2.1% in the quarter. Can you go -- can you elaborate a little bit more what drove that, you think, in the quarter? Because the economy was still kind of sluggish and so seeing the 2% sort of same-store sales growth seems a little bit less intuitive given what we saw in the economy in the second quarter.
Gary R. Heminger: Well, in our market, Faisel, what we've continued to see is some increases. I believe the -- early in the second quarter, the weather was very, very positive in PADD II, and our same store is really around Speedway and as well PADD II. So the weather was generally very good. Early part of the second quarter that helped us, as I said. As we got into late June and early July, the weather seemed to be a bit of a detriment. But -- and prices came down in the second quarter in a couple of different time frames. So therefore, you didn't have to push the increased crude oil price. You didn't have to push it back into the marketplace as much as we've seen early here in the third quarter. But I would say those would be the -- probably the key themes. Again, very difficult to be able to chart each component and what happens in markets and what happens in regions and markets on a same-store basis.
Operator: Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Gary Heminger for final remarks.
Gary R. Heminger: Well, thank you, Dawn. And as we complete today, I just wanted to emphasize one more time that all the questions that pertain to our capital allocation, how we may or may not repatriate capital, what our investment posture might be, we will continue to be very disciplined as we consider those opportunities going forward. And I think, as Don and Garry and I alluded in many of our questions -- or answers to questions here, capital repatriation and having the confidence to continue such repatriation in the future is first and foremost in our mind. So I thank you, Dawn, for your help today. And thanks, everyone on the call.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-05-01 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Marathon Petroleum Corporation's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Christine, and I will be your operator for today's conference. [Operator Instructions] Please note today's conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Pam Beall. You may begin. 
Pamela Beall: Thank you, Christine. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. The synchronized slides that accompany this call can be found on our website, marathonpetroleum.com. On the call today are Gary Heminger, President and CEO; Garry Peiffer, Executive Vice President of Corporate Planning and Investor and Government Relations; Don Templin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Palmer, Senior Vice President of Supply, Distribution and Planning.
 Please read the Safe Harbor Statement on Slide 2. It's a reminder that we will be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and during the question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what we expect today and factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here, as well as in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I'll turn the call over to Gary Heminger for opening remarks. Gary? 
Gary Heminger: Thanks, Pam, and good morning to everyone. We had a strong first quarter with $596 million of net income representing a 13% increase over the same quarter last year. Our strong results are primarily due to the improvement in the U.S. Gulf Coast crack spread and our ability to capture value using our extensive logistics assets. Our team executed on our capabilities to increase our throughput of WTI priced crudes, which represented 30% of the crude we refined during the first quarter of 2012, up from 25% in the same quarter of 2011. We are delivering on our commitment to return capital to shareholders through an $850 million accelerated share repurchase program as part of the $2 billion authorization we received earlier this year from our Board of Directors. We have already received the majority of the shares, and we expect to receive the remaining shares over the coming months. 
 Our mission continues to be value creation for our investors incorporating a balance between internal and external investment and a return of capital to shareholders. Our cash balance at quarter end was just over $2.2 billion, supported by strong earnings but down from year end 2011, primarily due to our share repurchase program. In total, we have spent about $950 million on our accelerated share repurchase program and dividends during the first quarter of 2012. Our strong financial position is also reflected in our debt-to-capital ratio of 26%. 
 Upgrades to our Detroit refinery as part of the DHOUP project were approximately 92% complete as of March 31, 2012, and remain on budget and on schedule for completion in the third quarter of this year. Immediately following, there will be a 70-day turnaround to tie in the new units, and we expect the upgraded and expanded refinery to be online by year end. When completed, these upgrades should allow us to lower feedstock cost and capture value from crude oil differentials. We will be able to process an incremental 80,000 barrels per day of heavy Canadian crude and increase Detroit's crude oil refining capacity about 15% to 120,000 barrels per day. 
 We are also moving decisively to position MPC to be able to transport and process the new Utica Shale crude oil and condensate coming online in Eastern Ohio. Initially, the volumes from Utica are being processed at our Canton refinery and as production increases, our Catlettsburg refinery. Our project to construct a permanent truck and loading facility at our Canton refinery will be in service this summer. In addition, we are expanding our transport operations to include crude oil trucking and a truck-to-barge offloading facility. We believe that we can run about 20,000 to 30,000 barrels per day of Utica condensate at our Canton and Catlettsburg refineries with minimal capital improvements. In addition, depending on the quality of Utica crude ultimately produced, we could run an excess of 50% of our crude capacity with Utica crude at our 78,000-barrel per day refinery in Canton and the 233,000-barrel per day plant in Catlettsburg. Our refining engineers continue to study what improvements we can make to increase the amount of Utica crude we can economically refine at those 2 refineries, as well as our nearly 210,000-barrel per day refinery in Robinson, Illinois. 
 Despite challenging market conditions, Speedway also had a strong quarter supported by light product volume and merchandise sales growth. As we have stated often in the past, one of our goals is to increase assured light product sales by expanding our retail -- our Speedway retail operations in an existing and contiguous markets. Speedway's previously announced acquisition of 88 GasAmerica stores along major transportation corridors in Ohio and Indiana will complement its existing 7-state asset base. We anticipate this transaction will be finalized by the end of the second quarter.
 In a separate announcement earlier today, we reported that our Board of Directors authorized and directed our evaluation team to further explore the formation and initial public offering of a master limited partnership and to prepare a registration statement. If we determine to further pursue an initial public offering of an MLP, the issuer would be a wholly-owned subsidiary MPLX LP. We will contribute a portion of our midstream assets to the MLP and sell a minority interest in the MLP in an initial public offering. Potential MLP would support our strategy to grow our midstream business, initially through a contribution of an interest in certain onshore common carrier pipeline assets located in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions of the U.S. 
 We will share more information with you as our plans develop to the extent we are permitted by federal securities laws. However, to avail of sales -- ourselves of Safe Harbor Provisions of such laws, we are not in a position to provide additional information or answer questions on our midstream evaluation initiative. As we look forward to the remainder of 2012 and beyond, I want to briefly discuss our view on macro trends that will have an impact on the refining industry.
 First of all, North American crude oil production continues to outpace the capacity of existing logistical assets to officially move the crude oil to refining markets. While we expect that the logistical assets will eventually be built to close this gap, we continue to believe that select crude oil differentials will be wider for longer than most market observers are expecting. While some changes will occur this year, there is still an abundance of Mid-Continent, Canadian and Permian crudes vying for pipeline space. In addition, the new Utica production is just starting and appears promising for Midwest refiners. The volatile crude oil differentials associated with domestic and Canadian crudes will present opportunities in the market for flexible refiners to capture discounted crude oil. With volatile crude oil spreads, logistics flexibility continues to be one of the keys to long-term success in this business. We believe price advantaged crude and feedstocks along with an abundance of natural gas as a cost-efficient energy source will provide cost advantages for U.S. refiners for some time to come. We estimate that U.S. gasoline demand was down about 1.7% and distillate demand was down approximately 3% in the first quarter of 2012 compared to a year ago. However, Speedway's April month-to-date same-store sales are up approximately 3.7%, which puts our same-store sales about flat year-to-date. Therefore, we expect U.S. gasoline demand to improve throughout 2012 and expect total year 2012 demand to be down less than 1%. Total year distillate demand is expected to improve as well, and we expect it to grow about 0.5% in 2012. We believe that global demand for gasoline and distillates will continue to provide an opportunity to sell products into higher value export markets, including Europe and Latin and South America. We exported 81,000 barrels per day of distillate, primarily from our Garyville refinery during the first quarter of 2012, compared to 66,000 barrels per day in the same quarter last year. We expect to continue playing a significant role in the export markets. We are making investments that will increase our export capability from diesel and gasoline and that will increase diesel production. Now I will turn the call over to Don Templin to provide a more detailed financial update on the first quarter. Don? 
Donald Templin: Thanks, Gary. Slide 4 provides net income both on an absolute and per-share basis. Our first quarter 2012 net income of $596 million reflects a $67 million increase from the $529 million we earned in the first quarter of 2011. Earnings per diluted share was $1.70 for the first quarter 2012 compared to $1.48 during the same period last year. I should note that as a result of the accelerated share repurchase program that we initiated in early February, the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding during the 2012 first quarter was $350 million compared to $358 million used in the first quarter of 2011 calculation. At the end of the quarter, there were just over 340 million common shares outstanding. The waterfall chart on Slide 5 shows by segment the change in net income from the first quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2012. The primary driver for the increase in our net income was the increase in refining and marketing segment income, partially offset by higher interest and other corporate expenses and by higher income taxes. Before I move to a discussion of the results of our operating segments, I wanted to comment briefly on the change in interest and other expense and the change in income taxes. The $37 million quarter-over-quarter change in interest and other items primarily relates to the interest expense on our $3 billion in senior notes, the absence of related party interest and the costs associated with being a stand-alone company. The increase in income tax expense is a function of our higher earnings during the 2012 first quarter. 
 Most of the slides I'm using today compare first quarter 2012 to first quarter 2011. Given the volatility in commodity prices, I thought it would be also useful to show certain first quarter 2012 information on an absolute dollar basis as well.
 Slide 6 shows the primary components that contribute to our refining and marketing gross margin. Using market indicators and our actual volumes, you can see that the crack spread and sweet/sour differential continue to be significant drivers to our income. Our ability to utilize the flexibility in our logistics assets also allowed us to capture value in the discounted domestic crude market. 
 As shown on Slide 7, Refining and Marketing segment income from operations was $943 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared with $802 million in the first quarter of 2011. The change was primarily the result of a higher Refining and Marketing gross margin. We are continuing to use the expanded market indicators provided on our last conference call to explain our change in our Refining and Marketing gross margin this quarter. Where applicable, the changes in market indicators have been applied to MPC actual volumes to arrive at the quarter-over-quarter variances. First, the blended 6-3-2-1 crack spread was $1.98 per barrel higher in the first quarter 2012 than the first quarter 2011, resulting in an estimated favorable variance of $239 million. Although the Chicago crack spread was relatively unchanged from 2011, the Gulf Coast crack spread was substantially higher in 2012 than it was last year. 
 While the sweet/sour differential improved from $12.40 per barrel in the first quarter of 2011 to $13.70 per barrel in the first quarter 2012, we processed less sour crude during the first quarter of 2012. As a result, the estimated quarter-over-quarter variance was down $12 million. WTI-based crudes accounted for approximately 30% of the crude we processed during the 2012 first quarter, 5 percentage points higher than the first quarter of 2011. This increase in volume and an LLS WTI differential that was $3.57 per barrel higher resulted in estimated $198 million favorable gross margin variance between the 2 quarters. 
 The first 3 market indicators I discussed are calculated by reference to an LLS prompt price. Rapid changes in crude prices can cause significant differences between the LLS prompt prices embedded in the market indicators and the actual amount we pay. On average, the delivered LLS crude cost was $0.50 lower than the prompt LLS price during the first quarter of 2012 when compared to the first quarter of 2011. This accounted for an estimated favorable variance of $24 million. Market structure had a significant quarter-over-quarter effect on our gross margin. There was $1.44 per barrel less contango in the NYMEX WTI market structure in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter 2011. With an estimated unfavorable impact of $115 million. The other gross margin column captures a number of factors that need to be considered when reconciling the market-based metrics to the change in our gross margin. Such items include our actual realized prices, refinery yields, other feedstock cost and crudes slate variances compared to the market indicators. They also include refinery volumetric gains, purchase for resale activity and primary transportation.
 On the next 2 slides, we provide earnings walks for each of the other operating segments. On Slide 8, Speedway's income from operations was $50 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared with $33 million in the first quarter of 2011. Total light product and merchandise margin increased $25 million quarter-over-quarter. This was primarily due to margin expansion resulting from increasing merchandise and food sale systemwide. It also reflects the impact of the May 2011 acquisition of 23 Gas City stores in the Chicago land area.
 Slide 9 shows changes in our Pipeline Transportation segment income. Income from operations was $42 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared with $51 million in the first quarter of 2011. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in earnings from pipeline affiliates.
 Slide 10 presents the more significant drivers of changes in our cash flows for the first quarter of 2012. At March 31, 2012, our cash balance was just over $2.2 billion. Operating cash flow before changes in working capital was a $1.1 billion source of cash. The working capital use of cash of $761 million noted on the slide is primarily due to higher accounts receivable caused by increases at our refined product prices, as well as lower crude oil payable volumes from changes in crude supply. Capital expenditures and investments during the quarter were $316 million, primarily related to the continuing investment in our Detroit Heavy Oil Upgrade Project. As we announced earlier this year, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to $2 billion of our stock over the next 2 years. We executed on that authorization by initiating an $850 million accelerated share repurchase program in early February. As Gary alluded to earlier, this program will be complete in the coming months and we have already received the majority of the shares under the program.
 Slide 11 provides some summary financial statistics. At the end of the first quarter, we had just over $2.2 billion of cash and approximately $3.3 billion of debt. With EBITDA of almost $4.8 billion during the last 12 months, we continue to be in a very manageable debt position with a leverage of 0.7x EBITDA and a debt-to-total capital ratio of 26%. Cash flow continues to be strong as well with $347 million of cash from operations, net of the working capital used I referred to earlier.
 Slide 12 provides outlook information on key operating metrics for MPC for the second quarter of 2012. For comparative purposes, those same metrics for the second quarter of 2011 are also shown. The April market data document will be published tomorrow on our investor website as well. As you know, we use derivative instruments to float the price of our foreign crude purchases to a date that is closer to the time those crudes are processed at our refineries. We have begun to hedge our foreign cargo purchases using Brent-based derivative contracts instead of WTI-based contracts. Our mission continues to be value creation for our shareholders. We are committed to pursuing opportunities to create near and long-term value. Examples include the return of capital through our share repurchase program and the evaluation of strategic alternatives for our midstream assets. We will be balanced in our approach to capital allocation as we continue to assess the opportunities in front of us. Now I will turn the call back to Pam Beall. 
Pamela Beall: As we open the call for your questions, we ask that you limit yourself to one question plus a follow-up and then of course, you can prompt again for additional questions as time permits. So with that, I'd like to now open the call to questions. Christine? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank. 
Paul Sankey: Firstly, just sequentially, could you give me an idea -- it was notable that you had a tough quarter in Q4 and this is obviously a good beat of expectations. Could you give us a sense for the impact in the way that you presented on Slide 6 of some of the differential moves, particularly the sweet/sour and the WTI LLS? And also, I'm wondering about market structure because I guess we've got a little bit of kind of a double curve at the moment with a bit of contango and a bit of backwardation. 
Donald Templin: Paul, this is Don, if you wait one second here. 
Paul Sankey: Okay. I'll flip in the follow-up if you want but Gary, could you talk a bit about export potential and if we could to go back obviously to my recent question, but the other question I had was just about export potential, how big you think the market for distillate exports can be. That's my two. 
Gary Heminger: That's tough to determine how big that actually can go because it all depends on the refining slate in Europe and how refineries run in South and Latin America, but our indicators suggest that the market continues to be very strong for exports and the way that we put out the different cargoes for sale, we're continuing to get a strong response on those cargoes. So it looks like, Paul, it should continue to be strong for the, we think, into the distant future. The other thing is there's a tremendous amount of building and expansion going on in Brazil and some surrounding countries, which is helping as well. 
Paul Sankey: Gary, can you just talk a little bit of more about the destinations of your exports? I get the point on the refining performance, but I guess most of your stuff is going to Latin American growth, is that correct? 
Gary Heminger: Well, as we've said and Mike Palmer is here. Mike, why don't you -- Mike handles all of our supply business so I'll let Mike go into the detail. 
C. Palmer: Yes, Paul. I guess what I would say is that we continue to have a very robust market for distillate exports and frankly, it still continues to be both Europe as well as Latin and South America. 
Paul Sankey: Okay. Is there a sense of the mix or is it just, shall I call it 50-50? 
C. Palmer: Yes, I think you could probably call it 50-50 today. 
Paul Sankey: Great. And then, just to remind you my first question was, sorry to put you on the spot here, but it was really Slide 6 ... 
Gary Heminger: Yes, I think Don has it for you now. 
Donald Templin: Sure, Paul. The LLS crack spread in the fourth quarter of 2011 was -- the total was $135 million versus the $323 million. The sweet/sour differential was $53 million. The LLS prompt versus WTI prompt was $461 million. The LLS prompt versus delivered was a negative $179 million. Market structure was $15 million and then the direct operating costs were a negative $689 million. 
Paul Sankey: Is that the indicative gross margin change sequentially? 
Donald Templin: Those were the absolute dollars. 
Paul Sankey: Okay. So that's the equivalent to Slide 6 or 7? 
Donald Templin: That was equivalent to Slide 6. 
Paul Sankey: Okay. That's helpful. Great. You don't have it for Slide 7 I guess, do you? 
Donald Templin: I don't right now. 
Operator: The next question comes from Doug Terreson from ISI Group. 
Douglas Terreson: Gary, in the pipeline business I think you guys have a pretty meaningful interest in the Capline, which I think operated a pretty low utilization until recently and either way, I want to see if we could get an update on the status of that pipeline and while I realize, partner consent may be required, whether or not you guys are thinking about any possibility plans because it seems like it could be a significant earnings opportunity for Marathon Petroleum. So could you just spend a minute on that, please? 
Gary Heminger: Well in fact, let me have Mike Palmer talk about -- you're absolutely right, Doug, we do have a little over 30% ownership in Capline. It's a very big artery to be able to move many crudes from the South to North and -- but let me have Mike Palmer go into that for more detail. Mike? 
C. Palmer: Yes, it's actually difficult to say a lot. At this point in time that we certainly are well aware of Capline and the low utilization, and there's been a lot of talk about reversing Capline. And certainly, we're well aware of the issues that are associated with that. It's complicated, not only from a partner standpoint but just from the use of the pipeline itself. So we are evaluating it now. We are looking at alternatives to that asset as well as other assets, but there's really not a lot more that we can say at this point in time. 
Operator: The next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays. 
Paul Cheng: Can I have a number of quick balance sheet item, Don? What is the market value of your inventory of [indiscernible] and the long-term debt? And also that if you can tell us -- you're saying that you start  moving into the brand hedging. In the second quarter, should we assume that you're pretty much using the brand hedging or that just you just halfway through? If you can give us some estimate of what is the exposure as well as what is your WTI link total exposure at this point? 
Donald Templin: Okay. Paul, hopefully, I got most of those questions. I think the first one was on the inventory question. Inventory was $6.8 billion above our reported cost. 
Paul Cheng: $6.8? 
Donald Templin: $6.8 billion. 
Paul Cheng: Okay. And that the long-term debt out of the total debt component? 
Donald Templin: Long-term debt is almost all of the debt, $3.3 billion. We have very little short-term debt. 
Paul Cheng: Okay. All right. How about on the hedging on that you're moving into plan, are we pretty much all out from WTI or that you're just in the process? 
Donald Templin: For purposes of our cargo hedges, so the foreign crude purchases we are using Brent derivatives to float that price. 
Paul Cheng: So in the second quarter, you have the Brent WTI differential swing. We should not assume that you will have any meaningful impact in your hedging? 
Donald Templin: On cargoes, that's correct. 
Paul Cheng: Okay. And then how about the WTI link exposure? I mean I think last quarter you're excluding WC as it was the 28%. What is that at this point? 
Gary Heminger: This is Gary, Paul. We're giving guidance for the second quarter that our WTI will be about 27%, I believe it is. 
Paul Cheng: 27%? 
Gary Heminger: I think, I'll hold on to one of the slides here. We got it. Yes. 27% is what the expected WTI price crude runs will average in the second quarter. 
Paul Cheng: Gary, can you remind me what is the first quarter level? 
Gary Heminger: First quarter of this year was right about 30%.  We had much lower crude throughputs this quarter, they'll be increasing in the second quarter as such it will be about -- the volume is about the same but the percentage is going down to 27%. 
Paul Cheng: Is there any reason why it's going down? 
Gary Heminger: Just the higher -- the absolute total, the total barrels of crude we're running is higher but the volume of WTI link is about the same. 
Paul Cheng: So the increase of your crude run down in the Gulf Coast, is that the reason? 
Gary Heminger: All over. 
Donald Templin: We had turnarounds in the first quarter and for whatever reasons, Paul, we just had lower throughputs. 
Gary Heminger: Lower crude throughputs. Total throughputs were fairly consistent with last year. 
Operator: The next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. 
Blake Fernandez: I had a question for you on the buyback program. It sounds like you're largely through the $850 accelerated program. And I'm just trying to understand how we should think about the balance of the $2 billion program after that. In other words, is that going to be kind of ratable repurchases or does that become more opportunistic? 
Donald Templin: Blake, this is Don. When we complete the program and that program we expect to complete in the next couple of months at the latest, we will evaluate a number of factors, including our cash position and the market. And we will be making a recommendation to our Board around how to continue that -- how to continue or what to do with that share repurchase program. So I would say it will be a fact and circumstance-based decision when this current program expires. 
Blake Fernandez: Okay. Fair enough. And then the second question I had was on the retail acquisition. I know you had a target of 70%, I believe, on assured sales. And I'm just curious with this recent 88 store acquisition, do you have an idea of where that puts you with regard to your target? 
Gary Heminger: Well, and Paul, excuse me, Blake, things change on how that product was supplied in the marketplace prior to where it is today. It is only going to change minimally once we get this acquisition complete here in the second quarter. 
Operator: The next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons & Company International. 
Jeffrey Dietert: Question for Gary or Mike. I know there's a fair amount of volatility experienced in the Chicago product markets this quarter. Could you talk about some of the dynamics that contributed to that volatility and do the flexibility of your system allow you to perhaps do better than what the market indicators suggested was available in that market? 
Gary Heminger: You know I think probably what I could say is that the weakness that you saw in Chicago had a lot to do with the weakness that occurred in the Canadian crude oil pricing during the first quarter. The weather was good, production was high, there was a lot of Canadian crude that was being produced and obviously, those pipes that sit directly on Enbridge pipeline in Chicago have the ability to bring in very cheap crude. And so they continue to run a lot of crude basically and that did cause, it has caused product prices to be relatively cheap. So from our standpoint again, I mean we, as you know, our system is setup such that we have the ability of running Canadian crude as well. So we took advantage of the cheap Canadian crude just like the Chicago refiners did, although we have constraints that perhaps they don't. 
Jeffrey Dietert: It seemed as if, and perhaps there was some winter/summer grade gasoline issue there as well. It got weak and then it rallied sharply, was that part of the issue also? 
Gary Heminger: Yes. That's a phenomena really that we see every year. When you look at the Chicago market it's relatively a thin market and the vapor pressure changes caused volatility pretty much every year. 
Jeffrey Dietert: If I could follow-up on Detroit, you talked about the 70 day turnaround after the completion of the heavy upgrader, is that a complete refinery turnaround? How do you expect that to impact throughput volumes in the fourth quarter? 
C. Palmer: Yes. Yes, it is a complete refinery turnaround. That's all it will be. We'll be down for that 70-day period of time. We will inspect all units, how things go in and turn around. If we get a few done early, we may start up a few of the small units, but with complete turnaround and tying in of the new systems we're putting in, I would say that we will reengage the systems in a very plant sequence. And I would doubt that you'll see much of the many of the process you going to lose coming up early. 
Operator: The next question comes from Chi Chow from Macquarie Capital. 
Chi Cho: Gary, in your prepared remarks, you talked about certain crude spreads potentially staying wide longer-term. Could you expand on that and maybe talk about what specific crudes you're thinking about? 
Gary Heminger: Sure, Chi. And I think we've chatted about this in the past. As we look at the crude going from North to South and West to East, first of all, the Canadian crude and we all know the dynamics in the system is trying to expand the crude systems into the Gulf Coast for Canadian supply. Then you look at the Bakken come down to the Niobrara, eventually to the Permian and Eagle Ford. The Canadian and Bakken and Permian crude as well, all finds its way to the Cushing hub. The initial pipeline that, I understand midmonth here, will be started up. That will be reversed from Cushing to the Gulf Coast, is around 150,000 barrels per day or so, of output. But when you look at the Bakken, and I'm understanding 20,000 to 30,000 barrels per calendar month are being added each month, and you look at the take away capacity from the Bakken, the take away capacity from Canada and then the Cushing barrels, excuse me, the Permian barrels coming into Cushing, we still find that there's going to be a substantial amount of supply available vis-à-vis the amount of export capacity you have out of that Cushing market. And then the other point that I want to make is as you take a look at, at those crudes that eventually may want to find their way to the Gulf Coast, and I think you have a very, very strong competitive force being the Eagle Ford's crude that is continuing to grow each month, and in order to be able to get those crudes and transport those crudes through the Gulf Coast, I see it that you have to go through the Eagle Ford to get there. Therefore, I think it's going to allow differentials to be wider back in those refiners in the Mid-Continent and Midwest that have the ability to take those crudes into the marketplace. They're going to have a transportation differential, a timing differential, and I think you are going to find more competition in the Gulf Coast. And where that competition is really going to play out I believe, is the imported barrel that is coming in as well as some offshore barrels that could come in into the Gulf Coast, either Louisiana corridor or the Houston corridor. I just see for some time that the friction of those barrels that are trying to pass through to the Gulf Coast is still going to be a very, very competitive market, therefore it's going to, as I said before, allow benefits back to Midwest, Mid-Continent refiners. 
Chi Cho: Great. Well, given those thoughts, why would you even consider a reversal of Capline? 
Gary Heminger: Oh, we didn't say that we were considering that. That there are many markets and many ways to look for the markets. And it's clear, Capline is 1 million-barrel per day, kind of rated capacity system, that moves South to the North per day. It is also clear that you would need to ensure that you have supply into the Midwest. I can take you back to late the last decade, where that pipeline was a major supply source in the Midwest refineries. In the event that you were to consider that, you would need to ensure that you have a large pipeline that can still move that type of supply, maybe not 1 million barrels per day, but still move a significant amount of supply South to North if needed. The Canadian production cannot handle everything into the Midwest. So there are many dynamics that go in, Chi, into making or performing that analysis in term of what would be the best way to look at those assets. 
Chi Cho: Right. And it seems like you do want to keep that optionality open from the Gulf Coast, is what you're saying. 
Gary Heminger: You absolutely need that optionality. 
Chi Cho: Right. Right. Okay. One final follow-up, I guess, Don, on a couple of details. On the share repurchase program, it's not clear, are you done with the $850 million buyback in the first quarter or is that still ongoing? 
Donald Templin: We've spent the money, Chi, and that money has been paid to the bank, but the bank is still in the process of purchasing and completing the share repurchase. We received 17.6 million shares to date, and we would expect, given sort of where pricing is currently, that the total shares repurchased will be in the 20 million share range. 
Chi Cho: Okay. Do you have any guidance on what second quarter average share count would be then? 
Donald Templin: Well, I mean we have -- there's 340 million shares currently, Chi, and if we would receive the other shares, I mean only a couple million more shares, so I would say 340 million is probably the number I would start with. 
Operator: The next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. 
Jason Smith: It's actually Jason Smith on for Doug. I just had a follow-up on Detroit. Even though the conversion is underway, how do regional discounts we're seeing impact your optimal crude slate? Is it still optimal to run WCS or is it going to be optimal to potentially run light sweet crudes instead? 
Gary Heminger: Good question, Jason. I think when you look at the spreads that we have been seeing in the market for the first quarter, it would still suggest that you want to run a very heavy slate. But the fact is that what we'll do, like we do at all the rest of our refineries, is we will look at the crude oil differentials that exist in the market at any given time, and we will optimize the crude slate such that we will have the highest profitability slate that we can. We still very much believe that it's going to be a heavy slate, but there are times when we may not run all the heavy that we talked about, it'll depend upon the market. The object is to make money not to run heavy crude. 
Jason Smith: And just can we get an updated view on a consolidation given the cash and the balance sheet, both on the refining and the retail side? 
Donald Templin: I'm not sure I understand the question, Jason. 
Jason Smith: Sorry, with the cash on the balance sheet and just given that we know that there's some assets on the market right now. Just your views on -- the kind of bid asked on consolidation? 
Gary Heminger: Oh, okay. Sorry, Jason. We continuously look at all assets that are available and as recognized with our acquisition last year of Gas City and the acquisition soon on GasAmerica. So we continue to look at basically everything that is available and what opportunities are there, but I can't go into any more detail at this time. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citi. 
Faisel Khan: In your prepared remarks, I think you talked about how you switched all your foreign waterborne crudes over to Brent-based pricing. For the first quarter, how much of your crude was -- your foreign-borne waterborne crude was priced off of WTI? 
Garry Peiffer: This is Garry Peiffer. For the first quarter, most of it was based on WTI derivatives, pricing, so essentially all of it in the first quarter, and as Gary mentioned, we're just switching in the second quarter. And if you look at most of April, there hasn't been much of a difference through the first 20 days or so, so fairly minor impact so far as we move to the second quarter. 
Faisel Khan: Okay. Understood. And given the plunging price of ethanol versus gasoline, were there any benefits of blending ethanol into your gasoline pool? 
Garry Peiffer: This is Garry again. We're basically at E10 everywhere at the moment, so we're watching the developments on the expansion. But at this time, we have no plans to go beyond E10 in our blending. 
Faisel Khan: Okay. Great. And then just looking at your export volume growth year-over-year, where would you say you had the most growth, which region of the world did you see the most growth year-over-year? 
Garry Peiffer: I don't know. I would say, just off the top here without getting into the details, Faisel, that I think it's pretty balanced. If you look at Europe and compare that to South America, Latin America is probably fairly balanced. Gary, just add to... 
Gary Heminger: No, and that's right. We don't have a lot of good details on some of the sales and slide as it is that we sell it domestically and is exported. So we're not really sure exactly where it was, the barrels are actually ending up, anyhow. 
Faisel Khan: Okay. Got you. And then last question for me, the acquisition price for the GasAmerica stores? 
Garry Peiffer: We have not made that public. 
Operator: The next question comes from Rakesh Advani from Credit Suisse. 
Rakesh Advani: Just first, I wanted to kind get your view of the Motiva start up on margins and the light/heavy spreads I guess in the short-term and long-term? 
Gary Heminger: Well, my understanding, Rakesh, from what I've read and studied is that as they start up, they will be taking the base plant down for turnarounds. So I think it's going to be sometime probably through the -- into the third quarter before they get the entire system up and running. And then it all depends -- and of course we do not know the information of how they're going to supply their crude or it's going to be heavy crude, medium, light, we don't know the type of slate. So therefore, how that would affect the differentials and then as they come up, how that will change the product prices, I just think is too far out, probably until late second, early third quarter before we would see the effects. 
Rakesh Advani: Okay. So I mean I guess if you thought that they were bringing on coking capacity with the implication that you're bringing or taking on heavy crude, then wouldn't that ... 
Gary Heminger: Well, certainly if coking capacity could also mean that you're running a part of a medium slate. It just -- but I would assume you're right, that it will be a heavier crude. 
Rakesh Advani: Okay. Just wondering if possible, for the first quarter results in the refining segment, is it possible to get the non-FERC EBITDA contribution from logistics that's in refining? 
Donald Templin: We don't break it out. No, not at this time. 
Operator: The next question comes from Cory Garcia from Raymond James. 
Cory Garcia: Just one quick one out of me now that we're through I guess, the seasonal low point in Asphalt demand, do you guys have any color into sort of how that market is shaping up as we move into summer? And also just sort of refresh me on how your Asphalt sells, is it predominantly wholesale versus what we considered more of a I guess assured sales or sort of contracted volumes? 
Gary Heminger: Well, I like your optimism that we're at our low point in Asphalt demand. It's still going to be a struggle for Asphalt this year. As you see the relative price of Asphalt in the $500 plus per ton, it's going to be a challenge for state governments and cities to be able to pay as much as they have in many years past. So let's say I'd like to share your optimism. We've hit the low point and Garry may have a little more detail. 
Garry Peiffer: Yes, I think the only thing to add is that as you probably now, both the House and the Senate recently passed a 90-day extension. So these 90-day extensions have really put a bit of a -- cast a lot of uncertainty over what funding is going to be there. So I think you know as Gary suggested, until we get a little more certainty as to what type of federal funding is going to be out there -- and federal state funding accounts about 80% of the total funding for Asphalt. So it's really until we get some resolution at the federal level as to what kind of funding we're going to have, we're just kind of -- it's a bit of a -- it's overshadowing everything else going on that market. So it's still a bit uncertain even considering the federal funding status. 
Operator: The next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays. 
Paul Cheng: Gary, I joined late so I missed your opening remarks, you may have already commented it. So if you do, I apologize. But for the month of April, do you have some same-store sales for gasoline that you can share with us? 
Gary Heminger: Right. For April, month-to-date we're up a little bit over 3.5%. I think it's about 3.7% month-to-date so a very strong turnaround in April versus the first quarter. And the other thing is, when you go back and compare some of the volume first quarter versus last year, and even most of the individual months, we had some pretty strong months in the first quarter last year. So when you look at things on a same-store basis, sometimes you're comparing up yourself against very strong months last year. So as I said in my prepared remarks, that we expect to be after April, about flat year-to-date on gasoline demand with a very strong pickup here in April. 
Paul Cheng: And Gary, does it make any difference in terms of that year-over-year comparison between your Midwest system and your Southeast system? 
Gary Heminger: Well, when we look at same-store, we're only in the Midwest. 
Paul Cheng: I thought you had some down in the Southeast? 
Gary Heminger: No, we do not any longer, Paul. We sold those back in '07, '08 timeframe. 
Paul Cheng: Okay. I see. All right. Wondering, if we're looking at other new shale oil development, a lot of them is actually NGL and also condensate, back on that [ph] should be relatively smaller than people thought. And 2 question in here, Gary, do you guys really can run much of a condensate even in your light sweet crude refinery? And secondly, that if not I could assume, then that will probably going to be long in condensate, do you look at condensate splinter even though that may not be a traditional investment that you guys will make if then an opportunity there? 
Garry Peiffer: Well, this is Garry Peiffer. We've been looking at that very closely, and you're right. We think that we can run between Canton and Catlettsburg maybe 20,000 to 30,000 barrels a day of condensate type crude, 20,000 or 30,000 barrels a day between the 2 facilities. But we're also looking at other opportunities around the system to run more condensate and I guess our opinion is that based upon the production forecast for condensate, we think for the foreseeable future, we could have an appetite to use up a lot of what's going to be available for quite a few years in that area. So we're looking at investments to do some of that but we think we have the facilities and we definitely are located in the right spot to be able to run it. 
Paul Cheng: So Garry, you will be able to run it, so you don't really need to build a condensate splinter to take advantage of the potential excess supplies in the market for condensate? 
Garry Peiffer: We're looking at alternatives, utilization of existing equipment, new equipment in our facilities and this is both at Canton, Catlettsburg and potentially, Robinson, as ways to use some of the condensate should it become available in the quantities being projected. 
Paul Cheng: How about down in the Gulf Coast? I mean Eagle Ford does produce quite enough condensate and look like Permian Basin, the increase is going to be NGL and condensate also. Any opportunity there? 
Garry Peiffer: I think there's a lot of other outlets down there. That's kind of the -- a lot of opportunities for using those types of liquids in the Gulf Coast that we aren't really exploring those for the Texas City or Garyville. So we're strictly focusing on the Midwest, the Utica at the moment. 
Gary Heminger: And Paul, what happens at in the Gulf Coast, first of all, there are more condensate splinters but also the condensate seems to get blended into different systems which cost us just much more infrastructure. And Garry's point are right, and I should have included Utica back in the question that Chi Chow had for me on how we looked at the different crudes, I should have included Utica as well. Because as this production ramps up, and we're -- this production is at the far -- the furthest Eastern part of PADD II, it is -- we don't have any pipelines that run East to West over in PADD II. So this really gives us a great opportunity to be able to run this at those refineries and once we get it on the water, we can take it many places. So to Garry's point, instead of possibly heavying up capital investment, maybe we can use our transportation assets to move it into markets. 
Paul Cheng: Sure. And a final one, Gary, can you tell us that whether you have go union to the data room of BP Texas City? 
Gary Heminger: We, Paul, we don't really comment on what we're looking at or not looking at, so we can't comment. 
Operator: The next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. 
Evan Calio: I joined a little late here, sorry, but maybe at risk of getting the last response. Congrats on the strategic update on midstream alternatives. I just had a question. In addition to exploring an IPO, would management consider acquiring an existing publicly traded MLP or GP vehicle assuming the right opportunity presented itself? 
Garry Peiffer: This is Garry Peiffer and really, it's kind of the same answer is, we look at a lot of things as ways to enhance the value of our core assets and we really can't comment on what we're doing, but we're looking at a lot of different alternatives all the time. 
Evan Calio: Perfect. On a, maybe with a faster moving midstream peers in the Utica and in big private acquisition, I mean clearly and a key positioning for MPC. I mean could we see incremental CapEx or investment alternatives in midstream infrastructure in the Utica, at least kind of given the last CapEx guidance in November? 
Gary Heminger: Right, and Evan, and thank you very much for the compliments on our quarter. But as we stated before, we're executing on a permanent to truck rack to Canton. We're looking at a trucking-to-barge operation and those are already in our plans that we've discussed before. If the production grows, like we certainly expect and the producers that we're working with, we have a main trunk line that runs West to East into the Canton area and therefore, we will have a great ability to run a gathering system if that production grows into that main trunk line. So we have many opportunities and I believe we're going to be able to move as fast and as quick and have the flexibility going forward as anyone else. 
Evan Calio: That's great. Just another question, I know I believe there've been some questions on Capline and I understand it wouldn't make as much sense given the kind of limited number of potentially interested volumes moving looking to move south from the north and a little likely of a tri CAPP reversal. But I mean what are your rights to control any potential reversal? Have there been any discussions there with partners or how are you thinking about that obviously, kind of longer-term? And I apologize if some of that had been answered. 
Garry Peiffer: Yes. This is Garry Peiffer again. As you probably know, this is an undivided interest in this pipeline so there's 3 owners and we're all competing with one another to set tariffs in the ship volumes. So we have to be a little bit careful of how we talk about the pipeline. So the bottom line is, we're just 1 of 3 and we have to evaluate this on our interest but we don't control the overall investment in that line. 
Evan Calio: Got it. Just last small question for me, is can you give me a color on the pretax income that comes from the acquired GasAmerica stores, and I'll leave it at that? 
Gary Heminger: We have not given that level of detail nor we closed the transaction yet. 
Operator: The next question comes from Chi Chow from Macquarie Capital. 
Chi Cho: Don, real quick, what's the remaining CapEx on DHOUP and also, have you given any guidance on 2013 CapEx? 
Donald Templin: We've not given guidance on 2013 CapEx. Remaining CapEx on DHOUP was $370 million for the year. 
Chi Cho: As of the end of first quarter? 
Donald Templin: No, I don't know that number from the end of the first quarter. 
Chi Cho: Okay $370 million at the beginning? 
Donald Templin: $370 million was the full year. That was included in our full year refining CapEx budget, Chi. 
Operator: Today's final question comes from Rakesh Advani from Credit Suisse. 
Rakesh Advani: I just had a quick last question, when you were mentioning about retail expansions, would you be looking to move back into like the Southeast or in a big way, would that be interested to you or? 
Gary Heminger: Yes, Rakesh. We have stated before we're very interested in continuing to grow both sides of our retail. And I want to make sure when Paul Cheng was asking me about retail, we have the Marathon brand in the Southeast but we don't look at same-store sales in Marathon brand because we don't have the individual store volumes. But we have Speedway just in the Midwest in the Southern state area. But certainly, if we can find the quality and the size of opportunities, we would move -- we would consider that into the Southeast for Speedway and we're continuing, we had an outstanding year last year on the Marathon brand side and growing our business in the Southeast as well, so we're trying to grow both sides of our retail business. 
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Please go ahead with any final remarks. 
Pamela Beall: Thank you, Christine. Thanks to everyone for joining us today and for your interest in Marathon Petroleum. Should you have any additional questions this afternoon, the IR team will be in the office. Give us a call. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you for participating in the Marathon Petroleum Corporation's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. This concludes the conference for today. You may all disconnect at this time.
