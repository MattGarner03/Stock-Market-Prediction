Good afternoon, everyone.
Nikesh Arora: And thank you for joining us today for our earnings call. I'm excited about our Q2 results. Our teams did a phenomenal job of executing at scale. We've made considerable progress in platformization, allowing us to outperform both our top and bottom line expectations for this quarter. We delivered on our high RPU expectations towards the top of the range. This gave us strength in our NGS ARR and also allowed us to outperform our revenue expectations. In Q2, growth was pretty broad across the entire portfolio, with strength across all three geographies and platforms. In particular, we saw strong performance from large deals internationally and also strong contribution from SaaS, software firewalls, and XIM. On the profitability front, we delivered operating margins ahead of our internal target despite some one-time events. Our efficiency initiatives continue to bear fruit, including some promising early contributions from AI. These results allow us to raise our operating margin and EPS guidance for the year. We're also very happy with our free cash flow performance and continue to be confident in managing our free cash flow guidance over the next few years as outlined. More from Dipak on this later. From our vantage point, the outlook for cybersecurity seems to have been robust in Q2, and is likely to stay so over the rest of this year. Despite the settling in process of the new administration, we see signs that we are going to be able to see reasonable growth through the rest of the year. As the conversation around AI continues to get omnipresent, and companies race to evaluate, experiment, and deploy AI, they're discovering that some of the legacy architectures come in the way of their aspirations. Interestingly, this is resulting in a resurgence of cloud transformation projects and consequently demand for network security network transformation. While cybersecurity's derivative effect is clear, the longer-term trend towards AI is going to continue to underpin technology transformation, and hence, continue to drive demand for security. The transformations are all geared to embedding AI capabilities across infrastructure. Additionally, many of them involve changing strategies towards data and a growing understanding that data security will be more and more important in the future. We see that from the heightened interest in data security posture management where our acquisition of DIG seems to be proving prescient. To fully harness the power of AI, customers must unshackle their data from disparate legacy systems and providers and open up broader access and lean into the cloud. Cloud infrastructure is much more dynamic than on-prem IT, creating risk. As cloud data volumes grow and customers utilize new services from the cloud service providers, such as modern data repositories, and doubling down in ensuring they're protecting their cloud environments from development to runtime. Understanding who's accessing what data in the cloud and putting controls around these new services. In other words, the cloud is becoming an integral part of the enterprise, and the same level of security must be delivered. A constantly changing attack backdrop is also compounding this inflection we've seen. There are tangible signs that bad actors use AI to accelerate attacks. Google recently found that adversaries can use generative AI to more rapidly create attacks including custom payloads, iterate on malicious scripts, and use evasion techniques. Additionally, bad actors using Gen AI do reconnaissance of target organizations, including their infrastructure and hosting providers, which are often exploited in attacks. We have a new technological revolution that requires us to secure AI. As customers leverage the cloud, transform on-prem infrastructure, and respond to the escalating threat environment driven by AI, they're transforming how they manage security operations. Legacy offerings cannot unify SecOps across cloud and on-prem. Across multiple vendors, and also take advantage of AI. AI is key for providing automation to help stitch together overwhelming volumes of data and generate the near real-time analysis of remediation needed to keep pace. As I said, security is a data problem. The data has to be all in one place for AI to have context and stop threats in their tracks. Our industry has to change the paradigm by shifting from fragmentation to platformization to enable the best security outcomes. In a recent study we did with IBM, platformized organizations take 72 days less to detect and 84 days less to contain a security incident. Our teams are busy helping customers as they accelerate cloud adoption and transformation across their environments. They need integrated security products and platforms for AI to be most effective in staying ahead of the active cybersecurity landscape. Herein, we're pleased with our progress in driving our platformization strategy and the adoption and endorsement of platformization broadly across the industry. As I mentioned a few quarters ago, I wish we had made this move earlier. We're seeing some interesting behavior that reinforces our conviction that the future state of cybersecurity will have to be AI-enabled platforms that can markedly improve the speed of response. We delivered approximately 75 new platformizations in Q2, up from approximately 45 in the year ago. We now have a total of over 1,150 platformizations within our top 5,000 customers. As you might expect, many of our platformizations start with network security, and are from customers that have platformized in one area. However, our number of two-platform customers grew over 50% in Q2, and we're seeing a number of three-platform customers up three times year over year. Also, the number of customers platformized in Cortex is up more than three times reflecting a strong excitement. We're excited to see the number of parts we have had success driving strategy so far, and our Q2 performance keeps us on track. To achieve our stated target of 2,500 to 3,500 platformizations by fiscal year 2030. Investors have always asked me what platformization deals look like. I want to provide a few examples based on deals we signed this quarter. A bank in Asia signed a transaction worth over $65 million in Q2 platformizing with us for the first time in Cortex, with a significant XIM deployment. They have been leveraging XDR and other Cortex capabilities several years ago also a network security customer and a QRadar customer. They had many point products in their SOC and were not getting the outcomes they needed. With limitations in the time to discover and remediate security incidents resulting in compliance issues. In platformizing on Cortex, our LGS AR with this customer increased by five times over $12 million. Here we are. We look forward to driving a successful deployment here, which can be an avenue to platformizing a network or cloud security in the future for this customer. A US municipality signed a transaction over $60 million thus which included renewal of its network security estate and expansion across our portfolio. The customer leverages all three of our four form factors within network security and is already platformized there. The deal also included Cortex and Prisma Cloud, which positions us well for future platformization in these areas. GSA are here. Increased over 40% in the last twelve months. Over $11 million. European automated automotive manufacturers signed a $25 million transaction in Q2 that already platformized with us in network security and cloud security, That is several capabilities as they renewed their firewalls, and support footprints, including IoT, virtual firewall, and Sassy. This is a complex customer, and we also secure business with them in Cortex, with XTR, XO, and Expanse, as well as Prisma Cloud. In doing so, we're now well positioned in the future to consolidate the SOC opportunity with XIM For this customer, the NGSA IRR, grew 50% to $9 million. More broadly than these anecdotes, the growth in our large deals tells a story. We had 74 accounts that had transactions over $500 in Q2. Up 25% year over year, and 32 accounts added transactions over $10 million up over 50%. Now moving on to an update about our first security platform network secure NetSec. Our Q2 net segment was driven by strong software demand. We continue to lead the market in network security, which is approximately 80% of our bookings. Our Zero Trust platform combines three best to beat form factors built on a consistent architecture. This is fast becoming a requirement as applications proliferate across data centers hyperscalers, SaaS, and Leverage AI. Meanwhile, users are increasingly distributed across headquarters, remote locations at home, and other places. And also there are now soon to be nonhuman users in the form of AI agents. Where interactions with applications must be secured. Disjointed network security offerings require significant resources to be applied to integration, creating the possibility of gaps in security policies given the disparity of control panes and more importantly, unless we can harmonize the data across the network, it'll be challenging for customers to adopt AI-enabled security capability in the future. We have to believe that in the future, all solutions will need to integrate harmonize data, and use that to train AI agents to solve security. Looking deeper into firewall as a platform, our bookings accelerated and grew by 21%. Within this, we continue to see stable demand in the appliance market. That stability, coupled with us continuing to take market share, allowed us to grow our appliance bookings in the mid-single digits. There's a refresh cycle coming from many players in the industry, and we believe we are well positioned to benefit from it. Software and SaaS make up a craft approximately two-thirds of our Firewalls and platform bookings and grew one and a half times faster the rate of the total firewall as a platform business. We have been on a multiyear journey to reinvent our security subscriptions, which we use consistently across all three form factors. Each of these advanced subscriptions are cloud-delivered, and at least significantly differentiates with what's in the market. Delivering these incremental innovations into our platform, like advanced subscriptions in the network security, makes our customers' adoption seamless. This is core to our strategy of staying ahead of our customer security needs with future-proof innovation. There's also a win-win for Palo Alto Networks, Inc. and the customer. Next, let's dive deeper into SaaS in a software firewall business. As customers transform their networks to keep pace with delivering first-class security capabilities for remote users, and branch offices, we continue to see demand for SASE. Many SaaS projects are large and comprehensive. Which is well suited to our rich offering. SASE continues to be our fastest growing form factor in network security and a strong contributor to our growth. We grew SaaS customers by over 20%, we grew bookings well north of 50% and increased deals over $1 million in value by two and a half times. We now have over 5,600 Sassy customers and over 23 million individual seats. Across our SaaS base as well as our GP customers have been chosen to help protect the base of over 100 million users. Meanwhile, the drivers of our SaaS momentum are broadening. Bookings of newer modules of the SaaS y platform such as Autonomous Digital Experience Management or ADEM, Cloud Access Security Broker or CASB, Prisma access browser, which you just saw an ad for, NAI Access grew nearly fourfold this year. Customers are happy with their initial SaaS deployments, so adding these to derive a more modern security environment and streamline their vendor landscape. I'm particularly excited about the momentum we're seeing with Prisma Access Browser. Roughly one-third of the new Prismaxes seats we sold in the quarter work for our secure browser. We signed a transaction in Q2 for over north of $10 million with one customer. With a total of over $30 million in Prisma Access Browser bookings in Q2, and growing seats by 95% quarter over quarter. We also continued to innovate in SaaS, releasing the mobile version of our integrated or secure browser This browser, integrated with Prisma Access, offers mobile phone and tablet users the same robust security and access to private applications. We added capabilities to AI access, ensuring organizations can apply controls to how their users interact with the AI-based applications. We can now provide real-time visibility into over 1,800 applications up from 500 six months ago. AI access comes with out-of-the-box policies to manage functions such as uploads, downloads, sharing capabilities. In a short period of time, this quarter, we crossed 300 customers who use the AI access capability. We can also provide comprehensive data protection to secure sensitive data secrets and intellectual property. Now turning to software firewalls. This has been a strong area of growth. We saw 50% bookings growth in our software for our business with AI and public cloud adoption continuing to be the strongest driver. Approximately 70% of our VM deployments are now in the public cloud. We continue to see customers adopt our software firewalls alongside our hardware appliances. As a testament to this, about two-thirds of our software follow-up customers are also hard of referral customers. Showing the hybrid nature of the solution and the need for platformization. Also continue to innovate in this business. Early in Q2, we released our API-based AI runtime security capability added the ability of our product directly secure applications without being in the traffic part. Later in Q2, we leveraged this capability to secure AI agents many of our customers look forward towards the value propositions of agents. But need to secure them as they would need to secure any other user or application. This capability helped drive our first seven-figure firewall software firewall transaction for AI in the quarter, and we have a healthy eight-figure pipeline for AI firewalls for the future. Now moving on to Cortex. This morning, we had an exciting announcement. We took our industry-leading Prisma Cloud platform evolved it with more capability, merged it with our CDR capability, and our Cortex platform, to announce the introduction of Cortex Cloud. Cortex Cloud is now the industry's first end-to-end cloud security platform which deeply integrates into the SOC. As we have been delivering cloud security over time, we've learned that the customers are keen to ensure that they can trace the cloud security capability all the way into runtime and production and do real-time security against us. We're also delivering a powerful data security DSP experience and real-time security capability with our cloud agent. Again, of this is now natively connected to the Cortex platform. This is where cloud security is going. We have anticipated the market change in cloud security, as one reason for our momentum and leadership in the space. Recall that in our early days, We entered the cloud security market in 2018 with two acquisitions and continue to build up these capabilities Pioneering the category and leading with our initial car posture capabilities. Soon after, it being became apparent that too many security issues were reaching production and organizations could not keep up with intermediating them once applications were deployed. We led the trend to shift left. Connecting this to the cloud posture to address security should be on before deployment. Attackers took note as customer deployment of mission-critical applications and sensitive data accelerated into the cloud. Our own unit 42 research shows that 80% of security exposures are found in cloud attack surfaces. The 66% increase in threats targeting cloud environments. With these evolutions of the attack backdrop, we believe cloud security security operations must be an Existing Prisma Cloud customers will have a seamless upgrade to Cortex Cloud to benefit from AI-powered prioritization, Automated remediation and new simplified powerful user experience. Additionally, can also adopt Cortex best in class CDR capability to gain real-time cloud security capability. So unification of enterprise to cloud can further drive the adoption of XIM the customer's cloud environment. Cortex Cloud natively integrates with cloud data, context, and workflows within Cortex XIM significantly reduce the mean time to respond modern threats with a single unified SecOps solution. More importantly, because we are natively integrating cloud solutions SOC, Xyme has now transformed into both a cloud and enterprise SIEM. We're excited about the prospects for us to maintain or accelerate our strong excitement. As I mentioned, we are making this announcement in the back of strong momentum in our cloud security and security business. I wanna give you some highlights. What We drove bookings growth of approximately 50% in both Cortex and Prisma Cloud in Q in Cortex with healthy momentum with customer growth of approximately 20%, Fueling this customer growth, we again signed hundreds of new XDR customers in Q2. But become opportunities for sort of transformation on the broader Cortex platform in the future. Our XTR momentum continues to be fueled by the efficacy of our product. This quarter, we achieved further external recognition on this, achieving the leadership results in the most recent MITRE ATTACK evaluations. XIM, Our AI-driven SecOps platform surpassed the $1 billion cumulative bookings milestone in Q2. While we know we have a winning product with Xiam, we're also starting to see external validation of our leadership with Frost and Sullivan and OMDA recognizing us as leaders in the same category. Contributing to our Cortex strength in Q2 was over $100 million in QRadar related bookings. Our pipeline on Korea is equally strong. Leaving us optimistic about our IBM partnership as a driver of Cortex. On the cloud side, we saw the adoption of our capabilities continue to broaden. With DSP, I'm integrated with Prisma Cloud, I see an early adoption to be one of the strongest one of any of our new cloud security capabilities We're excited to see the success continue with DSP and as part of the Cortex cloud. Product we announced this morning. We're also seeing particular success among some of the largest companies in strategic industries. For example, several SaaS companies signed significant cloud security deals with us in Q2. In this industry, Sam is the top ten SaaS companies outside of the cybersecurity leverage their cloud security capabilities to secure the customer's environment. As you can see, saw strong momentum across the business in Q2. We're seeing customer imperatives around AI driving accelerated cloud adoption infrastructure investment, which is supporting strong cybersecurity demand. This healthy spending backdrop is strong execution from our team and platformization. Helped drive the healthy top line trend we saw in Q2 across RPO and GSARR and revenue. We remain optimistic about sustaining this momentum as our sales teams leverage our ecosystem, continue to become more adept at aligning our many capabilities into a unique platformization journey for each customer. We remain confident in our long-term and just ARR forecast. Supporting this, is a steady innovation stream and momentum across our portfolio. Leading early mover into new market categories like enterprise browser, secure AI by design, the air-powered SOC, are making easy for our customers to adopt key new innovations with our platform approach. Lastly, we're driving profitable growth. Balancing operating margin improvements with strong cash flow. Continue to make progress in driving a culture of efficiency at all of our networks. You've seen the results of this over the last few years. This focus on efficiency and some early success in AI-based initiatives gives us the confidence to continue delivering profitable growth. I will now pass on to Dipak for his remarks.
Walter Pritchard: Thank you, Nikesh, and good afternoon, everyone.
Dipak Golechha: To maximize our time spent on Q&A, I will provide you with highlights of Q2. You can review the results in our press release and the supplemental financial information on our website. In Q2, total revenue was $2.26 billion and grew 14%. Above the high end of our guidance. Within revenue, product revenue grew 8% while total services revenue grew 16%. Drilling into total services revenue, subscription revenue grew 20%, and support revenue rose 8%. Our product revenue is approaching 40% software on a trailing twelve-month basis. We expect healthy software contribution product revenue in the second half of this year which we expect will increase our product revenue into the double-digit growth range. We also saw stable demand for firewall appliances in Q2, which we expect to continue through fiscal 2025. The appliance market grows 0 to 5%, as we have previously discussed. Moving on to geographies. We saw double-digit revenue growth across all theaters, with the Americas growing 13%, EMEA up 18%, and JPAC growing 17%. We were particularly encouraged by the volume of large deals we closed with some notable large deals in EMEA and JPAC. For example, we had our largest deals ever in both EMEA and JPAC this quarter, each in excess of $50 million. As Nikesh noted, these deals demonstrate the broadening of our large deals success in North America, to our international theaters. Also, know many investors have had questions about the US federal market. We have had prudent expectations in this market this year, and we saw stable federal business in Q2. Much of our federal business is tied to renewals, and existing programs with long-standing funding. During the quarter, we also received FedRAMP high authorization across our network, cloud, and security operations platforms. We now have the most comprehensive suite of AI-powered cybersecurity solutions authorized for use in federal networks at the high impact level. Total RPO grew 21% to $13 billion at the high end of our guided range. Our current RPO grew 17% to $6.1 billion. The average duration of new contracts remained at approximately three years. It did trend towards the high end of our historical range in Q2, based on our performance in large platformization deals, particularly customers making longer-term commitments to XI App. Our NGS ARR again delivered strong growth growing 37% finishing Q2 at $4.78 billion, our NGS ARR was driven by the strength across our advanced subscriptions SaaSII, and Cortex. Moving down the income statement, gross margin of 76.6% was down slightly as we continue to see the impact to some of our newer SaaS offerings, that are growing quickly but have yet to achieve scale. Also, we had some costs in Q2 related to inventory and product transitions that were higher than typical and we don't expect that that will recur in the second half of the year. It is worth noting have been transitioning our contract manufacturing Facility, in Texas as our primary manufacturing and fulfillment center. Not only to enable scale and innovation in our appliances, but also to take advantage of our foreign trade zone that can help mitigate tariffs and products we ship to international destinations as we assemble and manufacture all of our firewall appliance products, in the US. More broadly, we continue to see efficiencies across the company as we focus on driving profitable growth. We saw operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decrease by 120 basis points as we benefited from scale in our business model and initiatives as part of continuing to build our culture of efficiency. We delivered 81 cents of diluted non-GAAP EPS and a diluted GAAP EPS of 38 cents. Continues to grow along with our overall profitability. As a reminder, in the year-ago period, we had a significantly positive impact to GAAP EPS from the large $1.5 billion release of tax valuation allowance that happened only in fiscal 2024. We generated adjusted free cash flow of over $509 million. In Q2. So On our balance sheet, will see that our debt balance came down by over $100 million as we continue to see early conversions of our convertible debts which occurred at the discretion of the debt holders was settled by us in cash and equity. 2025, Our remaining debt of just over $500 million matures in June continue to see some early conversions. We did not repurchase any shares in Q2, and our buyback strategy remains opportunistic. We have $1 billion in authorization Remaining through December 2025. As Nikesh mentioned, we are pleased with the momentum we are seeing in our platformization strategy and the outcome in driving our financial results. I wanted to update you on what we are seeing a year into this strategy. As you all no doubt remember, announced our optimization strategy A year ago. Over the last twelve months, we've learned from our success and adapted where it made sense. We launched a number of structured sales programs that we highlighted to jump-start this initiative. Our goal was to remove friction both related to technology risk and budget challenges for the customer. We have now embedded these practices into how we do this.
Walter Pritchard: Business.
Dipak Golechha: A year in, we have seen both the industry rally around this approach as well as some of our key ecosystem partners also put significant resources behind platformization. This has helped leverage our own investments on the sales and marketing side and brings us closer to enterprise accounts where ecosystem partners have strong relationships. Many of our large platformization deals have been pursued and closed with global system integrators. With these joint successes, partners collectively are putting more resources behind platformization. When we initially announced platformization, we had piloted the program helping us build conviction in our aggressive launch. Predating our broad announcement, some of our top reps were driving deals with the principles that embody platformization. A year in, we have seen rapid participation significantly increase with approximately a third of our sales reps having already participated in a new platformization deal win the last twelve months since we launched our accelerated strategy. Lastly, when we launched the program, we had assumed the platformization would enable our to increase our ARR per customer. As you can see in some of the large deal highlights that Nikesh covered, have seen success signing larger deals and further expanding our ARR and platformized customers. As you can tell from both the tone and some of the details that we provided, we are very happy with our progress here. I'll reiterate what Nikesh noted last quarter and earlier our biggest learning is that we should have made this move earlier. Now turning to the bottom line. Our confidence in future operating margin expansion is rooted in our visibility to continued leverage across our P&L. As Nikesh mentioned, we've seen some encouraging results from our AI-based initiatives across multiple areas of the company that give me greater confidence in this ability to drive leverage. Wanted to provide you with an update of some of these AI-based initiatives on what we're seeing so far. In the areas that we have focused on, we've seen meaningful efficiencies which either manifest as lower spending enabling us to drive incremental innovation, or absorb expected increases in volume without additional spending. One of our first AI-based initiatives was focused on our employee-facing processes. In the past, we have leveraged contractors in various business processes in IT. We are on track to reduce this contract labor by about 50% as we close out fiscal 2025, which will result directly in operating expense savings. In our global customer support business, we've leveraged an internally developed Copilot to assist in case resolution. So far, we have seen our support Copilot used in about 85% of cases in network security which is where we first rolled out this technology, We're seeing approximately 50% reduction in the time to resolve cases. This results in a better experience for our customers and also our team is being able to absorb more case volume while adding less headcount than in the past. Lastly, we are deploying Copilot tools for our developers earlier and are seeing some exciting results. We've recently deployed the technology to all of our engineers. These and other initiatives that are still in their early stages Give us consistent outcomes and that gives me more confidence and confidence on the tangible benefits to our business including our cost structure. Before I turn to guidance, we have a lot of questions about how we get comfortable with the sustainability of our cash Generation given some of the transitions happening in our business. We began to see an increase in deals with deferred payments in fiscal year 2022 and have seen a significant increase driven by larger transactions particularly in our SaaS offerings over the last three and a half years. As we have absorbed an increase in deferred payments, our visibility into our free cash flow each year has increased. In fiscal year 2024, when we entered the year with $1 billion in deferred payments scheduled for the year, that was 32% of our fiscal year 2024 adjusted free cash flow. This year, that amount increased to $1.4 billion and our visibility increased to 41%. Of our expected adjusted free cash flow. Looking forward, we expect to enter fiscal 2026 with $2 billion in deferred payments scheduled for the year further increasing our visibility into free cash flow in fiscal year 2026. We've progressed substantially over the last several years through the transition of deferred payments. We've also spent significant time over the course of this year ensuring that we're balancing this transition with other uses of cash and opportunities for cash flow optimization. Because our appliance bookings and smaller bookings predominantly are paid upfront, and many of our large transactions already utilize deferred payments We believe we can manage the trend towards more of our larger transaction bookings utilizing deferred payments as we have done over the last several years. Consequently, Our expected increasing profitability as we scale and these financial dynamics give us improved confidence in our free cash flow generation. Our confidence holds for fiscal year 2025 where we continue to expect 37 to 38% adjusted free cash flow margin as well as our cash generation beyond this year. We are comfortable that we can generate adjusted free cash flow margins for fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2027, of greater than 37%. So As a reminder, we do not guide free cash flow on a quarterly basis, and we do see year-to-year fluctuations in our cash flow In fiscal year 2025, relative to prior years, we expect to see fluctuations in seasonality driven by the timing of deferred payments from customers, the timing of bookings within the year and the timing of cash tax payments But this year, we expect relative to The Street that more of our free cash flow will come in Q4. With that, let me turn to guidance. For fiscal year 2025, we expect NGS ARR to be in the range of $5.52 to $5.57 billion an increase of 31 to 32%. Remaining performance obligation of $15.2 to $15.3 billion, an increase of 19 to 20%, revenue to be in the range of $9.14 to $9.19 billion, an increase of 14%, operating margins to be in the range of 28 to 28.5%, diluted non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.18 to $3.24, an increase of 12 to 14%. And adjusted free cash flow margin in the range of 37 to 38%. For the third fiscal of 2025, we expect NGSA IRR to be in the range of $5.03 to $5.08 billion an increase of 33 to 34%. Remaining performance obligation of $13.5 to $13.6 billion, an increase of 19 to 20%. Revenue to be in the range of $2.26 to $2.29 billion, an increase of 14 to 15%, and diluted non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of 76 to 77 cents. An increase of 15 to 17%. We've included our typical modeling points in the presentation for you to review. Before I turn back to Walter for Q&A, we will roll one more video.
Walter Pritchard: When I think about the relationship between Palo Alto Networks, Inc., it We are a $20 billion global technical services firm that employs over 340,000 associates worldwide. We had disparate technologies across the environment. Our data was also very disjointed. How do we optimize our entire technology strategy through platformization and to create a level of consistency across our entire enterprise. So our ability to protect and defend goes up. And the complexity to manage and maintain this technology, but we've improved. We look at the promise of what we're seeking for XIM and where we're seeing the benefit is the ability to more effectively consolidate the visibility through all that data. And the ability to then rapidly accelerate creating runbooks and use cases out of that data in order to drive our response and our decision. And the relationship between Palo Alto Networks, Inc. and Cognizant is one that I get to see come into real life in terms of we're gonna transform and how we're reenvisioning our entire security program. Thank you. We ask in the Q&A that each analyst only ask one question. Our first question will come from Saket Kalia from Barclays followed by Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley. Saket, go ahead.
Dipak Golechha: Okay. Great.
Walter Pritchard: Guys. Thanks for taking my question here, and nice quarter.
Saket Kalia: Maybe a question for Nikesh and Dipak together. You know, it's great to see free cash flow margins at 37% plus expected now through fiscal 2027. Nikesh, can you just maybe talk about some of the success you're seeing driving better profitability and Dipak you just maybe go one level deeper into other drivers of that free cash flow like the deferred payments.
Nikesh Arora: Yeah. No. It's okay. There's first of all, thank you for the question. As Dipak highlighted, like, we're beginning to hit scale. As you see, platform deals are actually a lot more efficient from a sales perspective because a larger deals you know, I think if you see, if you look at cybersecurity landscape, we're now clearly a large deal company compared to most of our competitors. So that definitely drives efficiencies for us from a scale perspective. You look at any P&L, in any enterprise business, 50 to 60% PNL is sales, marketing, and customer support. If you can find efficiencies in that process, that's where leverage lies. You've seen we've been you know, improving our operating margins consistently now for over two and a half years. That's being driven from that efficiency lens. If you couple that with some of the early experiments we've shared, on the AI front, we think this has tremendous potential in the future. Where Enterprise companies should operate at a much higher operating margin in the future from now. I'm not gonna put a forecast just yet, but think the trend is our friend. And that gives us tremendous comfort that we can underpin our performance with strong operating margins over the course of the next few years Couple that with the way Dipak and his team have been able to balance the deferred payment parts, which you can talk about, which they said gives us tremendous amounts of visibility. We feel confident that The the range the next few years is there and possibly higher after.
Dipak Golechha: Yeah. If I can just build, Saket, like, a lot of this is is in the prepared remarks, but we've had a lot more visibility with a growing balance of deferred payments already in the past few years. There's parts of our business that are really never gonna go to deferred payments The the smaller transactions that have a multi-tiered distribution network where everybody wants to get paid upfront, the appliance business, where it's industry standards pay up front, then you're left over with everything else and we've we've already made a significant transition already So there's not as much left to actually do We're quite far along the journey. That's what gives us confidence and that's what I was meaning to convey in the prepared remarks.
Saket Kalia: Very helpful. Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Thank you, Saket. Next question from Hamzah Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley followed by Brian Essex from JPMorgan.
Saket Kalia: Alright. Great. Thank you for taking my question, and good evening. Nikesh, I had a
Hamza Fodderwala: Better A bigger picture question for you. Hey. Do you want to order? No. I'll leave that to the others. No. I obviously, you know, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. been at the forefront of AI, whether it's AI for security operations when it comes to Cortex, or securing AI now with DIG and and Prisma Cloud.
Nikesh Arora: Yep.
Hamza Fodderwala: Deep seep was a was a big moment for for the AI trend in the market earlier this year. I'm curious, what do you think this means for the proliferation of AI in general? And how this impacts security and specifically Palo Alto Networks, Inc.
Nikesh Arora: It's a very good question coming from you, Hamzah. Not that I wouldn't expect that from you, but it's a great question. Like, I think deep seek is a phenomenal pivotal moment for AI. Not just for us, but across the industry. If you look at it across three parameters. Right? There's the question around quality. Is it as good as the models that people are using out there, like OpenAI, Gemini, or Llama, etcetera? At least if you read The ratings out there, it seems like it's equally good if not better for tech technical answers. It does better coding. Better math, better physics. So it looks like for for sort of it has a better reasoning engine, out there. So interesting. Then the next question becomes great. If it's so good at it's equally good, you know, what are the economics? Did they actually get it done for a lot cheaper? Now we can debate that. I don't know if you'll ever get to the bottom of it. But what's interesting is today, you pay 14 cents for about a million words? And you pay $7.50 for every other model. So it's 2% of the cost to every other model. Now that's driving experimentation. I have talked to many SAS CEOs recently, and everybody's experimenting. So we need to see if Deepsea can deliver that degree performance. And third question comes, okay. Wait. This has come from a nation state, maybe from somewhere where we don't wanna trust the model. Gotta figure out how secure it. Now look, any AI model that is gonna be used by enterprises will be used Any sequestered fashion. Either on prem or in your own cloud instance, will require AI firewalls around it, If you can guarantee that your data doesn't get out of that sequestered sort of space, if you can guarantee that you can put guardrails around the model I think you'll see a lot more experimentation. So from that perspective, I just gotta pivot my only recommendation to every enterprise out there is make sure you don't deploy AI without running firewalls around it. Make sure you don't deploy in a multi-tenant environment. But I think this is great for AI. And, like, any technology is great for security because any technology requires you to put more security around it.
Dipak Golechha: Great. Thank you, Hamza.
Walter Pritchard: Next question is coming from Brian Essex at JPMorgan followed by Gabriela Borges at Goldman Sachs. Brian, go ahead. Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question.
Brian Essex: I have a bit of a different AI question. And, you know, it comes from the perspective of you know, leveraging AI across the platform to provide better security outcomes. And maybe if you could talk about what you're seeing in cloud security as an example, and win rates as you're able to provide know, code to cloud to SOC security across your entire platform How does that affect your ability to compete event against point solution? Providers in that space. And you know, how how is that enabling you to kind of leverage the platform maybe as as an example in that cloud security space. Thanks.
Nikesh Arora: Hey, Brian. Is any point solution business left? Every security company seems to claim their platform now, so I don't think there's I don't think this this I think that breed of point solution is gone. But, anyway,
Brian Essex: Was it different between calling yourself a platform and actually being a platform?
Nikesh Arora: That's what they say about us too. That's the those guys. But that notwithstanding, like, you know, I was I was I told Lee last night and I said, you know what? I found a new raison d'etre for platformization. Our earlier sort of narrative was that you need a platform so you get a single pane of glass, you can run zero trust networks. You can be harmonized across policies. There are no security gaps. But as we go down this journey, we're discovering and we're we're talking about deploying agents, and why do we need human beings trying to do these complex tasks and trying to understand how security should be deployed? Why can't we have agentic personas that say, I'm your network configurator. I'm your you know, phishing remediator. Can't we design security agents when very quickly you realize you can't design an agent unless you have the data? You can't you can have the data across seventeen disparate products and make sense of it. So what we're discovering is this strategy that we deployed of of about two years ago and really sort of put our our weight behind a year ago, resulting in us getting harmonious data. These eleven hundred and fifty customers who are platformized, have data that is harmonized. We can run and build agents on top of that. So from that perspective, the more platforms we sell, it creates tremendous opportunities for us. I wanna talk to let Lee talk about how this is helping us the cloud security front. Yeah. So you've seen what we've done in in other places. Right, Brian? So the in in XIM, using AI for the SOC and reducing meantime remediation from days down to hours to minutes. You've seen us do this with In NetSec and across network security and SaaS and other places, in Cloud what you've what you can see is a couple of things. First is in the individual areas. So in AppSec, how we use AI in order to have better detection and prevention of misconfigurations before they reach production. Production, how we use AI in order to better remediate detect and remediate, prioritize, etcetera. And then with Cortex Cloud, which we announced earlier this morning, what that allows us to do is now not only apply Aon automation within each of these areas, but now connect that across the full end to end from AppSec into cloud, into runtime, into SOC, And that is incredibly powerful when you think about trying to become much more proactive security.
Brian Essex: Is that translating in a better win rate? So, like, if you if you look against a point solution, vendor like a whiz in the cloud security space, are you starting to see the improvement in win rates? Yes. Sorry. No. Please go ahead. Just jumped on that one. But I I will let
Nikesh Arora: answer the question. I'm gonna I'm gonna say something else. Good.
Lee Klarich: Yes. Because it it not only had it achieved better security outcomes, but it also translates to more efficient you know, security operations of the that actually have are responsible for managing all this on a day-to-day basis.
Nikesh Arora: What I was gonna say, Brian, is that I think cloud security is gonna go through one more evolution. That evolution will be as it it sort of started in the center, shifted left to go to code. Now it's doing a hard shift right. A hardship right is you need to be in the sensor in production environments understanding what's going on, protecting the production environment, and using that to prioritize cloud security. I think you know, the the the bigger cloud security action is gonna be in runtime with agents, and that's where more It's actually not the the CNAP players who have had who won the last round. That makes any sense.
Brian Essex: Super helpful. Thank you. Alright.
Walter Pritchard: Alright. Thanks, Brian, for those two questions. We'll go next with Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs. Followed by Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Gabriela, go ahead.
Gabriela Borges: Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Dipak, you mentioned earlier there are some deals that are always gonna be upfront. Maybe just elaborate for us. What are the guardrails or what is the framework for your salespeople that determines when they go to multiyear versus one-year billings? And when they can offer financing versus when you don't wanna offer financing. Thanks.
Dipak Golechha: Yeah. So I think it's all it's all part of the actual sales motion and negotiation. So really, really where you see the majority of the requests for deferred payments is in the higher end. Like, distributors don't really want to have to deal with lots of back and forth with with customers at the lower end therefore, that's typically all upfront. Right. So it's really the hiring deal. And on firewall, typically get the money upfront because that's being budgeted. On a refresh cycle. So those cases apart, it then becomes a negotiation. Our our sales team will will basically go and they'll explain that there is value in the cost of money We expect to be paid upfront, and then it becomes part of the negotiation based on what is required and what's not required. We we do have guardrails in place Everything from sales comp to approvals, they're in place to make sure that we manage that tightly but it really is with a view of enabling platformization at scale, which is why we've been Working on this for a while and managed to transition pretty well so far.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks, Gabriela, for that question. Next, we'll go with Johnson Ho from William Blair followed by Peter Wheat from Bernstein. Jonathan, go ahead.
Hamza Fodderwala: Good afternoon. Just wanted to
Saket Kalia: CNAP as part of the Cortex platform. And
Jonathan Ho: can you talk a little bit about the ability to accelerate adoption or accelerate platformization as you take on the stock tick? You.
Lee Klarich: Yeah. Look. The as as Nikesh was mentioning, a lot of the action in cloud is is shift toward real-time, which means shifting toward runtime and and even SOC. The it's really critical though from our perspective that we bring in as much context as possible in order to be able to to make take those automated actions. Right? And that context often comes from CNAP and even code security. That's the first critical reason. Second is the cleaner your cloud environment can be from preventing issues from ever making it into production or cloud posture where we're detecting and remediating those issues. The cleaner your cloud environment, the more the the the better that security posture is. The easier it is for runtime and and SOC capabilities to to to fire in real-time because they're it's easier to pick out the attacks using machine learning AI and other types of capabilities like that. So ultimately, we believe that the the best outcome for customers is achieved when they connect the all of the aspects of cloud together, and so you see that show up in terms of how we we package the offering as well.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks for that question, Jonathan. Next, we'll have
Peter Weed: from Bernstein follow both by Shaool Leil from Cowen. Peter, go ahead.
Hamza Fodderwala: Alright. Thank you, and, congrats on the
Peter Weed: continued success on on the platform. Maybe I ask the unsexy question. Which is, you know, on the product side, You know, I I think we saw some some nice strength this quarter, and and I know kind of the guidance is that's gonna remain, you know, a less you know, exciting from a growth standpoint portion of the business. But that strength was important for for delivering on the revenue. And if we look forward, is that type of strength something that we should be able to look at as as a support as opposed to maybe a a a drag on on overall growth, or is this kind of a a one-time, you know, quarter how how will that evolve looking forward?
Nikesh Arora: So, Peter, I think it's probably one like, I sound like a broken record. I've always been saying that the hardware industry for us, at least our end, is gonna deliver somewhere between five to eight percent. And sometimes it's been flat in the in a post-pandemic. There was a sort of splurge, surge, and it went back down. I think we're back to steady states. So I think easily, you can expect us to be going low to mid-single digits on the appliance side. But I think the real action for us is, I think, you understand, there's a series of transformations going on underneath. Like, Dipak highlighted cash flow transition. We've been transitioning our network security business as you saw from hardware to software. This is why you see that we're growing that category 21%. Between hardware and software. So that just, over time, reduces our reliance on hardware because I think, you know, that cloud transformation is underway. More and more cloud volume. But that's the good news. The cloud volume is going up faster than the data wall data center volume is declining. So if we can manage this transition in a way, we can drive more and more software, firewalling capability and not just recompense for the hardware business being slow growth compared to that. We can also, over time, drive higher growth across the entire network security category for ourselves.
Walter Pritchard: Thank you. Great. Thanks for the question. Next up is Shahwaleh Al from Cowen
Shaul Eyal: followed by Taliani from B of A. Go ahead, Shaool.
Brian Essex: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Nikesh, I'm interested in your views on the curator and overall IBM partnership
Shaul Eyal: this quarter? And is it coming in line or better than your initial views couple of quarters ago when you have gone after this this asset. Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: Charles, we had our board meeting yesterday, and there was a comment that one day a Harvard Business School case would be written on this. And for the right reasons. I'll say this has this has been a spectacular partner for us. Not just our relationship with IBM, our go-to-market partnership together where they are you know, talked to a large large deal. It's actually public in the UK. The home office deal where IBM has partnered and is a very large modernization contract. We partnered really well. Some of our very large deals, as we highlighted one of our largest deals this quarter, the Asian Bank, was a QDR customer, which now we were able to take the ARR up five times. So you can see that the the sort of inroads in the partnership that IBM had with many of these customers has translated into very, very large opportunities for us. So it couldn't have been better.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thank you so much.
Shaul Eyal: Thanks, Joel. Next, we'll go to Taliani from B of A followed by Andy Nowinski from Wells Fargo. Tal, go ahead.
Tal Liani: I I wanted to ask about the margins Can you go over kind of what happened to margins this quarter that I saw a little bit of pressure and then what's the outlook for the year? What are the puts and takes for margins? Thanks.
Dipak Golechha: So tell us the clarifying question you told me in gross margins? Is that what you're saying? Gross yes. Gross margin and and also a little bit on the operating Yeah. So so really it's mainly on in the gross margin and it's all it was all in my prepared remarks, like where yep. So so there, the the main parts were on the services gross margin, It was driven by, you know, like, faster growth on the newer SaaS offerings. Which just have more time to mature and scale, And on the hardware, we did have some one-time inventory write-off CNOs. It will not repeat in the Second half.
Nikesh Arora: So I think it's we had a 40 basis point one-time write-off. Okay. Which impacted our gross margin on the hardware side. Which is why you it's it's a one-time event, but we still outperform the margin expectations both internally and as per you guys.
Tal Liani: Thanks.
Walter Pritchard: Alright. Thanks, Tal. Next, we'll go with Andy Nowinski, and our final question will be from Matt Hedberg from RBC. Andy, go ahead.
Hamza Fodderwala: Okay. Good afternoon. Thank you. And
Andy Nowinski: I thought your quarter overall was was very good as well. I wanna ask maybe a more difficult question on the NetNewAR side. You know, if you pull out the $74 million from QRadar, in Q1. You know, it looks like your net new ARR declined on a year-over-year basis for last two consecutive quarters. You and you have so many positive trends in these large platformization deals Why aren't those translating into net new ARR growth over the last two quarters?
Dipak Golechha: Yeah. So, Andy, we we talked about this a little bit last quarter. I mean, we're very happy with the net new ARR growth. We did have some transitions of you know, old attaches to cloud-delivered advanced subscriptions that led to a significant increase in net new ARR a year ago. As we lap that, we don't have the same step up. But the net new ARR on some of our newer products, what's driving a lot of the platformizations continues to go from strength to strength.
Nikesh Arora: And, yes, they just after that, like, You know, the software firewall strengths we talked about, the SASE strengths we talked about, The cloud security strength, the XIM strength, all these things contribute to net new ARR. That's what's allowing us to get it to the you know, I still remember six years ago, this was zero. So we're very happy that it's driving up a whole lot of $5 billion, and know, we still believe we're on track to get to $15 billion. On NGS error. Got it.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks, Andy. Our last question is from Matt Hedberg. Matt, go ahead.
Matt Hedberg: Thanks for taking my question, guys. Congrats on the results.
Peter Weed: Not an easy environment here.
Matt Hedberg: Yeah. I had kind of a high-level question, maybe Lee, for you. I think we you know, we've all been talking about agentic an agentic framework, and and I think you know, Akash, you mentioned on the call. I guess, Lee, from your perspective, a lot of people look at identity as sort of maybe the tip of the spear for AGENTIC basic security. What what's your perspective on on the the the security foundation for a a a broader agent rollout?
Lee Klarich: Oh, I think it's I think it's a lot more complicated than that, Matt. Not necessarily in a bad way. But I think sometimes the industry can be quick to jump on a single magic bullet of identity, which is important, but there's a lot of other aspects to to how these eigenetic platforms work. And I would actually start with how do you secure the AI portion of the agentic platform and making sure that it's providing If if you're going to give it the authority to take independent actions which effectively what agentic AI will do. You better make sure that that AI environment is fully secured from attackers and and you have proper guardrails enforced and everything else. Yes. That has to be combined with with identity, All of it has to be combined with, it's gonna ramp up even just machine to machine level communication, how we secure it. So there'll be multiple facets to how agentic AI is is secured as it as it matures. Just to add to that, Matt, I think one of the things which is
Nikesh Arora: from our perspective, fascinating is that we have now sold XIM more than 200 times. The last 24 months, making it one of the fastest growing products in cybersecurity. And in XIM, we see all the data. So we expect we will start seeing agentic activity in XIM. So, you know, identity is two parts. Identity is validating your credentials, to make sure you are who you are, whether you're an agent or human being, which is what typically MFA does a service accounts to a SaaS applications. But watching the activity and being able to control the activity and stop the activity and change permissions will have to happen in some sort of AI-enabled SOC. So we think there's an opportunity for us in the future That we will be able to build as the definition of agents and the deployment agent starts to settle in. Agentic detection, remediation, and management within the XIM capabilities that we have.
Walter Pritchard: Alright. With that question, Matt thanks for wrapping it up for us. I will turn the call back over to Nakesh for his closing remarks.
Nikesh Arora: I just wanna say thank you very much to all of our customers, employee, employees, and our ecosystem partners for all their hard work, and thank you for all of you for taking the time to listen in our earnings call. We'll see you guys next quarter.

I will now turn the call over to Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you, Walter. Good afternoon and thank you everyone for joining us today for our earnings call. We're delighted to report a strong start to fiscal year 2025. In our first quarter of focusing on RPO and NGS ARR, we saw strength in both metrics and saw them perform well ahead of our expectations. The market for cybersecurity continues to be robust and continues to grow faster than the overall technology market. Despite the acceleration of technology spend due to AI, cybersecurity continues to [out space] (ph) technology spend. We saw particular strength in our next-generation security offerings, notably in Cortex and in NetSec. NGS ARR grew 40% to over $4.5 billion. It is still well ahead of our industry's expectations independent of a one-time increase due to the IBM deal. On the profitability front, we expanded our operating margin by 60 basis points year-over-year as we continue to see benefits from our broad efficiency focus while making the necessary investments to sustain our growth. This translated into a 13% EPS growth and strong cash generation. We are particularly pleased with our continued execution at scale where we are able to balance our growth initiatives within our financial investment envelope, allowing us to deliver upside to our EPS guidance. We've been talking about the benefits of simplifying security architectures and consolidating point products into platforms for a while now. I'm sure all of you remember our eventful quarter where we changed gears on platformization, and as I've said before, I wish we could have made our good decisions faster. We continue to see momentum across our partner ecosystem and our customers. More recently, our industry peers have been evangelizing the virtues of platformization, and industry experts have begun to weigh in. I had our teams go back and compare the growth in the mentions of the Word platform on cybersecurity earnings calls this year versus last year, we found an overall 50% increase amongst our peers. As they say, imitation is the highest form of flattery. As another point of reference in recent research, Gartner sees 75% of secured leaders actively pursuing a vendor consolidation strategy, although less than 15% of large enterprise customers have implemented at least any one security platform solution. Gartner expects that by 2028, 45% of organizations will use fewer than 15 cybersecurity tools in their product portfolio, up from 13% of organizations in 2023. I do want to reiterate the definition of what we want to achieve as a platform. Central to stopping threats of the future is a robust AI and automation platformization strategy and data is at the heart of it all. Our approach is to ingest all relevant security data once, stitch and analyze this with Precision AI technology, and natively automate end-to-end workflows. It's a tall order to take data from many different security vendors, analyze it on the fly, and make a decision to stop an attack fast enough, but we're encouraged with the early success of our XSIAM and Cloud platform to do exactly this. In network security, we also collect all data across all Palo Alto network security products and enable our customers to operate on a single pane of glass with consistent services, which work across all our form factors. We believe our network security strategy is the most comprehensive platform available in the industry, encompassing a majority of the use cases via a single consistent interface, as one of our customers recently said, that's one pain of glass versus many glasses of pain. So while many of our competitors are talking about their platform approach, we don't believe they are equipped to deliver it in the way we can. We feel the cybersecurity industry is embarking into its next phase, where the market will continue to converge towards a fewer set of platformization players over the next 5 to 10 years. Point solutions will continue to get subsumed in these platform plays. Having started this trend, we intend to be one of those few players. With this being the first quarter of our fiscal new year, we further oriented our go-to-market enablement around platformization. Our goal is to broaden the effectiveness of our solutions selling across thousands of sellers and arm them to sell the value of our differentiated security outcomes across network security, cloud security, and security operations. With platform-specific domain consultants and architects, we are able to bring tremendous focus to our go-to-market efforts. I'm again pleased with the results we're seeing. These came through in our Q1 metrics. We added more than 70 new platformizations with about a third coming from our acquisition of QRadar SaaS. We ended Q1 with approximately 1,100 platformizations. Beyond the number of new platformizations in Q1, we also saw strength in ARR per platformized customer. Our Q1 ARR per platformized customer was up 6% versus the average we saw during fiscal year 2024. The improvement in ARR is driven not only by our success signing larger transactions, it is also driven by our team's ability to expand existing platform-wise deployments continuously with new innovation that is delivered. For example, in network security, we have seen significant value from the adoption of advanced subscription services and uptake of add-on modules in SASE such as ADEM or Autonomous Digital Experience Management, or CASB. ADEM and CASB are essential for us to be able to deliver AI solutions and AI access capabilities in the future, and we believe this capability will become existential for all SASE customers. Our Q1 performance keeps us on track to achieve 2,500 to 3,500 platformization deals by fiscal year 2030. We are happy with our continued strong growth in NGS ARR in Q1, fueled by our continued platformization momentum. We see multiple drivers here. Network security customers are increasingly deploying our software and SASE form factors, including adopting advanced Zero Trust security subscriptions across them. Over time, these customers have a significant incentive to converge their network security architecture towards the adoption of our full suite of three form factors. Outside of network security, where we now have well over $2 billion in NGS ARR, we are also seeing our cloud security and Cortex security operations business become significant as well. Last quarter, cloud security crossed the $700 million milestone, and this quarter, Cortex crossed the $1 billion milestone. Looking at the large platform deals, we see a variety of opportunities across all of our customers. We signed a transaction with large technology firm for over more than $50 million. This deal was headlined by a stock transformation where we both replaced multiple SIEMs with XSIAM and XDR. The customers facing rising costs in the SOC with little automation and adequate visibility into the rising number of tailored attacks that leveraged AI. The customers curated our customer and a year ago had platformized with us in network security. In this transaction, they added SD-WAN as well. Next, we had a deal north of $15 million in value to the national hospital system platformizing their network security, which included ELA for our firewalls. The customers focus on both preventing a breach after observing the many high-profile incidents in the healthcare industry as well as reducing operating costs. We displaced a legacy firewall vendor and also set ourselves up for future SASE deployments. In SecOps, we also have an initial Cortex footprint and secured our customers with an XSOAR deployment. Our financial institution customer standardized on our firewalls, including an ELA in a transaction for over $20 million after standardizing on our network security platform with SASE in fiscal year 2024. While we had to win the firewall business based on the capabilities of our appliance, our SASE platformization and our consistent NetSec architecture across form factors was a big differentiator. With the benefit of our consistent network security architecture, we were able to streamline operations across the network and drive lower costs. Last but not the least, we trained the transaction greater than $30 million with the physical security services company. The customer signed a large transaction with the last year, platformizing network security and security operations. In this quarter, the customer expanded both XSIAM and XDR deployments and added SASE network security. This was a challenging deal as there were significant changes as a customer with new IT leadership, including someone who previously deployed a SASE point product from a competitor. We were able to show both cost savings and a better security outcome from our consistent NetSec architecture. Our expanded Cortex footprint was driven by the customer's confidence that we are helping them identify and stop attacks. Overall, these are representative of our large deal momentum where we saw 305 transactions over $1 million, up 13%, and 60 transactions over $5 million, up 30% this quarter. Switching gears, let's take a look at our three platforms and how they're supporting our growth. In network security, we continue to see steady demand in our product business. The demand continues to be a function of customer refreshes, capacity expansion, and selective competitive takeouts driven by the customers' desire to deploy a network security platform across the category. We are also seeing customers who as they move to the cloud are beginning to deploy more and more software firewalls to protect their cloud instances. With the recent upgrade of our products to be able to solve AI use cases, we continue to feel positively about strength in public cloud deployed software firewalls. These represent 70% of our total virtual firewalls ARR and are driving our growth in this area. SASE continues to drive transformation deals as you saw in our customer stories. The true power of SASE and its extensibility now to our newer use cases helps validate the case for many of our new customers. Our SASE platform has the recently integrated AI-based monitoring, incremental capabilities to manage AI applications, and even more recently, the Prisma Access Browser, which we will talk more about in a minute. Whilst our SASE customers grew 20%, more interestingly, 40% of our SASE customers this quarter are net-new to Palo Alto Networks. This is exciting since it creates a future opportunity post implementation to drive consistency by evolving these customers to the full network security platform. This was true for the financial services customer I mentioned. In addition to landing these SASE customers, we also have seen success driving large deals with SASE transactions over $1 million and contract value up 40% in Q1. Critical sustaining our NetSec performance are investments we're making innovation. We released an enhanced security capability for operational technology environments to address the growing challenges our customers face as the number of non-IT connected devices accelerate. Challenges in OT environments include a need for more visibility, a lack of segmentation, and unsanctioned remote access. We have brought Precision AI to bear on this challenge along with our new line of ruggedized firewalls. We also saw strong interest from customers in our broad secure AI-by-Design portfolio with AI access leading the way. Our teams have been busy driving customer engagement and we have hundreds of customers leveraging AI access. We currently secure over 750 AI applications, a volume which we believe leads the industry, and are growing this figure by the day. We are also providing in line data loss prevention for more than 65 applications with this number growing as well. Lastly, as part of our generative availability release of our Copilot capabilities across our three platforms, we rolled out the Strata Copilot. In our development process, we prioritize delivering superior accuracy and we've had fantastic feedback. The Strata Copilot trained on nearly 50,000 vetted sources, leverages best practices to help guide customers to faster decisions and help accelerate remediation. We have made a version of Copilot available to our customer support teams, which is beginning to positively impact our time to resolving customer issues, which we believe will continue to improve significantly going forward. I want to spend a few minutes on the Prisma Access Browser. We acquired Talon Cybersecurity in December of last year. We knew this technology would become increasingly important to secure unmanaged devices such as those used by contractors. We saw an opportunity to acquire high-quality scarce assets and be first a natively integrated secure browser into a SASE offering. Since then, we have been integrating the Talon browser with our leading security, DLP, and access services and leveraging our broader network security capabilities. This has resulted in a much more robust secure enterprise browser, our Prisma Access Browser. What has been rewarding has been the surge in interest and emergence of various use cases. The browser is the ideal place to counter targeted attacks such as phishing, secure privileged users, and enable access to risky web applications. Customers are deploying Prisma Access Browser as an additional security control that is transparent to the end user. Customers running the hardware business on SaaS applications and leveraging emerging AI applications are especially seeing the benefits of Prisma Access Browser as a critical end user security control. Also, the replacement of Virtual Desktop Infrastructure or VDI is also starting to emerge as an opportunity. This is a legacy technology for which users are collectively unhappy. We are working to expand the pool of VDI users, which you can address by adding new protocols such as SSH and RDP and securely enabling mobile device users. Adding our ADEM capabilities browser can further enhance the end user experience with Prisma Access Browser compared to VDI. We have seen significant commercial transactions for Prisma Access Browser with over 115 new customers and 1 million licenses sold since the time of the Talon acquisition. This traction of Talon to Network SASE customers, including some of our largest customers highlights our ability to successfully integrate the innovation and the innovative technologies that we acquire and rapidly take to market. Prisma Access has about 16 million active licenses today. Our enterprise customers, the largest Prisma Access cohort, are now eligible to leverage this license to adopt Prisma Access Browser. We're seeing strong interest in this newly integrated capability. Now moving on to Cortex. Our strong momentum in this business continued with us crossing the $1 billion ARR milestone in Q1, as I mentioned before. We have built the Cortex portfolio steadily over the last six years, starting with XDR. Our Cortex offerings have both been recognized as leaders in their markets, but also work together seamlessly as a platform that can deliver superior security operations outcomes for our customers. In Q1, our leadership position continued to be reinforced by third-party recognitions, including from Gartner in endpoint protection, Forrester and Attack Surface Management, and KuppingerCole in security automation, orchestration response, or SOR. XSIAM is a standout within Cortex and we have made significant progress since its release of GA about two years ago. We continue to deliver both strong innovation and commercial momentum with XSIAM, released over 400 new machine-learning detection modules leveraging Precision AI to broaden the scope of our autonomous stock capabilities. We now have over 150 active XSIAM customers, about 40 of which have more than $1 million in ARR. We also rolled out a program for managed security service providers in Q1. One of the key highlights this quarter has been our partnership with IBM, including the QRadar transaction that closed this quarter. This is an amazing burgeoning relationship. I'm excited about the early momentum we're seeing from customers to migrate from QRadar to XIAM. Following the close of the deal end of August, we have added over 550 QRadar SaaS customers to our Cortex customer base. Since announcing the transaction, we have seen a number of customers sign QRadar to XIAM transaction for a total TCV of so far over $80 million as we execute against our well-planned go-to-market programs. Over 500 active XIAM customer opportunities on the pipeline across the full SaaS and on-prem QRadar base worth over $1 billion in total value. We're also seeing further opportunity across this customer set with broader Cortex offerings. This opportunity we see is global with over half of the installed base outside the United States. We believe that this deal will help us to become one of the top three players in the SIEM space over the upcoming years. Beyond our success in Cortex and with XIAM specifically, I want to highlight another trend we see in the market. Many of the attacks we see on our customers are targeting their cloud environments. The pace of change in cloud is far faster than on-prem, it's challenging for security teams to keep up with as new code is sometimes being pushed multiple times per day and new cloud services are constantly being adopted by developers. This demand for real-time cloud security is driving us to bring together the capabilities of our leading CNAP portfolio, Prisma Cloud and our Cortex security operations capability to stop cloud attacks. Against this backdrop, we have sold millions of cloud detection and response agents with these deployments up 10 times in the two quarters since the April launch of our new offering. This has helped drive our combined Prisma Cloud and Cortex customer base, which is up 15% year-over-year. Interestingly, about a third of our Prisma Cloud customers already use at least one Cortex product. Our combined portfolio can bring superior security, value, and operational improvement to our customers. We recently released a new capability, integrating our XSOAR automation capability in Cortex with our Data Security Posture Management or DSPM in Cloud to automate the remediation of data security risks identified. We also released our AI Copilots for Prisma Cloud and Cortex to general availability. While early in their adoption, we see the significant promise here, driving towards security operations that are machine-led and human-empowered. In our Cortex Copilot beta, nearly half of users trusted to take security actions on their behalf. With the recent flurry of conversations around GenTech AI, we have begun embedding capabilities across our Copilots. We believe this Agentic vision of AI will be hugely impactful in security and we're moving swiftly to adopt that into our products. We continue to drive innovation in our cloud security offerings. We released DSPM from our Dig acquisition. We integrated that into Prisma Cloud to counter the rise in cloud data attacks. These critical DSPM capabilities enable customers to trace potential attack paths in their cloud environment to determine what sensitive data is at risk, appropriately prioritize their response and remediate automatically. Along with our overall launch of Secure AI by Design, our AI runtime and AI-SPM offerings targeted in cloud environments have also seen positive early traction. Lastly, we also launched another program for managed security providers as customers to enable partners to deliver security services in their customer cloud environment. Before I wrap up and hand the call over to Dipak, I'm going to leave you with a few thoughts. One, we're seeing growing industry validation of our strategy with Q1 marking yet another steady quarter of progress. Platformization is fueling the growth of our NGS ARR and puts us on track to hit our long-range targets as we drive sustainable profitable growth. We're signing large transactions with leading global organizations because our approach delivers better security outcomes than the alternative. Over the last six years, we have integrated our solutions across three AI-powered platforms, and this approach is driving our business. We believe we have the best network cloud and security operational platforms and we will continue to invest across these areas and keep them ourselves at the forefront of the nexus of cybersecurity and AI. Over time, we will steadily bring these platforms closer together to solve problems, leveraging our integrated capabilities and common data. We hear our customers asking for it and we are delivering on it today with real-time security across Cloud and Cortex. We also intend to lead these platform convergence opportunities that arise in the future. As you can see in Q1, our conviction in platformization and momentum gives us the confidence to make significant investments, notably in innovation. I believe we are the only dedicated cybersecurity company with the resources and focus to drive consistent innovation and harness a substantial dedicated go-to-market capability to fuel our differentiated strategy. We are releasing capabilities that our single form factor competitors' network security are not able to offer such as our natively integrated browser in SASE. Our leading Cloud and SecOps portfolio position us to lead in real-time cloud detection and response. We're also seeing good early signs from our product and go-to-market investments around the opportunity to curate our customer base to accelerate our XIM momentum further. As for securing AI itself, our Secure AI by Design portfolio is off to a great start, enabling organizations to confidently and securely leverage AI in the enterprise. If I look at the broader technology industry, we have seen evergreen companies that successfully execute on a platform approach in markets such as CRM, HR, ITSM. We think this will happen in cyber security and we are poised to be that company. Boiling this down to the impact on our fiscal year 2025 outlook, we are raising our full-year '25 NGS ARR, revenue, and EPS on the back of the strong performance. Also reflecting our belief in the company's future and the momentum and confidence we have in our strategy, we announced a two-for-one stock split. This was also done to help ensure our shareholders accessible to all -- our shares are accessible to all employees and investors. I'll now turn the call over to Dipak to give you more details of our Q1 performance and higher guidance.
Dipak Golechha: Thank you, Nikesh, and good afternoon, everyone. To maximize our time spent on Q&A, I will provide you with highlights of Q1. You can review the results in our press release and the supplemental financial information on our website. Note that we have removed billings and added NGS ARR and RPO to our supplemental financials, reflecting our focus on the latter metrics. In Q1, total revenue was $2.14 billion and grew 14%, above the high end of our guidance. Within revenue, product revenue grew 4%, while total services revenue grew 16%. Drilling into services revenue, subscription revenue grew 21% and support revenue rose 8%. As Nikesh mentioned, the demand for firewall appliances was stable in Q1 and we continue to expect growth of 0% to 5% as we have previously discussed. Our support revenue is mainly tied to our appliance form factor. Moving on to geographies, we saw double-digit revenue growth across all of our theaters with the Americas growing 12%, EMEA up 21% and JAPAC growing 13%. Total RPO grew 20% to $12.6 billion. We added approximately $68 million in RPO sequentially from the acquisition of the QRadar SaaS business. Approximately $30 million of this RPO was also included in our deferred revenue. Our current RPO grew 18% to $5.9 billion. The average duration of our new contracts remained at approximately three years, in line with the year-ago quarter and slightly down from Q4. Our NGS ARR grew 40%, finishing Q1 at $4.52 billion. We added $74 million in NGS ARR from QRadar SaaS. We expect this QRadar NGS ARR to decline to approximately half this amount by Q4 as we focus on upgrading these customers to XSIAM and growing our XSIAM ARR. Also, it is worth noting that about a third of our new platformizations in Q1 came from QRadar. These customers have both -- both have over $100,000 in QRadar ARR and our active customers of Cortex XDR and/or Cortex XSOAR. That is a one-time increase as we completed the acquisition. Moving down the income statement. Gross margin of 77.3% was down slightly as we saw the impact of some of our new SaaS offerings that haven't yet scaled. We continue to see efficiencies across the Company as we focus on driving profitable growth. This resulted in 60 basis points of operating margin expansion and along with some higher interest and other income, drove upside to our earnings per share. Our diluted GAAP EPS continues to grow along with our overall profitability and we generated strong free cash flow in Q1 based on collections of our substantial Q4 bookings. On our balance sheet, you will see that our debt balance came down by over $300 million. We have continued to see early conversion of our convertible debt, which occurred at the option of the debt holders and was settled by us in cash and equity. Our remaining debt matures in June 2025 although we may continue to see early conversions. We did not repurchase any shares in Q1, and our buyback strategy remains opportunistic. We continue -- we have $1 billion in authorization remaining through December 2025. Before I turn to guidance, I wanted to touch on the early impact we saw as we shifted our focus squarely to RPO and NGS ARR as our top-line metrics. We did this believing it would help further drive company-wide behavior to optimize our business for long-term value creation, and we are encouraged by the early results in Q1. As we drove sales enablement and training to kick off the year, we focused the teams on maximizing exit ARR and deal profitability as compared to specific invoicing structures. I'm encouraged by some early signs we saw in Q1 where we reduced cycle times within certain steps of our deal close process. We also saw a handful of larger deals that work their way through the process, more smoothly than in the past. For example, a seven-figure SASE deal with one of the world's largest semiconductor companies accelerated through our process after we structured the deal around annual billings as compared to prior PAN-FS proposals which would have needed longer scrutiny and approvals at our customer. In another seven-figure transaction for XDR with a healthcare customer, we were able to structure a deal to accommodate the customers' payment terms requirements while focusing on maximizing exit ARR. We look forward to building on this to drive further improvements in predictability in our business as we focus squarely on NGS ARR and profitability in our deals. In Q1, we focused our PAN-FS financing capability on transaction where it was best suited, resulting in a meaningful reduction in the volume of these transactions. Instead of PAN-FS, we leveraged annual invoicing, which can be simpler for customers, especially when procuring SaaS offerings. Last quarter, I mentioned to you that we would have expected our billings to grow 12% this fiscal year if we did not change any of the practices in our business that impact billings. After reviewing Q1 results, this would continue to be true under the same assumptions. The quarterly analysis of billings is no longer meaningful as it does not reflect how we now run the business. Based on our Q1 performance, we also remain confident in our cash flow outlook for the year. With that, let me turn to guidance. For the fiscal year 2025, we expect NGS ARR to be in the range of $5.52 billion to $5.57 billion, an increase of 31% to 32%. As a reminder, this guidance includes the contribution of QRadar SaaS of about half of the approximately $74 million in ARR from QRadar in Q1 as well as incremental momentum in our NGS offerings Nikesh and I discussed. Remaining performance obligation of $15.2 billion, $15.3 billion, an increase of 19% to 20%. Revenue to be in the range of $9.12 billion to $9.17 billion, an increase of 14%. Operating margins to be in the range of 27.5% to 28%. Diluted non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $6.26 to $6.39, an increase of 10% to 13%, and adjusted free cash flow margin in the range of 37% to 38%. For the second fiscal quarter, we expect NGS ARR to be in the range of $4.70 billion to $4.75 billion, an increase of 35% to 36%. Remaining performance obligation of $12.9 million to $13.0 billion, an increase of 20% to 21%, and revenue to be in the range of $2.22 billion to $2.25 billion, an increase of 12% to 14%. We expect diluted non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.54 to $1.56 per share, an increase of 5% to 6%. We included our typical modeling points in the presentation for you to review. Finally, as Nikesh noted, we announced today a two-for-one split of Palo Alto Networks common stock. This decision is supported by underlying confidence in our continued business momentum and by our desire to make our stock more accessible to our employees and the broader group of investors. Shareholders of record at the close of trading on December 12, 2024 will receive one additional share after the close of training on December 13, 2024, for every outstanding share held on December 12. Our stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on December 16, 2024. With that, we will roll on more video, and then we will start Q&A. [Video Presentation]
A - Walter Pritchard: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Saket Kalia from Barclays followed by Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, Saket.
Saket Kalia: Okay, great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and nice start to the year. Maybe this is a question for both you Nikesh and Dipak. The platformization strategy is clearly starting to hit its stride. And we've talked about the ARR implications of that longer term, specifically the long-term ARR target. But I'm curious if we can just talk about the margin implications from platformization long term as those deals tend to be bigger and also tend to have higher lifetime value.
Nikesh Arora: Well, I'm going to add Dipak to add. If look at margin, if you look at the biggest cost on any enterprise company's P&L, it's a cost of sales by far. The second largest cost is your COGS as it relates to cloud spend. Now, we are privileged to have some amazing deals with two large cloud service providers, which allow us to maintain margins that are consistent almost with on-prem solutions that other people do because of our scale, and we expect that to continue to improve over time. So that -- at one end, that's a significant factor. The second significant factor towards margin improvement is, as I mentioned, cost of sales. So the more we can platformize with existing customers and have large deal sizes with customers, it reduces our effort but you don't have to get 20 deals to get $200 million like some of our peers, you get one deal for $200 million, which means the cost of sales is lower on an incremental basis as we established a land and expand strategy from a customer perspective. And last but not the least, I sort of alluded to it, we're noticing some very interesting outcomes from a customer support perspective, which ends up being the third largest area of cost. We're seeing, in some cases, our Tier 1 support cases are getting solved by support Copilots, which our support teams are using. So we're significantly reducing the time to resolution of support tickets at least on the sort of simpler end for now. But as I said, we've trained 50,000 data points into our Network Security Copilot. I think as we get better and better at training our models and training their customer support Copilots, where we've fully revamped the way we collect data on customer issues, I think there's tremendous potential there to give us future margin expansion. So I think across the Board, margin expansion on COGS, margin expansion from lower cost of sales, and margin expansion from customer support automation.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks, Saket for the question. Next up is Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank, followed by Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, Brad.
Brad Zelnick: Great. Thanks so much and congrats on a strong start to the year. Nikesh, your net set competitors are talking about hardware refresh cycles. And I appreciate hardware is a much smaller part of your mix. So I won't bother asking why you're not expecting a refresh benefit like they are.
Nikesh Arora: But we look forward to their refresh cycle. So we get a chance to take out their customers last Palo Alto. So I'm delighted there's a refresh cycle in the market.
Brad Zelnick: And that's exactly what I wanted to ask. Instead, how should we think about their refresh impacting your opportunity, both in the positive sense that you can go in and displace them as their boxes reach end of life, but also perhaps as a headwind? If they're using the event to bundle in SASE SecOps and other next-gen capabilities. Are you running campaigns actively to go after this? Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: So, Brad, let me parse that out actually. I know I spoke faster and English is my second language. So, I did try to suddenly land in there that I am positive about hardware, where I said we're seeing steady growth in hardware, both from refreshes of boxes for our customers. We're seeing expanded demand for new use cases like ruggedized and IoT, et cetera. And last but not the least, we are seeing slow and steady takeouts of other customers. So what's happening is our SASE cohort from two or three years ago, we landed with SASE. As that end of life happens in that customer base for firewalls, they turn to us and say, now I know the Palo Alto security interface, I don't have to learn it and they can just put firewalls, hardware firewalls against that SASE management pain because we have the same security management pain across SASE. It's not going to be revolutionary, but it is going to be evolutionary. If you look every year, our market share in hardware firewalls goes up 200 basis points to 300 basis points. So we think there are donors in the market of market share who will constantly keep donate market share as they hit their refresh cycles. And there are acquirers of market share, and we're hopefully one of those. So I actually have a steady expectation from product hardware which I think is going to underpin our growth across the Board over the next few years.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks for the question, Brad. Next is Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley, followed by Brian Essex from JPMorgan. Hamza, go ahead.
Hamza Fodderwala: All right. Great. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. And great to see the success with the Prisma Access Browser, you're into that acquisition. Nikesh, I wanted to get your -- just maybe early view into 2025. I mean, on the one hand, there's some optimism on the macro. You have a lot of new products. On the other hand, CIO, CSOs they still want value for what they're spending. There's some talks about the incoming administration looking to perhaps roll back certain regulations, maybe cut entire civilian agencies. You're a big seller into the federal government. So I'm just curious how you weigh those puts and takes as you look into 2025. Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you, Hamza, for a great question. Look, I think the most -- if you separate signal and noise, the biggest signal is AI in the next 12 to 48 months. And AI is already having significant impact both on the attack side, attacks are getting faster and faster and quicker. AI is possibly being used to evaluate what are the more vulnerable parts of your infrastructure, so we can go after that. So I think from a cyber incident perspective, unfortunately, it's not going to slow down. And that's the biggest driver of improved security posture and improve higher spend from CIOs. I think you're right. There is a consolidation. Let me spend less money for security. And there, we are discovering -- it's a more top-down motion than it is a bottom-up motion. And as you're aware, we are expending a lot of effort to interacting with CIOs and C-level executives. And actually, we're spending a lot more time with our GSI partners trying to address that issue because they are typically involved in the transformation stage where say, let's take all of the stuff and put it together and replace it. So we're seeing early success. As I said, we should have done that sooner because when you sit across this, I say, look, you have nine different products, you could bundle it together, take it down, have one management pain and you'll save a lot of cost because and they understand, because we're not ingesting data nine times across nine products or in just to get once analyzing it nine times, and giving them the outcomes they want. So I think the trend is in our favor. As regards to the incoming administration, I think clearly, a higher standard deviation administration by the sounds of it, and higher standard deviation implies more risk and more risk implies possibly a more return.
Walter Pritchard: All right. Thank you, Hamza. Next up is Brian Essex from JPMorgan, followed by Joe Gallo from Jefferies. Go ahead, Brian.
Brian Essex: Great. Thanks, Walter. Thank you for taking my question. And great to see the strong profitability and cash flow, by the way. I want to ask about the integration between Cortex and Cloud. And I wanted to understand when did that kind of hit the market. Is it typically led by Cortex or Cloud? And how should we think about how that positions you competitively, not just in the cloud security market, but across all of Strata, Prisma, Cortex segments of the business?
Nikesh Arora: So look, at a higher level, the Cloud market is effectively right now, three parts, right? There's the entire configuration management part, which is the CNAP part and posture management part. There is the blocking real-time threats and protecting enterprises part, which is the CDR cloud detection response part. And then there's a cloud -- the network traffic that needs to be inspected from a firewall perspective. We're clearly leaders in the network traffic part. As we talked about, 70% of our use case is not public-facing cloud service provider traffic. We are still one of the leaders in the CNAP space from our early start in Prisma Cloud. But what I think is going to happen in the next few years, this market is going to shift more and more toward the real-time security side on Cloud, which is where CDR, cloud SOCs, XSIAM become more and more important. So almost every one of our XSIAM deals, there is a portion of that is deployed toward cloud security now. And having that data together allows us to prioritize all the configuration issues and separate again, signal from noise. So, I'm going to let Lee describe a bit more about how we see that evolving. But I think that will change the cast of characters who are going to win in Cloud Security in the future.
Lee Klarich: Yeah. Thanks, Nikesh. Thanks, Brian, for the question. Picking upward where Nikesh left off, the -- if you think about sort of end-to-end cloud security, there's the -- all of the work that goes into sort of the cloud posture side, generates a lot of data and understanding about what assets are deployed, what workloads are deployed, how they're configured, how they might be vulnerable or susceptible to attack, and by connecting that with CDR, it allows us to both leverage that for better protection of the cloud workloads in real-time. And vice versa, it allows us to leverage all the run time, cloud run time components back into posture from a remediation perspective. And so -- we initiated this earlier this year with the initial launch of CDR, which basically connects Prisma Cloud with Cortex. And then since then, we've been continuing to iterate on that and drive closer and closer integration between those two platforms.
Brian Essex: Great. Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks, Brian. Next up, Joe Gallo from Jefferies, followed by Matt Hedberg from RBC. Go ahead, Joe.
Joe Gallo: Hey guys, thanks for the question. I think you could characterize cyber guidance broadly for calendar 4Q, is tepid at best. But yet your F 2Q guide calls for an acceleration in RPO and a really strong ARR. So I mean, what are you seeing with budget flush or Fed or pipeline that's allowing you to kind of defy the gravity that others are feeling? Thanks.
Dipak Golechha: Well, I think we covered a lot of these, Joe, in our prepared remarks. I mean, we've got a product portfolio that we feel very proud of. We've just recently done an IBM acquisition, where we have a lot of additional pipeline that's coming through the pipe there. And hopefully, we've proven over the last few years that we have a forecasting process that we feel comfortable, like, manages the business. So I don't want to comment about others, but we really focus more on what we see. And maybe your comment is just proof positive that our platformization strategy is working and is somewhat unique.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks for the question, Joe. Matt Hedberg, go ahead, followed by Gregg Moskowitz after that.
Matt Hedberg: Thanks for taking my questions, guys. What stood out to me, the large deal success was striking. I know you spent a lot of time talking about platformization. It seems like Q1 brings a whole another level to it. Could you talk about specifically on the SIEM side of it? The NGS, it really does seem like there's a next-gen SIEM replacement opportunity here. And we've talked a lot about some of the competitors with Splunk. Can you talk about just like what could -- what are some of the catalysts that could unlock some of these large replacement deals? I know they take a long time, but curious if there's anything that you guys can do to accelerate that.
Nikesh Arora: Matt, look, we're very happy in two years since going GA on XSIAM, we're positively enthused about the progress we've made. We've crossed $1 billion in ARR and Cortex. We're seeing larger and larger XSIAM deals. We have 150 customers. And as we already mentioned, have a robust pipeline north of $1 billion. And this is the fastest-growing product in the history of cybersecurity at scale. Now the good news is, there are two or three very interesting characteristics of the SIEM market. If you look at the SIEM market, 90% of the SIEMs are of technology that is 10 to 15 years old. If you go back and look at the history of what SIEMs are, whether QRadar, LogRhythm, Exabeam, Jazz, Sumo Logic, Splunk, these things are 10 -- 7, 10, 15 years old. I think there's a new breed of SIEM players that is fast coming in to replace these legacy SIEMs. I think we're going to go through a SIEM replacement cycle that we went through the endpoint replacement cycle from Symantec and McAfee to the XDR vendors. I think it is a moment of SIEM now for the next five years. Now interestingly, every SIEM deal that we see, we are able to deliver a much better security posture and median time to remediate and detect, which is better than the current deployment and we're able to save cost. So from a compelling proposition perspective, this is a no-brainer. You come and say, I know you're spending $10 million a year running your stock. I can do it for $9 million. I can consolidate and I can improve your median time to remediate from four days in many cases from 19 minutes to four hours. So that's a compelling proposition. We are seeing tremendous amount of interest in the market. We have created a compelling event in the case of QRadar customers because they have to migrate to us or elsewhere, and we're seeing enough traction where people are considering Palo Alto instead. So I think in the next three to five years, you will notice that the entire $20 billion TAM of SIEM is going to go through upheaval.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks for the question, Matt. Next up, Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho followed by Rob Owens from Piper Sandler. Go ahead, Gregg.
Gregg Moskowitz: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Nikesh, now that we're a few quarters into the platformization go-to-market, I'd love to get a little more of a flavor of how it's going. Is there an aspect for two of the strategy that's been most successful so far. For example, if you were to look at traction with legacy trade-ins versus introductory offers or more multiproduct incentives, what would you say is resonating the most with customers?
Nikesh Arora: Thing that seems to resonate the most, Greg, is elimination of execution risk. And what I mean by that is when I go to go to a customer saying, okay, let's go do this in a phased manner. We'll replace your SASE or deploy SASE for you and then Phase 2 will come in and replace their firewalls, they like that. If I say don't worry, I'll start executing today and you can start paying me when you stop being the other vendor, that's kind of the -- that's like the golden bear hug because the biggest risk they have is wait I have to go extend another deal by one year. Guess what, that you're sending a signal to the other vendor, you're out in the air, so the prices go up. And I say, don't worry about it. Let's start executing now were deployed, you can pay me when the current contract expires. So that elimination risk is resonating the most. Again, the customers fully understand that we're going to get our pound of flesh in the year two or year three of that deal. So they understand there is no free lunch. But eliminating that execution risk goes a long way. I think the -- as I said to Hamza and I said in our prepared remarks, it really helps us step back and say, look, what are you trying to achieve? I mean, in many cases, we've been able to converge XDR and SIEM RFPs, for example, saying, listen, 50% of the data is going to go into XDR, which is going to be one vendor. That data is needed for AI-based or machine learning-based analysis across the entire stack. Why wouldn't you make sure that, that data can be part of the same and be used to improve your posture and get better, faster outcomes?
Gregg Moskowitz: Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thank you, Greg. Next question, Rob Owens from Piper Sandler, followed by Gray Powell from BTIG.
Rob Owens: Yeah, thanks, Walter. And Nikesh, as a part of your prepared remarks, I would love for you to build on the data security. And another one of the holy grails alongside next-generation SIEM, of course, is data that everybody is chasing. So what you're seeing from end customers? I know you made acquisitions of a DSPM capability in the space. But how you see Palo Alto's evolution longer term relative to the data opportunity? Thanks.
Nikesh Arora: Rob, this is my perfunctory question. I have to give to Lee otherwise, he…
Rob Owens: Sounds good.
Lee Klarich: Thanks, Rob. The -- look, if you take a step back, data securities is a long-standing sort of product category that's often been very painful. It's difficult to be accurate in data classification. It's difficult to figure out what policies to enforce and it's difficult to do that holistically everywhere the data might exist and need to be protected, right? There’s -- so there's two pieces to our data security strategy that you've seen us evolve. First is around getting coverage of all the places where data might exist and improving the data classification capabilities within those. So over the last six months, we've launched AI-based data classification, leveraging large language models, machine learning models to get more and more accurate in the data classification, being able to apply that to all different places where data can exist and move. The second piece and very importantly, is the tie-in with Prisma Access Browser. The way that users interact with data, access it, download it, share it is one of the highest-risk areas for data security. And historically, it's been very difficult to get all of the necessary context for enforcing an accurate policy. Within the Secure Browser, we get all of the context needed. And what we're already seeing with the early adopters of Prisma Access Browser is the realization that this One component of what it does is effectively a next-gen data security component for how they secure data interaction with all of their employees. And this is part of the reason why the browser is expanding from being primarily focused on unmanaged devices and third-party contractors to actually being something that applies to all devices and all users across the entire enterprise.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks, Rob, for the question there. Next up is Gray Powell, BTIG, followed by Andy Nowinski from Wells Fargo. Go ahead, Gray.
Gray Powell: All right. Great. Thanks for letting me ask a question on the call. Really appreciate it. So, I have to admit, I'm a little confused on the NGS ARR statistics. If I look at the numbers, and back out the QRadar deal, you added around $230 million in net new ARR this quarter versus $270 million a year ago. That metric has never been down on a year-over-year basis before. So is there I’m something or something with the acquisition that maybe I'm not thinking about? Or just like what was the driver there? And then for the full-year increase in NGS ARR, how much of that is organic versus full visibility on the QRadar asset?
Dipak Golechha: So let me answer both, Gray, and let me just start off with the NGS ARR was above our guidance. So some of this, we already knew when we provided the guidance, but -- some of the products that move into NGS ARR have also been the advanced versions of our cloud subscriptions from a year ago, so things that were attached to our firewalls, where we made them cloud-enabled. Some of that happened last year, which is what led to a lot of the increase in the ARR. We're now lapping that. We're not -- so that's really the bigger explanation of the base. We knew that. That's why we included that in our guidance to begin with. When it comes to what's happening with QRadar, we talked about the one-time benefit. Our strategy is to convert all of the customers to XSIAM. Over time, we expect about half of that to occur within this year. So we would expect maybe half of that additional NGS ARR to be there by the end of the year.
Nikesh Arora: Gray, I think to recast what Dipak said, you have seen the peak inorganic NGS ARR this quarter at $74 million, or is that the number, from IBM. And half of that, we will migrate to us, and we expect half of that still stay on QRadar for -- through the end of this fiscal year. So there's no more net new inorganic NGS ARR expected this year.
Gray Powell: Understood. Okay. Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: All right. Great. Thanks, Gray. Next up, Andy Nowinski from Wells Fargo, followed by Fatima Boolani from Citi. Go ahead, Andy.
Andy Nowinski: Great. Thank you. Good afternoon and great results this afternoon. I wanted to ask you about the Prisma SASE. You highlighted a number of large deals that either deployed SASE or the expanded with SASE. And I know it's bringing a lot of new customers, which is great. But I was wondering if you could provide an update on the growth of ARR from that solution, whether those new customers you're bringing into Palo Alto onto the platform, are coming at the expense of other vendors? Or are those -- were they just not using any SASE solution previously? Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: So, Andy, all of the above, there are some customers who are going through a network transformation and they're now replacing their legacy VPN clients or other solutions they've had in the past. In some cases, there are competitor vendors who only had an Internet proxy-based deployment with the legacy VPN or in some cases, with Palo Alto VPN, which is converting to a full SASE solution from us. So we see all variants of that, as we said, 40% of that are net new logos to us, which means they are not deploying a Palo Alto VPN. They're deploying our SASE solution. So we're seeing all of that. I just think the SASE market, as I said in the past, is a fast-growing market. We have clearly established ourselves one of the top three players in the market. I think we're definitely growing faster than some of the others, one or at least one more of the other top three players in the market. And we particularly like the SASE space because we're always innovating, providing new stuff as we basically -- as I said in my remarks, we've made it available to every existing SASE customers. They can deploy Prisma Access Browser for the unused licenses. So they can actually experience the browser. It's integrated. It's in the same management pain. It's the same UI. Yes. So I guess I feel positive about it. We haven't quite reached $1 billion yet as the way we told you, but we're looking forward to it.
Andy Nowinski: Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks, Andy. Fatima Boolani from Citi is up next. And our last question will be from Roger Boyd from UBS. Fatima, go ahead.
Fatima Boolani: Thank you. Good afternoon. I appreciate you taking my questions. I think the topic du jour is definitely QRadar and a lot of the momentum that you've been seeing that $80 million or more than $80 million of bookings that you've already seen in the short amount of time. What I wanted to actually shift gears on is on the on-premise side of the QRadar business. And, Nikesh, some of your commentary, which I think is so apropos, there is just a stodgy stale technology in the SIEM market, right? So that $500 million or so of revenue that is just still captive in the QRadar on-premise space, what is the thought process, the strategy to really forklift those customers to the goodies in XSIAM? And as you think about the arc of the next 12 to 24 months, how should we think about a multiplier effect on that business to really give Cortex booster shot to have it potentially be your biggest pillar?
Nikesh Arora: Yeah, Fatima, I -- we had our Board meeting yesterday, and one of my Board members and I had this debate about which deal is going to look like the best deal Palo Alto ever did. And my bet is in the IBM deal, he bet on the Talon deal. Of course, I like both of them equally successful. But specifically, as it relates to QRadar, our teams are very focused. Since close, we've called the top 500 customers and reached out to see if we can support the migration from QRadar to Palo Alto. This is irrespective of whether they are QRoC or on-prem. I mentioned the $1 billion pipeline. That $1 billion pipeline is a hybrid pipeline at both QRoC and on-prem customers. The message is out there to on-prem customers that this technology will also over time be migrated. And I have to say IBM is doing a phenomenal job working with us and being proactive with those customers where we go -- I had a call yesterday with the CIO or IBM and elsewhere together in the room where we're talking to the customers saying they will provide the migration services, they'll work on the migrating the rules from QRadar to Palo Alto XSIAM and we're going to do it together. So look, it's -- we haven't done a partnership like this ever in the history of our Company. I haven’t seen one in the cybersecurity industry yet. We have a lot of expectations, but it's a lot of execution, a lot of hard work. It's not going to happen because I snap my fingers, but -- our teams are focused, we're dedicated. We're trying to do that. I think this will propel us into the top three SIEM players in the market in the next two years from nowhere. We did not play in this space two years ago.
Fatima Boolani: Appreciate that.
Walter Pritchard: Thank you. Last question, Roger Boyd to wrap it up. Go ahead, Roger.
Roger Boyd: Great. Thanks, Walter. Dipak, you noted that the contract duration on new business remains constant at roughly three years. Can you comment on what you're seeing with renewal and upsell business? And particularly when customers are renewing on a platform deals and adopting XSIAM, which carries longer duration. I guess as we look to gauge the success of some of these platformization deals, shouldn't we expect to see contracts lengthen as customers place more strategic bets on your platform? Thanks.
Dipak Golechha: Yeah. So I think we're, Roger, thanks a lot for the question. Look, at the end of the day, we're a large company with lots of different customers. We're definitely seeing the dynamic that you mentioned on some customers. We also see dynamics where other customers are saying, look, I know there's a lot more innovation to come. Let me go shorter duration on the renewals because that could be ahead of the large platformization in the future. So we see a little bit of everything. I think on the renewals, just the data trended slightly up, but nothing significant.
Roger Boyd: Got it. Super helpful. Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thank you, Roger. And that will end the Q&A. I'll turn the call back over to Nikesh for his closing remarks.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you, everyone, once again for joining us. As I said, I'm very excited about our great start to FY '25. We look forward to seeing many of you at upcoming investor events. I also want to thank all of our employees who put a lot of hard work to help us deliver these amazing results. And also, of course, I want to thank all of our customers for trusting Palo Alto for delivering cybersecurity solutions to them. With that, have a wonderful day.

I will now turn the call over to Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you, Walter. Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us today for our earnings call. As most of you are aware, the intensity around technology reliance, connectedness, and as a consequence, cybersecurity continues to accelerate. Supply chains and interconnected systems have become the norm for better actors to target. By most metrics, cyber incidents and their impact continue to be on the rise. And we saw it in spades in Q4, notably the large scale breaches. A growing number of technology and business trends are further complicating the situation, creating additional challenges. The combination of these is getting further C-suite attention and focusing on the cybersecurity. Organizations increasingly rely on their IT system, and nothing makes this more evident than a significant outage or security breach. Over the last 6 months, financial damages from an individual breach topped a $1 billion. In other case, the impact on business was existential and required significant work dedicated to system recovery and rebuilding. Our Unit 42 Group is being called into customer crisis situations. You see a wide variation in breach situations, but ransomware remains a significant threat tying many together. The relatively new phenomena of public ransomware extortion is raising the profiles as challenge, as organizations need to deal with the pressures of public disclosure, before they have had time to do an early assessment. In addition, the time customers have to address an issue before damages escalate is shrinking. In fact, our research has found that in nearly half of cases, attackers can exfiltrate customer data in less than a single day of compromise. Geopolitical tensions remain at high levels as evidenced by multiple regional conflicts in the news. Cybersecurity activity is often elevated in these environments, and we see multiple non-government agencies impacted by this nation state activity. We have seen this trend building for a number of years. Customer environments have been more complex with the adoption of capabilities, such as work from anywhere, public cloud, and more recently, AI. This complexity is additive with old technologies that have not been retired. Meanwhile, a multitude of uncoordinated security defenses are simply layered on. The sprawling interconnectedness of business through their IT systems is multiplying the impact of a breach. Instead of breach impacts being isolated to a single company, we're seeing customers, suppliers, partners and others in ecosystem being severely impacted. This has been most prevalent in the healthcare and retail industries, but this could happen anywhere. A recent high-profile outage involving security tools has elevated the cybersecurity conversation further. In addition to wanting to better understand the security risks, the C-suite and Boards are also now digging deeper into the technologies being deployed to mitigate these risks. Meanwhile, AI continues to generate significant excitement in the market, and many organizations are starting to scale transformative use cases that can enable new sources of revenue and/or drive substantial efficiencies. AI adoption is proceeding at a rapid pace faster than honestly I've seen any other new technology. However, it is following a typical pattern. Innovation is driving the speed of adoption while security might be an afterthought. At the same time, adversaries are leveraging AI capabilities to broaden attacks, better target organizations, and scale their malicious activity beyond the capabilities of defenses that rely solely on humans. This environment, paired with an ever more challenging threat landscape and a complex set of point products that are not well integrated or even coordinated is driving a growing need for platformization. We saw this translate into an acceleration in our bookings in the second half of the year, following the role of our platformization strategy in fiscal year 2024. We're delighted with our Q4 results. We drove the top line ahead of the overall cybersecurity market and delivered improved profitability and strong cash generation. They exceeded our guidance range for quarterly revenue and EPS, while exceeding our original annual guidance ranges for operating margin and free cash flow. We also grew RPO 20%. We saw strong growth in our next generation security offerings, and we exceeded our next generation security our guidance significantly surpassing the $4 billion milestone in Q4. We grew NGS ARR 43% with strong contributions across the portfolio. And yet another milestone with $4.2 billion in NGS ARR to close out the year is more than half our fiscal year 2024 revenue. Remember six years ago when I started, this was zero. We completed the year by expanding operating margins by 320 basis points and achieving nearly 39% free cash flow margin, generating well over $3 billion of free cash flow. We also continue to deliver healthy GAAP profitability. I know there was significant consternation around our platformization strategy six months ago. All I want to say is, I wish, we started down that path sooner. The amount of interest and activity around it has certainly been heartening and shows promise. After a strong addition of approximately 65 new platformizations in Q3, we added over 90 new platformizations in Q4, now have well over 1,000 total platformizations amongst our 5,000 largest customers as we exit FY '24. Beyond the number of platformization, we saw something interesting. We saw a sequential increase in average ARR per platformized customer in Q4. For perspective, our average ARR per platformization is up over 10% since Q1. This effectively means as we convert our customers to platform customers and single platform customers to multi-platform customers, we see an uplift in ARR. This is an exciting development. Representing the rise in interest around platformization, senior-level customer meetings increased 70% year-over-year in the second half of the year and grew even faster in Q4. This engagement is key to aligning the customer senior team with our platformization strategy and its benefits. We have a growing team of our executives and sales leaders focused on these engagements worldwide. We expect platformization to be a key driver towards achieving our goal of $15 billion in NGS ARR in fiscal year 2030, and our Q4 performance bolsters our confidence in our ability to reach this goal. You heard from a customer in the intro video, and I wanted to give you some more stories to dimensionalize our success of platformization in Q4. As you saw in the video, we signed a high 8-figure deal. In fact, a very high 8-figure deal, [indiscernible] that started with executive engagement in our briefing center earlier in the year. They are an existing firewall and XSOAR customer. As part of the platformization, we expanded our firewall footprint, added Prisma Access of moving them closer to a Zero Trust network security implementation. Additionally, we added Prisma Cloud for cloud security, replacing an incumbent cloud security competitor. We also agreed to transfer their SIEM replacing two distinct SIEM offerings with the AI powered, next-generation SIM, XSIAM. They are now one of our marquee customers platformized across all three. We had a mid-eight figure platformization deal with global semiconductor manufacturer building on a five year relationship. We worked with the customer on a project to reduce their costs and achieve a more consistent security outcome. This led to a discussion on transforming the network security to Zero Trust. Initially, the customer agreed to deploy our Cortex platform. This approach was deemed more comprehensive and superior to a solution that was proposed, which comprised various point products from competitors, which would have to be stitched together. Third, the platformized global media company across all three of our network security form factors. The customer prioritized and focused on driving Zero Trust network transformation for an increasingly mobile workforce, while under significant cost pressures and dealing with the complexities of M&A integration. The customer is also leveraging XSOAR and XSIAM to improve automation and better understand their tax surface. Our team ultimately converted this lengthy sales cycle into a 9-figure deal. Lastly, a U.S. financial services firm is moving 90% of the applications to the public cloud, significantly reducing its data center footprint. In that process, they're looking to consolidate point solutions and simplify the management of their security environment. This customer expanded from its existing Cortex XDR and XSOAR footprint to add XSIAM, replacing again two incumbent SIMs. Additionally, the customer added firewall capacity and Prisma Cloud for cloud native applications to deploy a comprehensive cloud security solution to secure them both to the cloud. Now, I'll highlight the drivers of our momentum and key innovations across our three product platforms as we look towards fiscal 2025 and beyond. Over the last five years, we have driven a significant transition as an industry around more software-driven network security. Our strategy to deliver a comprehensive approach towards network security with hardware software form factors for both on-prem and cloud, and an industry's leading SASE solution is working. Not just that, our comprehensive set of software subscriptions work consistently across all these form factors. We continue to see our firewall platform billings growth growing in a healthy manner, up 17% in fiscal year 2024. While there's slower appliance growth around the industry, our NetSec growth has been driven by SASE and the software firewall business. Our firewall platform billings are now two-thirds of total, up from just over 40% two years ago. This year, our VM and SASE business grew 40% propelling this mix shift. Our software-based virtual firewall business continues to show strong results, but bookings accelerating the second half. Helping to drive this, we double our cloud next generation firewall business, which runs natively on top of our four hyperscalers. Along with cloud next-generation firewall, we're seeing an inflection of software firewall business as about 70% of their business this quarter was being used to protect the public cloud. These customers choose Palo Alto firewall instead of the firewall from the cloud service provider. Our customer momentum in SASE remains strong with customers growing by over 20%. Once again, in FY '24, more than one-third of our new SASE customers continue to be new to Palo Alto Networks. This is encouraging. We're effectively landing in network security with all three of our product families, allowing us to eventually drive platformization and move these customers to a Zero Trust platform. Our natively integrated enterprise browser has attracted more attention to our SASE offerings since the Talon acquisition. Not only is it now an integral part of SASE, we're also able to provide the customers an ability to protect the AI usage of their employees, both in our SASE and browser product. Beyond our software and SASE form factors, our cloud-based subscriptions are driving steady network security code. A significant driver is the advanced versions of four of our core subscriptions, modernized to be fully cloud delivered like newer subscriptions such as IoT and DLP. We have seen strong adoption of our first three advanced subscriptions, which carry a higher price point than our original subscriptions. Advanced URL Filtering, our first has been adopted by over half of our customers after three years in the market. We just launched Advanced DNS in Q4 and are excited to see it ramp as well. More broadly, we have seen the overall subscription attach rate per customer increase from 2.6 at the end of fiscal year 2022 to 3.5% today. We have 10 subscriptions that run across all of our network security offerings. Customers can buy these on our firewalls one-by-one, in bundles package for a specific network security use case, or as an enterprise license agreement to cover the entire state. Beyond the strong network security momentum, we are innovating to ensure we can continue to lead the network security market as software and SASE further drives growth. Some of the most important highlights are: Prisma Access browser. Following the position of Talon in Q2, we launched the industry's first and only enterprise browser, newly integrated with SASE this month. Leading up to launch, we saw strong interest in this technology with over a 100 customers adopting our Talon powered Prisma Access browser. The browser is available to our existing and new SASE customers. We have seen success with our autonomous digital experience management capability integrated with SASE, which helps customers proactively identify sources of downtime and ensure network availability for the hybrid worker and branch office. We followed that up by adding this capability to our firewall and have seen strong initial interest. We launched our AI Access offering enabling our organization's workforce to use AI tools with confidence, while giving security teams’ full visibility, robust controls, data protection, and proactive threat prevention measures. AI Access can easily be turned on for our over 5,000 Prisma Access customers. Following our early access program in July, we have now seen interest from over 1,000 customers to deploy AI access. Finally, leveraging our industry-leading virtual firewall capability, our AI runtime offering is experiencing strong interest from Prisma Cloud and network security customers looking to protect the AI applications, models, and data from threats. As we look forward, the direction of the network security market is as clear to us as it's ever been. We are focused on driving the benefits of platformization through our three network security form factors and getting our customers to true Zero Trust architecture delivers the best security with the lowest cost to operate. Turning to Prisma Cloud. The enterprise adoption of a public cloud is a generational change in IT that has been underway for at least half a decade. More recently, this has been fueled by the adoption of AI services in the public cloud. The public cloud must be secured differently than on premise environments, and we recognize this more than five years ago. In this highly competitive market, we have not only established ourselves the largest pure-play cybersecurity, cloud security business being the first to $700 million in ARR. We also have the broadest footprint of cloud security capabilities in the market. As a great confirmation of our leadership and innovation capability, leading/SaaS players have chosen Prisma Cloud to secure their production environments. We have CRM, HR, and collaboration leaders who all signed significant deals with us in fiscal year 2024. These players are amongst the most sophisticated users of public cloud technology, and hundreds of thousands of organizations trust them to operate a secure enterprise grade SaaS offering. We are proud to be able to showcase them as customers. Highlighting the comprehensiveness of our platform, we had a number of key innovations Q4 that show our ability to stay in the lead in this competitive market. For example, we released our 13th Prisma Cloud module data security posture management, based on the acquisition of Dig Security. The Dig team has moved quickly, not only releasing this module, but also helping to integrate data security comprehensively within Prisma Cloud. An important use case for securing data in the cloud is securing cloud native LLM-based applications. To address this need, we released AI security posture management, our 14th module. Lastly, we released cloud detection response capabilities, leveraging the best of Prisma Cloud and Cortex. CDR gives us all full visibility into security events in the cloud, as well as real time threat detection and remediation. With an increasing frequency and scale of breaches targeting cloud environments, CDR capabilities becoming critical differentiator and a comprehensive cloud security platform. As we close out the air along with the overall acceleration we saw in our second half business, our large deal business in Prisma Clouds was up its strong growth in new and expand business in Q4. As we look forward, we will ensure Prisma Cloud stays ahead of the CNAPP market new capabilities. We will bring new real time capabilities to the cloud and enable full cloud security integration to the SoC. These will be essential for our customers as public cloud and AI adoption broaden. Last but not the least, Cortex. Fiscal year 2024 was a watershed year for Cortex. We firmly established XSIAM as the transformation platform for security operations and continue to innovate across the broader Cortex portfolio. We also expanded the Cortex customer base, bringing us future opportunities for XSIAM and maintained ARR growth on a significantly increased scale. XSIAM achieved approximately $500 million in bookings in FY '24 alone, up more than 2x versus our fiscal year 2023. Our active customers are up 4x over the same time period. We finished the year with over 30 customers north of $1 million in XSIAM ARR. Customers are seeing the security outcomes that XSIAM can deliver, namely a dramatic production in the time to discover remediate security events. This is important in identifying signs of breach and stopping the activity before significant business interruption occurs. Our ability to deliver the substantial outcomes unlike any product we have sold, since the introduction of our original next generation firewall more than 15 years ago, and the growth of XSIAM is following a similar path. Beyond XSIAM, our momentum in Cortex continues with the business passing $900 million in ARR this year. The focus of our platformization efforts for Cortex is with XSIAM. Having closed out fiscal year 2024 with well north of 100 XSIAM customers, we have seen some amazing outcomes with deployed customers. More than 50% have achieved a median time resolution for security incidents of under 10 minutes, coming from days. After the first quarter deployment, these customers have then seen an additional 2x improvement in their median time to remediate. Looking forward, we have increased conviction that we can lead the transformation of any organization security operation center with XSIAM. We see a growing list of customers as an appetite for the outcome we can deliver, and we believe the market is at point that is ripe for disruption. We have a strategy of delivering additional value to our Cortex XDR XSOAR Xpanse customers by enabling them to platformize XSIAM. We also see a significant option to provide real time capabilities and cloud security where cloud detection response capabilities can help drive this opportunity. Lastly, we expect to close the IBM create our SaaS assets acquisition by the end of September. We're excited to work with our colleagues at IBM to bring XSIAM to their customers. It doesn't stop at XSIAM platformization. We're also equally excited about our newest launch, XSIAM for cloud. This allows organizations to comprehensively address cloud security issues as part of the security operations. Additionally, we are partnering with many service providers and system integrators to build capability together continue accelerating our XSIAM opportunity. And finally, a quick note on the recent widespread outages in the industry. I want to reiterate, our product uses an approach that deploys a 1% to 3% wide sample test cohort to ensure no issues, and then we release content updates in a phased manner. We have additionally enabled controls so customers can manage the update process and control it. The recent outage has caused a number of customers to reevaluate their options. They have initiated conversations with us around XDR and XSIAM. This, plus our industry leading cortex technology is appealing, as we've talked to everyone we have talked to so far, and we think it has potential to further drive our cortex momentum. When it came to Palo Alto Networks, we articulated a clear strategy that for our continued success, we needed to ensure our products were constantly improving. They were solving problems for our customers the best way possible, and also we are solving new problems. In other words, our success would depend on our product portfolio and product quality. I continue to be excited by our continued growing leadership position in cybersecurity categories. With our products, customers adopt the best-of-breed offering and eventually evolve to a platform approach. The results of our innovation are evident in the broad analyst recognition of our leadership position across 24 categories. This quarter, we added a new recognition in incident response services, a testament to our industry-leading capabilities in breach response and recovery. We also added a leadership recognition data security posture management, our 8th for Prisma Cloud. One last area to highlight. We continue to believe in the opportunity around AI. We think we are in the very early innings, and AI will be both a threat and opportunity. I'm particularly proud of our teams who stepped up and delivered this comprehensive suite of AI security solutions for our customers. We also continue to infuse AI into our platforms, allowing us to bring leading solutions to our customers. These AI solutions are off to a good start. We surpassed $200 million in AI ARR to close out the year. Underscoring the traction, the AI first products we've had in the market such as XSIAM and [indiscernible]. In May, we announced our suite of AI security offerings and launched our precision AI campaign featuring the TV ad with Keanu Reeves. For the last several weeks, we've released the announced product, namely AI Access, the AI Firewall or runtime security, and AI security posture management. We believe this makes us the first to market with a comprehensive portfolio for secure AI by design. Before I hand over the call to Dipak, I want to reflect on our journey and set some context as we discuss fiscal year 2025. Throughout fiscal year 2024, we saw a backdrop helping create interest in demand for enhanced cybersecurity. This helps to accelerate our bookings in the second half of the year. It is also reflected in our new platformization, as we close the year with strong momentum and our strong NGS ARR. FY '24 marked a seminal moment in our history. I feel our innovation engine is now leading the market, be it by showing enhancements to our SASE portfolio, our cloud security efforts, or in the SoC. We have new integrated solutions for our customers. Take AI, we believe we are the only scale cybersecurity player to lead the market in a comprehensive suite of AI solutions. We feel comfortable that, we're on track towards our target of making Palo Alto Networks the first $15 billion ARR security business. We have made decisions on how we run our business to maximize long-term ARR, shall aligns well with growing shareholder value. A select club of enterprise companies has scaled ARR business in front of us, and we intend to join the club. Dipak will cover in detail how we will evolve our external metrics in line with this. We closed the year with strong top-line growth, expanded our operating margins, and drove best-in-class cash conversion, and we are confident that we can continue this in fiscal year 2025 and beyond. With that, I will hand over to Dipak.
Dipak Golechha: Thank you, Nikesh, and good afternoon, everyone. To maximize our time spent on Q&A, I will provide you with highlights of Q4. You can review the results in our press release and the supplemental financial information on our website. In Q4, total revenue was $2.19 billion and grew 12%, above the high end of our guidance. Within revenue, product revenue declined 5%, while total services revenue grew 18%. Drilling into services revenue, subscription revenue grew 23%, and support revenue grew 10%. It is worthnoting that, product revenue grew 24% a year ago as the supply chain normalized, resulting in growth above our underlying demand in that period. Despite the tough Q4 comparison due to supply chain constraint reversals in the second half '23, fiscal '24 product revenue grew in the low single digit range, which is in line with our expectations. The firewall appliance market demand was stable in Q4, and we continue to expect growth of 0% to 5%, as we have previously discussed. Moving on to geographies. We saw revenue growth across all theaters with the Americas growing 11%, EMEA up 14%, and JAPAC growing 15%. We saw strength across all of our geographic theaters. Total RPO, a metric that better represents our top-line growth and billings, grew 20% to $12.7 billion. Our current RPO grew 17% to $5.9 billion. The average duration of our new contracts remained at approximately three years, in line with our third quarter. As Nikesh mentioned, our NGS ARR grew well past the $4 billion mark, ending the year at $4.22 billion and growing 43%. Strength in NGS ARR was broad-based across our three security platforms. We reported Q4 billings above the high end of our guidance, driven primarily by double-digits booking growth and higher volumes transacted on [pandas]. On our balance sheet, you will see that our debt balance came down by $199 million and is now under $1 billion. Like in Q3, this reduction was driven by the early conversion of our convertible debt, which occurred at the option of the debt holders and was settled for us in cash and equity. Our remaining debt matures in June 2025, although we may continue to see early conversions. We did not repurchase any shares in Q4, and our buyback strategy remains opportunistic. Our Board of Directors approved an additional $500 million buyback authorization, such that we now have $1 billion in authorization remaining through December 2025. I wanted to give you some context around our NGS ARR, RPO, billings, and total services revenue metrics. You can see the relatively steady trends in RPO and NGS ARR, which closely match the trend in total services revenue, while we have seen more volatility in billings. We've talked for a year now about the factors that impact our billings. Over a year ago, we began to see the impact of rising interest rates on how customers perceive the cost of money in procurement situations. This was causing many to ask for payments to be spread over multiple years, instead of an upfront payment. In response, we leveraged programs such as annual billings and our PANFS financing capability. The impact on billings varied based upon which program the customer chose and how the deal was structured. Also, during this fiscal year, we rolled out our platformization strategy, and we offered customers more flexibility in payment terms, when making large strategic commitments. This has had a further impact on our billings. In both of these situations, we found ourselves facing the choice of maximizing billings or focusing on NGS ARR, and we want all to have all of the incentives aligned to the latter. RPO and revenue are both important to understanding our business momentum. Revenue gives you the near-term view of our growth. Our RPO helps you understand the longer-term trend and the scale of our book of business that will drive revenue. This aggregate measure is driven by contracts we sign each quarter, and the long-term growth in RPO influences our revenue growth over time and gives you visibility into the future trend. As a reminder, the contracts included in our RPO are all non-cancelable and non-refundable in nature. We aspire to continue to grow RPO ahead of our target forward revenue growth rate as that helps us build confidence in these growth rates. Now focusing further on NGS ARR. As a reminder, NGS ARR is an important metric for us as it shows the return on the significant investments we've been making in the next generation areas of our cybersecurity market that are also growing the fastest. We expect these offerings will disproportionately drive our growth as we transform our revenue. Our recent rollout of platformization has sharpened our focus on maximizing ARR. For example, we started the account review process early in fiscal year 2024, to identify white space amongst the largest organizations globally and maximize ARR. As we followed up with the rollout of our platformization strategy, we focused not only on the total deal value or the cash collected upfront, but also on an exit ARR and profitability of the recurring revenue stream. We can accommodate customer points of friction, while maximizing this recurring revenue as we structure deals with customers to encourage their strategic adoption. These friction points include the challenge of replacing multiple products simultaneously and the issues around double paying, while working through complex contract terms. In making these short-term concessions to billings, we ensure a valuable long-term relationship with a deal that meets our and the customer's needs. I've talked to you about how NGS ARR and RPO are becoming more prominent in our focus, as we drive our platformization strategy. The shortcomings related to billings have become significant over the last 12 to 18 months and further increasing, as we drive our platformization strategy. In evolving our metrics, we solicited the input of some of our largest shareholders and looked at how our peer companies are giving guidance. Investor feedback was that, quarter-to-quarter billing volatility is merely a distraction, and it does not impact our assessment of the shareholder value we can create over the medium and long-term. We've seen a number of companies disclose ARR and adopt an RPO-related metric to help investors better understand the business trajectory, some of those companies include Adobe, Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Workday. As a result, beginning this quarter, we will focus on NGS ARR as our key top-line guidance metric, in addition to revenue. We will provide NGS ARR guidance both quarterly and annually. We will also provide total RPO guidance quarterly and annually this year to help investors understand the size of our book of committed contracts, compared to their future expectations for our revenue. Since we know this is a change for you after many years of guiding billings, I wanted to help provide a onetime bridge back to what we would expect our billings to look like, if we were not to change any of the practices in our business that impacts billings. If we were to keep the mix between our PANFS and billing programs in fiscal year 2025 in line with what we had in fiscal year 2024, we would expect this to drive 12% growth in our billings in fiscal year 2025. Before I get to detailed guidance, I want to give investors some additional color on the drivers of our cash flow as that is an area that we continue to receive questions on. First and foremost, our improving operating margins have been the most important driver of our free cash flow margin. We have seen our operating margins improve by over 800 basis points, since fiscal year '21 when we began a more intensive focus on profitable growth. This higher operating margin has helped us to put a higher floor under our free cash flow margins. We continue to see ample opportunity to expand our operating margins, supporting our free cash flow. Beyond improvements in our operating profitability, the timing of customer cash payments can impact our free cash flow. Over the last four years, we have gradually absorbed an increase in customer preference for payments over time, increasing this proportion of our bookings from 6% in fiscal year 2020 to 30% as of the most recent quarter, while maintaining or even increasing our free cash flow margins. I'm happy that we've been able to do this, and we have confidence we can continue this gradual transition within the business and sustain our free cash flow margins at 37% plus through fiscal year 2026. I also wanted to update you on the pending transaction with IBM. We continue to expect the deal to close by the end of September depending on the timing of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. At this point, we've included several tens of millions in acquired revenue from legacy QRadar SaaS products in our fiscal year 2025 revenue guidance, with this number decreasing over time, based on the speed at which we migrate to rate our customers to XSIAM. We have also embedded the ongoing expenses in our operating margin, cash flow margin and EPS guidance. Now moving on to guidance. For the fiscal year 2025, we expect NGS ARR to be in the range of $5.42 billion to $5.47 billion, an increase of 28% to 30%, remaining performance obligation of $15.2 billion to $15.3 billion represents an increase of 19% to 20%, revenue to be in the range of $9.10 million to $9.15 billion an increase of 13% to 14%, operating margins to be in the range of 27.5% to 28%, non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $6.18 to $6.31, an increase of 9% to 11%, and adjusted free cash flow margin to be 37% to 38%. For the first fiscal quarter of 2025, we expect NGS ARR to be in the range of $4.33 billion to $4.38 billion an increase of 34% to 36% remaining performance obligation of $12.4 billion to $12.5 billion an increase of 19% to 20%, revenue to be in the range of $2.10 billion to $2.13 billion, an increase of 12% to 13% and non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.47 to $1.49 an increase of 7% to 8%. Since we know this is a change for you all after many years of guiding billings, I wanted to remind you of the one-time bridge back, which we talked about before. Finally, we included our typical modeling points in the presentation for you to review. With that, we're going to play one more customer video, and then we will move to the Q&A portion of the call. [Audio-Video Presentation]
A - Walter Pritchard: Thank you, Dipak. To allow for broad participation, I would ask that each of our participants only ask one question. The first question will come from Saket Kalia from Barclays with Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley on deck.
Saket Kalia: Thanks for taking my question and nice end to the year. Nikesh, maybe for you, it's been a great start to the platformization strategy. I guess the question is, as you look at those top 5,000 customers that we're targeting as part of that 2,500 to 3,500 goal, how much of that is white space versus competitive takeout? And maybe related to that, when we started thinking about the platformization strategy, you talked about giving customers more flexibility, as they transitioned off of legacy solutions. How is that additional flexibility helping with these platformization wins?
Nikesh Arora: First of all, Saket. Thank you. You always seem to manage to get the first question in, so congratulations. Like, as I said, very, very positively excited by the response to platformization. We've literally had customers reach out now. Most recently, customer we were about to close a deal. Customers said, no. I don't want to do this one deal. I actually want to sit down with the whole platformization discussion. We might do it next quarter, but let's not go two point solutions at a time. These are these anecdotes. These are these moments where it gets really exciting for us and our sales teams. In terms of your question about where are they coming from, as you mentioned, a third of our customers in SASE here are net new to the company. So when we platformize them on SASE or Zero Trust network security, they're new to the company. There's a lot of existing customers that are highlighted in our four of our largest deals where they already work Palo Alto customers, but they use the opportunity to go embrace the larger platform because they saw the vision. They participated, and they bought into it. This is where it is really helpful where they say, listen. I really like the platformization idea. I have two parts of the puzzle. But my third part of the puzzle, I need another 12 months for the other vendor to expire so that I can go and respond. I'm like, don't worry about it. You have to. We'll start implementing the third, and we'll turn on our economics the moment the other vendor is done. Now what that does, as I've said in the past, it takes over the execution risk, but they're not worried that they'll stop paying. They'll start paying us then, and they have to worry if it's going to work or not. At the same time, it also creates that economic bridge for them. But for us, it's amazing because, I have a very simple view. This goes back to the days of when CRM was not a platform or ticketing or management IT infrastructure was not a platform. At that point in time, you have four or five applications doing this. But once you bought one that did all five things, you never went back and deployed 4 different things to solve the problem. We believe we have a unique opportunity in the platforms we offer. And as I said, I wish we'd gone there earlier than later. I firmly believe this is what's going to help us get to the $15 billion number faster.
Walter Pritchard: Next up, Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley followed by Brian Essex from gold from JPMorgan.
Hamza Fodderwala: Thank you, and congrats on a strong finish, to the year. Dipak, thank you for all the helpful guidance and modeling points. Nikesh, I really appreciate the disclosure on the AI security ARR. I think over $200 million of ARR there already. There's two parts of that. There's the AI for security operations, which has been Cortex XSIAM, which has been the fastest growing product I think you guys have had in Palo Alto's history. And then the other part is securing AI, which, I when we talk to CISOs seems to be a really big problem. It's coming up more and more in all the various industry conferences. So I'm curious. I know it's early days. You just announced some of these products. But based on the pipeline you're seeing today, how fast of a product cycle do you think this could be? Because it seems like an entirely new category altogether.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you, Hamza. So I think as you know, the XSIAM product is excellent in its own regard. We've shown you we did $500 million bookings this year, which I think the second year of a product is spectacular, by all means. And that helped us drive the $900 million in ARR Cortex. And we're seeing super later results from a median time to remediate. I just reviewed a bunch of this this morning. We've got some customers down to under 10 minutes, so it's really exciting. And that does form a part of the ARR. There's a very reasonable part of that ARR that comes from our network security business where we've actually deployed AI operations into our firewalls, which is what I call infusing AI into network security. That allows us to actually anticipate when the customer might run out of capacity, anticipate firewall sort of issues. That's part of it. Not a lot of that revenue is coming from the product we just launched. We launched all of our three products pretty much this year, not even last year, which we did start launching on July 20th through August 16th. All of our AI security suite is done. But as I mentioned, about 1,000 customers are interested in AI Access, which is the thing they're most interested in. There's a financial service organization which, you might know. It's the first time in our history that the entire security team literally walked up to the screen and say, wait. What are you doing here? Yes. We want to talk to you about that. So early days, exciting. And the reason it's exciting, as I said, it's seminal for me because it's very rare that you'd expect a large cybersecurity player to show up with innovation ahead of the market. And now that we can deploy AI Access to all of our 5,000, 6000 Prisma Access customers or we can deploy AI firewalls against all of our virtual firewall customers. It's interesting because all they have to do is turn on a switch, and they don't have to deploy new instances or new agents. It's just going to work. Early days, exciting, and I'm pretty sure these products will go through multiple versions as they get more and more robust.
Walter Pritchard: Next up is Brian Essex from JPMorgan followed by Andy Nowinski from Wells Fargo.
Brian Essex: Thank you, Walter, and thank you for taking the question. Nikesh, you mentioned on the call about the outage in July and how that impacted some of the demand on your platform. But what are you hearing from CISOs? Or what did you see in the quarter, one, in terms of, like, follow through from the pipeline for the quarter, was there a pause in that catch up? And then maybe an adjacent question, how might this be changing the way that some CIOs are looking at, the exposure that they may have to one vendor, one type of technology. I know clear that, you've highlighted the difference in the way that you roll out the updates. We're just looking for more higher level, one, deal experience and then two, CIO thought process as they approach to next-gen technology.
Nikesh Arora: Brian, as I've said publicly as well, look, that was a tough event. It simultaneously impacted tens of millions of users, which is unfortunate. I appreciate the way, CrowdStrike handled it. At the same time, it caused two things to happen. One, customers are asking us, you have the same product. How do you deploy it? As I highlighted to you, we have a fundamentally different way in which we do content updates and have been doing it for a very long time. We were able to articulate that. Funnily enough, some of the customers busy remediating that issue while we're trying to get our deals done with them. It's kind of interesting. They were saying, I'm so busy fixing that. We had to sort of drag our deals kicking and screaming in some cases. That was kind of interesting. But I think what it did do is, like you said, it caused customers to step back and say, wait a minute. No. I need to make sure that I'm evaluating all the XDR opportunities in the market. For us, who is, not the number one player in the market, we're top four, I think, in that market, hopefully trending towards three, it's exciting, because customers are willing to give us consideration on the XDR space. It's no longer a slam-dunk for some other place in the market, which is helpful for us, helpful for our sales team, and I think, we can build on that coupled with our XIM capability and opportunities that we just talked about. I think it gives us comfort that is going to keep helping us drive momentum in Cortex.
Walter Pritchard: Next one from Andy Nowinski at Wells Fargo followed by Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs.
Andy Nowinski: Good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. Nikesh, it seemed like one of the common factors of those platformization deals that you talked about on the call, involved consolidation on the SIEM side. And so, maybe once the, deal with IBM closes, do you think your platformization deals could possibly accelerate if SIEM conversion is actually a core driver or impetus of these deals?
Dipak Golechha: I'm going to have Lee answer. Otherwise, he doesn't come to these calls.
Lee Klarich: But I think the -- our ability to land customers on any of the three platforms and expand is fundamental to how we can approach this with customers. With that being said, XSIAM this this past year has been a bit of a revelation to see our ability to innovate with a new platform, launch it, and quickly get some of the world's largest companies to adopt it and adopt it as a large scale soft transformation. And you're seeing that with the results of that with the medium time to resolution, driving down from days to minutes, less than 10 minutes is world class. And so, to see some of these large customers of ours achieve that so quickly is phenomenal. I believe that, once we have that position in the SoC, that will help to drive the other platforms because the other platforms will help bring -- we'll be able to show where good data sources are and less good less valuable data sources are and actually help our customers walk through a ongoing security transformation, based on the insights that XSIAM is able is able to glean from seeing all of the security data in one place.
Walter Pritchard: Next up, Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs followed by Fatima Boolani from Citi.
Gabriela Borges: Good afternoon. Thank you. Nikesh, either for you or for Dipak. You've talked in the past about some of your own internal uses of AI to drive operating efficiencies within your business. Give us a little bit of an update on how that's going. Where do you feel you are in that road map of being able to implement AI to, for example, save in your customer operations center and things like that? And a little bit maybe on how what you've learned from the last year in adopting AI for your sales in-house?
Nikesh Arora: Great question. So, there are three parts, as I said. One, we've infused AI in our products, and we talked about that at length just now. The second part is, using generative AI to create customer helpful AI copilots as well as AI copilots for our customer support teams, because they can also use them. And then third part is just driving internal efficiencies. Let me start with the third part first. We had approximately, give or take, 300 people who were involved in solving employee tickets for our employees, so about 2% of our 15,000 people. We had just launched, last week what we call the internal AI employee experience that has allowed us to reduce that headcount by 50%. We think that can go down to 80% because we've able to been able to automate a lot of the tasks and also use generative AI to answer employees' questions. You can think about 200 people odd, which we don't need, either our own employees or third-party contractors because it's boring work. Its horrible work to have to go keep solving IT problems that have been solved a million times before. Now we've automated a bunch of them, used AI to fix it. So that's one project. We've got some early results. Some of our best developers are 40% better in coding, who have used our internal coding Copilot. It certainly is. We expect that we should be able to deploy that capability across 3,000 of them. Now remember, coding is only a third of their job, because they do other things for the other two-thirds of their job. But even in the third, if my best person is 40% better, an average person is 20% to 25% better, there's opportunities for better code and we can do more. Those are sort of the two internal efforts, if you will. On the customer support side, again, the most fascinating discovery for us is we have an internal customer support copilot, which is consistent with our co-pilots we are sharing with our customers across Cortex, Prisma, and Strata. And those customer support people. The best one is equally productive irrespective of tenure after three months. So I can hire a net new person, have them solve customer problems, and 3 months in, they're as good as somebody who's been here for three, four years. So these are all very promising signs. There's a lot of work that we're doing, but part of our philosophy is if we don't go through the trials and tribulations and try it ourselves. We're not going to get to be a great company using AI. So early days, but very excited.
Walter Pritchard: Next up, Fatima Boolani from Citi followed by Tal Liani from BofA.
Fatima Boolani: Thank you, and thank you for taking my question. Nikesh, I wanted to zero in on some of your Prisma Cloud prepared remarks. You talked about a business acceleration in the back half, and your tone suggested a material improvement in that pillar and maybe a little bit more of a proverbial pep in your step in that segment of the business, especially when I think about last year, when you did allude to some irrational market behavior, market participant, dynamics and activity. I wanted to get to the bottom of what's underpinning some of that back half acceleration and some of the more sanguine kind of outlook on the Prisma Cloud franchise from here.
Nikesh Arora: I'll have to go back and listen to the sentiment analyzer on my own call afterwards. But, reacting to your pep in my step, last year, as I said to you prior that, because of the aggressive new players, they cut prices down 30%, 40%. Whilst we saw the volume increases, pricing was impacted in the industry causing effectively our growth rate not to be as exciting as we wanted it to be. That has stabilized for sure. We also took some remedial steps in turning our business into an ACV business for Prisma Cloud unlike the rest of our business, because we wanted our sales team to act in a similar fashion as the market was seeing. We made a bunch of product improvements, and we actually went to our biggest customers and ensured products were effective for them. And I said, coupled with that, what has also happened is, as I mentioned, that, most of our customers are now using many modules, which are oriented towards network security in the cloud. We run on all four hyperscalers natively, which is in addition to CNAPP, is also our real time cloud security part. So given the 14 modules we have from a comprehensiveness perspective, we found some of the customers where we can uniquely solve their use cases, allowing us to do those large deals. And in a way, the platformization helps. Like [Schlumberger] they bought all three. It wasn't a separate decision for them to go buy Cortex from us and cloud from somebody else and network security from somebody else. That ability to drive your platform also helps drive our cloud security business.
Walter Pritchard: Next up, Tal Liani from BOA followed by Patrick Coville from Scotiabank.
Tal Liani: I guess. You spoke in the past about shorter contract duration. What are the implications on free cash flow generation? Are there any short term or long term implications? And then, in general, can you talk about you know, free cash flow improved so dramatically over the last few years. Can you talk about the long-term outlook for free cash flow margin? Thanks.
Dipak Golechha: Sure, Tal. I'll take that one. Just to start off with, I think I said in my prepared remarks, our contract lengths actually did not shrink. They've been roughly consistent at three years for our new deals, and they've been actually relatively constant for quite a while now. You do have some areas where the contract lengths may be shorter. You have others like platformization deals where they're more strategic in nature, but on average, it ends up being that much. I think in terms of the ability to generate free cash flow, frankly, I think the most important part about our free cash flow is really the operating margins. I mentioned that in my prepared remarks that since fiscal year '21, we've actually improved our operating margin by 800 basis points. That really is the biggest buttress to what has happened. And we've been able to absorb the change in the amount of deferred payments going from 6% to 30% in the last quarter, like, over that same time period. So I think we've proven, that we've been able to deliver strong cash flow, like, whilst being able to absorb all of these deferred payments. We feel very confident that we'll be able to continue to do that in in the future.
Walter Pritchard: Next question, Patrick Colville from Scotiabank followed by Roger Boyd from UBS.
Patrick Colville: Thank you, Walter. Nikesh and Dipak, the financial disclosure you guys give us is terrific. You give us a huge amount of metrics. But the metric I want to focus on is the new RPO guide. RPO rose 20% in 4Q, and the guide implies, I think, a 19.5% in the midpoint in fiscal '25. I guess what gives you the confidence that, there's going to be kind of no deceleration over the next 12 months? Is it specific business lines or is it, IBM QRadar acquisition or hiring? Can you just kind of have a look on that, please?
Nikesh Arora: I think, Patrick, it's a combination of factors. As I mentioned, we've seen the pipeline. We've seen the acceleration in the second half. If you look at our first half versus second half, implied bookings have gone up. We see the pipeline for next year. Obviously, the IBM business is part of that. Obviously, the strength we're seeing in XSIAM is part of that. Our platformization efforts are part of that. This year, we have tried to anticipate that with making sure we have resources in place, for the coverage we need to deliver those numbers.
Walter Pritchard: Next up, Roger Boyd from UBS followed by Matt Hedberg from RBC.
Roger Boyd: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a follow-up to Dipak's comments, a question ago on annualized billings. But you noted, Dipak, that 12% would be kind of the bridge to billings guide this year if you maintain a similar mix of financing and annual billings. Given the shift towards RPO and, ARR guidance, is it fair to assume that that mix will probably not be that similar to what you saw last year, as well as probably additional factors around the interest environment. Is there any thoughts on what you might see from the mix of financing and annualized billings?
Dipak Golechha: Look. I think we'll see a mix more towards annualized billings in a way from financing. I think the simplest way to think about it is, if you do financing, it's another it's another piece of paperwork. It's a loan document at the end of the day. It does create, like more work out in the field. And so, in line with our platformization strategy, we're all about figuring out where all the friction points are and trying to eliminate them, where we can and continue to do the best thing for the shareholders. That's really what we're driving here, and that's what I would expect now.
Nikesh Arora: I thinks it’s code for that to look very different because we may not be doing as many PANFS deals because they contribute to billings, but they don't change RPO and they don't change cash flow. If you don't have too many PANFS deals, it saves time to the field.
Walter Pritchard: Next up is Matt Hedberg, followed by our last question will be Keith Bachman from BMO.
Matt Hedberg: Thanks, guys. Congrats on the quarter and big fan of the new guidance philosophy. I think it really does tie to the business. Nikesh, a question for you. With the election coming up and you guys have historically had a really strong federal business, just sort of curious about how you're thinking about US Fed in 1Q and sort of what could that mean for kind of the up it seems like there's a lot of pent-up demand there on the federal side. Just sort of curious on your outlook there.
Nikesh Arora: Yes. Matt, I've learned in my life never try and foreshadow the government. Usually, it's not a winning strategy. Don't predict insulate, don't predict budgets, don't predict elections. We'll roll with the punches. We have people clearly, we know there's business that we have to renew because they have our Palo Alto capability and products. We're working hard and getting all that done. There's a bunch of new ideas and new projects that we're working on, but we'll keep powering through them. As the elections transpire, depending on what administration comes into place, it's going to impact a bunch of the budgets. But as I said, we had significantly de-risked our federal expectations as we told you earlier, in this calendar year. We're going with a muted set of expectations into the election to make sure that we don't see any bad surprises.
Walter Pritchard: Thanks for that question, Matt. The last one will be Keith Bachman from BMO.
Keith Bachman: Alright. Thank you, Walter. Good evening. I wanted to ask about XSIAM a bit and break it into two parts. In your slide deck, you noted that your active customer count is up 4x. And I just wanted to hear a little bit about where those customers are coming from. What I mean by that is are these displacements? Are you sitting side-by-side? Just want to hear a little bit more about that. And then, Dipak, for you, in my discussions with IBM, I thought the QRadar business was running about a $100 million, a little bit less than that in ARR and you said tens of millions. I wasn't sure what is being included when you think about the guidance there on what QRadar may add on a prospective basis over the next 12 months or so?
Nikesh Arora: Almost every one of the XSIAM sales is replacing an existing SIEM. And in some cases, multiples. As I mentioned, in case of Schlumberger, we replaced two. In case of the other eight figure deal, we replaced two others. For the most part, it is if you looked at the market share of existing SIEMs in the market, our acquisitions, which are north of a hundred customers, would be a representation of us taking the same amount of share from each of those people. And if you look at the people out there, I think there's a bunch of people, who's been around 15, 17 years who have shared their market. Those will be the people we'll be replacing for the most part. There's no net new SIEM. I don't think they're starting net new companies out there that scale will require, $10 million, $20 million, $30 million SIEM deal. So it's usually we're replacing people who are out there. I will let Dipak answer the IBM question.
Dipak Golechha: Just, to keep things very simple, Keith, and we can we can follow-up with you in more detail offline. There are certain contracts that will be part of the IBM ELA or something like that. We won't be able to recognize the revenue, of just the way that the accounting treatment works, and there'll also be some contracts that require consent from customers. Those are the kinds of things. We do expect over time things to move to XSIAM. Our intention was never to do things, and that's much more ratable revenue anyhow.
Keith Bachman: It just takes some time to get those customers transferred over. Fair enough.
Nikesh Arora: Our real interest is in converting them to XSIAM as you'd appreciate. That’s right.
Walter Pritchard: With that, conclude the Q&A portion of the call. I'll turn it back over to Nikesh for his closing remarks.
Nikesh Arora: I want to use the opportunity to thank all of you for supporting us and for joining our call. I also want to thank all of our customers, partners and entire ecosystem for supporting our business. And last, but most importantly, all of our employees who worked really hard to deliver these results. Thank you very much.

Nikesh Arora: Thank you, Walter. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our earnings call. I hope everybody enjoyed our new marketing campaign teaser featuring Keanu Reeves that goes live on national media. Let's start at the beginning and I'll update you on what we have experienced in Q3. First and foremost, cyberattacks continue unabated. We're seeing a consistent stream of nation-state activity that is systematically looking for software supply chain and hardware zero-day vulnerabilities and attempting to exploit them at scale. Additionally, there continues to be a robust stream of attack activity targeted at large enterprises and pieces of critical infrastructure. We continue to see high-profile breaches, some of which were widely reported in the press again this quarter. Most organizations face the challenge of an ever-shrinking time window for a bad actor to enter their environments, find valuable data, and exfiltrate it. The window is now measured in hours. In comparison, the time it takes for an organization to discover a breach and stop the malicious activity continues to be measured in days and weeks. While not a new phenomena, with new disclosure mandates, this challenge is now clearly out in the open. With AI, we expect the attacks to come at an even faster pace. I don't need to elaborate on the current enthusiasm around AI. Almost every one of our customers is either experimenting with AI or plans to deploy some use cases in the near future. As usual, their employees are way ahead. Almost 50% of employees of most companies are using some sort of AI application, LLM or co-pilot, to explore, learn and make themselves more productive. Whilst this is great for the evolution and adoption of AI, this is introducing a whole new set of threats. As some of you are aware, we have recently announced a suite of products which are aimed to secure this AI usage by design. More about this later, but I expect this to continue to provide a tailwind to the cybersecurity industry. On spending for cybersecurity, we see no change of pace or trajectory. Most customers have a series of projects they want to get done, and the only limiting factor seems to be their execution capability. Customers continue to focus on zero-trust transformations, coupled with the need for new network architectures to adapt to a more hybrid infrastructure. The resurgence of cloud migrations is being driven by the need to get their data in the cloud to be AI-ready, causing discussions around the cloud security platform. And as you may all have noticed with all the M&A activity, the security operations space is getting rejuvenated, which is something we've been preparing for with XSIAM. At the accelerated pace of change in cyber, even with healthy increases in cybersecurity funding, many organizations aim to simply keep pace with the volume of threat activity they see. Most cannot do this and are increasingly receptive to a better way of tracking their security challenges -- tackling their security challenges, windows sprawl and architectural complexity. We firmly believe that answer is platformization of cybersecurity over time. I'm delighted to report, despite the concerns around our platformization approach after our last quarter, the customer feedback has been nothing but encouraging. We have initiated way more conversations on our platformization than we expected. If meetings were a measure of outcome, they have gone up 30%, and a majority of them have been centered on platform opportunities. In short, demand is robust, and my expectation is that we will continue to see it be that way for the next many quarters. With this backdrop, we are pleased with our strong Q3 results. As you can see, we delivered top-line growth ahead of the market and continue to drive growth while improving profitability. Our performance was highlighted by 47% growth in our next-generation security ARR. As we continue to transform our business to a security software business, we saw 23% growth in RPO, an uptick from last quarter. This translated into 15% revenue growth and 3% growth in our billings. As we have articulated earlier, we don't see the billing metric as a true indicator of business strength. It continues to be impacted by payment terms where more and more customers prefer annual billing plans. However, if you impede implied bookings, you will note that we saw an uptick over that in the last two -- over the last two quarters. We actually ended up billing – booking backlog -- billing backlog this quarter. We continue to operate our business efficiently. Our operating margin expanded by 200 basis points year-over-year, driving 25% growth in operating income and 20% in our EPS to $1.32. Our cash generation was strong and again our GAAP net income grew substantially year-over-year. Before I continue with highlights from Q3, I'm aware that our accelerated consolidation and platformization strategy created significant conversation last quarter. We have also had questions from analysts and investors on this topic since we reported our Q2 results in February. I thought I'd share more background on how we got here to provide context and also offer a platformization framework for you to help understand why we're convinced that we can build a much larger business over the next several years and platformization is key to achieving that. When we embarked on our journey to transform our company, we were keen to create interest and convince our customers that we could solve their problems not just with our next-generation firewalls and the associated subscriptions, but also with a set of best-of-breed products across 20-plus categories organized across three platforms. That strategy was hugely successful and saw us achieving nearly $4 billion in NGS ARR. The majority of focus of our teams was landing multiple products across our three platforms and our customers. Whether we were able to land at a brand new customer for Palo Alto Networks or we added products from new platforms to our existing customers, we were happy. Landing could range from a single product used in part of the organization to broader usage across the organization. From that lens, if you look at our top 5,000 customers, we have landed two or more of our platforms at about half these customers, and these customers contribute just over 80% of NGS ARR. If you look at it by -- this by platform, we have landed 97% of these top 5,000 network security, over 20% of them in Prisma Cloud, and over 40% with Cortex. By all means, our land-the-platform strategy was extremely successful. In landing with multiple platforms, many of our customers have leveraged our capabilities across key cybersecurity buying centers, such as network security, cloud security, and security ops. Most of this cross platform adoption has happened more organically with customers adopting incremental products on Palo Alto Networks at their own pace. Governed by the complexity of the environment and the friction of dealing with contracts with multiple vendors, not many of our landed customers are fully platformized. And the ones that are fully platformized, we saw encouraging results. We realized that for fully platformized customers, while they saw better security outcomes, our ARR profile was also very different. While our average next-generation security ARR for our landed customers ranges from $200,000 to $800,000, for our land strategy, we discovered that our ARR for fully platformized customers ranges from $2 million to $14 million, depending on how many platforms the customers are standardizing on. This drove us to accelerate the rollout of our platformization strategy at the end of the last quarter, following successful pilots earlier in the year. We created interest in the market, we started conversation with customers looking to begin their platformization journey, and spurring existing sales cycles to a more strategic outcome. Having personally reviewed over 500 of our top customers in detail this past quarter and having had a few hundred conversations with CSOs, CIOs and CEOs, I continue to be convinced of our opportunity to deliver full platformization to our strong -- to our top customers. We're still early in the results from full platformization. Across these top 5,000 customers, we have completed about 900 through Q3 2024. Our Q3 efforts resulted in approximately 65 incremental platformization sales in Q3, which is up 40% since Q2. It was this framework that was the foundation for our goal of $15 billion in next-generation security ARR by fiscal year 2030 that we first discussed last quarter. With our incremental momentum in platformization, we see a runway to delivering approximately 2,500-plus platformizations sales, up from the current 900, while continuing to land our multiple platforms in our customer base and adding new customers. I showed you the benefits we see in our ARR from our success-driving platformization. Our customers also see significant benefits as they adopt our full platforms. We have talked to you in the past about reduction in median time to resolution with XSIAM, which takes less than one-tenth of the time it took before XSIAM was deployed, as customers platformized on Cortex. IDC recently validated the benefits platform customers see in a study published earlier this year, independently proving much of what we have talked about. Customers saw productivity benefits, as much as 30% to 40% efficiency improvements and significant improvements in security outcomes. I could talk further about the benefits, but what really brings us to the forefront is some examples of our significant transactions in Q3. A U.S. county agency signed a seven-figure transaction, landing our firewall subscriptions as well as Cortex XDR and becoming a Palo Alto customer for the first time. We displaced a competitor that had sold both of these capabilities to the customer and competed against on -- us on an appliance vendor that could not offer best-of-breed capabilities across these two categories. A large U.S. financial services company that was an existing platform customer faced significant challenges in their SOC. Despite a staff of 40 in the SOC, they were not achieving their goals and sought a transformation plan. We signed an eight-figure deal including XSIAM, our ITDR, or identity threat detention and response, offering, and our managed detection and response service. A global data services provider was unhappy with his incumbent SASE provider facing outages that created lost productivity. It was also never able to integrate its VPN and URL filtering capabilities fully. The customer selected our SASE capability for approximately 65,000 mobile and branch office users, including CASB, DLP, enterprise browser, and ADEM capabilities for many of them. This was a highly competitive situation, but our ability to deliver consolidated capabilities through a platform across a half a dozen areas as well as our superior security versus incumbent won us the business. Finally, a large healthcare company experienced a breach and engaged our Unit 42 Incident Response Services. After we helped the customer remediate and get back online, we were able to educate the customer on the benefits of platformization. The customer fully platformized with us, standardizing on network security, Prisma Cloud, and Cortex. This transaction was the largest in the history of Palo Alto Networks at nearly $150 million of TCV. Beyond these showcase deals, our overall large deal activity was healthy in Q3, as shown by significant increases in our accounts with transactions over $1 million, $5 million, and $10 million in the quarter. We also recently announced our partnership with IBM. IBM and Palo Alto Networks have done what in my mind is a one-of-a-kind partnership. This partnership involves migrating the QRadar customers of IBM to XSIAM, where IBM will be able to deliver industry-specific capabilities on XSIAM using watsonx. Given their leadership position on the Gartner Magic Quadrant, now we can collectively deliver an even better solution to both their existing and new customers. Enabling over 1,000 IBM security consultants on the entire Palo Alto Networks portfolio will allow us to drive platformization in an accelerated fashion. We will be IBM's preferred cybersecurity partner across network, cloud, and SOC, while driving a significant book of business for IBM. Additionally, IBM will platformize on Palo Alto products. It will extensively leverage watsonx across both our operations and products. And lastly, but not the least, we will work on co-developing solutions for cloud security. Last quarter, when we rolled out our accelerated consolidation platformization strategy, we also activated our AI leadership strategy. Leading up to this, over the last year, we've oriented an increasing portion of our R&D investments towards AI. We have seen growth in customer interest and adopting AI to drive business value and bad actors using AI, as I discussed earlier. In early May, we announced our comprehensive suite of AI security offerings and believe we will be first to market the capabilities to protect the range of our customers' AI security needs. We rolled out three products to safely enable the use of AI from employees using AI to enterprises building AI into their applications. AI Access Security, AI SPM, and AI Runtime Security put us at the forefront of securing AI adoption. We also believe our co-pilots across our three platforms, which are context-aware, can perform and automate user action, surface alerts and best practices, and provide in-product support all with near-perfect accuracy. Furthermore, we announced our Precision AI Security Bundle to leverage inline AI to counter AI attacks with AI Defense. We have had strong early customer engagement with these offerings, which you expect to be made generally available beginning of July. As you heard from our teaser trailer with Keanu, this isn't sci-fi, this is precision AI. More broadly than AI, it has been a busy last three months from an innovation perspective. On our SASE 3.0 launch, which we rolled out early this month, debuted with several unique industry-defining capabilities. We announced industry's only secure enterprise browser integrated into SASE, and as end-user engagement with AI applications grow, the browser becomes an important defense layer against AI threats. Additionally, it is becoming clearer that the browser offers a better way to secure contractors, mobile devices, and managed devices, with SASE integration providing a simpler and more secure approach to adoption. We launched AI-powered data security integrated into SASE, leveraging industry's first LLM-powered data classification. This new classification engine combines the strength of context-aware machine learning models with the power of LLMs, understanding how to increase classification accuracy. Lastly, as part of our SASE 3.0, we launched application acceleration, which understands each user's journey within an enterprise SaaS and cloud applications and optimizes performance for these applications. Customers see performance up to 5 times faster than the user experience in the general Internet. This rapid cadence of innovation in SASE has enabled us to maintain SASE ARR growth above 50% for the sixth quarter in a row. At Prisma Cloud, we have completed the first phase of rollout of data security posture management, which came from the Dig Security acquisition. We also added support for more than 100 new APIs across the major hyperscalers to stay ahead of our customers by securing the cloud services [they were talking] (ph). Based on our Cortex Xpanse technology, we did launch Cloud Discovery and Exposure Management, leveraging our Xpanse data natively in Prisma Cloud. Over 100 customers now use this capability to evaluate Internet exposure risks and discover unknown Internet exposed cloud assets. Also during Q3, we launched CDR, Cloud Detection and Response, which extends our XDR capability into the cloud and give customers a unified view of their entire environment from cloud to endpoint to network. CDEM and CDR show the power of having both Cortex and Prisma Cloud platforms, as we can leverage these sophisticated capabilities to benefit cloud customers. Last but not least, on Cortex, we launched XSIAM about 18 months ago, and this offering has already elevated the profile of Cortex in the market. We see steady demand for XDR, the foundation of Cortex, where we are landing many new customers, and now we have north of 5,800 customers on XDR. With $400 million in cumulative XSIAM bookings coming out of Q3, this offering is really going mainstream with customers understanding the value proposition versus the traditional SIEM. XSIAM has accelerated our Cortex ARR growth and we continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities. We are converting our innovation into recognized leadership, adding two new positions this quarter. One was in managed detection and response, the other in data security posture management, leveraging our Dig acquisition and demonstrating our ability to acquire technology and rapidly integrate into our platforms. As many of you have undoubtedly seen, our rollout of platformization has stoked a long-standing debate within the cybersecurity industry about whether customers desire a platform or best-of-breed cybersecurity. From the Palo Alto Network's perspective, we've proven it is possible to deliver best of platform. This is why we have invested in building leading products and we have now recognition for product leadership in 23 categories while also delivering on the benefits of integration across all three platforms. To summarize, before I pass off to Dipak, please take away a few conclusions from my prepared remarks. One, we put out strong Q3 results in a positive spending environment where cybersecurity priorities are well funded. Beyond the continuation of a challenging threat environment, new threat vectors from AI are starting to surface as the usage of AI grows. We've been pleased with the initial traction of our accelerated consolidation platform strategy. This drove an increase in bookings, with deferred payments and impact on our billings, something we expect will continue. We had a big quarter of innovation, especially as it relates to AI, where we strive to lead the industry in securing this powerful productivity medium while also doing so comprehensively. As we look forward, we have significant pipeline heading into our largest quarter of the year. We're just beginning to see the benefits of platformization accrue to our business. We will continue to make further investments here while balancing delivering profitable growth and have chartered a path with conviction towards being a $15 billion NGS ARR company. With that, let me pass you on to Dipak.
Dipak Golechha: Thank you, Nikesh, and good afternoon, everyone. To maximize our time spent on Q&A, I will provide highlights and you can review results available in our press release and the supplemental financial information on our website. Within our revenue of $1.98 billion, product revenue grew 1%, while total service revenue grew 20%. Within services revenue, subscription revenue grew 25% and support revenue grew 11%. Moving on to geographies, we saw revenue growth across all theaters, with the Americas growing 15%, EMEA up 20%, and JPAC growing 8%. This quarter, our lower JPAC revenue growth was driven by lower product bookings in the region, offset by higher subscription bookings, which benefit revenue over time. We reported Q3 billings within the range we guided, although as Nikesh and I have noted several times in the past few quarters, we continue to focus less on this metric. We saw an increase quarter-over-quarter in business transacted with deferred billings, which was also higher than we forecasted. The impact on our financials from platformization this quarter was in line with what we expected 90 days ago, and our expectations around the impact in Q4 and beyond is unchanged from what we talked about in February. First, we saw a greater volume of large deals with some of these customers opting for deferred payments over the term of their purchase, instead of paying upfront as they grapple with the higher cost of money. This drove the quarter to quarter increase in periodic billing plans that I noted. Also, this level of periodic billings was higher than we forecasted 90 days ago. We also saw an uptake in the array of our platformization programs we launched early in the quarter. These programs continue to ramp up as we roll them out broadly. Within our RPO of $11.3 billion, our current RPO was $5.4 billion. Our average duration of new contracts increased slightly year-over-year, but remained at approximately three years. On our balance sheet, you will see that our debt balance came down by $659 million. The driver for this was early conversion, which occurred at the option of the debt holders and was settled by us in cash. Our remaining debt matures in June 2025, although we may continue to see early conversions. During Q3, we spent $500 million to repurchase 1.7 million shares of our common stock. Our buyback strategy remains opportunistic. I know that billings has been a significant focus for investors. As you're all aware, remaining performance obligation, or RPO, captures the full value of our contracts, independent of customer billing terms. As we have explained to you over the last year, with an increase in factors impacting payment terms on a quarterly basis, there's been significant volatility in our billings. With this volatility in mind, we've been increasingly focused on driving high-quality bookings, which add to RPO and maximize our NGS ARR in contracts. Focuses on these metrics provides a more relevant view of the business. If we look at the history of these metrics for our company, you see that NGS ARR has consistently grown ahead of our other metrics and as it continues to contribute a higher proportion of our revenue. You also see the correlation between RPO and total services revenue growth is high. Our RPO is mainly comprised of contracts for offerings that carry ratable revenue, which are recognized through our total services revenue. Billings, on the other hand, is significantly influenced by the invoicing terms on contract signed, which adds significant volatility. In Q3, we saw RPO growth tick up, along with strength in NGS ARR, including us raising our guidance here. This is in contrast to billing trends which went the other direction, thereby showing the divergent trends in action our Q3 results. Nikesh talked briefly about our first-of-a-kind IBM partnership that has multiple facets that touch each of our platforms and include significant devotion of resources from both companies. I'd like to provide more details on the financial impact we expect to see. As part of the partnership, we've agreed to acquire IBM's QRadar SaaS assets, certain QRadar intellectual property, and IBM's on-premise QRadar customer list. The total consideration is $500 million plus earn-out consideration based on successfully migrating QRadar on-premise customers to our XSIAM offering over the next several years. We anticipate closing the transaction by the end of September 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The calendar year 2023 QRadar SaaS revenue was on the order of $100 million. However, as we work through details of the customer contracts we are acquiring and the deferred revenue associated with this business, we expect our recognized revenue could be much lower than this in our fiscal year 2025. We will provide more information on the financial impact closer to the close of the transaction. We will invest to fuel this partnership and ensure a seamless experience for QRadar customers purchasing and migrating to XSIAM. As part of the partnership, we have entered into an agreement with IBM whereby they will operate parts of the business on our behalf on a medium-term basis. We expect we can make these investments within the profitability framework we spoke of previously. Specifically, we continue to expect 28% to 29% non-GAAP operating margin in fiscal year 2026 and 37% or greater free cash flow margin through fiscal year 2026. Before I provide Q4 guidance, I wanted to remind you of what we talked last quarter when we introduced platformization and discussed the top-line headwinds we expected it would have. We continue to expect platformization-related drivers, both larger deals with associated cost-of-money impacts and acceleration in platformization programs, will impact our billings over a total of a 12- to 18-month period. Consistent with what we noted in February, we expect that this will persist through fiscal year '25 as we anniversary the rollout of these programs and resulting in lower billings and, to a lesser degree, revenue. Beyond this period, we expect to grow faster than we discussed in August and sustain this growth for longer. Now moving on to our guidance for Q4 and the year. For the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect billings to be in the range of $3.43 billion to $3.48 billion, an increase of 9% to 10%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.15 billion to $2.17 billion, an increase of 10% to 11%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.42 a share, a decrease of 1% to 3%. For the fiscal year '24, we expect billings to be in the range of $10.13 billion to $10.18 billion, an increase of 10% to 11%. We expect NGS ARR to be in the range of $4.05 billion to $4.10 billion, an increase of 37% to 39%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $7.99 billion to $8.01 billion, an increase of 16%. For fiscal '24, we expect operating margins to be in the range of 26.8% to 27.0%, an increase of 270 basis points to 290 basis points year-over-year. We expect our non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $5.56 to $5.58 per share, an increase of 25% to 26%. And we expect adjusted free cash flow margin to be 38.5% to 39%. In the interest of time and to get as many of your questions as possible, we've included the modeling points in the appendix of our earnings presentation. With that, I will turn the call back over to Walter for the Q&A portion.
A - Walter Pritchard: Thank you, Dipak. To allow for broad participation, I'd ask that each person only ask one question. The first question will be from Brian Essex at JPMorgan, followed by Brad Zelnick at Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, Brian. Brian, you're muted. Brian, you're muted. Brian, looks like you're on mute.
Brian Essex: There we go. Yeah, it wasn't letting me unmute myself. So, thank you. Thank you for letting me take the question. Yeah, I guess for Dipak, as we look at your efforts of incentivizing platform consolidation or platformization, I mean, obviously you've talked about the pressure on the last two quarters of this year. Can you maybe help me understand the duration that you anticipate pursuing these efforts? Is this going to be a more temporary type of effort where it kind of just lasts through this fiscal year, or do you expect it to stretch into next year? Thank you.
Dipak Golechha: Yeah. So, thanks for the question, Brian. Look, I think we will -- I mean, platformization is something that is now our strategy, so I think in that sense it will continue for a while. But at some point, it just becomes a normal motion, and then we're lapping a period where we've been doing platformization already. So, really, what you're seeing in the financial metrics is the difference when it wasn't the normal motion and then it becomes the motion, and then in the future, it will just become lapping what is a consistent motion.
Nikesh Arora: I think in that context we said last quarter that this should persist till the end of Q2 next year. We currently started Q2 this year.
Brian Essex: That's helpful. Thank you for the clarification.
Walter Pritchard: Thanks, Brian. Next question is from Brad Zelnick followed by Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, Brad.
Brad Zelnick: Thanks very much. Thanks for taking the question. Nikesh, I was hoping you can give us an update on the state of the channel. There's a lot of noise from the traditional VAR channel. I wanted to get your sense on how they're acclimating to platformization, but you're also doubling down with the GSIs. You announced this super special deal with IBM. You also signed a deal with Accenture, too. We'd just love to hear your latest thinking in a particular more on the GSI strategy. I mean, how many more can you add that are up at that level of an Accenture and an IBM? Thanks.
Nikesh Arora: Well, first of all, thanks for the question. Look, I don't think there is contention between the two channels. We still do IBM deals with a traditional VAR involved. Very often the VAR has -- represents the customer, helps to clear the deals, helps them work through all the financing, et cetera. So, there is a role for both. What we are discovering is in platformization deals, customers require consulting effort to re-architect the entire security stack. And typically, they engage with the SI community or GSI community first to try and do that transformation and partnering with them hand in glove allows us to be part of that story. As I gave the example, when we did the most recent, let's just say, re-architecture, which we had to do in a hurry in the case of a recent hack, we were working with SI partners as well as other incident response teams to make sure that we build an architecture that's consistent with what the end state needs to be. And that's where partnerships like Accenture and IBM become really worthy and important because the customer is relying on them to do the heavy lift and doing the one-time transformation. So, I think both these strategies will co-exist. As you know, we still have a substantive hardware business, which we also work through the traditional channel. We also have -- actually to be fair, many of the VARs have transferred or translated their businesses into a part consulting model where they also work with customers of transformations. I don't think they're contentious. I think it becomes harder for the analyst community to be able to track what the channel status of a company is because the SIs are not as sharing as the traditional VAR channel is.
Brad Zelnick: Thanks very much for the color, and I love the pullover. That's a good one, Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you. I appreciate it. I need some color in the day.
Brad Zelnick: Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: We had a great quarter.
Walter Pritchard: Thanks, Brad. Next, we'll go to Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley, followed by Matt Hedberg from RBC. Go ahead, Hamza.
Hamza Fodderwala: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Nikesh, in the earnings presentation, you mentioned you see significant pipeline heading into your fiscal Q4. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color into that pipeline? Because the Q4 billings guide does suggest a big sequential uptick as is usual, but I think this year a little bit higher than normal. But any color you can give will be helpful.
Nikesh Arora: Yeah, Hamza, look -- first, thanks for the question. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we have been reviewing all of our customers. We have been through 500 of them with the account teams. And every customer, there is an opportunity. There's an opportunity to deliver a platform, there's an opportunity to consolidate. And just that gives us hope and sort of some degree of conviction that there's a lot of business to be converted out there. It's really limited by the customers' speed and desire to execute or the resources to execute. So, we have a robust pipeline across most of our platforms to see, question is can we go out and convert as quickly as we need to, and that's what we're guiding to.
Hamza Fodderwala: Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks, Hamza. Next question is from Matt Hedberg, followed by Tal Liani from Bank of America. Go ahead, Matt.
Matt Hedberg: Thanks, Walter. Yeah, and Nikesh, I think we are on the same wavelength here on the color. Good choice. I wanted to ask about the federal side. Last quarter you mentioned Thunderdome. Any update on that transaction? And just kind of how we're thinking about federal into 3Q -- or excuse me, your 4Q?
Nikesh Arora: Yeah, that's a good question. Look, the Thunderdome contract got activated last quarter because of the zero-day vulnerability we found in certain VPNs out of the market. So, they wanted to quickly replace some of the VPNs because they were required to replace them in the classified agencies and non-classified agencies. So, we saw some activity around Thunderdome and that contract was activated where people used that contract that we have with DISA to be able to execute some transactions. But we still maintain. These are going to get one at a time, each of these missions are going to execute one at a time. So, we haven't changed our expectations in terms of how Thunderdome will evolve vis-a-vis how we will see it in our financials.
Matt Hedberg: Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks, Matt. Next question from Tal Liani at Bank of America, followed by Saket Kalia at Barclays. Go ahead, Tal.
Tal Liani: Hi, guys. I know we don't focus on billings, but I have a question. Just first to clarify...
Nikesh Arora: You do.
Tal Liani: Just to clarify, you -- if you won -- you said in the prepared remarks you won a $150 million deal. Does it include -- does it go through billing and should we exclude it from billing on a normalized level? Just to understand the impact on billing this quarter. And then, billing is -- it's going to recover because I'm going to ask it, not say it, but how -- what's the path for recovery for billing? If investors are looking at it and you look out into the next year or two years, what's the path for recovery of billing's growth?
Nikesh Arora: Well, Tal, I think if you listened carefully to what I said, we actually built backlog this quarter, which means we booked a lot more business than we built, which is the difference between contracts where we chose not to take their payment terms and just do annual billing. So, we're signing big deals. We have a lot of business that we're signing, and the way it gets reflected is in RPO. It depends on what we choose to either take as annual billings or to take through PANFS, right? It shows up in billings. What we choose not to take ends up in future or deferred payment plans or deferred billing. So, I think if you look at the implied bookings, you'll see there's a double-digit number in there in the quarter. I just think billing is an artificial metric. I think I understand you guys like it because it's been around for a long time. I think the cost of money has changed the quality of that metric. To me, a quality metric is implied bookings or RPO. And in both those, as I mentioned, we saw an uptick this quarter. So, we actually believe we saw a recovery faster than we expected this quarter. That's why we're surprised at the reaction of the market.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks, Tal. Next up is Saket Kalia from Barclays, followed by Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, Saket.
Saket Kalia: Okay, great. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Nikesh, maybe the follow up is on that point.
Nikesh Arora: I like your color. That blue is very nice.
Saket Kalia: Thanks, buddy. I appreciate it. So, just to that point, it was great to see RPO bookings, I think, actually accelerated year-over-year in this quarter, right? So, last quarter, I think we talked about more flexibility for customers with platformization, right, just consolidating and creating some of those [ramp] (ph) contracts. How much did that sort of play into the difference between bookings and billings?
Nikesh Arora: Well, remember, the acceleration -- the ramp contracts really impact us in the way that we have higher exit ARRs than many of our newer contracts, right? So, with year one ARR may be lower than the year three ARR for a contract. But that is not visible to you yet in the numbers because there's no way to represent that, right? The only way you'll see it, you'll see it in a consolidated TCV deal which is going to show up in RPO. So, the ramp contracts show up as a total wholesome in the RPO number and you're seeing an uptick in the RPO number which tells you that business is stronger this quarter than we expected it to be. I think the only difference is we chose not to take -- remember, when a customer says I don't want to pay you upfront, you have no choices, you can take annual billings or you can get them financing through PANFS, right, where it takes away from revenue and becomes interest income. And then, we decided we didn't want to take so many of these deals. So our quantum of deferred billing went up compared to last quarter.
Saket Kalia: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks, Saket. Next question, Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs, followed by Gray Powell from BTIG. Go ahead, Gabriela.
Gabriela Borges: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. I'm going to ask on the $15 billion NGS target for fiscal year '30. Either for Nikesh or Dipak, a little bit of color on how you arrived at that number? There's an interesting footnote here on assuming 5% annual growth per customer. And then, within that target, how do you think about cyclicality? Any comments on the cyclicality of firewall or the cyclicality of platformization impacting the linearity of getting to that target? Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: Yeah, two things. One, the firewall is not in there. That's hardware. That's not next-generation security. The services that work on top of firewalls are obviously in there, because they're all now AI enabled and next generation. Cyclicality is consistent with our cyclicality of our quarters, right? We see more business in Q4. You should expect more platformization deals in Q4, hopefully higher growth in NGS ARR, which you're used to. I think the cyclicality of that slide is no different than the cyclicality you've seen in the growth of NGS ARR over the last three years that we've been sharing that number with you. Yeah, sorry, was there another part?
Gabriela Borges: Yeah. Just on the footnote here on the 5% within...
Nikesh Arora: Yeah. So, what we've discovered...
Gabriela Borges: Yeah, benchmark that for us.
Nikesh Arora: Well, what we've discovered is as platformization grows for a customer, as renewals come up, we're able to upsell them more capability. For example, in SASE, now we can sell them ADEM and AIOps. For example, in our firewalls, we can send them 10 subscriptions. For example, in Cortex, now with XDR, ITDR, we can sell them CDR. In Access, we will be able to sell them in AI Access. So, every time these deals will come up for renewals, we will have the opportunity to present more services and capability onto the platform with the customer driving NRR for us. So, we've made a simplistic assumption that the combined effect of NRR is approximately a 5% increase in ARR or the course of those years.
Gabriela Borges: Got it. Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Thanks, Gabriela. Next question, Gray Powell from BTIG, followed by Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Go ahead, Gray.
Gray Powell: Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question. And it was good to hear the 50% growth on Prisma SASE this quarter. So, a question on Secure Service Edge. If I look at industry analysts estimates there, I think Secure Service Edge is probably about 25% of the network security market today. Give or take, that's rough. I'm just kind of curious, where do you think that penetration goes in maybe three or four years? Or maybe said differently, how should we think about the growth profile of that market going forward and your ability to grow at or above that?
Lee Klarich: Yeah. Look, I think it's important to start with a view on this that the market will be hybrid for a very long time, meaning customers will need a combination of hardware form factors, software form factors, and SASE. And the reason for that is campuses still exist and hardware is still the fastest approach to this and public and private cloud software-based approaches are the best. SASE comes in with all of the remote users and branch offices. And so that hybrid nature from our perspective means that the customers will increasingly choose to go with a platform-based approach where they can shift traffic across those different form factors as is optimized for that form factor. And so, some of the SASE growth that you've seen, and you've seen it with us, where 50% growth with SASE over the last several quarters, is showing that that portion of the architecture is going to grow faster for some time, and then ultimately see this come into the total growth of the platform being what really matters. And then, on top of that, we can deliver the security services, such as the newly announced AI Access Security, across all of those form factors.
Gray Powell: Okay. Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Thanks for the question, Gray. Next up, Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho, followed by Fatima Boolani from Citi. Go ahead, Gregg.
Gregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thanks, Walter. Thanks for taking the question. Nikesh, in order to reach your fiscal '30 goals, it looks like you'll need to sign an average, give or take, of around 75 new platformization deals per quarter, a little higher than what you did just in Q3. But if we're in the early days of this strategy and if you're just now building your go-to-market muscle around this, why shouldn't new platformization customers be a lot higher than that on a multi-year basis? Thanks.
Nikesh Arora: Look, we told you last quarter we're going to do a platformization. I have to say, I have to commend our team. We spent a lot of time over the last 90 days working hard on analyzing all this data to make sure we could give you a framework so you can look at it and measure us over the next few quarters as we show you the benefits of platformization. So that's one part. The other part is like it's positively surprised, a good thing that we've got 60-plus deals done in this quarter. We'll see what happens in Q4. We've just started going down this journey, and of course, if prospects get better, we'll be happy to update our targets in the future. But for now, that seems like a robust goal that will still make us the first company in the history of cybersecurity to ever get anywhere close to that kind of aspiration and number.
Gregg Moskowitz: Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks, Gregg. Next up, Fatima Boolani from Citi, followed by Shaul Eyal from Cowen. Go ahead, Fatima.
Fatima Boolani: Thank you. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. Nikesh, you talked a lot about the multiplicative impact and the monetization acceleration you can get from platformization. I'm curious if we can put a profitability lens on this, because you are driving between $2 million and $14 million of the ARR you mentioned from a platformized customer. But from a contribution margin perspective, can you share with us what that incremental profitability impact would be like? And why should we sitting here not think that's structurally your business as it moves towards being increasingly consolidated can see 30%, 35%, maybe even 40% operating margins?
Nikesh Arora: Look, Fatima, in concept, principally, I have no argument against what you're saying. Because remember, if you look at an average enterprise company's P&L, the largest cost is sales and marketing, right? Gross margins are, give or take, 75% to 80%, take your favorite enterprise company. That leaves you most of your costs are -- majority of the costs are sales and marketing. If you can consolidate and concentrate your sales and marketing costs to very large deals and be able to generate large amounts of ARR or ACV/TCV, those customers, the cost of sales, the proportion of your revenue goes down. As you are constantly upselling into the same customer base, it also makes it a little easier. So, I think our opportunity is to first create enough breadth in our sort of coverage to make sure that we can actually go address all these landed customers. We've only done 900. We said we've got to get north of 2,500, which means we have to go address a lot more customers than our existing landed base. We don't have to go make new friends, we just have to go work with our existing friends. But yes, in the long term, I have no argument against your thesis that this should allow us to continue to aspire to higher profitability, not counting the impact of AI, which should get us to be a much more productive organization over the medium term.
Fatima Boolani: Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thank you, Fatima. Next question, Shaul Eyal from Cowen, followed by Andy Nowinski from Wells Fargo. Go ahead, Shaul.
Shaul Eyal: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Question for Dipak or Nikesh on finance receivables. So, finance receivables up 34% sequentially. I know you don't guide, cannot guide this metric. If we look into next quarter and take into account your commentary about the strong pipeline, will we be seeing the finance receivables still expanding? Or maybe asked differently, will there be a point where would you like to see that this metric actually decelerating to a degree? What's the thinking along these lines?
Dipak Golechha: Yeah. So, I think -- thanks for the question, Shaul. I think as a business grows, like having tools like PANFS can only help you. And if that's what the customer is looking for in terms of deferred payment plans, I think -- I don't have a problem if it goes up because it just ends up giving you even more like knowledge of what your cashflow will be in the future. Like, so all of that receivable, we can collect it eventually. Honestly, I think more of it is related to the cost of money than anything else. So, I think this becomes a larger issue in the current environment where interest rates are higher, I think if we're in an environment where the interest rates would go down, that's when I would expect this to potentially ratchet down.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks, Shaul. Next up is Andy Nowinski from Wells Fargo, followed by Joe Gallo from Jefferies. Go ahead, Andy.
Andy Nowinski: Okay. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. So, I wanted to ask you about the IBM deal. What was the impetus for acquiring those assets? Because it looks like their SaaS revenue is pretty small at $100 million. And given how well XSIAM is doing, couldn't you just capture those on-prem customers for free over time?
Nikesh Arora: Hey, Andrew, there's more than that. Remember, we explained to you that part of platformization is going to be able to transition customers of their existing contracts. Now the good news is we can transition these customers irrespective of term when they expire. That's great option value. I don't have to wait for three years to migrate them. I don't have to wait for an RFP. I can just walk up to them saying, "Listen, you're already my customer now, because I've acquired the contract. Why don't you come, we work on transitioning to XSIAM?" Not only that, it also allows the opportunity not just to go after the SaaS customer base, but also allows us to transition the on-prem customer base, which is a much larger prize, where IBM has economics from us, where they're able to transit -- they will get earn out based on how many of those customers transition to us. So, I mean, honestly, I think it's an amazing deal for us. I'm just delighted that IBM agreed to do this deal with us and partner with us. And also it gives me access to -- look in the history of IBM, they have not sold anybody else's cybersecurity portfolio with the enthusiasm we hope we can generate together for the thousand cybersecurity sellers. Until now they would sell one portfolio that was IBM. And today, this deal allows us to train all of them, all thousand of them, work with them on XSIAM and get it out to customers. I think it hopefully cements our place in the SIEM/SOC category at a pace that nobody would have anticipated, right? Until yesterday, there were three players in the Magic Quadrant, which was not us. This allows us to participate with one of the biggest players in the space and migrate as many of these customers based on merit and based on great proposition as quickly as we can.
Andy Nowinski: That makes sense...
Nikesh Arora: That's [$5 million] (ph), and I didn't have to spend, what was the number? Never mind, I won't quote a large number. I didn't have to sell many, many, many billions of dollars and transition to the customers then.
Andy Nowinski: Got it. Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks, Andy. Next up, Joe Gallo from Jefferies, followed by Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research. Go ahead, Joe.
Joe Gallo: Hey guys, thanks for the question. I want to follow up on Fatima's question. I don't think many disagree with the strategic long-term potential of the platform or the ensuing financial strength, but when you look at fiscal '25 specifically in free cash flow being 37%-plus margin there, how should we think about the visibility or durability of that free cash flow margin, given what's impacting you now with deferred payment terms, discounting, fatigue, hardware digestion should in theory impact you for a couple of quarters next year? Thanks.
Nikesh Arora: First of all, do not introduce the word fatigue in our conference call. Secondly, as it relates to the free cash flow margins, I'll let Dipak jump in in a minute. But it's the fine balance of making sure that we can let our annual billings continue to grow as a proportion, because we think this interest rate environment is here to stay and we can manage our free cash flow margins at the same timeframe. The good news is because of nicely increasing profitability that allows us to have the capability to let our annual billings continue to get bigger and bigger, because eventually that's what gets you. Take the extreme example on either side. The other side extreme example is a SaaS company with annual billings, which can go back to the same degree of free cash flow margins that they have. So, our opportunities to see if we can migrate our customers to more and more annualized billings and continue to maintain the margins without creating a kink in there. That's what Dipak is very focused on. I don't know if there was something you want to add to that, Dipak.
Dipak Golechha: No, the only thing that I would add is like, look, the more that you do deferred payments now, the more you actually understand your waterfall of what will come afterwards. So, as long as the shift doesn't happen all at once and it's a gradual shift that you're managing, it actually gives you even more certainty than less certainty in your ability to deliver. So, happy to talk offline about how we see that and why we believe that, but I think the data doesn't lie there.
Joe Gallo: Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Thanks, Joe. Next, Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research, followed by Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Go ahead, Ben.
Ben Bollin: Thanks, Walter. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Nikesh, one of the initial attributes around platform seems to be the potential for free use periods and as companies displace other vendors. Could you talk about what you've seen from the use -- those free use periods in those first 60-plus deals? And then maybe Dipak, could you talk through a little bit about what it means for revenue, RPO, ARR, billings, and like how that waterfalls over time? Thanks.
Nikesh Arora: Yeah. So, in the first 50 or 60 deals, I think we've got a little sort of portfolio of all kinds of stuff that's happened. There are some customers we've had to basically wait for six months to be able to charge for our services because they have an existing contract and we start implementation, so we wait that period out. Typically, those deals where we end up waiting out, end up with longer duration, because we don't want to give away that period over a shorter period time. So, you'll see that those deals are north of three years, in the case we end up giving some sort of free use period. In smaller situations, sometimes we'll provide migration services, which allows them to get off an existing solution and move to Palo Alto as quickly as possible. And remember because most of these implementations have some sort of ramp element, nobody goes and deploys 65,000 endpoints and turns them on in one day. Typically, it takes them three to four months internally to deploy those. So that actually doesn't impact us from a COGS perspective as much. It allows them to have that execution flexibility which you've always talked about as part of platformization. So, I think we've seen all variants, and I'll say right now, we're seeing more of an impact on our business from deferred payment than we are from the free periods, to be honest, right? In every case, we're trying to make sure the exit ARR is what we want from that customer. So, ARR we expected to ramp in some of these deals, which are three to five year duration where we provided free periods. But we're still, as I said, more impact is from the billing's deferral and annual billings than it is from free periods right now. And we'll know better after Q4 because you'd expect the volume of Q4 business given the expectations on numbers should be substantially more than Q3.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thank you, Ben. Next question, Jonathan Ho from William Blair, followed by Joel Fishbein from Truist. Go ahead, Jonathan.
Jonathan Ho: Good afternoon. As you add more AI capabilities to your platforms, what are customers looking to benefit from, and how do we think about the monetization opportunity here? Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: So, I think if you look at some of our products as we articulated, there are three specific products we announced at RSA. And then, we said all of our co-pilots will be available and already are available to customers for beta reasons. And then, we have underlying capabilities in our products which are AI enabled. Now, in most of our advanced services on firewalls, and I'm making a broad statement here, so we've increased prices from 20% of the cost of firewalls to the sub to 30%. So, we have had an uptick in AI-delivered services on the firewall, and the customers see the value and majority of customers have opted into that capability which we've had for the last two or three years and today we've just launched the most recent one, which is Advanced DNS which will also be uptick to a 30% instead of 20% subscription. AI Access will be sold as an incremental capability and incremental subscription for all of our VPN and for our SASE customers. So, you will have monetization capability there. AI Firewall would be, again, an uptick on our virtual firewalls where you have AI capabilities so you'll pay a premium to protect AI installations over a traditional VM. We're still debating whether we provide AI SPM to the market, which is effective in security posture management capability as part of our firewall optionality or we charge for it separately. We will do that closer to when we launch the actual product towards July. Our co-pilots are for the most part available to our customers as a productivity tool, as an enhancement tool. In certain cases where we require them to ingest data to get advanced telemetry, they would have to buy the advanced telemetry module to make the co-pilot even more useful for them. So that's roughly the lay of the land. But one should expect that there should be three capabilities. One, better productivity for our customers, so they don't have to understand more complex UI. Two, they will have to pay certain more -- some on more in certain use cases where they are getting incremental value and we're making incremental effort from them. Then three, they might require to upgrade their underlying capabilities from base to advanced because we need the telemetry to make AI useful.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks, Jonathan. We'll take our last question from Joel Fishbein from Truist. Go ahead, Joel.
Joel Fishbein: Thanks, Walter. I have an AI question, too, Nikesh, just to follow up on that. In terms of, can you talk about the customer appetite for AI security and maybe a couple of comments about the competitive landscape around companies that are delivering products around AI security as well?
Nikesh Arora: Yeah. Look -- so, we had an amazing reception to our AI -- precision AI, sort of preview at RSA. We have in north of a few hundred customers who signed up to have discussions with us and engage in the beta of these products. That's very good, A. B, as you'll appreciate, AI Access is an overlay product on all of our Access customers. So, it's a good thing because our customers say, I don't have to go somewhere else and get something add on and go make that happen, because I expect Palo Alto will have it in six weeks' time, so I'm just going to wait for Palo Alto. And those who are keen to deploy sooner, we are able to discuss with them, show them the beta, and continue to have design discussions with them. So, it sort of reduces any risk of competitive activity into our customer base where somebody else is providing AI Access Security in our own cases, one. Two, in the case of AI firewalls, I think what is unique is we are possibly the only security vendor which has a native integration. I say native, not on top, but native integration with AWS, Azure, GCP, and Oracle in their public clouds, which means our firewall sits in their cloud, you can activate it from their UI, not just from our UI, and you can launch it natively in all those cloud providers. AI firewalls will be built into that capability so that you get a native capability in most large cloud service providers, or a VM that you're going to deploy in your data center. So again, for somebody to compete with us, they would have to have that native capability first, then build it. So, do we expect that Google will have it? Possibly. Microsoft? Possibly. AWS? Possibly. So, the cloud providers might have that capability because they have native firewalls. But again, if you had a multi-cloud infrastructure with an LLM running in one cloud, another one running the other cloud, and some running in a data center, we hopefully are the only option that allows that capability to happen. So, we're trying to make sure that we do the early innovation in this space so our customers don't have to, or we don't create more fragmentation without the people having to deploy point products in that outcome.
Joel Fishbein: Great. Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: All right. Thanks, Joel. With that, we'll conclude the Q&A portion of the call. I'd like to turn it back over to Nikesh for his closing remarks.
Nikesh Arora: Well, I just want to thank all of you for joining our earnings call. I appreciate your attention. I also want to thank all of our employees for all the hard work that goes into delivering great quarters and all the innovation that they've delivered. And last but not the least, thank you for all of our customers for their trust in us. See you guys next quarter.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-02-20 16:30:00) =====
Walter Pritchard: Good day, everyone, and welcome to Palo Alto Networks' Fiscal Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. I am Walter Pritchard, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Please note that this call is being recorded today, Tuesday, February 20th, 2024 at 1:30 P.M. Pacific Time. With me on today's call to discuss second quarter results are Nikesh Arora, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dipak Golechha, our Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, Lee Klarich, our Chief Product Officer, will join us for the question-and-answer portion. You can find the press release and other information to supplement today's discussion on our website at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. While there, please click on the link for quarterly results to find the Q2 '24 supplemental information and the Q2 '24 earnings presentation. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections regarding the company's business operations and financial performance. These statements made today are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ from those forward-looking statements. Please review our press release and recent SEC filings for a description of these risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in the presentations today. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered as substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations are in the press release and the appendix of the investor presentation. Unless specifically noted otherwise, all results and comparisons are on a fiscal year-over-year basis. We would also like to note that management is scheduled to participate in the Morgan Stanley TMT Conference in March. I will now turn the call over to Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you, Walter. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today for our earnings call. I am pleased to report another quarter in which we successfully executed our profitable growth strategy, driving a combination of top-line growth, significant expansion in non-GAAP operating margin, and strong free cash flow generation. Revenues grew 19% year-to-year and RPO grew 22%, capturing the full value of our future revenue. Billings grew 16% year-to-year. Just as important as we focus on profitable growth, we again delivered substantial operating margin leverage and strong growth in free cash flow. Non-GAAP operating margins of 28.6% expanded nearly 600 basis points year-over-year and we generated $2.9 billion in adjusted free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis. Our strong profitability drove non-GAAP EPS of $1.46 up 39% year-over-year, and our GAAP net income continued to grow meaningfully even without one-time items. Beyond our financial results, we achieved a number of notable milestones in Q2, worthy of spotlighting. We continued to drive large deals, including a steady stream of million dollar plus deals and success in our largest deals with 10 transactions that were $20 million in the quarter. Our 10 highest spending customers in Q2 increased their spend with us by 36% of the period. I also wanted to update you on key achievements across our three platforms. In our network security business, we continue to see progress driving ARR growth in our SASE business. Q2 was our fifth consecutive quarter of 50% ARR growth. Additionally, more than 30% of our new SASE customers we signed in the second quarter were new to Palo Alto Networks, showing that we can win head-to-head in the market when leading with SASE. We continue to drive innovation in network security, refreshing our high-end 7500 series platform, and investing new OT security capabilities, which garnered a net new leadership position for us. In Prisma Cloud, we have made significant investments in the first half of the year to drive new customers and saw this pay off in Q2 with our highest new ACV growth in five quarters. We continue to see strong trends in multi-module adoption, with approximately 30% growth in customers with two or more modules and approximately 60% growth in customers with three or more modules. Additionally, about a quarter of our customers are using five or more modules. Our external recognition in this market continued with Forrester Research positioning us as a leader in this Cloud Workload Security Wave Report. In Cortex, XSIAM continues to be a significant catalyst for large transactions and growth across the business. This is evidenced by ARR, for XSIAM customers being more than five times higher than that of Cortex customers who have not yet adopted XSIAM. We have seen significant progress in the milestone with XSIAM in Q2, including the most number of deals signed in a single quarter and bookings of over $90 million again this quarter. We've already displaced 19 different SIM vendors to date, and with the confidence under our belt, we're now looking systematically on how we can accelerate this legacy SIM displacement. From a regional perspective, demand overall is healthy. We did see softness in the US federal government's market. We were positioned well for several large projects where we had requisite certifications and one technical selection, but these deals did not close. The situation started off towards the end of Q1. We were worsened in Q2, and as a result, we had a significant shortfall in our US Federal government business. We expect this trend will continue into our Q3 and Q4. Offsetting the billing weakness in Fed was some non-product backlog that we shipped this quarter. With several leadership positions awarded in second quarter, including our addition as a leader of the Gartner Endpoint Protection Magic Quadrant, we're now a recognized leader in 21 different categories across our three platforms. Five years ago when we began our strategy, the industry believed building leadership across multiple categories wasn't possible. No one was talking about security platform. Instead, the word was best-of-breed. Our success over the last five years has been driven by the shift to platformization. We're committed to investing in innovation to extend our industry leadership position and platform. This unique leadership across our three markets is driving strong adoption of our platforms in our target Global 2000 markets. As of Q2, 79% of Global 2000 have transacted with us on at least two of our platforms and 57% on all three. This is up from 73% and 47% two years ago. In most of these accounts, while they have adopted products from multiple platforms, we are early in driving each of our platforms wall-to-wall. This is a major area of focus for us as we move forward, driving consolidation within our three platforms. We know this is the right strategy as we see compelling economics with multi-platform wins. Our two platform customers have an average customer lifetime value that is more than five times that of our single platform customer. For our three platform customers, that is more than 40 times larger. While we are driving platformization, I personally think we should be doing this faster. Not only is this showing up in our deal statistics, but as we have established the position of our platforms, we are now seeing significant progress in consolidating vendors in our customer environments. We have built our zero trust platforms through a consistent architecture across our appliance, software, and SASE form factors. Customers can now consistently manage security policy across these form factors, and then leverage a consistent set of security subscriptions to consolidate network security capabilities. These capabilities, provided by point vendors can include intrusion prevention, web proxies, URL filtering, SD-WAN, and DLP, just to name a few. In Q2, we saw zero trust consolidation wins that included a large US manufacturing company standardizing on our network security platform in a $40 million transaction, replacing end-of-life competitive hardware, leveraging our security subscription, and removing a point competitor in SSE. We were the only company with the right certifications across all these offerings that could support their broad geographic footprint. This deal was part of the consolidation and modernization effort across IT with positive ROI for the customer. We also had a seven figure deal with a large law firm expanding our firewall footprint in the new data center and expanding their hybrid workforce initiatives with Prisma Access. As part of this, we won versus other firewall and SSE competitors and also consolidated their URL filtering and VPN capabilities. In Prisma Cloud, we have built a core-to-cloud platform combining key best-of-breed capabilities that we have acquired or developed organically. Our common architecture and user experience spreads across 12 modules. As our customers adopt multiple modules, they can consolidate a wide variety of vendors, including those in cloud security posture management, cloud workload protection, API security, SCA or software composition analysis, and infrastructure as code security amongst others. In Q2, we closed a seven-figure Prisma Cloud new logo deal with a financial services company displacing multiple incumbent vendors. The customer was looking for a CNAPP solution to support their multi-cloud journey. The Prisma Cloud CNAPP streamlined several previously deployed point solutions and tools. They also closed a seven figure renew and expand deal with the leading North American technology company where the customer intends to expand the use of Prisma Cloud to seven modules and also value the consolidation and standardization delivered through Prisma Cloud. Finally, in our Cortex platform with our autonomous security operations platform, XSIAM, we were able to establish our offering, which has enabled us to accelerate a platform value proposition with Cortex. A platform approach in the SOC is becoming a customer imperative, as point products, each with their own data stores, cannot have full context nor drive appropriate action without overly complex integrations and high people costs. In Q2, we saw consolidation wins that include a large insurance company that renewed its subscriptions, support and firewalls at the same time, added XSIAM and Expanse capability for a $25 million transaction. The XSIAM choice displays the two leading EDR and SIM competitors in the market, and enables the customer to avoid the cost of adding other point products in their SOC. Additionally, in Q2, we saw follow-on consolidation success for the Japanese manufacturing company that previously consolidated their network security across our SASE capabilities, leveraging Prisma Access and our DLP and CASB capabilities. The customer then added XSOAR into their SOC and expressed an interest in consolidating further. In Q2, they added XSIAM in a mid-seven figure deal. I know all of you had a chance to look at our guidance. Our guidance is not a consequence of a change in the demand outlook out there. Our guidance is a consequence of us driving a shift in our strategy in wanting to accelerate both our platformization and consolidation and activating our AI leadership. We believe this is the time for us to invest, given our leadership position in the market and our leadership position across platformization and consolidation. But before I talk about that more as to how we intend to accelerate our growth prospects in the future and drive towards a much higher aspiration of $15 billion in ARR by 2030, I want to give you a candid view of where we see the cybersecurity market and the demand function out there. The demand story is no different from prior quarters and on the margin, continues to get stronger. There are multiple drivers fueling this. The threat landscape continues to challenge our customers with increasing scale and sophistication of attacks. I'm personally getting calls from CEOs and members of boards that have had bad incidents, as well as those that have seen their peers adversely impacted. We're increasingly focusing on working with companies impacted by breaches, an important commitment as we continue to be the leader in this space. Last quarter, we offered 1,500 of our top customers an opportunity to get our free support during a breach. Surprisingly, 400 customers have signed up in the last 90 days out of 1,500 to get our help on this topic. Clearly there is awareness and concern around cybersecurity, as has never been before. Heightened geopolitical tensions are driving significant national state activity with national infrastructure being targeted. Successful breaches and ransomware attacks are being perpetrated across many industries with few repercussions for the bad actors. Although we did see various law enforcement agencies this morning over the weekend shut down lock pit, which is a promising sign. The new SEC mandate requires prompt disclosure of material incidents which often result in companies reporting those incidents before a full assessment can be done or incidents to mediate it. We see some companies making several disclosures in succession as they grapple with understanding the full extent of what they are facing. We see the results of these disclosure mandates recognizing the need for expedited action in security, visibility, and remediation in [indiscernible]. The part that is new, despite the many demand drivers we're seeing, we're beginning to notice customers are facing spending fatigue in cybersecurity. This is new, as adding incremental point products is not necessarily driving a better security outcome for them. This is driving a greater focus on ROI and total cost of ownership amongst most customers. There are also some key trends within the industry that I think are worth highlighting. Palo Alto Networks is unique in seeing gains in market share in hardware firewalls or in the product space. This market is changing rapidly with us seeing some of our competitors who had introduced price increases begin to roll them back. From our vantage point, we see the share shift happening in our favor because we see customers consolidating into our zero trust platforms. Customers, as I mentioned, 30%, net new network security customers or SASE or new to Palo Alto. Those are the customers who over time go ahead and consolidate their footprint and require our firewalls to be deployed to give them a consistent zero trust architecture. We see this as a promising trend. We intend to accelerate that opportunity. Along with the incremental focus on ROI and TCO with single product vendors having challenges and articulating compelling value, they're also forced to have platformization narrative. When they're not able to convince the customers that their strategy is competitive, they're many times resorting to un-economic pricing and putting pressure on transactions in this manner. We're beginning to see rogue behavior by some vendors in the space who are keen to retain their customers, primarily in the legacy vendor space and the start-up space. We intend to combat that with investing in this space and trying to accelerate platformization and consolidation for our customers. We're also seeing increased demand for AI, along with deploying AI in our products or big needs to our customers asking us to help them protect for a successful and responsible deployment of AI in their infrastructure. Putting this all together, these trends of the market bolster our conviction that adopting platforms is the only viable strategy for customers and leveraging AI is imperative. We want to march faster to our aspiration to become the sales force, to become the service now, or the workday of cybersecurity. Customers have adopted platforms in other markets across technology, and this will inevitably happen in cybersecurity. These industry trends set up conditions that favor leaders that can drive consolidation. We intend to answer this challenge. With all the problems that platformization holds, adoption is not always easy for many of our customers. Until now, we have primarily assumed that our customers adopt our platforms at their own pace. The crux of the challenge is around execution. Customers face risk in executing or making significant changes to the environments as well as economic exposure from these changes. Key friction points you've noticed include the challenge of replacing multiple products simultaneously as well as the issues around double playing while working through complex contract terms. Over the last six months, we have been quietly working to develop programs that enable us to help minimize and even share in the risk of our customers' face. You will see us tomorrow launching a significant number of platform offers to our customers to help drive the consolidation and platformization strategy. We believe we can build customer confidence in our platforms by approaching them well before their point product contracts expire. After we gain their contractual commitment, we have offered an extended rollout period where we can demonstrate our ability to deliver these platform benefits. Customers can then start paying us after the obligation of legacy vendors ends. With the experience we've gained over the last six months, we believe now is the right time to accelerate programs across our portfolio to drive this platformization. All these programs will have mechanisms to reduce customer friction, accelerate product deployment, help customer realize the value of our platforms, and consume new innovation sooner. While this is not an exhaustive list, I wanted to give you some examples. We have begun to launch programs already that include legacy trade-ins, no-cost introductory offers and product add-ons and incentives to accelerate estate standardization. Each of these programs is elements of reducing execution risk and dealing with economic exposure that concern our customers. In that sense, we must bear the cost of the transition through lower upfront financial outcomes, but we are convinced these will yield amazing outcomes for us in the mid to long-term. We have developed these programs across all three platforms, and as I mentioned, we intend, we have announced a few and we intend to announce more starting tomorrow in addition to expanding some of the programs that we already have. Given this is an investor call and you're all focused on these numbers, I want to provide you a high level understanding of the aggregate impact we expect this will have in the medium term and long term. I will then have Deepak talk more about this in his section and explain this much more eloquently and elaborately. We expect a typical customer entering into a platformization transaction will not pay us for our technology for a period of time. As these programs ramp over the next year, we expect a change to our billings and revenue growth for the next 12 to 18 months. As customers move into the period where contracts have a full billing and revenue contribution, we expect to see an acceleration in our top line metrics. Beyond this dip and acceleration in our top line metrics, we believe we can sustain higher growth rates for longer, driven by sticky and broad platform relationships with incremental customers, allowing us to aspire to a goal of $15 billion in next generation security in 2030. We also expect to achieve our transformation to a business with greater than 90% recurring revenue, an industry leading non-GAAP operating margins in the low to mid 30s. As Deepak will explain, we believe we can do this in a financially prudent and strong manner. Talking about bigger platforms and ARR, aspirations cannot be done today without talking about AI. We have been working on AI for a long time as a company, however, we did accelerate our efforts with the arrival of generative AI. I personally believe AI is going to be one of the biggest inflection points in technology in over a decade and likely, more importantly, to significantly increase the total addressable market in cybersecurity. Gartner predicts by 2027 $300 billion will be spent on AI software. This AI juggernaut continues to bring several challenges along with it from a security perspective, multiple vectors of attacks ranging from phishing to malware to nation state activity and inflected negatively due to AI. Furthermore, customers are evaluating dozens of co-pilot type offerings with end users where security is not necessarily front and center. We see three discrete opportunities to drive additional growth in cybersecurity through AI and we have internally put pen to paper to understand this opportunity, and we're in alpha or beta stages of many of these across our product capabilities. First, organizations are concerned about their employees' access to AI in an insecure manner, where the consequences are unintended leakage over from source, other data models tampering, or AI-driven phishing, we see an opportunity to add value across the growing volume of users we secure. We currently secure north of 100 million users and their access to applications both in the public cloud and in the data center. We expect each of these users is an opportunity for us to deliver an AI security sub for them. It leaves us a $3 to $5 billion opportunity over the next five years. Secondly, organizations are increasingly deploying AI-related workloads in the cloud, just like they need to understand the overall security posture of the cloud estate and expeditiously identify immediate issues. They must do this for AI-related workloads. We believe this in itself is a $5 billion to $6 billion opportunity in the next five years. Lastly, network traffic will increasingly have an AI context with interactions and transactions between applications and AI models. Our more than half a million installed firewalls is the perfect place to inspect this traffic. We believe this is the $5 billion to $6 billion opportunity in the next five years. Overall, this combined $13 billion to $17 billion opportunity drives our conviction that investing in AI and maintaining our leadership can help us accelerate our growth towards $15 billion by 2030. The larger opportunity, we also believe we are uniquely positioned to garner our fair share of the stamp. Our proprietary data and large technology footprint is a significant advantage in driving AI outcomes. We've already seen the early benefits of this AI in our newly developed product offerings. In Q2, our AI offerings, which include XSIAM, Autonomous Digital Experience Management, or ADEM, and AIOps, cost the $100 million in ARR milestone. We are possibly the first security companies to cost $100 million ARR in AI security. This is above and beyond the AI capabilities we have embedded across all of our platforms, including our advanced subscriptions and our core to cloud platforms. Our co-pilots are in alpha, are in the hands of leading customers who are giving us feedback before we move to general availability. Looking forward, we have aggressive plans to roll out additional AI-based offerings by the end of this fiscal year. We have plans to offer three new product offerings, one to address each of the stamps I talked about. Before I wrap up and pass it on to Deepak, I'd like to summarize. We have established our platformization notion, our clear industry leadership position with our best-of-breed platforms, and the industry trends convince us we're in the best position to capitalize on this early trend and now focus on the next phase of cybersecurity, which is going to be all about consolidation. One of the hardest things to do is to change a strategy that is working. We have spent time understanding how to accelerate our strategy further. We firmly believe as a management team that the changes we are making today are going to give us better prospects in the mid to long-term and allow us to drive this consolidation much faster whilst giving our customers better ROI and total cost of ownership. AI is an opportunity in the early stages. However, we are seeing the signs that there is significant demand there. It will prove to be an inflection point for cybersecurity. And today will be marked as a day where we will see that inflection begin to take hold as we start to deliver more AI security products over the course of the rest of the year. We have confidence we can drive our top line growth trajectory higher for longer ahead of the growth trajectory we talked about back in August, despite absorbing some short-term impacts. We have shown we run the business in a financially prudent manner, which we will continue to do as we dive this exploration, hitting our original operating profitability and cash flow margin targets. With that, I will pass on to Deepak.
Dipak Golechha: Thank you, Nikesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Given all that we have to talk about this quarter, I will do an abbreviated review of our Q2 results. You can refer to the press release and supplemental financial information on our website for our key numbers. For Q2, revenue of $1.98 billion grew 19%. Product revenue grew 11%, while total service revenue grew 22%, with subscription revenue growing 26%, and support revenue growing 14%. Moving on to geographies, we saw consistent revenue growth across all of our theaters, with the Americas growing 19%, EMEA up 19%, and JPAC also growing 19%. We had some puts and takes during the quarter related to billings. As Nikesh mentioned, we saw weakness in the US federal vertical related to some specific programs. This US federal weakness was a meaningful headwind to our billings in Q2 after we saw a slow start in the year to Fed. The impact of these federal deals on our revenue is significant as they are relatively shorter than our average contract term. At the same time, we saw a decrease in our non-product backlog which offset this Fed weakness in our billings. We continued to see customers closely watching cash outlays around deals, which we discussed last quarter, although this trend played out largely as we expected 90 days ago. Remaining performance obligation, or RPO, was $10.8 billion, and current RPO was $5.2 billion. You likely noticed that our GAAP EPS was $4.89 and GAAP net income was $1.75 billion. These benefited from a $1.5 billion release of a tax-related valuation allowance. This was a one-time item in fiscal year '24, which has been adjusted out of our non-GAAP results. This amount also does not impact our cash taxes. Our average duration on new contracts was relatively flat year-over-year, with average duration for new contracts remaining at approximately three years, while total contract duration was down slightly year-over-year. I did want to spend more time talking about our accelerated platformization and consolidation strategy and give you more of my perspective with some additional framing and detail with a financial lens. Nikesh talked about our programs to alleviate friction with customers. We believe that by moving from a deal-by-deal approach to a program-based and systematic approach, we can accelerate platformization with a customer base and drive vendor consolidation faster by mitigating platformization friction. This results in a number of business benefits for us, ranging from a faster capture of the customer estate and larger platform commitment to higher renewal and expansion rates and faster adoption of our new innovations. For the customer they are able to execute on the platform deployment with lower risk and consolidate vendors while benefiting from a lower cost total cost of ownership and a better security posture. As Nikesh gave you the high-level trajectory on our pipeline, I wanted to help you understand how we think about the medium term. Our platformization offers to drive consolidation, effectively provide customers a period of the contract for free as part of their commitment. We expect we may see a period of 12 to 18 months of pressure on our top line growth rates, notably billings. Some of our platformization programs embed deferred payments into deal structures, which we have spoken about in the past. We expect this will persist through fiscal year 2025 as we anniversary the rollout of these programs and result in billings below the target we provided in August of 2023. Beyond this period, we expect we can sustain higher growth than we provided in these targets in August. From an NGS ARR perspective, we expect less impact on our year-end metrics, and we expect we can continue to meet or exceed our target, which called for 30% growth rate through fiscal year '26. As Nikesh noted, we are establishing a long-term target of $15 billion of NGS ARR in fiscal year '30. Underlying this trend, we expect customers deploying our full set of platforms to have a higher makeup of NGS products. These offerings tend to be deeply installed in our customer infrastructure. And once a customer deploys the platform, it's easier to continue to consolidate vendors and adopt new innovations. We expect this to drive a significant increase in our overall revenue mix that is recurring. From a revenue perspective, we expect to see less pressure on revenue as compared to billings. Generally we see a lag in changes in our revenue growth versus our billings growth, and we expect that this will happen here as well. As Nikesh mentioned, part of what gives us confidence to execute on the strategy, and especially to do so now, is our success in driving profitable growth. As we embark on a strategy that we expect will negatively impact the top line in the short-term, we have significant confidence that our business scales well and we can continue to see operating leverage from a number of drivers. As I have mentioned multiple times before, we scale well across every line item of our P&L, ranging from customer support to cloud hosting, to sales and marketing, to G&A. And we've seen significant payoff from focusing on internal efficiency across all areas of the business. Let me give you some specific examples for Q2. First, in cloud hosting, we signed a significant extension with our primary cloud provider. This contract is constructed to enable us to drive further margin benefits as we scale. Second, within G&A, we're progressing well on a significant employee experience program. This started by analyzing all of our service desk tickets across all channels and identifying all the manual responses needed to address requests. The combination of process re-engineering, automation, and AI is still in progress, but we have already seen positive savings and have a target of automating 90% of the more than 300,000 manual interventions. By the end of Q2, we have roughly halved the cost of our T&E servicing. We are now leveraging this program as a template across other business areas. In short, whilst we made a lot of progress, we still have significant opportunities on the profitability front. That gives us confidence that we can maintain our medium term operating margin and free cash margin targets beyond this year. Specifically, we believe that we can expand our operating margins by 100 basis points beyond this year, in line with the operating margin guidance we gave in August of 28% to 29%. And this can continue to support our medium-term free cash flow margin target of 37% plus. We expect that this will come despite us absorbing some billing's impact, as we have both the benefit of some prior arrangements with deferred payments contributing as well as efforts we have placed on optimizing the cash dynamics of our vendor spending. In short, I wanted to reiterate what Nikesh said, that it is important for us to be able to manage through this platformization acceleration in a financially prudent manner and we have set ourselves up well to do this over the next 12 to 18 months. Now moving on to the guidance for Q3 and the year. For the third quarter of 2024, we expect billings to be in the range of $2.30 billion to $2.35 billion, an increase of 2% to 4%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.95 billion to $1.98 billion, an increase of 13% to 15%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.24 to $1.26, an increase of 13% to 15%. For the fiscal year, we expect billings to be in the range of $10.10 billion to $10.20 billion, an increase of 10% to 11%. We expect NGS ARR to be in the range of $3.95 billion to $4 billion, an increase of 34% to 35%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $7.95 billion to $8 billion, an increase of 15% to 16%. We expect operating margins to be in the range of 26.5% to 27%, an increase of 240 basis points to 290 basis points year-over-year. And we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of 5.45% to 5.55%, an increase of 23% to 25%. We expect adjusted pre-cash flow margin to be 38% to 39%. In the interest of time and to get as many of your questions as possible, we've included the modeling points in the appendix of our earnings presentation. With that, I will turn the call back over to Walter for the Q&A portion of the call.
A - Walter Pritchard: Thanks. We'll now proceed with Q&A. Please, in the interest of time, ask only one question with no follow-ups. Our first question will come from Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley, followed by Brian Essex from JPMorgan. Hamza, please go ahead with your question.
Hamza Fodderwala: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to clarify, Nikesh, your comment on spending fatigue. What exactly were you referring to there, just given you also said demand was quite good. And then just the billings cut. It seems like it's a function of some bundling, discounting, as well as lower duration. Anyway to quantify that at all? Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: Thanks, Hamza. Thanks for the question. Yeah, I think I want to make sure there's no confusion in our characterization of spending fatigue. Over the last few years, most of our customers have ended up spending more on cybersecurity than on IT. As a consequence, they're feeling like my budget for cybersecurity keeps going up in double-digits every year because I'm trying to protect against every new threat vector. Yet, you see the number of breaches continues to rise. So our customer are sitting down and saying, if I spend more money, can you show me how I get a lower total cost of ownership across my enterprise? How do I spend less on the services that I have to deploy? And how do I get better ROI? So I think it's more about optimizing their current cybersecurity budgets as opposed to there being no demand. Demand continues to be very strong. The customers are demanding to get more for the amount of money they have allocated to cybersecurity. That's where platformization consolidation kicks in. In terms of trying to quantify duration versus.
Dipak Golechha: So just to be clear, Hamza, from a billings perspective, part of the billings guidance is related to the Fed that we talked about in the prepared remarks, part of it is also because of the platform initiatives -- platformization initiatives per se, but also part of it is we just expect there to be more deferred payments like annual billings, things like that as we roll out these programs. That's what makes it up.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thank you, Hamza. Next question is from Brian Essex at JPMorgan, followed by Saket Kalia at Barclays. Brian, go ahead.
Brian Essex: Yeah. Thanks, Walter. And maybe to follow up on Hamza's question. Maybe for Dipak, one thing that caught my ear was the comment about discounting or offering a free period upfront for a certain period of time. Wanted to get a sense of what kind of headwind within that billings guidance is attributable to some of that discounting? And should we be looking at other metrics like average TCV or annualized TCV to get a sense of once those contracts hit a normal run rate, what would a normalized growth rate look like?
Nikesh Arora: Thanks, Brian. Let me jump in here. I think let me clarify in terms of the discounting notion. What's happening today is when I go to a customer and say, listen, I'd like to replace your estate with the entire platform. The customer says, wait, wait a minute, I got this vendor for IPS, this for SD-WAN, this for SSC. And I got half of my firewalls from another vendor, and they all expire at different points in time. I'd love to deploy Zero Trust, but it's going to take me two, three years as the end of life, so these vendors happen. And I'm scared that if I rip and replace this at this point in time, is going to create execution risk, not just that, it's going to hit economic risk. So the propositions we're going to customers is, listen, let's lay out a two-year, three-year cybersecurity consolidation and platformization plan. We'll go start implementing today, you pay us when they're done. So what it is, is more of a sort of like you can use our services until you have to keep paying the other vendor, we'll take it from there. But that's taking away a lot of the economic exposure and the execution risk for our customers. Now you can call that discount or you can call that a free offer. Our estimate is approximately it works out at about six months' worth of free product capabilities to our customers on a rolling basis. I think in about 12 months, as our offers start lapping each other, we should go back to our growth rate we've been talking about. And I think the right metric is the time frame is to look at RPO.
Brian Essex: Okay. Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Thank you, Brian. Next question is from Andrew Nowinski at Wells Fargo, followed by Gabriela Borges at Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, Andy.
Andrew Nowinski: Thank you. I wanted to ask about the US federal spending. You said it was soft in Q2, Nikesh and I think it's going to remain soft for the next six months. But given your comments about how nation state activity targeting the national infrastructure was increasing, I guess, why do you think there's a disconnect between that trend? And were those comments specific to your Palo Alto customers in the US Fed are more broad-based?
Nikesh Arora: Look, part of it is particular to us. As you are aware, there was a large program. We were part of down selected to be the only vendor. We'd expected we staffed it to make sure we could implement it and we could get the orders. That program didn't materialize at the pace and at the spending levels we had expected. We saw an early glimpse in Q1 towards the end -- you saw it not show up in Q2, and we have it staffed for Q3 and Q4. Remember, Fed is a lower duration number. So it has a much more significant impact to revenue because Fed pays on an annualized basis as opposed to an TCV basis. So you're seeing the impact of that to our revenue for Q3 and Q4 and some of the billings miss in Q2, which we had to make up with shipping from non-product backlog. So that's kind of what happened in the Fed business. One's bidding, twice shy. So we're being very cautious about how we expect it to come back or not in the second half of the year. So it's more pertinent to that as opposed to a broader comment around the federal space. And don't forget, Fed is, in general, is not a next-generation security adopter because they're usually slower on cloud services than they are on traditional cybersecurity products.
Andrew Nowinski: Makes sense. Thanks.
Walter Pritchard: Thanks, Andy, Apologies. We're going to go back to Saket Kalia from Barclays and then go to Gabriela Borges from Goldman. Go ahead, Saket.
Saket Kalia: Hey, great. Hey, thanks, guys. Nikesh, maybe for you, just to touch on the platformization item a little bit deeper. I almost think about these as ramping contracts and you tell me if that's off. But specifically, as you look at the second half, maybe putting the mechanics of the ramp aside, how do you sort of feel about sort of underlying demand with metrics like ACV or bookings and what percentage of your book of business do you sort of expect to shift to sort of this ramping structure? Does that make sense?
Nikesh Arora: Yes, yes, that makes a lot of sense. I think part of what we're noticing, Saket, is that we'd like to go from best-of-breed competitive behavior with legacy vendors or New Year vendors and go straight to platform competition. Because you noticed that we have a higher win rate on platform deals. We have a higher win rate and consolidation plays as opposed to best-of-breed head ones, which end up costing more time and energy and you see very, I call it, rogue behavior where people start trying to desperately hold on to customers. So we are trying to shift our go-to-market towards a consolidation play and a platform play. I think, as I said to earlier, the right number to look at in this context is RPO. The underlying demand is strong. Our book of business is strong. Our pipeline is strong. There is nothing going on in the demand side. It's just that we see this pushing out of the billings towards later parts as we get more and more consolidation offers and platform offers out there. To give you an example, when we acquired Talend , we made Talend free to every SASE customer, right? Is there going and trying to upsell that every SASE customer and run the risk of running the POCs other secure browsers. We've decided to give it away free for the next 12 months until the customer's renewal comes up. Now that has a billing impact in the 12-month time frame and revenue impact. However, at the end of 12 months, all these will be renewed because our aspiration is to get 50% of our customers to use the enterprise browser. It's one of the best products we've acquired. It has tremendous market traction. When we acquired it, there were 100 POCs in place going on at customers. And we told them, listen, if you're a Palo Alto customer, just use it. It's part of our product. It's part of the licensing. You don't have to pay us more, you don't have to do a new contract. What that does, it allows us to penetrate a market segment which would end up being competitive, we end up getting some share and spend the rest of our lives trying to create more traction and more market share in the future. Is that great. It's free. Our incident response offer. We never had 400 Fortune 2000 customers dealing with us on incident response. We launched an offer in 90 days, we've got 400 customers. We gave them 250 hours free, right? That's 100,000 hours of breach consulting for free, but that drives a future business for us where they become our cybersecurity partner of choice. So we're trying to seed ourselves into our customers' platform and consolidation strategies so that we don't have to keep fighting on individual breach individual best-of-breed deal every time we go to a customer.
Saket Kalia: Makes sense. Thanks, guys.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks, Saket. We're going to go next to Gabriela Borges with Fatima Boolani from Citi on deck.
Gabriela Borges: Hi. Good evening. Thank you. Nikesh, I wanted to ask how you think about the risk of potentially cannibalizing the customers that are willing to pay full price today as you implement the bundling strategy? And then how do you think about --
Nikesh Arora: If you find them, let me know. Sorry, go ahead, please ask the question. How do you?
Gabriela Borges: Yes. It's also a longer-term question on how do you think about maybe catalyzing a race to the bottom with pricing pressure. So as you think about ramp deals, technology that maybe was $100 today or a year from now, by the time you get to renewal, is no longer worth $100 because you've created pricing competition or you've created a competitive response.
Nikesh Arora: I think there are two answers. Yes, let me answer two parts of the question. I think this is -- to think about it as a price war is a wrong way to think about it. Actually, we're averting a price war by driving a platformization approach. I will explain how. First of all, all of our customer deals are discussed, negotiated POC. So it's very rarely that we have a customer who does not understand the value of what they're offering. Because the competitive market, we have a price. Our competitors are who normally rational competitors have a price. So we don't think that we're cannibalizing a full price paying customer we are possibly. I think what we are doing, Gabriela is that we're avoiding the unintended consequence where a customer says, oops, I have no time left. Because what happens to customers with all the right intentions we'll say, I'll renew, I'll buy Palo Alto in 12 months from now when my current contract goes away. They take a little while analyzing and they get to six months, oh my God, if I'm not able to deploy you in six months, I'm going to have an exposure, so I'm going to go try and get a renewal. When they're trying to get a renewal, the other vendors know this is not going to be their business for too long. So that's when international pricing behavior happens. It's not when they execute early and deploy early. So actually, averting the last minute race to the bottom like you called it, by making sure our customers don't have to worry about the execution risk and trying to get renewals and trying to get best pricing in the last six months.
Gabriela Borges: Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks, Gabriela. Next up is Fatima Boolani from Citi. And after that, Roger Boyd from UBS.
Fatima Boolani: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Nikesh, on the platformization strategy. I was hoping you could drill into what the catalyst was for this to be a midyear change. What were you hearing from customers where you said we've got to pull the trigger in the middle of the year because it's admittedly atypical. And then as a related note, when you're rolling this out, if you've got customers who are not paying you for six months, how are salespeople going to get compensated for that free freemium sort of stance you're taking. So just how are you protecting I guess, the piece of the go-to-market organization as it relates to the new strategy?
Nikesh Arora: Thank you. Dipak did warn me this one will take a little bit of explaining. And -- so let me go back to what Saket said. For simplicity purposes, think about a ramp deal. So our sales people still get paid on TCV, right? So they're still going to do a three-year deal or a five-year deal. We're not doing six months or 12-months deals. So you'll see that in our RPO. You'll still see us doing ramp deals for the first six months may not be charged, but the next 4.5 years is or the next 2.5 years to sort our salespeople will get paid on the TCV deals like they get paid today, right? That's not a problem. I think that's the best way to think about it and, I'm sorry, there was another part that I missed, I apologize.
Fatima Boolani: Just the impetus of it being --
Nikesh Arora: I'd say the impetus, Fatima is fascinating. We are -- we've managed to double our business in the last five years. And for us to get to a double from here and more, we've had to step back and say, what did we do? We got 21 categories where we're best-in-breed to realize we're still fighting best-of-breed deals while we should be selling the platformization strategy and we realized selling the platformization strategy, which we have been for the last six months, as we said, we have been trialing this out, we've been running this play with about six months discovering, when we go in with the platform approach, we win more often than if we go into the best-of-breed only. Otherwise, we get whittled down on price, XDR to XDR or SASE to SASE. When you go with XSIAM with XDR, XSIAM and XSOAR, then we don't get a little down on price because customers see the TCO value and the ROI of doing the entire replacement together. But the moment we go up with that is like lots a lot of risk. I got to replace everything in the next six months. I'm not willing to commit, let's go one at a time. And they go one at a time, I get riddled down on price with a legacy vendor.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks, Fatima. Next up, we have Roger Boyd, and after that, it will be Jonathan Ho from William Blair.
Roger Boyd: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Another follow-up on the platformization. But as you get more accommodative on some of these offerings, more aggressive on discounting. What are you expecting to see from a contract duration perspective? It sounds like the focus is going to be on RPO, but are you expecting to see contract duration actually extend in exchange for some of this economic flexibility? Thanks.
Nikesh Arora: I think that's a great question. I think the way to think about it is that we still have two parts of our business. We'll still have the regular part of our business, which is still growing and competing best-of-breed. We expect that business to continue. Remember, this platformization really applies to where customers have the opportunity to consolidate and platformize. There are still many who are in different parts of their cybersecurity journey or the IT journey. So to the extent that we are dealing with the customer who's willing to consolidate with us, you will see contract durations go up because we're not going to do this if you're not going to get a commitment for a three to five year deal because it does not behoove us to do those deals if you don't see a long-term commitment to the customer because we are going to be consolidating multiple security products to them and working with them to implement them across the enterprise.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thank you. Next question, Jonathan Ho from William Blair. And after that, we've got Adam Borg from Stifel.
Jonathan Ho: Great. Thank you for taking my question. I guess one thing I'm trying to understand a little bit better is this ability to standardize on the platform, give you something similar to what Microsoft has done with their E5 bundling to sort of force customers or package very attractive terms for customers to switch. And I guess how does that maybe play out in terms of customers' willingness to commit to a single vendor platform? Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: That's a great question, Jonathan. Very apt question. Look, it allows us to do a much better job of putting stuff together across our portfolio as opposed to having to do each of these deals on an individualized basis. So you're bang on the idea that this consolidation benefits us and allows us to drive towards that platform much faster. That's helpful. I think it also gives us financial flexibility in terms of pricing deals. That's also very important, very true. But I'll give you an example, right, just this morning, I was on the phone and the customer is trying to buy an IoT capability. Independently, that IoT capability is going to cost them north of $5 million. They already have our firewalls. We allowed them to activate IoT of our firewalls, which cost us a lot less than $5 million. But that allowed them to consolidate. And now when the renewal comes up in six months or 12 months, they're going to be able to renew for a higher amount. So that degree of flexibility that we can offer our customers, but they don't have to go end up spending more and building yet another vector that they have to go consolidate in the future is what we're trying to drive to.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks, Adam. Next up is Keith Bachman from BMO followed by Tal Liani of BofA.
Keith Bachman: Hi. Thank you. You confuse me, Walter. I think Dipak for you, you mentioned we certainly have the billings guide for Q3 and then implied for Q4, something like 10%. And you indicated that this was going to be a 12 to 18 month sort of impact as you try to anniversary consolidating spend. But is there any trough or any way to think about FY'25? I mean is it still double-digit billings growth that we should be thinking about? Or any kind of metrics on how you think about the six to, or excuse me, 12 to 18 month impact where you're trying to anniversary the program?
Dipak Golechha: Yes, our aspiration is that towards the second half of '25, we should revert back to our original expectations of mid to high double-digit growth. But as I said, so 12 to 18 is obviously we have to go experience these programs to see how they persist. But at some point in time, they will start to lap and give us better upside in the larger size deals that we're able to do.
Nikesh Arora: I just want to make one more point, sorry, on this context. One of the things that I think should not be lost what Dipak has said. We have maintained our absolute free cash flow guidance for the year and absolute EPS guidance for the year. So we believe we can make all this happen whilst holding our earnings and free cash flow constant.
Keith Bachman: Yeah, noted.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Next, we're going to go back to Adam Borg and then we're going to go to Tal Liani for BofA.
Adam Borg: Awesome. Thanks, Walter. Thanks, everyone for taking the question. Maybe just on XSIAM, it was good to see the traction there. Maybe talk more about the displacement opportunity that you saw in the quarter. I think you talked about replacing -- displacing up to 19 different vendors since being introduced and talk more about how you plan to further penetrate that as part of this broader platformization approach. Thanks.
Nikesh Arora: Thanks, Adam. So Adam, we've displaced 19 unique different SIM vendors. And the reason that's relevant for us is that tells us that our platform has capability that spans multiple use cases and different types of products in the market. It's not like we only replace one kind of SIM. We have been able to replace different kinds of SIM, which offer different capabilities in our customers. And we still believe this is the fastest and best cybersecurity product that has been created. We are north of 65 customers now in nine months. As we said, we have signed a larger number of deals this quarter. And on a deal basis, we did a $90 million in TCV. So we're really excited about it. This does resonate with our customers. We are launching tomorrow an offer to replace end points for our customers who are stuck with legacy end points which is one of the things that holds us back in being able to deploy XSIAM. We've also announced support of other non-legacy vendors that they have in their infrastructure. So our customers have been asking for that so we can support some of the other leading edge XDR capabilities in the market. So we are making a concerted play to be able to be the SOC of choice. It is radically different and better than most other SIMs out in the marketplace. So we are putting a concerted effort, very excited about where we are with it.
Adam Borg: Great. Thanks.
Walter Pritchard: Thanks a lot, Adam. Next up, Tal Liani from BofA followed by Brad Zelnick at Deutsche Bank.
Tal Liani: Hi. First, just a clarification, you spoke about discounting or pricing. Is there any product where you see more discounting than others? Is it on the legacy firewall side? Or do we see it on SASE or Cortex? Or should we look at it as a complete kind of pricing for the platform?
Nikesh Arora: I think the best analogy is Jonathan's analogy, which is the bundling of multiple things into one capability, more like I don't want to call it that one. More like one of the other vendors has a certain bundling philosophy. I think it's more like that than it is about individual product categories because it's not about if you buy SASE, I'll make it cheap, or if you buy XDR, I'll make it cheap. It's about -- if you commit to my network security platform, the combined whole of it will be much better TCO and ROI for you, and I'll take the execution risk. You don't remember, the exit ARR for me is going to be no different than it is today and I think that's why I don't like the word discounting or reduced pricing. The exit ARR will be consistent with what I would get today. I would end up taking the execution risk away from the customer.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thank you, Tal. Next up, we have Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank. And after that, Matt Hedberg from RBC.
Brad Zelnick: Great. Thanks so much. I wanted to ask another question from a go-to-market perspective, just extending on Fatima's question. Nikesh, how do you align the channel to execute on this platformization strategy where for you to win, somebody else has to lose. And their economics are typically a function of present day billings not LTV. And then also just extending on that, you've talked about the SIs as a real strategic opportunity for you. Where do they fit into this platform -- I got to practice the word platformization strategy. Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: I know it's a new word. Only introduced five years ago when you didn't believe us. But now we've got to worry about consolidation. Thank you, Brad. So when I start to make fun with you, I start forgetting your question. So look, the two, the SI, your channel question, so two parts of it. It's a great question. First of all, channel does get compensated on TCV. So I think part of what we said is our deals are 40 times when they use all three platforms compared to a single platform deal. Our deals are north of 20 times than used two platforms, right? Our top 10 customers spent 36% more with us than everybody else. And that's all a function of -- as the deal size. As we do the platformization, the deal size is going to get bigger. The channel gets paid on TCV. So channel has a lot of incentive to help us drive this platformization. I think you hit a very important point around SIs. We have been working really hard over the last six months with our SI partners to help activate and we're actually trying to get in front of their engagements with customers as opposed to wait for their RFPs. We have very strong relationships with almost every SI out there. It's been a concerted effort. We've just Kristy Friedrichs who is the CEO of New Relic to drive our partnership, she is the Chief Partnership Officer. So we are putting a lot of attention and focus on it. And we're positively enthused about the traction we're getting with the SI. To think about it, the SIs are new to this business over the last three to five years. They used to have cybersecurity businesses, but they really doubled down and focused on it, you can take your favorite SI and they all have a very strong practice in cyber security. And they would much rather partner with one large player or a few large players in the entire gamma of 3,000 cybersecurity companies that are out there. So it fits their aspirations. It fits our aspirations are getting ahead of it. So they are a critical part of this platformization approach because these platform offers actually spin out a lot more services revenue than individual best-of-breed offers.
Brad Zelnick: Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks. Next up is Matt Hedberg from RBC followed by Joe Gallo from Jefferies.
Matt Hedberg: Great. Thanks, Walter. I think one of the important points, Nikesh, you made is, despite all these changes, free cash flow margins are unchanged for fiscal '24 and the midterm targets, I guess the question for Dipak, I just wanted to make sure I understood why that's the case. It sounds like you said it was prior arrangements and optimizing vendor payments. First of all, did I get that right? And I guess, secondly, when we get into '25, are there other variables that we think of that could potentially change that margin target or kind of confidence level that, that margin target can hold into next year?
Dipak Golechha: So whilst we're not guiding to next year, we're pretty confident in our free cash flow margin, as I said in my prepared remarks going forward. Just to be clear, the thing that buttresses our free cash flow margin the most is our operating margin. Okay? So we do expect that to continue to increase. And that's kind of like one part of it. Secondly, we've got more business that's coming off prior contracts that we've signed. So we have visibility to that. We know when they're going to come. We also have some incremental focus on factors that impact our cash flow, for example, vendor payment terms. But when we put that all together, look, we're pretty confident on the cash flow side.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thank you. And we'll take our final question from Joe Gallo at Jefferies. Go ahead, Joe.
Joseph Gallo: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I appreciate the candor and the cash on spend fatigue and it's logical. But given your discounting comments, can you just give an update on the competitive environment on win rates or any metrics you're tracking, particularly in SASE. Have you seen several vendors enter the market, several noting large eight-figure wins. You've certainly made eight-figure deals look easy over time, but what gives you confidence this is not competitive, and this is more of a short-term hiccup?
Nikesh Arora: First of all, I would not classify this as a short-term hiccup. I know you guys would love life that was linearly nice in quarters and moved up in a beat-and-raise percentage basis. I'm trying to get this done in the next three to five years where we become even a bigger and larger platform in cybersecurity. If I step back and look at what we've done over the last five years, we established the notion of the platform in cybersecurity. It wasn't a notion that existed. I'm trying to accelerate the deployment of the notion because I believe competitive advantage in product in this industry the last two to three years. At this point in time, I believe we have the largest competitive advantage across our platforms in the market starting with our XSIAM product in our SOC space. We think that is a 15-year-old legacy space, which we should get quickly and go and deploy as quickly as we can across the board and take you any friction in the process. On network security, we did not have network securities, Zero Trust offers in the marketplace. We are starting to see our customer bought $40 million of SASE and then came and replaced all their firewalls with us in the last six months, right? So we are seeing the customers show that behavior. We're trying to take all the friction out of the way, they can make that happen. Now if I break it down into the three categories we're in, I think in network security, you'll see more and more zero trust offers where hardware, software and SASE have to combine. There's very few vendors in the space who can do that today. So they're trying to hold on to the legacy positions. We're accelerating combination across that category. You can make your own judgments as to which vendors are going to benefit, which ones are not going to benefit as much. In the SOC space, there is only one option, deploy AI in your SOC. The average technology in the SOC space is 13 to 15 years old, right? That was not made for AI. It was not ready for AI, it doesn't matter who you buy, it doesn't matter what gets acquired. What is important is that you can actually have an AI delivered data lake that delivers the capability of XSIAM. On cloud, it's a new space. And we're beginning to see what's fascinating is for us, our best cloud customers are the ones who are delivering SaaS software to their customers. So we take the large platform players, they use our cloud security because they understand the need to have an integrated cloud platform. So we have green shoots. We have trialed this. This is the time for us to double down and accelerate. That's what we're doing. It's not a hiccup.
Joseph Gallo: Makes sense. Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks, Joe, for that last question. With that, I'll pass it over to Nikesh for his closing remarks.
Nikesh Arora: I know this was exciting for all of you guys, even more exciting for us. We are committed. We believe this is the right way forward. We believe this is the way we can deliver a faster platformization, a faster way to consolidate the industry into a platform. We hope that in the next five years, this allows us to double our business from here, which is why I'm here. I want to say thank you to all of our employees, all of our partners, and of course, all of you for taking the time to listen to our earnings call.

===== 2024 Q1  (2023-11-15 16:30:00) =====
Walter Pritchard: Good day, everyone, and welcome to Palo Alto Networks' Fiscal First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. I am Walter Pritchard, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Development.

The most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations are in the press release and the appendix of the investor presentation. Unless specifically noted otherwise, all results and comparisons are on a fiscal year-over-year basis. We also note that management is participating in the UBS Conference on November 29. I will now turn the call over to Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you, Walter, very good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our earnings call. Q1 was the first quarter of our three-year plan we presented in August. If I were to summarize the quarter I would say the following. We continue to execute amazingly well in what is a volatile environment. On the geopolitical front, we've been contending with what's happening in Israel and Ukraine. On the hardware or product front, as you see, there has been normalization in the industry, it's something we've been indicating for a while. Backlogs is being shipped, supply chain issues are behind us and product growth is normalizing in the industry, we continue to seize normal strength as we indicated in prior quarters in that category. On the macroeconomic front, business practices continue to adapt and adjust to a new normal with higher interest rates for longer. Internally, on the product side, we've had one of the strongest start to our fiscal year. In addition to various recognitions, we have delivered strong innovation across all three platforms. We launched an AI-enabled Cloud Manager and Network Security to continue our consolidation platformization efforts towards Zero Trust. In SASE, we announced our intent to deliver enterprise browsers, the Talon acquisition, which will solve one of the critical issues that more access, which is not addressed today by any SASE vendor. We released the industry's first integrated UI for Code to Cloud and Prisma Cloud and announced the acquisition of Dig Security, double-down on data security for Generative AI and Prisma Cloud. Last but not the least, in Cortex, we launched XSIAM 2.0 to bring your own AI. On-the-go to-market side, Q1 is seasonally a slower start as we kick off the new year, but the team delivered superior revenue and profitability and we had our highest cash collection quarter in our history. We continued to see steady execution - excuse me, in our firewall cloud and endpoint businesses and SASE, we continue to position ourselves in larger and more strategic deals, and XSIAM while in it's early days, continues to garner tremendous interest, giving us more comfort around our long-term intentions. So in summary, a strong start in Q1 towards our three-year journey, early days, but confidence is fired. Let's dig in the details. Our Q1 revenue grew 20% and our billings grew 16%, while our RPO growth of 26% exceeded both of these and was driven by our next-generation security capabilities. I would like you to pay particular attention to RPO versus billings, Dipak will talk about the difference at plan and explain why the street might be confused with our future billings guidance. Our Q1 non-GAAP operating margins expanded by 760 basis points, driving 1.38 in non-GAAP earnings per share and we generated record $1.5 billion adjusted free cash flow in Q1. If you look at what's going on from an overall cybersecurity perspective, we have never seen as much adversarial and consistent activity at scale as we have seen in the first quarter. Unfortunately, we don't expect this to abate anytime soon. As a consequence of this increased activity and in recognition of our customer's commitment to us, this week we announced the Unit 42 Rapid Incident Response Retainer at no cost to all of our strategic customers, and are providing additional support during this escalating threat landscape. Ransomware attacks are increasing in frequency and severity, the ransom amounts being paid are also increasing. Bad actors are doing damage in a much shorter amount of time. As an example, in the recent engagement of our Unit 42 team, we saw an instance where bad actors extracted 2.4 terabytes of data in just 14 hours. There is also some evidence that the adversaries are beginning to leverage Generative AI as a tool to make attacks more sophisticated. Not just that, based on what we're seeing in Unit 42, most attacks are not happening on the back of vulnerabilities in widely used software and APIs such as a widely exploited move it file transfer software. Unfortunately, these bad actors remain elusive with no apparent significant increase in convictions and high-profile attacks, and therefore not surprisingly this malicious activity continues. At the same time, U.S. publicly listed companies in the Board are confronted with new SEC disclosure requirements that are on prompt public reporting a material cybersecurity incident, the enhanced oversight responsibility that comes with them. This result is a continued focus across organizations and understanding security posture, cybersecurity risks, and how to mitigate this risk effectively. This increasingly involves not only the CISO, but the entire IT organization, legal, finance, and the CEO and the full Board of Directors. This pace of malicious activity and the Board-level focus on cyber security risk is fueling a strong demand environment. Customers have often have multiple strategic priorities in cyber security and our broad portfolio enables us to align with these priorities. In Q1, the cost of money remained a constant discussion and customers' significant focus on this topic is becoming the new normal. The way it manifests itself in our business is that there's always a payment in duration discussions in final negotiations. Given our strong balance sheet, we can use a mix of strategies to navigate the environment. This includes annual billing plans, financing through PANFS, and partner financing. Whilst this does not impact our business demand or the impact to annual revenue or annual metrics, it does create variability on total billings more than before depending on financing used or the duration of contracts. I'm not concerned about the demand for cyber security, for this quarter and upcoming quarters, though my concern about our ability to execute, the billings variability is a pure consequence of the payment conversation that we're having with our customers and this is validated by the fact that we continue to see strong RPO and low churn suggesting this is a cosmetic impact to our business. We continue to see strong interest across our next-generation security portfolio, and we're making progress on our platformization journey. I'll highlight a few deals to talk about the diversity of opportunity, cross-platform buys, as well as the geographical distribution of our deals. For example, the federal government agency signed a $25 million expansion transactions including adding Cortex XDR and Prisma Access in highly competitive situations, expanding the network security footprint. This customer has now spent over $100 million for its lifetime across SASE platform. A large global SaaS provider signed an $18 million Prisma Cloud transaction to consumer modules across the portfolio. The customer is already a customer for our network security and Cortex platforms. A large education organization expanded its relationship with us in the first quarter in a $15 million transaction adding XSIAM, Prisma Cloud, and an expansion of its network security footprint. And lastly, a nation-state signed a $28 million deal that is a first-of-its-kind, standardizing on both SASE and XSIAM. This is a long sales cycle and represents our systematic approach to platformization. Storing these deals have been playing out across our large customers, as of Q1, 56% of the Global 2000 has transacted with us across Startup, Prisma, and Cortex. This continued focus on customer cyber transformation has fueled a 53% growth in NGS ARR we reported this quarter as we broke through the $3 billion milestone. Another exciting news, as of Q1, recurring revenue across Palo Alto is 83% of our total revenue from 77% a year ago. Let's turn on to updates from our three platforms that are the engine driving our success. First, in network security, we continue to drive innovation across our portfolio and see momentum as customers drive towards Zero Trust architecture. This month we unveiled PAN-OS 11.1 or Cosmos and Strata Cloud Manager, unifying the management of all of our three form factors and all security services in a single pane of glass, and also leveraging AI to analyze security policies, reduced miss configuration that predict and prevent disruptions. Customers who have invested in our platform by deploying all three form factors continue to grow rapidly, up 34%. Of our top 100 network security customers, 60% have purchased all three form factors, up from 63% a year ago. On average, these platform customers spend more than 15 times of the rest of our network security customers spend. The story is similar in SASE. Having just seen our innovations gain multiple industry recognition in SASE in the second half of our fiscal year, we've continued to invest to build on our leadership position. We're seeing strong momentum in SASE with ARR growth of approximately 60% in Q1. We also saw a 35% of our 5 million or greater network security transaction includes SASE, up from less than 10% a year ago. Today, it was the first day of our event called SASE Converge, where we unveil several enhancements. We were able to SASE to access applications with performance faster than the Internet. We added visibility and control over interconnect SaaS applications, and enable safe access to Gen-AI tools and ensure data isn't inadvertently leaked. Lastly, we added Remote Browser isolation technology for an extra layer of security. M&A has always been an important part of our strategy. Last week, we announced our intent to acquire Talon Cyber Security. We see an opportunity to expand the addressable market for SASE and solve an important customer problem. As many as 36% of workers classify themselves as independent workers, who often use unmanaged devices for work. In addition, employees increasingly use personal devices for accessing business applications. To enable access of these devices, security teams have an impossible trade-off. There are forced to either ignore security entirely in favor of flexibility and user experience or trade-off cumbersome technologies like VDI. Talon is a pioneer in the emerging enterprise browser category and when combined with Prisma SASE after closing, we will enable users to securely access business applications from any device, including mobile devices and non-corporate devices for the seamless user experience. We intend to include this capability with Prisma Access after closing and customers will be able to extend the same best-in-class security to unmanaged devices. Moving on to Prisma Cloud. We continue to see a strong endorsement of our integrated platform strategy. This traction is evident in the strong growth of our multi-module customers. We have seen particular success here with modules released over the last two and a half years. There has been a consistent pattern of seeing 100 plus customers for new modules in the first full quarter of launch and rapid growth after that, as the benefits of these new modules are broadly understood. This enthusiastic adoption has driven our strong conviction in adding key new modules, including some through acquisitions. our IaC scanning capability which came through the Bridgecrew acquisitions and CICD Security, which came through Cider are two such examples. This new module traction is helping to accelerate Prisma Cloud new business ACV in the last quarter. In Q1, we also unveiled a major new Prisma Cloud released Darwin. Darwin further differentiates our unique position across code cloud infrastructure and cloud runtime, Darwin enables a view across all elements of cloud applications including cloud services, infrastructure assets, compute workloads, API endpoints data, and code, Darwin can also help customers understand risks with deep context and overlay active attack attempts in near real-time. Our full coverage from code to cloud to enables fixes to be applied immediately versus the months most vulnerabilities stake to be passed. About two weeks ago, we announced our intention to acquire Dig Security, which will bring an award-winning Data Security posture management capability Prisma Cloud. With almost 70% of organizations having data stored in the public cloud, the sprawl of new cloud data services and the adoption of generative AI, we see an increased need to identify sensitive data, effectively manage user access, and implement robust security measures to prevent unauthorized internal and external access to this data stored in the cloud. After the close of proposed acquisition. Dig's capabilities will be integrated into Prisma Cloud platform to provide near real-time data protection from code to cloud. Moving on to Cortex, we continue to invest across our product portfolio and expand our customer count, as we see continued adoption of XDR, XSOAR, Xpanse, and XSIAM. In Q1, we had several industry recognitions of our innovation, Cortex XDR is the only product in the industry to achieve 100% protection and detection in the Round 5 MITRE evaluation. Additionally, XSOAR, Xpanse, and XSIAM are all name leaders by third-parties this quarter. We grew our Cortex active customer count by 25% to over 5,300 customers. Attraction overall in Cortex is essential, as it allows us to sell our transformational offering XSIAM. XSIAM has had a very fast start since we released the product just over a year ago. After a strong FY '23, XSIAM's first year release which included over $200 million in bookings, we followed up with a strong Q1. You saw our first expansion purchase of XSIAM, an eight-figure deal, and in Q1, our largest XSIAM customer to date was deployed with over 300,000 endpoints. We're seeing XSIAM transform customer security operations and significantly improve their security outcomes. This includes significant reductions in the meantime to detect and resolve security incidents. On the back of potential customers, hearing about early XSIAM success, our pipeline for XSIAM is over $1 billion of which $500 million was created just in this past quarter. As I began my remarks, Q1 was the first quarter of us delivering on the three-year plan we presented in August. We're driving profitable growth, investing in innovation, next-generation security, and the industry's largest dedicated security go-to-market organization, at the same time, leveraging the scale of Palo Alto Networks. Demand for cyber security is strong given the backdrop of attacks, the ever increasing focus and scrutiny around cyber risk, execution continues to be paramount given the macro conditions and we will continue to adapt and respond to changes in the environment. We will manage for long-term growth, operating margin, and free cash flow, and ensure we continue to transform the business and build revenue predictably. You will also see this through RPO and most importantly our current RPO. Our long-term forecast thesis remains intact whilst we expect short-term variability in billings, we don't expect this to have a meaningful impact on our ability to deliver our three-year targets. With that, I will turn it over Dipak.
Dipak Golechha: Thank you, Nikesh, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll cover the specifics of our Q1 results, additional details on drivers behind the results and our Q2 and fiscal year 2024 guidance. For Q1, revenue was $1.88 billion and grew 20%. Product revenue grew 3%, total service revenue grew 25%, with subscription revenue of $988 million, growing 29%, and support revenue of $549 million, growing 17%. We saw consistent revenue contribution across all theaters, Americas grew 20%, EMEA was up 19%, and JPAC grew 23%. The strength of our next-generation capabilities continues to drive our results with NGS ARR exceeding $3 billion for the first time and growing 53%. We saw strong contributions across the portfolio in Q1. We delivered total billings of $2.02 billion, up 16%, total deferred revenue in Q1 was $9.4 billion, an increase of 32%. Remaining performance obligation or RPO was $10.4 billion, increasing 26%, with current RPO just under half of our IPO. As Nikesh mentioned, we saw the rising cost of money have an important and incremental impact on customer behavior in Q1. We're responding to this in the ways we have discussed previously, including using annual billing plans, financing through PANFS, and partner financing. In Q1, this had a negative impact on our billings, although as you can see, we saw strength in NGS ARR and revenue. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was significantly ahead of our guidance, growing 66%. This was driven primarily by the significant increase in our non-GAAP operating margins, which expanded 760 basis points year-over-year. We continue to benefit from the scale inherent in our business, especially as some of our next-generation security offerings scale. We again delivered strong cash flow in Q1 with trailing 12-month adjusted free cash flow of $3 billion, achieving trailing 12-month free cash flow margins of 41%. Moving beyond the top line, gross margin for Q1 of 78% increased 370 basis points year-over-year. We again saw year-over-year improvements in product margins with the Normalization of the supply chain environment. Service gross margin improved to 78% as our new offerings continue to gain scale. Our operating margin expanded by 760 basis points in Q1 as we saw higher gross margins and efficiencies across our three operating expense lines. We are pleased with our operating efficiency progress against our medium-term targets. We continue to make significant investments to support our top-line growth expectations, including investments in -product and engineering, building sales capability, and supporting our ecosystems in our go-to-market organization. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended Q1 with cash equivalents and investments of $6.9 billion. Q1 cash flow from operations was $1.526 billion with the total adjusted free cash flow of $1.489 billion this quarter. As is typical for our Q1, this cash flow performance was primarily driven by strong collections in the prior quarter based on the strength of our Q4 bookings - sorry, collections in the quarter but based on the strength of our Q4 bookings. Over the last several weeks, we announced that we have entered into definitive agreements to acquire two companies. On October 31, we announced our intent to acquire Dig Security Solutions for approximately $232 million in cash, excluding the value of replacement equity awards. On November 6, we announced our intent to acquire Talon Cyber Security for approximately $435 million, excluding value of replacement equity awards and an inclusive of cash on Talon's balance sheet at closing. We expect both transactions will close in our second quarter of fiscal year '24. During Q1, we repurchased approximately 300,000 shares on the open market at an average price of approximately $227 per share for a total consideration of $67 million. As a reminder, our share repurchase program is opportunistic and we're committed to returning cash to shareholders over the medium-term. Stock-based compensation expense declined by 250 basis points as a percent of revenue year-over-year. As expected, stock-based compensation ticked up slightly as a percent of revenue quarter-over-quarter with the issuance of a portion of our fiscal year '24 grounds. On a year-over-year basis, we continue to manage our SBC down as a percent of revenue in-line with our long-term plans. Before turning to guidance, I want to frame some of the impacts that we're seeing in our billings. As Nikesh noted, we see strong demand in the market and continue to see customers make a technical selection of offerings across our portfolio. From here, we see more customers asking for deferred payment terms either with annual billings, financing through PANFS, or pursuing external financing. Some customers are looking for additional discounts upfront payments as they grapple with the cost of money. Our strong financial position which includes $7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, combined with our many options in dealing with this dynamic, it gives us significant flexibility. This can impact our billings trends quarter-to-quarter and we are reducing our billings guidance to account for this through fiscal year 2024. RPO and cRPO have more of a direct impact on future revenue this quarter with duration towards the low-end of the range we've seen over the last several quarters, we saw strong trends in cRPO. As we see low customer churn, we're confident that independent and specific billing terms and contract lengths, we can continue to grow RPO at levels that support our forward revenue growth ambitions. Now moving on to our guidance for Q2 In the year. For the second quarter of 2024, we expect billings to be in the range of $2.335 billion to $2.385 billion, an increase of 15% to 18%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.955 billion to $1.985 billion, an increase of 18% to 20%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.29 to $1.31 per share, an increase of 23% to 25%. For the fiscal year 2024., we expect billings to be in the range of $10.7 billion to $10.8 billion, an increase of 16% to 17%. We expect NGS ARR to be in the range of $3.95 billion to $4 billion, an increase of 34% to 35%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $8.15 billion to $8.2 billion, an increase of 18% to 19%. We expect our fiscal year '24 operating margins to be in the range of 26% to 26.5%, up 190 basis points to 240 basis points versus fiscal year '23. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $5.40 to $5.53, an increase of 22% to 25%. And we expect adjusted free cash flow margin to be 37% to 38%. Additionally, please consider the following modeling points. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 22% for the second quarter and fiscal year 2024, subject to the outcome of future tax legislation. We also expect cash taxes in the range of $230 million to $280 million. For the second quarter, we expect net interest and other income of $55 million to $60 million. We expect second quarter diluted shares outstanding of 339 million shares to 342 million shares. We expect fiscal year 2024 diluted shares outstanding of 338 million shares to 343 million shares. And we expect fiscal year 2024 capital expenditures of $175 million to $185 million and $40 million to $45 million in Q2. With that, I'll pass it back to Walter for the Q&A portion of the call.
A - Walter Pritchard: Thank you, Dipak. To provide as broad participation as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Our first question will be from Saket Kalia with Barclays followed up by Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley, go ahead, Saket.
Saket Kalia: Okay, great. Hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions here. Dipak, maybe the question is for you. Appreciate the revised billings guide in this macro backdrop and to your point the higher cost of money. I'm curious how you maybe thought about factors like pipeline, like close rates, and very importantly billing things duration for the rest of the year as we just try to get comfortable with how much that billings guide has maybe been derisked?
Nikesh Arora: Saket, thanks for your question. I'm going to take this one because it's more about demand function. I think repetition doesn't spoil the prayer, so I will repeat. The billings difference is not a change in demand for us or not a function of our pipeline. The billings change is a consequence of negotiations with customers and the customer says, you want me to pay you for three years upfront, you got to give me a bigger discount. You want to pay me, want me to do a three-year deal, you got to go finance it in benefits. I can do that, but I can say just pay me on an annual basis, I'm okay. I'll collect my money every year. If I go in that direction my billings changes. It does not change anything in my pipeline, in my close rates or in my demand function. Those are my point. So we're just giving ourselves flexibility because this quarter we saw a lot more negotiations around those topics, we just don't want to be held hostage to those kind of negotiations where we have to go finance deals to get DCV in there. Billings is a DCV metric. DCV is important if I am concerned about churn. I have very low churn across many product categories. So I'm very happy to collect my money on an annualized basis and that's what's needed to make sure that I don't get pressure on financing, I don't get pressure on having to give larger discounts. I retain flexibility. I do a lot of TCV deals. I do a lot of financing. This allows me the flexibility. So all I want to make sure is, there is no change in the demand function in the market. There is no change in our revenue forecasts.
Saket Kalia: Got it, very helpful. Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Thanks, Saket. Next up is going to be Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley. Followed by Brian Essex from JPMorgan. Hamza go ahead.
Hamza Fodderwala: Hi, good evening. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to start by offering my thoughts and condolences to all your employees in Israel. You know, it's kind of similar vein to Saket's question, I mean, 16% billings growth is certainly not bad in the context of many of your peers growing single-digits, if at all. I'm just curious because your guidance is still assuming that growth will sustain for the full year. So what's giving you that confidence given the cost of money, given the hardware digestion that you can sustain that the high-teens billings growth given what you're seeing in the market?
Nikesh Arora: So, Hamza, as, you know, Saket mentioned about pipeline, we have visibility to our pipeline, so we know there is business out there. We have not seen customers walk away from deals in Q1. It's not like people don't want to do business. We've been very consistent on hardware and hardware expectations for the last 12 months. We are regaining our consistent and expectations on hardware. We don't expect any lumpy movements up or down. We expect this is going to steadily in the 0% to 5% range as we've always been talking about. So I think from that perspective, I think to use Saket's word, we feel reasonably derisked on what's out there in the future. Q1 is the first quarter, allows us, you know, we have lots of pipeline, we have visibility to. I think I want to reiterate again, we are retaining flexibility. Can I go financing? Of course, I can. Can I go finance a three-year deal through PANFS or $7 billion of cash? I can, which will have a cosmetic impact of giving you better billings. But what I don't want to do is finance bad deals. This allows me the flexibility of not having to finance them nothing changes, I still get my revenue for the year. I still get my CRPO. I still get my annual billings. I just don't get year two and year three billings, but changes my total billings forecast for the year. It's cosmetic, it's mathematics, but it's interesting to see how the street interprets it.
Hamza Fodderwala: Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Thank you, Hamza. Next up we have Brian Essex from JPMorgan, followed by Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs. Brian, go ahead, please. You're muted, Brian.
Brian Essex: Thanks, Walter. Yes, thank you for taking the question. Nikesh, I was maybe wondering if I could dig in on M&A a little bit, pretty meaningful volume of M&A from a dollar spent perspective this quarter after not having done some for a while, how would you describe the overall environment and how would you, I guess message to investors the level of M&A that you might do over the next, I don't know, couple of years? Is this more of a one-off IP and aqua hire that you saw a great opportunity to pick up or might there be something meaningful in terms of longer-term trend or even dollars put through your sales pipeline as you scale this over your platform or scale both of them over your platform?
Nikesh Arora: So, Brian, thanks for the question. Look, we have not changed our point-of-view. We have always maintained that we're going to sustain M&A at a level close to a billion here. So we haven't done one for a while or two. And if you see, if you split the two, we did a cloud security one, and we've been pretty consistent in that rough range in the $150 million to $250 million range in terms of adding cloud capability as we see the market evolves, so I think that's kind of consistent, where we are. We saw a unique opportunity, as I mentioned, 36% of workers are independent workers, they don't get SASE remote access solution. We saw more and more discussion in the market, where RBI was not covering every use-case and managed devices were not, all your mobile phones don't have management for security. Last few hacks that happened to mobile devices. So from that perspective customers asking, what is my solution, and now, what we didn't want to do is to have to deploy yet another independent solution, which is just disconnected from our overall SASE capability. And like we do, we will always pay attention to the market. We figured Talon had the best tech in the space and they were just about to go race to go to the go-to-market sort of implosion or explosion with other companies. So - and from that perspective, we saw an opportunity and we think it's a great fit. Actually, it makes us the most comprehensive SASE solution. We are going to integrate them deeply into our SASE solution. Our customers will be able to use Enterprise Browser RBI or our Prisma Access client, so it's - I don't want to call it a one-off, one-off sounds it will never happen again, but I think it's just happens to be the time where we did two at the same time, other than to different platforms, two different teams are integrating them, so it's not overhead to the organization. But we're going to keep our cautious approach towards meeting what we can digest. So you shouldn't expect anything that is off the regular pattern we've sort of shown it last time.
Brian Essex: Got it, helpful. Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Great, thank you, Brian. Next question is going to be from Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs, with Roger Boyd at UBS on-deck. Go ahead, Gabriela.
Gabriela Borges: Good afternoon. Thank you. I want to ask about the two dynamics that you're talking about in your business, the firewall cycle on the one hand and cost of money impacting billings duration on the other. How do you think about the potential that these two dynamics are actually connected, meaning product mix is also having an impact on billings duration and how do you think about the risk that cost of money dynamics get worse before they get better, thereby impacting the full-year guide of billings, again as we go through the year? Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: So thank you, Gabriela. Look, the firewall business is actually is a one-shot business. You sell a piece of hardware and you get paid for it. It is not a ratable business, right? The ratability comes from our subscription and services part. It's usually there we have to look at it from an NGL perspective. Our duration this quarter was on the lower-end of duration. It reduced, went down, because we took more annual billing deals or we took shorter-duration contracts with our customers. So from that perspective, I think we feel comfortable given the visibility to our pipeline for the rest of the year that we have flexibility for ourselves on billing. You know, I think we're going to keep having this debate, where you keep calling it guiding down on billings, I'm going to keep calling it flexibility, you want to keep calling it guideline downward billing, so I'll keep telling it doesn't change my numbers. So we just agree that we're going to be saying that because I don't - nothing has changed the prospects of Palo Alto of three months ago.
Gabriela Borges: Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: All right. Thanks for your question, Gabriela.
Dipak Golechha: May just to build on that, Walter, I'd say like just recognize that we're also maintaining our cash guidance, which would be the other area where we may get concerned, we're not concerned on that front.
Walter Pritchard: Great, thanks, Gabriela there. Next question is from Roger Boyd at UBS, followed by Brad Zelnick at Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, Roger.
Roger Boyd: Great, thanks for taking the question. Just looking at the XSIAM pipeline, that $1 billion dollars is a pretty impressive mark, just any color you can provide on the size of the length of those deals as we think about it from an ARR perspective? I know you've talked about the 3x ARR upsell or expansion potential, but just any color on the size of those deals and how we should think about that kind of flowing into opportunities over the course of fiscal '24.
Nikesh Arora: Yes, I'm trying to make sure Lee gets to ask some questions otherwise he doesn't want to show up next time. Yes, exactly.
Lee Klarich: Yes, look, we've obviously, over the last few quarters we have been talking about XSIAM, and the interest we're seeing from customers is very strong and it's been the fastest sort of growth of a new product that we've ever seen. I think it speaks to a couple of things. One is just the need in the market from customers to go through the SOC transformation. Nikesh, talked about the speed of attacks, increasing relative to disclosure requirements and things like that, and obviously the number of attacks going up as well. That's driving the technology needed to have a different solution, a better solution, one driven by AI and automation. That's exactly how XSIAM was built. And that is what was feeling the interest. The second part of this is, with XSIAM, we're able to replace several of the customer's legacy point solutions in the SOC. So we are consolidating multiple independent piece parts with a single XSIAM deployment. And third, with these deployments of XSIAM, this is a significant investment the customer is making in us [technical difficulty] investments are three-year investments and in some cases even longer because they're standardizing their stock on a new platform. They want that long-term runway with us. This is not a short-term decision they're making. So all of those factors are what are fueling the strong pipeline that we shared in the early customer success we're having with the saying.
Walter Pritchard: Great, thank you for the question. Next question from Brad Zelnick at Deutsche Bank, followed by Fatima Boolani of Citi. Go ahead, Brad.
Brad Zelnick: Great, thanks very much for taking the question. I wanted to ask about your new hardware lineup and the release of PANOS 11.1. I noticed some of the newer features like quantum security and advanced wildfire patient zero prevention. I just wanted to get your take on the extent to which the new platform can catalyze demand as customers try to look to take advantage of the innovation and maybe if you could, you know, help us compare contrast versus prior product cycles. Thanks.
Nikesh Arora: Yes, thank you. I always get excited about the Next-Gen firewall releases of course. Look, what we announced was a new high-end chassis, so one that scales beyond a terabit per second. And so there is, obviously, this is the largest highest performance networks out there, service provider and in some cases large enterprise environments, at the same ruggedized platforms, platforms that can go to plus 50 degree Celsius, minus 40 degrees Celsius, because there are harsh environments out there that also need to be protected, right? So, this is expanding the use cases that we can support with our hardware next-gen firewalls. The other pieces you mentioned are also equally exciting from a software perspective. You know, Quantum is still likely a ways off, but there's a lot of companies that are starting to prepare for that, thinking about what happens in post-Quantum cryptography in the advent of potential computers and what that will mean, and so this is the start of a set of Quantum security capabilities that we're launching for our customers. You mentioned, advanced WildFire, we added proxy capabilities. We added ADEM capabilities, so there's a lot of innovation that's in this release. Generally in what this drives is customers to look to be on our latest Gen IV or newer hardware architectures, which over time means hardware refreshes and upgrades. And so all of that is good and helps our customers get to the most secure state.
Brad Zelnick: Well, thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Great, thank you for that. Next question is Fatima Boolani at Citibank, followed by Joel Fishbein from Truist Securities. Go ahead, Fatima.
Fatima Boolani: Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my questions. Either for Nikesh or Dipak, some of your pipeline commentary is what I wanted to unpack. As you think about the composition of NGS ARR for the remainder of the year and bearing in mind some of your product pillars are, you know, I'm not going to say maturity, but certainly they are more penetrated than others, so I wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about contribution by pillars? Your ARR expectations for the year and to the extent, anything there has changed and I recognize that you love all your product pillars equally, but any distinguishable - 
Nikesh Arora: It's very kind of you to remember prior answers, but I'll try to give - I tried to give a preview of that in our prepared remarks where I said we continue to see steady execution and hardware endpoint and cloud, so they're following expected trajectory. We see the pipeline and I said the excitement and upside is coming out of SASE and XSIAM. And we see that there are large SASE network transformation deals out there, which these things have anywhere from six months to 12-month closing cycles. So we would have to know what's in the pipe for the rest of the year. Do you have some sense of comfort? We also said we grew that business 60% in the first quarter on SASE. We already - we cannot gush enough about XSIAM as you know so far, so the billion-dollar pipeline, we're hoping will close in that six to nine months. Interestingly, XSIAM pipeline closes faster than SASE pipeline deals, because SASE is often very competitive. There are POCs involved. There are future comparisons between us and one or two other companies. In the case of XSIAM, you're really competing with the incumbent.
Fatima Boolani: Helpful. Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Great, thank you, Fatima. Next question is from Joel Fishbein at Truist, followed by Joe Gallo at Jefferies. Joel, go ahead with your question.
Joel Fishbein: Thanks for - thanks for taking the question. This is for Nikesh and Lee. Nikesh, you called out the recent ransomware attacks and also the SEC new requirements. I'm curious, number one, is there - is that helping to drive business and what products essentially would that be driving Palo Alto and why you're sort of in a unique position to sort of address some of these issues?
Nikesh Arora: Yes, so that's interesting, Joel. Let me connect that to something we announced yesterday. So first of all, I said, the activity is at an all-time high. Every day you read about ransomware attacks, now the SEC regulations are actually not kicked in yet. I think they kick in December. But you're seeing some companies go out there and start to do sort of self-report in anticipation because they're all petrified, of course, when you get attacked. So I think you're going to see more and more disclosure and we've be trying to parse, is it more activity or more disclosure? That's a good question. I think it's more activity. We've seen more and more activity. Our team does a research. We've had the maximum number of inbounds to our Incident Response Team in the last month than we had before. So clearly, anecdotally also, it's sort of come true that this is what's happening. Now, typically, the anatomy of an attack for us from our vantage point is that when we get engaged in incident response, typically, we go and we deploy a production sort of suite, where we go in and put XDR everywhere and we'll go run a bunch of analytics to make sure we understand what happened and where there is sort of the - that access may be still be resident in a customer's infrastructure. Now, typically when you do that and we leave, they don't want us to leave with our stuff, they want us to be one step back in case the guys come back. So from that perspective, you know. The incident becomes a need unfortunately because of these act, but it because the lead for us and that creates a whole bunch of product conversation around whether we're going to deploy endpoints, whether we need to upgrade their firewalls or whether they need to go down a cybersecurity transformation. I'll tell you nine times out of 10, every one of those customers ends up in the cyber security transformation because they discover that they have a lot of stuff that they should have upgraded or changed in that process. So that's kind of what happens. Those are the products, which typically end-up those customers.
Lee Klarich: Maybe I'll just add one point, Nikesh described the multi-extortion ransomware attacks being on the rise, 37% increase, the key to that is, a lot of companies sort of become used to, call it, normal encryption-only ransomware attacks. So they invested in backups so that when that happens, they backup from a green backup and they're back and operational. These multi-extortion attacks actually steal data and then extort the target, and so this can't simply be dealt with backups and this is driving a need for a better and greater investment in prevention of the attacks and not just the recovery cycle. So that connects the sophistication to the investment needed as well.
Joel Fishbein: Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Next question from Joe Gallo at Jefferies, followed by Gray Powell of BTIG. Joe, go ahead.
Joe Gallo: Hi, guys, thanks for the question. You've made several acquisitions further bolstering Cloud, congrats on that 12th module. Nikesh, when do you think the platform message truly cement itself in that market as it currently feels like the Wild West and then has the pricing environment stabilized there at all?
Nikesh Arora: Great questions. Yes, the pricing has stabilized, you know, we saw tremendous pricing pressure in the last fiscal year with the emergence of few competitors who are willing to do whatever it takes to try and dislodge our platforms or solutions. So I think it's fair to say that pricing is beginning to stabilize. I think what's interesting is, we're seeing customers come the second time around and start looking the platform. I think the first wave so far and there's still part of the customers are still in that wave. First wave is still very module driven. I want to see SPM solution, I want to see an app solution and I want to look at SCA. So you'll find that there are different people in the customer's organization who are responsible for different pieces of the cloud security pie and end up trying to look for best of breeze, kind of like replicating what happened in enterprise security. But as soon as they start putting big deployments of scale of any kind, they have to start having a platform. I just told you, we had an $18 million deal for a platform for a large SaaS company. Now, we don't have every large SaaS company which is deploying a platform - sorry, every large SaaS company needs a platform because they have eight different tools that they're not able to stitch together. So I think it's going to be sort of a --- sort of a recursive journey where we'll show that we'll land with some customers - and some customers, other people will land with their modules, but eventually, each of those customers has to go through a platform conversation. So we're sort of focused on our platform story. We're focused on making sure we make our platform more and more robust. I was at a CIO event before this morning. There are 30 of them there. And the first question was, it was interesting, you guys bought Dig or did a security posture management, how is that integrated into the following five things we have running and like, well, the following five things will talk to each other for you.
Joel Fishbein: Thanks.
Walter Pritchard: All right. Thanks for the question, Joe. Next question from Gray Powell at BTIG, followed by Ben Bollin at Cleveland Research. Gray, go ahead.
Gray Powell: Okay, great. Thank you very much. Yes. So maybe a broader question. It's pretty clear that the firewall space or that there's headwinds across, you know, the firewall appliance space this year, it's impacting everyone. But you're still guiding Q2 billings to about 17% growth. Your closest competitor is guiding to minus 5%. Historically, you've been fairly correlated with them. So I know you can't speak to their business, but can you talk about what's different on your side? Why you're more insulated? Is it more the NGS portfolio? Is it data center exposure? Is it share gains? Is there just anything you can kind of help us to think through those dynamics?
Nikesh Arora: Yes. All of the above. Sorry, I'm trying to - I mean I can't process which competitor he's talking about, but okay. Look, we are in multiple businesses. In our firewall business, as we said, on the hardware business, we see that 0% to 5% as being where the market is and some of that we achieved through refresh, some of that we achieved through our own customers expanding so that we achieved through the replacement of other people's firewalls. We've - in the last, I'd say, 18 months, we've been very diligent about making sure we normalize for the effects of backlog or supply chain in that guidance and that thinking and you see that in our numbers. So I don't think that's going to change much for us. I can't comment on other people's billing variability. We just saw the impact of billing variability to our numbers this quarter. So I'm sure they have the reasons of building variability. In terms of SASE, as I said, you know, we're - we can compete with a different set of people not with the hardware people. We saw 60% growth this quarter and we have visibility on the pipeline for the rest of the year, which gives us comfort that there is business to be had there. We told you about XSIAM, which is again a category which is more in the soft management space, which is a different set of competitors. If you're talking about XDR, it's a different set of competitors. And then cloud security, where our competitors want to startup. So I think the portfolio allows us to look at different growth rates in different pipelines, across the spectrum. As I said, the demand function is not going down for cybersecurity across the board. The only thing that's changing is people saying, I'll do a two-year, one-year deal or a three-year or a five-year deal, I'll pay you later, you finance it around year-over-year. That's the only confusion you're seeing. And I think if you do all that in the market, you can figure out the underlying growth rates are strong for some people in certain categories.
Gray Powell: Okay. Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: A follow-up - our next question comes from Ben Bollin at Cleveland Research, followed by Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Go ahead, Ben.
Ben Bollin: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to piggyback Gray - Gray's question a little bit. When you look at the underlying product revenue, how much of that is physical appliance versus the software form factor? And then a follow-on would be interested in your thoughts on how the trajectory of branch firewall looks over time as customers adopt, you know, more VMs and SASE to get that scale. That's it. Thank you.
Dipak Golechha: Yes. So let me take the first part of the question. I mean, our product revenue when Nikesh talked about zero to five is actually across hardware, virtual firewalls, another software that's counted in product revenue. We talked about that last time then. I think it's very customer-specific in terms of what their actual needs are. So again, rather than trying to pass through each of them, I think it's looking at the aggregate. We feel pretty comfortable in that 0% to 5% range. So software is about 35% or about 30% this quarter, right? And then just --
Nikesh Arora: You can see that in the gross margins. Our gross margins continue to improve for product because software is obviously a higher gross margin product for us.
Dipak Golechha: And then I think your second question was around what is the impact of this on the branch deployments. The - there's really primarily two models for the branch. One is a SD-WAN-only branch, that tends to be for smaller branches where all of the security or just about all the security moves into SASE is cloud-delivered. And the second model is a next-gen firewall typically with SD-WAN built-in branch, which is still often connected back to SASE for global network connectivity, et cetera. So there - so the shift to software in SASE doesn't replace the need for the branch to have that local intelligence and to be an extension of the customer's network and ultimately, the extension of the network security posture, zero-cost posture.
Ben Bollin: Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Next up, Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer followed by Patrick Colville from Scotiabank. Go ahead, Ittai.
Ittai Kidron: Thanks, Walter. Dipak, can I just - not sure I got the answer for Ben's question quite right. On hardware, can you tell us exactly hardware, what percent of revenue that is? And Cisco in conjunction to you right now reported also results, and they've talked about - they've significantly took down their next quarter guidance in the view that for the last two, three quarters a lot of hardware was sold but not installed and so there'll be some digestment period in there. My question to you, when you sell firewalls, how much visibility do you have into how much of that is actually goes and sit on the shelf which is actually gets deployed in the field? And so is there a risk or is there a blind spot here, where you might not know exactly how your customers are handling hardware - firewall hardware and could that catch up somehow with our business as well.
Nikesh Arora: Okay. So I don't - I did not listen to the Cisco call because we're here. And even if I had the time, I wouldn't. So I don't understand, it's a very large hardware business. Remember, hardware is a small part of our business, A. B, we only report in revenue what we sell and ship to the customer. So there's nothing - if it's sitting on the shelf at a customer then it's still sold from our perspective.
Ittai Kidron: Yes. But I don't have any color to interact, but you have visibility especially again installing that.
Dipak Golechha: Yes. Every share-based payroll is deployed has to be registered with us. So we have reasonably good visibility into firewalls that are sold to deployed. And any - I would say, it's fair to say and there are specific issues where a customer may have bought extra firewalls because [indiscernible] but there's no - I say there's no uncharacteristic or different activity we see in the last three months that has been away from the normal. So we don't have suddenly the last quarter, a lot of customers going a lot of firewalls. I think I'm going to try and guess, but there was this whole backlog situation and supply chain problem where people may have bought ahead because we're expecting supply chain prices to continue. And now they've got a bunch of stuff that is ordered sitting around that they can deploy, they don't order more, we don't have that situation. We never went down that path. We didn't hit a lot of backlog. We shipped - You know, we never went past 12 things of shipping in our product. So we did - I know that in the industry, some people are up to 1 year in terms of shipping backlog, we have 12 weeks or back to four to six weeks. So it really is not an impact for us from that perspective. So I think that should give you some better sense of what the spread is. We have reasonably decent visibility into our pipeline can be up or down the margin? Yes, but nothing as substantive as what you might have seen from other people.
Ittai Kidron: Thanks you.
Walter Pritchard: Thanks, Ittai. We'll take our last question from Patrick Colville at Scotiabank. Patrick, go ahead.
Patrick Colville: All right. Thank you, Walter, for squeezing me in and got a sore throat, so sound a bit like Jason Statham. So forgive me for maybe quiet, to me, the standout metric was the non-GAAP operating margin, which was 28% typically 1Q is like the low watermark for margin, but based on your guidance is actually can predicted to be the high watermark. So I guess, you know, I presume Talon and Dig are going to be dilutive. But Dipak, are there any other puts and takes that you know we should consider around operating margin?
Dipak Golechha: No. I mean, I think you obviously talked about the talent, which is part of the rationale for the annual thing. We did have some expects - expenses that we expected to incur in Q1 that will now come later in the year, some around the marketing areas as well. But I would say it's just a normal course of operating business. And fundamentally, I think Dig and Talen explains the majority of the rest. I will just say on a year-on-year comparison, we did have, you know, hiring that had a different, you know, level of hiring activity this year, it's a lot more normalized in terms of how we're ramping. So there's just a little bit of base factor calculation in there but nothing really added.
Walter Pritchard: All right. Thank you, Patrick, for your question. Thanks everybody for participating. And with that, I'll pass it over to Nikesh for his closing comments.
Nikesh Arora: Well, thank you very much again, everyone, for taking the time to attend our earnings call. I would be remiss if I did not use the opportunity to thank all of our employees across the world and the ones in Israel, especially given what's happening in that part of the world. I also wanted to thank all of our partners and customers for trusting Palo Alto Networks.

===== 2023 Q4  (2023-08-18 16:30:00) =====

During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections regarding the company's business operations and financial performance. These statements made today are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ from these forward-looking statements. Please review our press release and recent SEC filings for a description of these risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in the presentations today. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations are in the press release and the appendix of the investor presentation. Unless specifically noted otherwise, all results and comparisons are on a fiscal year-over-year basis. We also note that management is participating in the Goldman Sachs Conference on September 7. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you, Walter, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for spending your Friday afternoon or perhaps some part of your Friday evening with us. Our choice of Friday has definitely made us the topic de jure these past two weeks and has made for some very interesting reading of all the analyst notes. We apologize to people who are inconvenienced but as we had mentioned in our press release, we wanted to give ample time to analysts to have one-on-one calls with us over the weekend, and we have a sales conference that kicks off on Sunday. We want to make sure all of our information was disclosed out there. So again, we apologize for the unique Friday afternoon earnings call. But clearly, we have enjoyed the attention. Well, let me go and just straightaway dive into our Q4 results. We started off the year focusing on excellence and execution. We stayed true to that and delivered strong results in Q4, capping off a strong fiscal year 2023, where we met or exceeded our original top line guidance and significantly exceeded our profitability and cash flow guidance. This year indeed required clear focus across our company, and we're all proud that our team delivered throughout the year and especially in Q4. Our Q4 revenue grew 26% making our -- marking our 12th consecutive quarter of revenue growth north of 20%. Our billings grew 18% of a very strong 44% growth in Q4 a year ago, and RPO grew 30% ahead of our revenue growth. Our Q4 operating margins expanded by 760 basis points, driving $1.44 in non-GAAP earnings per share, and we achieved 39% adjusted free cash flow margins for the year. Our performance in Q4 did not come as a surprise to us. We've been investing in our next-generation security portfolio for some time now to position ourselves in the leadership position for the future of the cybersecurity market. It is this next-gen portfolio driving -- that is our growth transformation and enabling our leverage. Lee and his team will expand on this in the forward-looking part of our program. We achieved several important milestones in this quarter, especially in our software and cloud-based businesses this year. Our combined SASE, Cortex and cloud bookings were north of $1 billion in Q4. Our Cortex platform surpassed $1 billion in annual bookings last quarter, and we achieved the same milestone with SASE this quarter. We also exceeded $500 million in Prisma Cloud ARR. These product performances are all contributed to the strong growth we continue to enjoy in NGS ARR. Remember, that our NGS business is largely a capability new to us in the last five years and is primarily cloud delivered. This quarter, we added more new ARR than any other pure-play cybersecurity company. Our platformization is continuing to drive large deal momentum. One way to illustrate the traction of our next-generation security capability across network security, cloud security and SOC automation, so look at the makeup of some of our largest deals. When we deliver best-of-breed products that are also integrated into platforms, we help customers simplify their architectures, lower their cost of ownership and benefit from differentiated cross-platform capabilities. This is a win-win scenario. 8 out of our top 10 deals saw a significant contribution from our next-generation security capabilities, five were essentially next-generation security deals. Here are some examples: one, a large industrial manufacturer signed a transaction with a total value of $45 million. Our Prisma Access expansion led the transaction, but also included significant commitments to Prisma Cloud, XDR and our IoT security offerings. The customer success with Prisma Access and our executive level engagement were keys to winning this additional opportunity. A large professional services firm, standardized on Prisma Access and a transaction exceeding $40 million, securing their hundreds of thousands of users. The completeness of our offering, particularly our strong capabilities and private access, differentiates us from the competition by standardizing on Prisma Access to customer consolidated legacy security offerings from many competitors to a single solution. A large retailer also signed a landmark transaction for more than $40 million, led by XSIAM. In this deal, we displaced the incumbent SIEM offering and also added our threat intelligence and attack surface management capabilities. Rounding out the examples, a large technology service provider chose our XDR and XSIAM capabilities in a transaction worth over $30 million. This deal started as an independent evaluation of replacement for both endpoint security in their SIEM. This is the second quarter in a row where we have signed an 8-figure deal that was driven by a unique capability to provide both XDR and XSIAM, competing against separate competitors in each of these categories. This sample represents the success we see across industries and regions. As I mentioned, a critical part of our profitable growth formula is selling more to our largest customers. In Q4, we saw our larger deals grow faster than our overall business. Notably, we saw the number of deals greater than $20 million grow faster than our deals over $10 million as our go-to-market motion becomes more and more increasingly successful in selling the platform and building the sort of trusted relationships required to close this quarter of our business. Now for the surprise of this quarter, starting with Cortex. There are a number of things I'm excited about in this business as we ended this year. We launched XSIAM to general availability last October and set an aggressive goal of booking north of $100 million in our first year. The year is not over yet. We have closed out the year achieving $200 million in XSIAM. This is strong validation that our outcome-based value proposition on XSIAM is resonating well with security organizations and also a sign that interest in applying AI to transform security operations is very high. Lee will talk extensively about this in our forward-looking section. Our customers have told us loud and clear that the legacy products powering their SOCs are no longer working and they need to reduce their mean time remediation by an order of magnitude. This becomes increasingly important with the new SEC rules detailing that all public companies will be required to report material breaches within four business days. XSIAM is shaping up to be our fastest-growing offering outside our original next-generation firewall releases. XSIAM transactions are large and long term, which helped to further our goal of evolving our customer relationships from vendor to partner. As excited as we are about the early success of XSIAM, we are also seeing strong growth across the entire family of Cortex products, namely XDR, XSOAR and Expanse. We crossed the 5,000 customer milestone in Cortex as we continue to gain share in the market and see the opportunities for upsell to the platform. Our average Cortex deal size grew over 50% year-over-year, reflecting our success in cross Cortex adoption. Moving on to the next star of the quarter, SASE. SASE continues to become our standout offering. We're seeing strong customer awareness and momentum following our new leadership position in the Gartner SSE Magic Quadrant last quarter. We were recognized this quarter with a leadership position of the Forrester Zero Trust edge wave that was published earlier in the week, establishing Palo Alto Networks as a clear industry leader in SASE. We also have some breaking news on industry recognition, very excited that Palo Alto Networks has been recognized as the only, I repeat, the only leader in Gartner's first single vendor SASE Magic Quadrant just published on Wednesday. Our recent acceleration and external industry recognition has contributed to customer momentum, and we saw many new customers and large expansion transactions in Q4. This included four transactions over $10 million and many 7-figure deals that span numerous industries and regions. Not to be left behind, Prisma Cloud went past $5 million in ARR. Our cloud security platform, where we believe all companies will eventually to manage security across multiple cloud applications and providers through a single platform, continues to show strength, ensuring customers consume our capabilities after committing to the platform is vital. In Q4, we saw steady consumption growth with credits consumed up by 45%. We're also seeing strong growth in customer adoption of multiple modules this quarter. We are showing our growth in customers with five modules more as it is starting to become a meaningful trend with customers up 179% year-over-year. We continue to make significant organic investments in Prisma Cloud and grow the platform through acquisitions. We launched the CICD security module last week based on technology from the cybersecurity acquisition. This is our 11th module, and we continue to have the broadest cloud native application protection platform in the industry with capabilities spanning our customers' entire code to cloud needs. Later in our call, you will get a chance to see our exciting developments and glimpse into our plans for the future. Finishing where I started, I couldn't be more proud of our performance in Q4 and the year. Our teams helped drive steady performance, enabling us to maintain a strong outlook through macro challenges by focusing on crisply executing our differentiated strategy. We continue to drive platformization and capitalize on the opportunity the changing landscape presents for products like XSIAM. We continued with our go-to-market transformation. For example, we consolidated our SASE sales team into our core a year ago, and we had a strong outcome, as you saw, with some large transactions and opportunities across the pipeline. We have continued to not hold back on investing in innovation to ensure we can capture share in a market that constantly presents new opportunities. Lastly, we successfully accelerated some of our efficiency initiatives in fiscal year as we saw the environment change. I'll now pass the floor to Dipak to cover the detailed financial results and our 2024 guidance.
Dipak Golechha: Thank you, Nikesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Beyond providing the detailed results this quarter, I also wanted to highlight some additional business insights through the Q4 numbers to help you understand our results and provide context for our go-forward plans. As Nikesh mentioned, we saw strength across our various metrics, starting with the top line. This was especially true in our NGS ARR and RPO. NGS ARR grew 56%, driven by strength across our portfolio. RPO grew 30%, well ahead of our revenue growth. Broadly, the industry has experienced an increase in deal scrutiny as well as deal pushouts. The environment has become more challenging this year, and we started telling you about that at the beginning of our fiscal year. We got ahead of this changing environment by front-loading our sales hiring for the year, training our teams to address the tougher procurement processes and by having our sales management teams apply additional scrutiny to the pipeline earlier in the quarter. As a result of these efforts, we did not see a significant impact in Q4 from unexpected deal delays. We did see, however, see two impacts on the top line from the changing environment: first, the rising cost of money has caused customers to hold on to their cash and more frequently seek deferred payment terms. These deferred payment terms are delivered in the form of annual billing plans and through our PANFS financing capability. The percent of bookings that included deferred payments increased approximately 45% year-over-year. Additionally, the proportion of our bookings have included billing plans more than doubled from Q3 to Q4. This quarter-to-quarter increase negatively impacted our billings as compared to what we forecasted 90 days ago in our guidance. As we see this shift in billing terms, RPO is becoming a more important leading indicator for our business as it's not impacted by billing terms. As a reminder, RPO represents the booked business we expect to recognize as revenue in future periods. Also, all customers' purchases, including an RPO, are noncancelable. Second, we have seen the market return to a more normalized growth rate in hardware-based firewalls, and I wanted to help further the collective understanding of this. As many of you are aware, there have been several factors that have impacted industry hardware revenue. These include the COVID pandemic, the reopening-related hardware demand catch-up, post-COVID supply chain challenges, price changes and backlog release following supply chain easing. Despite these positive and negative fluctuation, there's a relatively consistent level of underlying hardware growth that is in the low to mid-single digits. And we see the industry returning to those levels. This return to normalized appliance growth is also happening on the backdrop of a broader transition from hardware to software in network security and growth in new security markets. We are unique in being recognized as a leader across different network security form factors, including our software-based VMs and our cloud-delivered SASE. Our firewalls or platform billings growth captures our business across these form factors and grew north of 20% in the last three years. Within this business, we have seen the mix of software increase substantially. Over the medium term, this mix transition to software and cloud and network security as well as the growth we are seeing in the rest of our next-generation security portfolio and driving an increase in our occurring revenue mix. Our platform business model and our focus on efficiency drove significant improvements in operating margin in fiscal year '23, including 760 basis points of margin expansion in Q4. This higher operating profitability, strong bookings growth and interest income performed a baseline for our free cash flow at higher levels as we achieve 39% adjusted free cash flow margins in fiscal year '23. The same dynamic of higher deferred payment plans not only had an impact on our top line, but also on our free cash flow. As I mentioned in my discussion of RPO, it is noteworthy that we absorbed the impact of the higher mix of bookings with deferred payment terms in Q4 and fiscal year '23. And we were still able to exceed our cash flow margin target for the year. If you look on a multiyear basis, we've seen the proportion of our bookings that occur with deferred payment plans increase over 4x in the last three years, while we grew our free cash flow margins over the same period. As I will talk about when I come back in the second half of the program, this gives us confidence we can maintain our free cash flow margins at a high baseline. Moving on to the rest of the results. Product revenue grew 24% in Q4, driven by the impacts we noted last quarter from new go-to-market motions and SKUs that contributed more renewable software revenue to product than in the past. Total subscription and support revenue grew 27% with subscription revenue of $918 million, growing 31% and support revenue of $528 million, growing 20%. We saw consistent revenue growth across all our theaters with the Americas growing 26%, EMEA was also up 26% and JPAC growing 24%. Gross margin for Q4 of 77.3% increase over 400 basis points year-over-year. This caps off a year where gross margins expanded by 230 basis points as we saw a benefit from higher software mix and some scale synergies on our customer support spending. Our operating margin expanded well over 700 basis points in Q4 and over 500 basis points for the year. We saw the higher gross margins and efficiency across our three operating expense lines as we accelerated some of our efficiency initiatives. As happy as we are about the outcomes here, we're only part of the way through executing on these multiyear efforts. The result of all of this is that we continue to see strong non-GAAP EPS growth due to substantial operating leverage, which also translated to strength in GAAP EPS, which more than doubled quarter-to-quarter. We are now firmly GAAP profitable with GAAP net income of over $200 million in the quarter. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended Q4 with cash equivalents and investments of $5.4 billion. We had our 2023 convertible notes mature on July 1, 2023, and we settled the principal obligation with cash of $1.7 billion. We settled the access in shares and had previously accounted for these in our non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding. Q4 cash flow from operations was $414 million with total adjusted free cash flow of $388 million this quarter. Stock-based compensation expense declined by 310 basis points as a percent of revenue sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, stock-based compensation expense was down 220 basis points as a percent of revenue. 'I'd like to provide the details of our fiscal year 2024 guidance as well as guidance for Q1 before we move on to the broader forward-looking section of the presentation, where we will provide context for this guidance and talk about our medium-term targets. Overall, we are pleased we capped a strong year of growth and margins and look forward for more to come. For the fiscal year 2024, we expect billings to be in the range of $10.9 billion to $11 billion, an increase of 19% to 20%. We expect NGS ARR to be in the range of $3.95 billion to $4 billion, an increase of 34% to 36%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $8.15 billion to $8.2 billion, an increase of 18% to 19%. For fiscal '24, we expect operating margins to be in the range of 25% to 25.5%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $527 million to $540 million, an increase of 19% to 22%, and we expect adjusted free cash flow margin to be 37% to 38%. For the first fiscal quarter of 2024, we expect billings to be in the range of $2.05 billion to $2.08 billion, an increase of 17% to 19%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.82 billion to $1.85 billion, an increase of 16% to 18%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.17, an increase of 39% to 41%. Additionally, please consider the following modeling points: first, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 22% for the first quarter in fiscal year 2024, subject to the outcome of future tax legislation. We also expect cash taxes in the range of $230 million to $280 million. This is an increase as compared to the $150 million in cash taxes in fiscal year 2023. For the first quarter, we expect net interest and other income of $50 million to $55 million. We expect first quarter diluted shares outstanding of 336 million to 339 million shares. We expect fiscal year 2024 diluted shares outstanding of 338 million to 343 million shares. And we expect fiscal year 2024 capital expenditures of $160 million to $170 million. With that, I'd pass it back to Walter to start the short Q&A covering what we had discussed up to this point. Walter?
A - Walter Pritchard: Thanks, Dipak. We'll take about 15 minutes now, and we'll have a few questions. [Operator Instructions] For the first question, we'll go to Matt Hedberg from RBC with Rob Owens from Piper Sandler on deck. Please go ahead, Matt.
Matt Hedberg: Great, guys. Thanks for taking my question Maybe, Nikesh, with you, the macro. Good results in the quarter. I wonder if you could just talk a bit more broadly about some of the broader trends that you're seeing. There's been some other -- obviously some comments from some competitors that are maybe a little bit different. But just broad brush strokes on high-level demand trends.
Nikesh Arora: I think as I said, and as Dipak elaborated, look, it's -- interest rates are higher. CFOs are scrutinizing deals, which means you have to be better prepared to answer their question and show the business value that you bring to them with your cybersecurity products. We are lucky that we have been focusing on our platform strategy. So we can usually walk in and say, here, you can consolidate the following five, it doesn't cost you anymore, but you get a better outcome and you get a modernized security infrastructure. So from that perspective, that strategy of ours is resonating. But there is more scrutiny. There are deals that go through multiple levels. There are some that get pushed. There are some that get canceled. And again, you just have to get more on the top of the funnel. And as Dipak very clearly highlighted that eventually end up and there's a conversation about saying, wait, I used to pay you upfront. And I need to understand the cost of money. And is there a way, either my cost has to be lower from you, so I can sort of account for the cost of money or you've going to allow me to pay you later. From a deferred plan perspective, those are really the two effects. And I think the biggest -- and if I summarize Q4 for us, great execution. There's a lot of demand out there, and the two things which are -- were different is: one, we saw the hardware cycle start to normalize much faster and, not like we told you so, but we've been very consistent. I think one of you guys actually was kind enough to cut and paste every time we talked about hardware into their note. We've been very consistent that we think underlying hardware grows at single digits, low single -- low to mid-single digits. So we've seen that main reversion. Other than that, honestly, we've just got to go out there and get more stricter on execution. That's the outcome from a macro perspective.
Matt Hedberg: Great guys.
Walter Pritchard: Thanks Matt. Next question will be from Saket Kalia of Barclays with Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank on deck. Go ahead, Saket.
Saket Kalia: Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my question here. Nice end to the year to the team. Dipak, maybe for you. Great to see the free cash flow margin for next year. I think a couple of things that we were all thinking about, as we model next year were cash taxes and the deferred payment plans that you referenced in your prepared commentary, of course, the profitability here is well ahead also. But maybe you could just talk us through some of the puts and takes you thought about within that free cash flow margin guide for next year.
Dipak Golechha: Yes. So I think -- thanks for the question, Saket. I think the primary driver really is the stronger profitability, right? So that's really what underpins a lot of the cash flow confidence. We've also seen benefits of higher interest rates on the cash that we have, right? And that also helps. That's another put and take. But I would say, you're right, we've absorbed the additional headwinds from deferred payment terms. We've modeled in the cash taxes. And when you put all the different puts and takes, we feel pretty confident of where we are.
Saket Kalia: Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Sorry to skip you Rob. We're going to go back to Rob Owens at Piper Sandler and then go to Brad Zelnick at Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, Rob.
Rob Owens: Thanks Walter, and you know Saket is much interesting than I am. But want to build on that question just a little bit relative to deferred payments. And is there discounting when you're doing these multiyear deals? And will we actually see a longer-term economic benefit as people start to move towards annual payments? And I guess, given the shift in the portfolio and what you guys are selling, this should be no surprise. So if you could just comment on if there is a broader economic benefit to kind of moving to annual terms and understand that we'll probably address the midterm guidance on the next portion of the call.
Nikesh Arora: Rob, I'm going to give you a little macro flavor and then Dipak can jump in as well. Look, on the macro front, the part I'm really excited about that Dipak and his team have basically navigated a significant part of our business into annual billings effectively through these deferred payment plans, right? And we were able to hold our free cash flow in spite of those downward sort of pressure. And we think we're going to keep absorbing some of that as it goes. In the end, it's an economic argument. It's like there's a cost of money. I can take the money up front and let the customers get a discount, and I can go try and get a return on that cash or I can let them pay when they're ready to pay and I can extract a better economic outcome in that context. And I think it's important to understand, given our portfolio-based approach, our customers -- different products lend themselves to different discussions. On cloud, we see a lot more of the shorter duration discussions because cloud is more of a consumptive event. On XSIAM, they want longer deals. They don't want even 3-year deals. They only want 5-year deals and they want price locks. So there also is a counter effect they're worried about inflation. So if you put it all together, as Dipak said, we're very comfortable with the way we've modeled it. There's definitely levers that go in different directions. And our sort of aspiration and desire and hope is that we keep transitioning seamlessly into more and more annual billings over time while being able to hold these metrics and these outcomes for ourselves. And Dipak?
Dipak Golechha: Yes. No, I think Nikesh mentioned it well. The only comment that I would say is we're probably more focused on the economics of the actual deferred payments versus the upfront. I understand the argument that if you're more of a SaaS business, then you don't have to make as much like discounts to pull the deal through. We haven't really built that in, right? At this stage, we'll see how that goes. We're still going through the transformation.
Nikesh Arora: And don't forget, there's still a reasonable part of our business that still has to be paid upfront, which is the hardware business.
Walter Pritchard: Thanks Rob. We're going to take our last question in this segment from Brad Zelnick at Deutsche Bank. The IR team is available to take questions offline, and we will return at the end of this program to take more questions from you all. Go ahead, Brad.
Brad Zelnick: Thank you so much Walter. So many questions to ask, but I'm going to keep it high level. Nikesh, heading next week into sales kickoff, you're going to once again rally the troops to perform even better next year, topping a fantastic fiscal '23. What are the highest level messages that you're going to focus on to ensure that they really step up their game and can overachieve and do even better next year?
Nikesh Arora: Brad, sort of how I worked in sales and interacted with salespeople, majority of my life, salespeople like to win. And I think what has become apparent in fiscal '23 for our teams that can -- that we can win in each of these categories. They were used to winning in firewalls. I will tell you, our win rates have gone up tremendously in SASE. I mean we did $1 billion in SASE this past year. Winning in XSIAM has been a phenomenal surprise and a delight to all of us. And literally, I'm telling you what's going to happen on Sunday, every salesperson is going say, I want to be able to sell that product. This product is selling with an average ACV of $1 million hasn't happened in security before. So I think the just generating enthusiasm towards all these capabilities and solutions is kind of a key message for our team. There are some structural changes. Like last year, we took the SASE team and merged that with the core team, and you saw the outcomes. We managed to do that seamlessly without an impact to our business, in fact grew faster. We're doing that next year with Cortex. We're taking our Cortex team, and making them part of core. That's why Dipak talks about these constant ability to improve operating margins is we've hit sort of scale economics in our business. We've hit scale. Everybody has to do these deals. It's no longer a firewall business. So our teams want to do cross-product deals. So the message really is, we're winning in major categories, go out and win those deals. The message is cross-platform is working for us. The message is you are now empowered and trained to sell everything. And every year, we use the opportunity to tweak certain things, which have worked better than the others. So I mean, honestly, like sorry to drag you out on a Friday day afternoon, but I think it's important for a few thousand people next week that we shared all these results with them, and we just got caught in the trap. We're trying to get a Board meeting done and do that on Sunday, so here we are on Friday. But all I -- if it gives you any comfort, Dipak and me and the team are going to be working all Saturday and Sunday as well.
Brad Zelnick: Awesome. Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Thanks, Brad. Thanks, everybody, for your questions. We will come back at the end to do more. We're now going to move to the forward-looking portion of our program and talk about our medium-term update. And with that, I'll pass it back over to Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora: Well, that's a wrap on our Q4 results. The reason we wanted to make sure you had the opportunity to enjoy our Friday evening celebrations in the context of a long-term or midterm outlook from us was we wanted to make sure that you see our FY '24 guidance in the context of where we believe we are in the next three to five year journey. I think what's important to understand is that over the last five years, the cybersecurity TAM has continued to rise. It has grown at approximately 14%, and it has grown twice the pace at which the IT market has grown. Now the reasons for that are, as we get down these transformations that are going on in the world, we get more and more reliant on e-commerce, as we get more and more reliant on digital transformation movement is about and possibly now with the sort of arrival of AI as a mainstream opportunity, every one of us is trying to make sure we grab that with both hands. So we will continue to see the pace of technology spend go sort of up or forward. Similarly, we're going to see that cybersecurity is going to get more than its fair share of growth. So from an opportunity perspective from what's going on in the market, we believe the cybersecurity market is robust and will continue to be so in the next three to five years. Having said that, if you look deeper, there are actually three things going on in that market: one, there are new markets being created. If you look at the last five years, we saw a sort of a surge in this concept called SASE. We saw SASE come on mainstream. Everybody is out there trying to build a SASE business. That's kind of been a big thing. As we had anticipated and talked about five years ago, cloud continues to become bigger and bigger. As companies go sign up with cloud service providers, they are beginning to go move their applications from on-prem or their hybrid cloud to the public cloud. Now it's important to understand is that approximately 80% of the applications in the world are actually homegrown applications, which are working on on-prem data centers. As we go forward, we're seeing enterprises take those applications, reimagine them, rewrite them, rearchitect them and move them to the public cloud. Now that work has to be done by 33 million developers around the world, which work for these companies. As they write new code, as they put together a code by looking at open source and having stuff from here and there, there is this real opportunity to make sure that, that code that is written is written in such a way that is secure, is secured by design. So you will continue to see that cloud security part of that market grow, but that's a market that's effectively been created in the last five years. Couple that with the arrival of IoT and OT as mainstream opportunities, we've seen even that market has been sort of a new market. Approximately it's a $30 billion market between those categories, which has been built over the last five years, driving some of the cybersecurity opportunity. Outside of that, in the underlying cybersecurity market, we've also noticed that some markets have undergone to transformation. We're seeing a large transformation in network security as people try and figure out how much to go in the public cloud, how much to leave in the data center, how much hardware to deploy, how much software to deploy. We're seeing that network security is beginning to evolve from a hardware-only market to effectively a faster-growing software part of the network security market. Not just that, what we're also seeing is things like SD-WAN, which are part of the networking TAM are now moving into cybersecurity because people want an integrated solution as a SASE solution between SD-WAN and your security protocol. So it's interesting. There are markets going -- undergoing inflection like network security. The market of endpoint has gone through a huge inflection in the last five years. We've seen people go from endpoint protection to EDR and XDR. We've seen an explosion, there are about 14 vendors at last count in the EDR XDR space, but you can see clear leaders emerging, which are down to two or three players in that space. And there's a huge inflection going on there. We think not just there. You're going to see a large inflection in effectively what is a 15-year-old market called SIEM and SOC. That market has been -- a technology that has not been evolved for the last 15 years. It's primarily been a reactive technology where if I am breached, I need to figure out what to do, and we collect a lot of data and analyze it. That's no longer going to work, the arrival of AI, they have the need for automation, the need for normalized data, actually going to force that market to inflect. And that's something we'll talk about more. And you saw already in our Q4 results at something like XSIAM, which is targeted to that market, is where the real opportunity is for that inflection to continue, for that market to go through its own transformation. Outside of that, there are still about $30-plus billion in sort of steady cybersecurity segments as well as about $80 million of services, which we think will also continue to evolve in the next three to five years. So with that in mind, I think it's important to think about where we were when we thought about the transformation of Palo Alto Networks five years ago, where we said, cloud is going to be big, AI is going to be big, and the networks are going to have to start getting reimagined as we go towards the cloud. So effectively, cloud was going to drive the cloud security market and the network transformation and AI and machine learning would have to start helping us do this transformation in the SIEM and SOC market. Now what we saw over the last three to five years is, we at Palo Alto Networks as well as, to some degree, different plays in the industry, started to look at the various parts of these markets and say, like, these things need to start getting integrated because you can't deliver great security outcomes without these things getting integrated. So this is the thing. We talked about this. We were told that market does not need platforms. We were told that integration is not key. Customers can deal with the integration. What we want is best-of-breed products. So we decided we're going to do both. We're going to have phenomenal success in best-of-breed categories. In addition, we're going to make sure our best-of-breed products were integrated. So in these three TAMs, in these three markets of network, cloud and SOC operation, what happened is we saw these point products, we started to get integrated into the larger platform vision we had, and we saw the TAM continue to grow because these are all markets which are undergoing transformation or rapid growth. Now where we are today, we believe this is about a $100 billion opportunity across these three platforms. So for us, the opportunity has grown. It's almost gone up 2x from five years ago where we believe it's a $100 billion market today, which allows us to deliver the superior growth you've seen and the continued consolidation in the market that we've had at Palo Alto Networks. What's even more exciting within these markets will continue to drive future growth. And you will see that because of the arrival of AI, the need for more real-time autonomous security, these markets will continue to drive opportunity. In the same period over the last five years, as I said, we have been able to transform Palo Alto Networks to get it to where it is today. A, we actually proved that platforms are relevant and important in the space of cybersecurity. Just imagine, it seems obvious now, possibly to many of us, but five years ago, we had customers who had more cybersecurity vendors than they had IT vendors. And it was a customer's responsibility to take these vendors, deploy them across their infrastructure, make them work together to deliver security outcomes. You're expecting 2,000 customers out there in the Global 2000 or possibly tens of thousands of customers having security experts trying to stitch together products made by fast growth cybersecurity companies, which are deeply technical and trying to figure out how to correlate what one vendor saw or one set of vendors is telling you versus another. It just seemed like a problem that could not be solved. But over the last five years, you've seen that starting to stitch these together, starting to take this disparate solutions for security, trying to provide them in a common fabric has actually allowed us to deliver better security outcomes And we've proven that by doing that in a way, they are -- each of those pieces work in a best-of-breed fashion are leading in their own category. However, they're kind of better together in the platform. So the last three years -- the last five years, as we just shared in our Q4 results, we have been able to build a $1 billion business in security operations under Cortex, which was 0. We have been able to build a $1 billion SASE business in the last 12 months to be able to show that integration across this remote and hybrid network space is actually working. Not only that, we actually built a $500 million ARR cloud security business, proving that, again, the ability to stitch across the entire cloud development life cycle is useful for our customers. So we think that we've established that these platforms are going to be around are important and necessary, and that is the way of doing security in the future. Not only that, we've also proven that in the last five years that you can teach an old dog new tricks. Palo Alto Networks, which was a single product in one lane, we had the best firewall technology in the world as well as had amazing services that worked in the firewall, we have been able to take that and build multiple products across multiple security swim lanes and make them work better together. And the only way you can do that in security is you have to keep driving innovation. You have to stay at the bleeding edge because you don't need your customers to be at the bleeding edge. It is our responsibility as a security company to make sure we take all the innovation, we distill it, we make it work in an integrated fashion and deliver it to our customers at the fastest pace possible because the bad actors are not waiting, they're constantly looking for ways to get to our customers, to get to penetrate their infrastructure and try and figure out how to go extract data from our customers or possibly hold them with ransomware. So we have taken what was an amazing company in one category and actually built what we'd like to say is an innovation engine that allows us to stay at the bleeding edge. We've also done that, to be honest, not just by doing it ourselves because the fact that the cybersecurity industry has 3,000 startups out there, which are constantly funded because they're all working in a specialist way to solve more problems, which they believe is important for the end customer, we have to be vigilant and make sure that we don't have any issues in either building it for our customers or partnering or acquiring something that's out there that is important as part of the security fabric that we need to deliver to our customers. So as a team, we're really excited that where we are in our sort of juncture today allows us to go forward and build an even better, larger and a more compelling business for our shareholders. Not only that, to deliver phenomenal security outcomes for our customers across all these categories that we see inflecting as well as categories that we believe will be created in the next three to five years. So with that in mind, if you think about what's our view going forward for the next three to five years or possibly the next decade, I said in the last five years, we saw that huge sort of technology trends, underlying it of cloud and AI allowed us to create the stitching to build what I would say, the building blocks of building the world's largest cybersecurity company actually prepares us phenomenally well for what we think lies ahead. What we think lies ahead is the need for security to stop bad actors mid-flight, real-time, as it's happening. If you think about security today, the industry is only 30% or 40% real time. You know a bad URL, you know a bad DNS. You know how to stop your customers from something that is bad that we know. What we still aren't good at as an industry is being able to figure out unknowns and stop them before they happen. To do that, it requires a fundamentally different way of thinking about security. Something we have been sort of leading having a point of view on. And that is the idea of having stitched products that work from end to end. The idea that as something is happening, you're able to analyze it real time, on the fly and understand it's good or bad. It is reducing the noise of security in the industry by eliminating all these super close alerts or the bad signal to noise ratio. So to get that right or to get security right, we will have to be more and more real time as an industry. Now we sit at a point where everybody is talking about AI. And actually, that is the solution. The solution is to make sure you ingest large amounts of data, you analyze them on the fly, and you're able to deliver superior security. Something we talked about just in our Q4 earnings call, right before this, you saw that everything we're doing in XSIAM is driving us to that vision. But that's not enough. We have to make sure every platform that we have continues to grow and continues to get more and more ubiquitous with our customers, at the same time, also stitches these things together. So we believe in the next five to 10 years, we're going to see this shift, which is going to be palpable. It is going to be big. It's going to be understandable where we have to become more and more real time. It will no longer be about putting a bunch of sensors and thinking about hygiene and security policies. It will be about how do you stop a bad act. And we'll talk more about this because today, the mean time to fix a bad act as we've talked to you about in our earnings is four to six days. That's not acceptable. This thing will have to go down to minutes and near real time. So that's a big shift we see that's going to drive a lot of the innovation in our industry. That's going to drive a lot of our strategy and our vision because we think we're on our way to be able to deliver that future to our customers as the world's largest cybersecurity company. In that context, we talked about those three categories. We think those three categories are going to continue to become bigger. And if you look at it, the biggest opportunity is that big green circle of security operations and automation because we think the current paradigm is broken. The current paradigm is a reactive security paradigm. It's the paradigm we say, let's hire three more million people to solve security problems. No, I don't think that's going to solve the problem. What's going to solve the problem is, let's collect good data, let's analyze good data. Let's find out the anomalous behavior. Let's block it while it's happening, so our customers have a better security outcome. I think that's where we're going to be going. And we're going to have a phenomenal opportunity at Palo Alto Networks to go ahead and address a $200 billion market, which is primarily going to be a software-based market, which has its own benefits across the board because it's a lower cost of ownership for our customers, lower cost of integration for our customers. It's easy for us to go deploy and keep our customers all at -- what is the best and current best in -- sort of best-in-class capability. So a future that is driven by software capability, a future that's driven by software solutions with security and a future which has integration as part of so -- as part of it as a key tenet with the objective of delivering a real-time autonomous security outcome. So that's where we think the world is going, that's where we'd like to be, and we think we're best positioned in the industry to be able to deliver that future. Not only that, to deliver great security outcomes to our customers. So with that in mind, how are we going to do this? What are we doing in the next three years, how is that going to translate into numbers that are loved by our shareholders? So it's really the five things, part of it is something which we've been doing and some things we're going to have to keep pivoting harder. For example, one, we want to maintain this notion of being an evergreen innovation company. Our biggest insight is that if you want to lead in cybersecurity, you always have to be on the bleeding edge because the bad actors are. You always have to be scanning the market understanding, where the world is going, where technology is going to see what potential security risks are going to get created in the adoption of that technology, in the deployment of that technology to make sure we're ahead of the curve, and we start delivering security by design. As in we're not going to come in and try and bolt it on afterwards as our customers have been through the transformation, it's to work with them, embed our architectures with customers as they go through their innovation journey, we're in lockstep with them delivering security innovation. I think the second part, which we talked about is we want to make sure that our platforms, which are now deployed in sort of different stages or different amount of sort of capacity with our customers, they become ubiquitous. We want to make sure that our customers have wall-to-wall platforms that allow them to look at it as a data problem, as an AI problem, not have to stitch our platform with five other security solutions out there and trying to build their own outcomes because it's impossible for every customer to go to a secure integration by themselves. I think the way -- the best analogy I can come up with, I think in the next decade, we will see sort of a standard platform for security out there, just the way we've seen platforms in CRM or we've seen platforms in HR, as you've seen platforms and financial sort of software. We think it's time that in the next decade, we will see a security platform in our future, which just works for our customers, and the customers are not spending time integrating multiple vendors trying to stitch their own. I just think that's the only way we're going to get to the future that we need for real-time and AI-based security. Third, the topic du jour, everybody is talking about AI. We're talking about AI. We are not only talking about it, we will demonstrate that we can deliver security outcomes and the vision and the future that security needs using AI across Palo Alto Networks, and we'll talk more about that. Well, that's great. We can build amazing products, but also as a company, for our shareholders, we have to make sure that we can deliver all this innovation to our customers, both effectively; and two, we have to make sure that it's easy to consume and deploy for our customers. And we're going to have to make changes as we go forward on how we actually go deliver all the wonderful capability to all of our customers, not just by ourselves, but actually working together with some of the bleeding edge partners in the world who are in this journey. Our partners are delivering these great security outcomes for our customers. And last but not the least, and one of the key things is we cannot do this unless and until our employees are fully bought into our strategy, our vision, feel excited every day to come to work and deliver a better security outcome to our customers to make them secure and be their cybersecurity partner choice. So with that, let's take a quick look into each of these categories to see how we're going to get there. And it sort of boils down to these five key strategic sort of requirements and directions from our perspective, innovation, continued platformization, leveraging AI, continue to transform our go-to-market capabilities. And last but not the least, again, is to make sure our team is along with us every step of the way. So getting into the topic of innovation. I think I'm very proud of the track record we have so far. We've gone from 13 products/acquisitions that we've integrated in 2019, to delivering 74 in 2023. It sounds like a lot, but actually, these 74 are delivered in an integrated fashion. So it actually improves the efficiency of security for our customer. It actually makes usability better. It actually makes it much easier for us to deliver security outcomes. So really excited about that. I think this whole AI revolution that we're undergoing or we're looking at, witnessing, it's going to require us to keep investing, looking once again as to what capability AI is going to deliver across all of our products because we do collect the world's most amount of security data. So we will keep driving innovation by underpinning more and more machine learning and AI under our platforms. We'll keep looking at how to deliver more capability with the sensors that we have out there with our customers from an innovation perspective. We've talked about this. We are happy to make sure that we deliver innovation and security outcomes to our customers. It does not all have to be invented in Palo Alto. We will constantly keep scanning the market to make sure that there's something out there that our customers need to get and somebody else is doing really well. It's our job to make sure we partner, collaborate, integrate or acquire to deliver the outcome that the customer needs from an innovation perspective. And last but not the least, being at the bleeding edge of security. Being one of the largest players, it is our responsibility to make sure we're looking at all new technologies to see how they're going to impact our customers and their states, whether it's quantum, whether it's AI because there is a dark side to AI. It's our job working with our partners and the industry to make sure we deliver innovation in how to protect against AI getting abused or misused in the market. So I strongly believe for us to deliver on the next three to five vision of Palo Alto Networks, we are going to have to continue to be an evergreen innovation company, which I think will give this company longevity and sustainability forever in the future and being the leader in cybersecurity. We talked about platformization or you've heard that word, you will keep hearing it to the next sort of 45 minutes from our team because we believe that's the way to deliver security, is resonating with our customers. Our customers are seeing it. My team is going to show you some amazing UI. I think you're going to start seeing not only just we're talking about this sort of the next level of platformization. You will start seeing, right after me, how we actually bring it to life. So I cannot be more excited about some of the work we're doing on the product side, stuff that we haven't shown anybody yet. You are going to see it today because it's important for us not just to talk about it, be able to show you how we're going to deliver. So you will see a next level of integration and how we can deliver security outcomes. You'll see sneak peeks into how we're going to leverage AI copilots in each of our products to create the simplicity and usability that security has not had, to be honest, so far. So I couldn't be more excited about how our teams are going to keep driving more and more platformization, more and more integration, where things of integrating best-of-breed vendors as sort of DIY or do it yourself or do it home is going to be a thing of the past. So moving on to leveraging AI, I talked about this. But again, clearly, there's no Analyst Day out there today that you cannot -- you must talk about AI. So I think the reason is different for us. As a security company, we are always focused on figuring out how to leverage data. We have north of 100 machine learning models that run today at Palo Alto Networks across our products. So this is not new news. But the way I think about it is, let's call all of that precision AI. That's AI where I cannot afford for it to be wrong. If it's wrong, lives matter. If it's wrong, ransomware happens, if it's wrong, bad actors get in. So we have to be right 100% of the time. And to me, that's the definition of precision AI. And to deliver that future, we have to build a lot of our own models. We have to train them. We have to collect first-party data. We have to understand the data. Today, we collect approximately 5 petabytes of data. Yes, 5 petabytes of data on behalf of our customers and analyze it for them to make sure we can separate signal from noise and take that signal and go create security outcomes for our customers. We still have 1.5 million net new attacks every day across our 60,000 customers. So we know how to use AI, and we believe we are uniquely positioned in the industry given our presence in end points, our presence in firewalls, our presence in the cloud, our presence across the entire network security stack to be able to deliver those AI-based outcomes to our customers. And we're doubling down, we're quadrupling down to make sure that Precision AI is deployed across every product in Palo Alto, and we open up the floodgates of collecting good data with our customers for them to give them better security because we think that is the way we're going to solve this problem, to get to real-time security. But let's not underestimate the opportunity generative AI puts in front of us. On a very personal basis, I believe generative AI is amazing for data summarization, for natural language interaction, for doing all the things where there was an information decay between our products and our customers. We build great products. By the time they get to our customers, there's a lot of translation that happens between our product developers and the customer and sometimes the breaches happen because the customers don't fully understand our product because they cannot configure them right. All those things can be eliminated if we can implement generative AI effectively through our products. So our customers can interact with our products in natural language. They don't have to have complex security understanding to operate our products. They don't have to have complex security understanding to fix a problem. We can fix all of that if we, in our company, learn how to deliver generative AI-based interfaces, generative AI-based outcomes through our products. And you know what, our teams are going to show you a glimpse of that. We have been working diligently over the last five months across the board at Palo Alto Networks. And I couldn't be more excited about some of the stuff that you're going to see just after this from our product teams to give you a sneak peek. At the same time, we're going to do it in a deliberate fashion. We're going to crawl, walk, run. We think we are on the right path. We're going to work in lockstep with the industry. We have people analyzing and working with almost everybody out there. We understand where the best-in-class LLM activity is. We understand where technology is. We also understand what might be going in the next three to six months. So all I can say is that I think the combination of precision AI and generative AI is going to fundamentally change the way security outcomes are delivered to our customers because it will take away the complexity. It will take away the confusion, the sort of usability problems that you have with security, and it will start helping deliver great outcomes to our customers. I think it's just going to make our platforms amazing as we go forward. On the go-to-market side. In the last five years, we have done a phenomenal job, I think, of building the products that our customers need. Yet, we have to make sure that every customer understands our capability. Every customer has a road map with us where we can take them to deliver real-time security outcomes. For that, we need to skill -- upskill our team in some areas, which we have been doing very effectively. As you saw, our team was able to deliver some amazing results for Q4, and I think we're going to keep doing that. We are going to go from being just a security vendor to being a solution partner. For that, we have to work harder with many players out there, which is something we've geared up to do, and we're having some amazing early success. We've got to figure out how to institutionalize that capability at Palo Alto Networks. And that's one thing BJ and his team are going to focus very effectively on in the next three to five years. Not just that, as I said, we need to figure out how to deliver architectural outcomes to our customers. Our customers are tired of spending too much money in cybersecurity and ending up with the same mess and saying, wait, my security outcomes aren't getting much better, but I seem to be spending more money. It's important for us to work with every one of them to deliver those capabilities in a architectural way so they understand the long-term road map because I think it's fair to say that where we are today is not where we were five years ago. I think we have enough confidence in our customers to partner with us for the long term because they believe we're going to be around or we're going to be an evergreen cybersecurity company. And last but not the least, I think it's very important as part of our go-to-market efforts, we have a large team that delivers customer delight. Well, I just think we're about to see a step change in customer delight with the application of generative AI. Again, we've been working really hard. You'll see a bit of a glimpse of that in some of the things that teams are going to show you. And over the next possibly three, six, nine months, you will see more and more capability delivered to our customers using that generative AI framework or predictive AI or precision AI framework. I think in the next three to five years, that is going to fundamentally change what Palo Alto is able to do out there in the market. And as I said, we cannot do this without the best people. Our employer brand has become phenomenal in the last five years. As we continue to deliver great innovation, great outcomes, people want to come work at Palo Alto Networks. People want to be part of the success of being the cybersecurity partner of choice for our customers. So we can only do this, we can only deliver our strategy if we have the best team. We continue to track the best, we continue to empower them. We continue to make sure that they can deliver great outcomes for our customers. We plan to keep doing that over the next three to five years because we believe this is a mission-driven opportunity. It's an opportunity that allows us to make the world a better place by making sure that our customers can be secure. So as I said, you will notice in the next three to five years, we will continue to transform Palo Alto Networks from where we are to where we would like to be. We will continue to focus on the demand function at the top. We believe the market is continuing to inflect, as I said, in the area of security operations. It's highly likely that some of the other steady areas are going to see some inflection as well. We're going to continue to relentlessly innovate and keep making our platforms more ubiquitous. We're going to make sure that we can deliver the amplification from our go-to-market teams. And also, we're going to make sure that we have the best team in the industry to deliver solutions to our customers. I couldn't be more excited about the prospects of Palo Alto Network. I couldn't be more excited that we are seeing tremendous success in our software-driven capabilities. I think we are going to continue to be able to transform this company from where we started as a hardware vendor to a software-delivered security with real-time security outcomes. I believe we will continue to be the best cybersecurity partner of choice for our customers. With that, I'm going to hand over to Lee because he's going to show you some really cool stuff, which is hopefully going to excite you about our ability to deliver the future we've talked about.
Lee Klarich: Thank you, Nikesh. Now in a second, we're going to go into more detail on our three leading platforms. But first, I want to share some context. After all, we're a cybersecurity company, what's happening in the threat landscape. And I'll just give you the really obvious answer, it's bad. The threat landscape is intensifying. $8 trillion of cost due to cybercrime. Attackers are becoming very sophisticated with the tools they use, whether that's automation, attacking the supply chain, et cetera. And just the sheer volume is off the charts, growing about 20x since 2011 to over 1 billion new malicious programs. This is incredible. So clearly, that is a challenge, but it's even more challenging than that. It wasn't that long ago when it took an attacker on average about 44 days from initial compromise to exfiltration. Now 44 days is basically the time period that an organization would have to detect, disrupt and potentially prevent the breach from happening. So in 44 days goes down to hours, which is what we're now starting to see. That is a huge problem. That requires a very different approach. But on average, the industry is able to respond and remediate attacks in about six days. That doesn't work. And even more challenging now with the SEC new rules of being able to disclose within four days, none of the math adds up. Now before we get comfortable in just solving these problems, there's one more challenge coming. Attackers have recognized the power of AI, just as much as everyone else has recognized the power of AI to do good things. Whether it's fraud GPT or worm GPT or other use of AI, it is clear this is going to become the next major tool used by attackers to launch more attacks, more sophisticated attacks and faster attacks. So we have to innovate. And we recognize that, Palo Alto Networks was built for innovation from day one. And today, we have over 4,400 product, engineering and other experts that are building and driving innovation. And you see just how fast we've ramped that over the last several years. In part, by being able to scale our organization across three main R&D centers in the world. In addition to this organic innovation engine we've built, we look at about 250 private companies every year to identify the absolute best teams, the absolute best technology that could become part of Palo Alto Networks in order to further drive our innovation engine. And we combine these two together, and we will continue to combine them together to have the best innovation capability. And then we combine that with AI. We recognized really how important AI would be to our innovation. And over the last several years, we have been infusing AI into our products in very unique ways to solve very challenging problems that only AI can. And from this foundation, we're only going to do more and better. We are going to accelerate our pace of innovation even further. We are going to leverage our proven playbook around M&A to be able to augment what we do organically. And we are going to take our capabilities in AI and turn that into an AI-first company. And why I'm so confident in our ability to leverage AI is we've built the right data foundation, we've combined that with the right architecture, and we've leveraged an amazing set of expertise across all of that. We collect more data per customer than anyone else, security data, relevant data for AI. We combine that with an architecture that over the last several years, we've been migrating every product into a cloud-based architecture because we know that, that sets us up to use AI in everything we do. And today, I have a team of over 150 AI experts that I can leverage across all three of our platforms to identify and drive even more AI capabilities and innovation. That's how we do innovation. How the industry does innovation is very different. The industry tends to look at this in the context of point products. Every time there's a new need, there is a new point product. This leads to incredible complexity for end customers. Think about having to stitch all of this together. Now it does create a large security market of about $210 billion, but it means that there is an incredible opportunity for disruption. And for a disruptive and innovative approach, which is why we've taken our platform-oriented approach because we recognize that the only way to achieve the real-time security outcomes that our customers need is by integrating natively all of those capabilities into a set of very focused platforms, around Zero Trust, code to cloud and security operations. In a moment, we'll go into detail on that. But last and certainly not least point, not all platforms are created equally. I shared with you how we think about innovation because that is so fundamental to the outcomes of our platforms. In addition to that, our platforms are designed to be as comprehensive as possible. It doesn't mean we do everything, but it means that we do all of the core set of capabilities necessary such that we can then selectively integrate and enable third-party technology to complement the platforms. Everything we do is integrated. It's designed to solve hard problems through integration that cannot otherwise be solved with point products. And that combination enables our platforms to be real time and enable real-time security outcomes for our customers. So with that, let's start our first deep dive with our Zero Trust platform. It's very clear in the network security market, what's happening. The point product approach that we've been fighting for so long as a company is getting harder and harder to sustain. There's more technologies, more capabilities needed. Those capabilities are needed across a broader attack surface with the advent of hybrid cloud and hybrid work. The only way to solve this is with a platform. we're going to share that in a second. In addition, the next set of trends is going to further propel the need for platformization as passwordless becomes common, as Quantum becomes common, as BYOD becomes enabled across enterprises. In all of these, there's going to be a decision. Do you want to try to enable them across 25 and 30 different standalone point products? Or do you want to enable them in a single platform? The answer is obvious and clear. And that is why we are well positioned to take advantage of the opportunity in front of us across all of network security with our Zero Trust platform. And to go into more detail is Anand Oswal, Leader of our network security Zero Trust platform team. Anand?
Anand Oswal: Thank you, Lee. Before I talk about network security, let me first talk about the evolution of network security. Today, network security has become increasingly complex. In the past, when users were predominantly in the office and applications in the data center, network security was delivered by a centralized firewall. Data center virtualization and migration to the cloud required inspection of traffic moving to the cloud and many organizations had software firewalls. And with the hybrid workforce and protecting remote branches, many enterprises deployed a cloud-delivered stack, SASE. As you can see, many organizations today have three distinct and disparate stacks. This leads to complexity of architecture, poor operational experience, inconsistent security and poor user experience. What if you could take a radically different and new approach, ensuring that any user across any location, accessing any application and data is secured by unified security stack, which means we have one platform with a set of security services that ensure that users across all locations have consistent user experience. And administrators can now author policies in a centralized manner. This is enterprise-wide Zero Trust. Over the last five years, we've developed a Zero Trust platform with best-in-class products, and it has three key components: first, network secure enforcing points, hardware firewalls, software firewalls and cloud-delivered SASE. Second, cloud-delivered security services that run consistently across all form factors of network security and management that provides configuration, writing of policies, monitoring and analytics. And each of these three components ensure that we can provide our customers near real-time security, better operational outcomes and a simplified and consistent user experience. Let's now talk about the components of the platform. First, the network security enforcement points. The foundations, hardware firewalls, software firewalls and SASE. We're the leader in next-generation firewall now for over a decade, a Gartner Magic Quadrant leader 11 times. And we're the only vendor that's a leader in both SSE and SD-WAN that make up the SASE market. We're also a leader in Zero Trust. Next, let's talk about cloud-delivered security services. Over the years, as Lee mentioned, the attackers have become more and more sophisticated. The old approach of signature and databases is not working. We've been working on using AI and the power of machine learning to ensure that we can provide our customers with protection against attacks that they have never seen before and ensuring that we can provide near real-time security. We also expanded from three services five years ago to seven, ensuring our customers can consolidate point products onto the platform. In addition, we've developed new services like ADEM and AIOps. ADEM, our autonomous digital experience management provides customers segment by segment visibility from user to application, helping them understand exactly what's going on at every segment along the way. And with AI operations, we can automate many of the complex tasks or customers, ensure that they're using security with best practices, configuration with best practices and ensuring that we are able to predict things that may not - they have seen before. Now as you can see, we've had some great success with different capabilities of our platform. However, if you think about the market, hardware firewalls to secure data centers and campuses, software firewalls to secure cloud networks and SASE to secure hybrid works and remote branches. These, for the most part, have acted as three distinct markets. And customers for the most part have made independent decisions. I believe we're now at an inflection point. With unified management across the entire network security estate, we will change the way how customers buy and how customers deploy and how customers operate network security. Let me now show you a glimpse of our unified management, which I'm very excited about. As you can see, we have unprecedented visibility here. Users can be anywhere in campuses, in branches, remote workers on the go and applications that are sitting everywhere, data centers, public cloud SaaS. And traffic flowing through all the enforcement points, hardware firewalls, software firewalls and SASE. And we have a complete comprehensive view of all the threats in the entire network security estate, the data risks, the posture and the experience. Now the threat landscape is constantly changing. And we always have new vulnerabilities that show up and are published offer. And many times, network administrators want to know exactly if what happens for a particular vulnerability, is the enterprise affected by it or not? Now with this unified management, we can easily search for a given vulnerability. And once we understand, like in this case, that we have compromised by this vulnerability with a single click, we can get remediations of best actives and make sure that we can apply these best practices across the entire network security estate, which means our hardware firewalls, our softer firewalls and Prisma SASE. That's the power of having complete end-to-end visibility of the entire estate. Now let me talk to you about our network security copilot. With the power of generative AI, we're ensuring that customers can use our platform to the best of its capabilities, optimizing security, optimizing configuration and optimizing their operations. This is what you'll see when you come to the co-pilot. As you can see, they tell you all the activity that happened in the last 24 hours. And now as you can see, we have 140,000 users that have a good experience, but 10,000 users have a degraded experience. Now rather than point and click to understand what's going on, we can engage with the copilot with natural language and ask the co-pilot exactly what's happening for those 10,000 users. And behind the scenes, the power of AI and ML and getting data for all sources, endpoint, cloud identity engine, applications, network enforcement points, we can tell the customer that the users are having degraded experience accessing a geo application. Not only that, we can also give root cause, which is because they're authorization failures, open an ITSM ticket on their behalf with all the relevant information. Let's take an example next about a network administrator wanting to know exactly what are the risky applications being accessed in the organization. Again, here going through all the enforcement points, hardware firewalls, software firewalls and SASE, we can give a summarized view of all the six risky applications in this case. Now once you know the risky applications, the next step would be, what is the policy I need to apply to block access to risky application. And using best practices, we're able to give them the right policy configuration ask the customer to review the policy changes or apply them. And once they apply them, it's applied across all the enforcement points, making sure the customer is now protected. As you can see, with the power of unified management with the power of the copilot by changing the way network security is deployed operated on a managed on an ongoing basis. Super exciting. To wrap things up, we have over 1,700 customers today using our platform. And over the next few years, we expect many more customers to use the platform to get the power of Zero Trust, to get the power of ensuring that they have consistency across the entire security estate to get unprecedented visibility. At the same time, we've seen customers use and adopt more of our security services. In the last two years that number has increased, and we continue to see a trend. Customers consolidating their point products onto the platform. To make sure that they get the network effect of data and simplify their operations. In summary, Zero Trust can only be delivered for platform centric approach. It's very hard to do it with point products and disparate solutions. Customers will continue to integrate more and more of the services onto the platform, and we'll continue to give a delightful experience to our customers the power of AI. With that, back over to you, Lee.
Lee Klarich: Thank you, Anand. So clearly, huge opportunity in network security Zero Trust platform. Now turn your attention to the Cloud. Cloud is just absolutely gone through an incredible transformation. Today, there's over 500 million cloud native applications deployed. There's 33 million developers that are constantly pushing new capabilities in new applications. Nearly all enterprises are multi-cloud. That is just an amazing starting point when you think about what is going on. And at the same time, there's a, tremendous amount of innovation happening, because of the cloud. And a lot of this is being driven through the ability to leverage open source. That's being combined with custom code. That's being combined with infrastructure as code. All of that just enables the speed, this dynamic nature of the cloud, and it all needs to be secured. And very much like the rest of enterprise cyber security, the industry approach has been a whole bunch of point product that customers are somehow expected to stitch together. We have a different approach. We believe that all of these capabilities should be modules natively integrated and delivered in the platform. And when we get this right, we can not only secure in real time, but we can then fix at source. So, the issue doesn't happen again. And to go into more details on how we're able to achieve that is Ankur Shah, leader of our Prisma Cloud code-to-cloud platform. Ankur?
Ankur Shah: Thanks, Lee. Like Lee mentioned, we live in an app economy. The average enterprise today uses over 100 applications, some for commercial and some for internal use. With AI-led code development, I expect this trend to continue. Before we talk about securing the apps, first, let's talk about how these applications are assembled in the code phase, there are some custom code, a whole bunch of open source code gets deployed using infrastructure as code. And ultimately, it moves through the pipeline goes into the run time and construct what we call the application. The key thing to note here is, that everything that happens in code phase gets multiplied in cloud, a single infrastructure as code or open source component can get deployed across hundreds of thousands of workloads and application component. What is true for infrastructure and the application layer is also true for the security risk. A risk, like an open source vulnerability, secret, pipeline risk introduced in the code phase, gets multiplied in the run time where - now you have hundreds of thousands of containers and application components running that risk. The attackers has more ways than ever before to exploit this risk and cause a data breach. Now there are two approaches to solving this problem. One approach is what the industry has always done, which is to have a point product per problem. In the code phase, there are about half a dozen different tools to scan security posture. In the infrastructure layer, you have yet another set of tools. And finally, in the run time, you have tools for cloud workload protection, network security and application security. Now this is not the right approach to solving this problem for two reasons: number one, each of those tools lack the context. So the customers have to stitch all of that together. And the second thing is, like Lee described, there are 33 million developers and a really few security professionals who understand code and cloud. This is a battle that the security team simply can't win with this specific approach. We believe there is a better approach. And that's the approach that we have been steadfast in executing over the last four years, and that is an integrated code-to-cloud platform approach that can help customers prevent risks, and breaches in near real time. Prisma Cloud does that today by scanning security vulnerabilities at each phase of the application life cycle and also have runtime protection to prevent breaches in runtime. Our strategy is resonating well with the customers and analyst community across different component parts as well as the entirety of the platform. Typical customers start their journey in the infrastructure layer, where we have now 68% of the customers where we're securing over 4 billion cloud assets. Then they shift left, where they want to prevent the risk from happening to begin with, where we have today 20% of our customers, and we are today scanning millions of code assets. And finally, customers want defense in depth, and they want active prevention, and protection technology in the cloud runtime should a bad actor cause a data breach, where today, we have 54% of the customers where we're scanning 13 million-plus containers. Let's see the entirety of the Prisma Cloud platform with a quick demo. What you see here is a code-to-cloud dashboard that gives the security practitioners visibility across the entire application pipeline. What you see here is as the code assets, and the cloud assets are growing, so are the security risk. For example in the code phase, you're seeing a whole bunch of security risk that Prisma Cloud has already scanned. The typical enterprise uses multiple tools just to do the security of the code. And on the cloud phase, you're seeing a whole bunch of security scans that Prisma Cloud has done should things fall through the crack and go into production. The key thing to remember here is that risk introduced in the code phase gets multiplied in the cloud, 20 risk in the code got to be 2,000 in cloud. Now typically, the security practitioner, it takes months and months to resolve these 2,000 issues, because they don't have the context, don't have the traceability to fix the root cause of the problem. Let me show you how Prisma Cloud does that. So I clicked on the 2,000 security risk. What you see here is a code-to-cloud security graph, where we're tracing the 2,000 security risk back to the two problems in the code phase. More specifically, these are the two Log4j components that the developers introduced that has the security risk that led to those 2,000 problems. You can see that those 2,000 risks belong to a single application. And like I described, the customer's using multiple applications. So now the customer has tens of thousands of different risks. With a single click of a button, Prisma Cloud is able to fix the root cause of the issue as you will see that momentarily. We're able to upgrade the latest version of the Log4j, invoke the pipeline, reduce the risk at each stage of the application life cycle. And now you see that the 2,000 risks are reduced to zero with a single click option. So that was the first demo. The key thing to remember here is anytime there is a risk in the cloud, you have to trace it back to the cloud, and we're the only platform that can do that today. The second demo I want to show, and that's something we've been working on, which was with the AI copilot. So let me show you how our AI copilot experience is going to look like is going to show you all the things that it has done for you since you last logged in. The user, this time, I was going to ask the question around how many Log4Shell vulnerabilities do I have in my environment? Through a simple natural language processing, it was able to understand the question, was able to render a similar graph. As you can see, there are 1,000 cloud risks per Log4Shell, trace it back to the one source problem. The user is able to interact with the copilot, get a little bit more definition of these problems. And finally, just like you saw in the first demo, asked the copilot to go ahead and fix all this problem with a single click. The key thing I want you to remember about the security copilot is that it's a resource multiplier for you. There are not enough security professionals and the copilot is going to help you burn down the risk, and prevent breaches in cloud. As I wrap this, let me tell you the opportunity ahead of us. The average customer today doubles their credit consumption within a year and quadruples in two years by growing from two to five to eight modules. We have a natural land-and-expand motion with our existing customers. When you add that with the new customers that we're going to be adding, and enough headroom that we have with the installed base, the opportunity in front of us is massive. The last thing I'll leave you with is the market in front of us is huge. Prisma Cloud is the clear leader in this space, and we have the right strategy and the vision to win this market. Thank you all.
Lee Klarich: All right. Thank you, Ankur. Again, clearly, huge opportunity in cloud security with our unique approach and what we're driving, really excited with where we are and what we're working on. And now for our third platform, our AI-driven SecOps platform. This is a market that I believe is ready for a fundamental transformation. Most of the technologies that companies use are - or were developed 15, in some cases, 20 years ago. That clearly does not work. They were not designed for an attacker sophistication that we see today. They were not designed for real-time detection, and automation remediation. These tools were not designed for supply chain attacks. These tools were not designed for the advent of attack AI being used by our adversaries. We have to reimagine security operations from the ground up. And in doing this, leveraging data, leveraging AI, leveraging automation as core tightly integrated foundational aspects to how an entire SecOps platform functions within the SOC. And this is the journey that we've been on for the last several years. Building this platform, refining it, developing the capabilities necessary, and then refining it again until we reach the point where we are today, where we have a set of leading products and an incredible platform, delivering incredible outcomes to take advantage of this entire security operations market in front of us. And to share more details I'm joined from our Tel Aviv R&D center by Gonen Fink, who leads our entire Cortex Product Organization. Gonen?
Gonen Fink: Thank you, Lee. Let's take a deeper look at why existing SOC architecture doesn't work. With the growth of sophisticated alerts, multiple tools were created, each one designed to solve a specific problem. This leads to an extremely fragmented SOC, very hard to manage. It is the customer responsibility to integrate those tools into a human-driven workflow. The result of that is bad security outcome, low-confidence alert, energy shortage, unable to resolve those incidents in real time. So what is required to deliver real-time security operation? We need to replace this fragmented architecture with a unified single floor architecture. We need to replace multiple products that collect data with a single data platform and silo detection tools with an AI engine that is trained on a full data center. And then automation should be natively integrated into the flow rather than being placed as an afterthought. Five years ago, we recognized the criticality of data, AI and automation for the future of cybersecurity. We built three amazing products. Each of them became a leader in its respective category, and we continue to innovate in each of those categories to maintain our leadership. This drove Cortex to become a $1 billion business for us, and it also brought us into thousands of customers' security operation centers. Cortex XDR extended the EDR market, and it is the best AI tool for endpoint prevention and real-time detection of all security threats. Cortex XSOAR is the best-in-class security tool for automated threat response and Cortex XPAND proactively manage your attack surface and reduce that. But to harness the full potential of AI and automation in order to build a real-time SOC requires more than that. We need an integrated AI-driven architecture that reimagine the legacy 20 years old SOC architecture from the ground up. And this is what we brought to the market with XSIAM last year. So what happens is legacy SOC and how it has changed with XSIAM. Let's look at that. In order to detect attacks, silent tools just get alerts. But we are living in a dynamic world, unfortunately, looking at anomalies or alert in isolation might be suspicious, but there are many of them. Each of them we'll look at the world from a very narrow standpoint. And the result is that high volume of alerts that overwhelm the SOC. This means that SOC gives up on reviewing all of those alerts. And eventually, the SOC is missing the important ones. With XSIAM customer no longer needs to review low confidence alert and try to connect the dots themselves. XSIAM collect a large amount of data and uses AI to analyze low confidence signals, stitch them together with raw data and get enough context to resolve most of them automatically, presenting the user only with all of an incident and with a full context for each of those incidents. By grouping this into incidents prioritize them, restoring them, XSIAM provides a full picture view to the analysts, and allow the analysts to respond very quickly to the events. How do we do this management? Let me use our new product UI to explain the key elements that differentiate XSIAM on the rest of the products in the market. It starts with the data. We ingest normalized stitch together petabytes of data from dozens and hundreds of data sources to recreate the full story of each and every event in your environment. This stitched rich data set feed and sophisticated AI engine with over 3,000 models that produce high confidence alerts that groups those alerts into incidents, assigns a risk score to each and every incident, and then integrate natively built automation to resolve most of the incidents, leaving only a small number of incidents for human review and resolution. Like the copilots, you saw for both network security and cloud security, our new Cortex UI, we incorporate a copilot with an early alpha testing starting next month. We started working with Palo Alto Network SOC as our first partner as we design and build Cortex and XSIAM. Palo Alto is the largest security vendor. And as such, we have a lot of assets that we need to protect. In order to do proper job, we collect a lot of data. Over 1 trillion events are collected every month or 75 terabytes every day. With Cortex, Palo Alto Network's SOC can protect its network with a small team working on startup ships, resulting with less than one minute incident resolution. This is not heroic. This is relying on technology and AI and automation to achieve the right security outcomes. So when we launched XSIAM, we wanted to see how these plays with customers. And the early indications are remarkable. Our customers are able to ingest a lot more data than before, which provides them with broader coverage for their attack service. Even though they ingest a lot more data, product generates a lot less false positive. And those true positive alerts are being grouped together prioritized by AI, delivering much, much superior security outcomes. Better coverage shifting the median time to response from day to hours. As we look forward, we see tremendous opportunity in drawing Cortex and XSIAM. We continue to win and gain market shares with our best of breed products, XDR, XSOAR, and Expanse, That's not a basis to upsell our customers to the full XSIAM solution. Each of those customers is a candidate, is becoming a prospect to move to the full platform XSIAM. And we demonstrate this over the past 12 months in being able to convert a lot of the customer that use part of the platform to become a full platform users. For the most exciting part, is when we look at where we can expand XSIAM. We believe the era of AI automation is just beginning, and XSIAM is quickly becoming the largest security data platforms. And the technology we build with AI automation could be the basis to expand what we can deliver with XSIAM to new modules within the SOC, and across the entire security landscape. Thank you all and back to you, Lee.
Lee Klarich: Awesome. Thank you Gonen going in. Clearly, an incredible opportunity in Cortex, and specifically with XSIAM as we think about the journey ahead where we are going to transform security operations in just absolutely incredible and amazing ways. And with that context across our three platforms. Let me now turn it over to BJ to share with you how we take all of this wonderful stuff to market. BJ?
BJ Jenkins: Thanks, Lee. And it's great to be here with all of you. I couldn't be more excited to talk about our go-to-market transformation that, will allow us to take full advantage of the product innovation you heard about. I just had my two-year anniversary of Palo Alto Networks, and the evolution of this go-to-market organization in step with our customer needs and product innovation has been incredible. To understand how we can best serve our customers, we need to understand how organizations are tackling cybersecurity challenges today. On average, large companies have 75 plus security solutions. This leads to fragmentation and growing complexity as customers try to stitch together all these individual products and data. To add to this, they are dealing with overlapping vendor solutions, that don't talk to each other. Many customers are buying cybersecurity in this way. They recognize how unwieldly and ineffective it is, and they need our help. This is a call action for our industry to do a better job at helping our customers. And at Palo Alto Networks, we will do this through three key go-to-market transformations. First, we are transitioning from a transactional vendor to a true strategic partner, guiding customers on their transformation journey. Customers are looking to us for direction on how to secure their enterprises and keep their employees and end user customers safe. Second, we are transforming from selling point products to architecting outcomes in partnership with our customer's most trusted ecosystem solution providers. Our customer's ecosystem partners will become even more important as we work with them, to create more value through new services, and joint offerings. Third, we are moving from a reactive help model where customers only call us when they need us to a more collaborative model, where we are proactively driving success for every customer with an in it together mentality. Palo Alto Networks is well positioned to help our customers through these three key shifts, and we have made significant headway on each of these fronts. In the past, our go-to-market motion focused on technical domain experts, solving very specific product requirements. These conversations often revolved around price, and they were transactional in nature. Today, C suite executives are engaging us more and more, they are looking to transform their entire business, understand security strategy, and deliver better security outcomes. We now have a seat at the table for key architectural decisions and ongoing multiyear roadmap engagement. Our 3000 integrated sellers are set up to scale, and have these strategic conversations with our customers. Our ecosystem is also playing a critical role as we move from selling products, to architecting outcomes. Five years ago, we sold a single product, primarily hardware firewalls as part of a larger partner delivered motion. Most of our partners were focused on transactional fulfillment of customer orders. Today, we are deeply embedded with strategic partners across all routes to market and are co-leading the sales motions with our partners to deliver joint solutions. We have a 150, $10 million plus strategic partners today in our ecosystem. In the future, we're going to continue to strengthen our sell together motion by building integrated offerings with a shared focus on improving client outcomes. Our top 30 partners will become even more important, and we're looking to drive $10 million plus of business with them. Delivering the best security outcomes means that our customer's post sales experience must also undergo a shift. As I said to an in it together model, allowing them to be successful faster and get the most value from our solutions. Although we have consistently achieved a 90 plus percent CSAT score, we aren't stopping there. Continuous improvement is the goal. As part of our strategic focus on AI, we'll leverage AI to resolve customer issues more quickly. With AI enabled in product support, we plan to reduce our meantime to resolve for calls by over 65%. We also plan to scale our global network of 300 plus fully certified professional service partners in order, to further expand our ability to deploy our products with speed and agility. And last, but not least we'll increase adoption by staying with our customers throughout - their entire journey. We have a 600 plus person customer success team with deep expertise, helping to build customers for life. You've heard this from others today, but it bears repeating. We see massive opportunity ad for Palo Alto Networks, and our go-to-market model is transforming to meet it head on. As you can see in the chart, we're already well on our way with our global 2,000 customers with 54% of our customers on the journey across all three platforms. And we have great potential to extend our breath by selling, the full portfolio across our installed base, and our platform depth by covering our customer's full estate. I'll end where I started with a reflection on the opportunity, and unprecedented ability to help our customers secure and transform their business. Palo Alto Network platforms are the best in the industry, and we have a world-class go to market organization uniquely positioned to bring them to our customers and partners. Our go-to-market model is ready to scale and deliver real time security outcomes for every customer through the power of our platforms. Thank you everyone and back over to you, Dipak.
Dipak Golechha: As you heard from Nikesh about our strategy, Lee and his team on products, and BJ around go-to-market, we have the entire company pointed in the same direction. I now wanted to bring this altogether to help you understand why we are confident, that we can capitalize on our opportunity and translate it into financial result that will drive superior total shareholder return. I will go through all four of the primary drivers of TSR, including revenue growth, profitability, cash conversion, and capital structure. First, on the top line, you heard about our TAM from Nikesh, we have proven over the last five years that we target the largest and most attractive parts of the market. We've been able to capitalize on an expanding opportunity taking share from within existing markets, and positioning ourselves in new markets to drive further growth potential. Our share today stands at just 7% of our addressable market, which is lower than the share of leaders in many other markets outside of the cybersecurity industry. As we plot the course to the larger term that Nikesh outlined over the next five years, we continue to see the opportunity to gain share in our existing markets, and continue to fuel above market growth for Palo Alto Networks. Looking at this through the product lens, Lee and his team outlined our platform leadership in our three areas, and showed you the innovation plans their teams have to continue to lead our markets. From my seed at the company, innovation is our lifeblood, and we will continue to spend aggressively on R&D. We do not focus on driving leverage to the bottom line, but rather we redeploy any savings we identify to invest in additional innovation. Our customers expect us to continue innovating, and we have consistently shown a strong return from these innovation investments. This includes recognition of our innovations, such as the Gartner single vendor SASE leadership position that we mentioned today. We expect our innovation to show through, and financial outcomes in each platform and the company overall. In network security, our investments across form factors, especially software-based and cloud delivered, enable us to further our market position and sustain our growth in FWaaP billings. Our market share and our software-based VM business is approximately two times what it is in hardware. In SASE, we believe that we are the number two player in this fast growing market. In cloud security, the growth algorithm is leveraging products and go-to-market capabilities to drive credit consumption ahead of the growth rate customers are deploying public cloud. Along the way, we are confident we can increase multi module consumption, to solidify our position as the definitive code-to-cloud leader. In Cortex, we have a solid business with XDR, XSOAR and Expanse, competing an attractive individual product markets. We've seen a shrinking number of players in the XDR market, and have steadily added several 100 customers per quarter. Adding customers across Cortex is important to allow us to drive larger, more strategic deals in the future, where we can further cross sell our products, including XSIAM. XSIAM is truly game changing innovation, where we are selling outcomes, and I'm confident that momentum will beget momentum here, after a very strong launch of the product in the first year. It should be clear from BJ's presentation that we've invested in building a large dedicated go-to-market organization, and are transforming how we engage with the market. Transformation here has been a nonstop effort and has driven growth - in the number of large deals each quarter. On the back of the core tenants BJ covered, we see the opportunity to continue to drive more strategic relationships with customers that can result in eight, and even nine figure relationships. At the same time that we have seen these large deal outcomes, we've consistently improved the productivity of our core apps, as they collectively become better at selling the broader portfolio. As Nikesh mentioned, SASE has been a big success here. Additionally, we have seen standout growth from new ecosystem partners, including the cloud service providers, and global system integrators. Not only has our business transacted through these channels increased, but more importantly, so has our success leveraging these partners as influences. We have the product portfolio that makes us an attractive partner to these players, along with the scale to make the investments to support the success of these partners. Bringing this together on the top line, as Nikesh noted, we're targeting growth of 17% to 19% in revenue and billings over the next three years, which is ahead of the cybersecurity market growth rates. We see hardware as a percentage of our total revenue decreasing to approximately 10% with NGS ARR exiting fiscal year '26 above 55% of our fiscal year '26 revenue. RPO remains an important metric as it captures the full value of our customer contracts independent of payment terms, and we expect growth of 25% annually through fiscal year '26. Additionally, we see about two-thirds of our revenue in fiscal year '26, driven by current RPO entering the year highlighting the increase in predictability of our revenue profile. Now moving to the cost side, and first with gross margin. As I hope Lee and BJ have impressed on upon you, we have significant advantages inherent in building and delivering platforms. There are characteristics of our platform business model that benefit gross margins. A higher software mix in our network security business, helps contribute to a higher gross margin, something we saw in fiscal year '23. On the cloud delivered side, most notably in SASE, and Cortex, we've aligned with public service, providers to enable us to instantly leverage their scale, and delivery capability as well as take advantage of their ongoing innovations and efficiencies. As we grow, we see improvements in our unit economics. Lastly, in customer support, with multiple scale products in each of our platforms and common customer support needs, we see leverage within our platforms and across the company. Above and beyond these platform benefits, as we talked about earlier in fiscal year '23, we accelerated some efficiency initiatives that contributed to higher gross margins. We also saw a normalization of the supply chain during fiscal year '23. Starting in in '23, we have increased our investments around generative AI to leverage this technology in customer support for efficiency, and better medium term customer outcomes. While we see these platform leverage, and efficiency opportunities in gross margins, we also leave room to invest in new cloud-based offerings, which generally have subscale gross margins in their initial phases. For this reason, we expect to relatively steady gross margin in fiscal year '26 as compared to fiscal year '23. Moving on to operating expenses. We see similar benefits from being a platform company across our major functional areas. At the top of this list is the sales productivity improvements already discussed. It's important to reinforce my point around the platform benefits in R&D. We choose to redeploy those resources to ensure we are leaning into innovation instead of driving overall financial leverage in R&D. Our fiscal year '23 focus on accelerated efficiency did yield benefits in terms of leverage and OpEx, and we expect to continue many of these initiatives. One to highlight is the consolidation of sales specialists. Similar to customer support, we also have generative AI initiatives to both improve outcomes across sales and marketing and our G&A functions that we expect will contribute to efficiency in fiscal year '24 and beyond. Translating this to operating margins, while some may see a 500 basis point improvement in one year as a milestone achievement from our 2021 Analyst Day, we simply see - this as a new beginning as we see many opportunities to drive this higher. We look for non-GAAP operating margins in the range of 28% to 29% in fiscal year '26, with a long-term opportunity for those to be in the low to mid-30s as we further scale our platforms, and gain confidence in the power of AI, and other business transformations. We're also committed to growing non-GAAP EPS on a compounded rate greater than 20% from fiscal year '23 to '26. Moving on to cash flow. We call that in fiscal year '21, we guided to 33% free cash flow margins. In front of that guidance, we spent considerable effort looking at our entire business end-to-end from the point of view of cash flow, and understanding all the drivers. We have now had two years' operating in this manner. We're confident we can sustain our high cash conversion, focusing on areas such as best-in-class working capital management, and low CapEx, business models. Our top line growth and underlying improvement in operating margin form the foundation of our strong cash generation. There are other factors impacting cash flow, that I want to highlight, and that we have already included in our forward-looking guidance. First, with a rising cost of money, we have seen more customers asking for deferred payments over the last three years, but especially in the last 12 months. As we previously talked about. Also, our rising GAAP profitability and some changes in U.S. tax law, we see rising tax - cash taxes. This has all been included in our forward-looking guidance. I want it to double click on the impact of deferred payments for a moment. We've already seen this have a significant effect on our cash flow. In the second half of fiscal year '20, along with the pandemic, we launched Palo Alto Networks Financial Services, or PANFS, to ease customers' challenges with short-term cash flow issues. As I mentioned, with a rising cost of money in the last year, we have seen this trend broaden. PANFS and deferred payments allow us to drive success partnering with our customers on long-term transformation of their security architectures while working with their cash flow constraints. The amount of bookings with deferred payments was up 4x in the fourth quarter as compared to three years ago. This impacted our reported cash flow in the last three years, yet we have maintained our strong cash generation. As we look to the next three years, we expect this impact to continue, and have accounted for this in our medium term targets. A byproduct of - the rise in deferred payments is greater predictability of our cash flow over time. For example, we now expect about a $1 billion in cash flow from deals entered into in prior years, where payments will now come in fiscal year '24. This $1 billion is twice what it was in contribution to our fiscal year '23 cash flow when we entered the year. Summarizing cash flow, I'm confident we can maintain a baseline of 37% free cash flow margins over the next three years after accounting for the factors I noted. This and the revenue growth targets, I covered should keep us on the aspirational path to Rule of 60 economics in our business. This combination of top line and cash generation puts us in a rare peer group, and allows us the flexibility to navigate the changing environment. Finally, I'll cover the capital structure as the last tenant in TSR. With all the opportunities ahead of us, organic investment in our business to drive growth will remain our number one priority. We have ample cash generation to make these investments. From here, we have three capital allocation priorities. As we've done previously, we will continue to balance these. Our first capital allocation priority is our M&A strategy. We have successfully acquired companies that are early leaders in adjacent, and emerging cybersecurity markets. Many times, these are markets in which, we've had an early organic effort, but we see external innovation that can significantly accelerate our time to market. We target companies - that have achieved product market fit, with teams that can accelerate their innovation inside Palo Alto Networks. Revenue is not a focus for us, but we do ensure that we have a solid plan to accelerate, the trajectory of our business. We've used $2.5 billion in cash over the last five years, pursuing the strategy successfully. Secondly, we manage a capital structure that gives us flexibility. For example, we use our balance sheet as a competitive advantage with PANFS, and deferred payments. We repaid our 2023 convertible debt in July, and have a have another convert coming due in about two years, which we also plan to settle for cash. Beyond enabling reasonable flexibility in our capital structure, we are also focused on minimizing dilution and reducing our organic stock-based compensation expense as a percent of revenue, by at least 300 basis points over the next three years. Lastly, we will use share buybacks opportunistically, something that you have seen from us over the last five years, as we have repurchased nearly $4 billion cumulatively. In concluding my section on bringing it altogether, I wanted to bring together the financial targets I've covered. As Nikesh mentioned at the outset, we're focused on an evergreen innovation led approach that will continue to fuel our transformation into a software, and AI driven cybersecurity company. I am more excited than ever about our growth prospects over the next several years and our plans to continue to do this profitably, benefiting from our platform business model. I hope my excitement comes through today, and you can clearly see that drives our confidence in these targets from the various presentation. With that, we'll now transition to taking your questions. And I will hand the call back to Walter to manage this. Walter?
Walter Pritchard: We'll now take questions on the entire program. We're going to start first with Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley and go next to Andrew Nowinski from Wells Fargo. Hamza, please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Apologies. Can you guys hear me? Hi [indiscernible] dialing in for Hamza. Thank you guys so much for taking my question today and really congrats on the great quarter. You did mention that, you know, AI is a very large opportunity for the company going forward. And I know that you broke down, some of the gross margins as well as, potential operating margins impact, but could you just, let us know how we should think about the company's investment for AI going forward? Are there any upfront CapEx, or margin that that we should consider a little bit more. Thank you so much.
Nikesh Arora: Hi. Yes. Thank you very much for your question. Like, it's early days in AI, as I mentioned on the precision AI side, we have been using it. We have been using it across our products. There's no incremental costs. So it's embedded in our current product development capabilities. On the generative AI side, I say you saw a sneak peek of all the copilots. The good news is all of those things, should generate positive outcomes for us either in terms of incremental modules that customers would like to buy, to enable certain functionality, or possibly reduce costs from our capabilities, to deliver much superior customer support. So, I think at this point in time, I would not in baking any incremental sort of spend expectations in our forecast, as it relates to the implementation of AI. Dipak has given you guidance that we can continue to see operating leverage, and operating margin, clearly some of that is driven by expectations in AI, but I'd say we're being normal about it. We're not overtly aggressive nor are we overtly conservative around it. And hopefully, there'll be upside in that, if and when we start to see the fruits of deploying it effectively across Palo Alto Networks.
Walter Pritchard: Thank you. Next we're going go to Andrew Nowinski from Wells Fargo with Brian Essex from JPMorgan after that. Go ahead, Andrew.
Andrew Nowinski: Thanks, Walter. And congrats on a nice quarter as well. So I wanted to ask about Zero Trust that's clearly a top priority - and really, it seems like it's the only architecture that's capable of stopping a sophisticated attack. And you showed how it requires hardware, software, and SASE components. So, if we think about Zero Trust demand continuing to ramp going forward, why would, firewall demand drop? I think you said the 10% of total revenue in fiscal '26, if it's such a critical component of the of your Zero Trust offering?
Nikesh Arora: It's important to understand. We didn't say it will drop 10% of revenue. Everything else is growing really fast. I think it's important to understand, like, it's not growing as fast as everything else. Look, for the last five years, I've always been asked that hardware question. I've been trying to avoid it for five years unsuccessfully. So thanks again, Andrew, only took one question to get to it. I think it's important to understand, as we started moving to the cloud, people started coming to notion of software firewalls. And then with this whole pandemic thing, remote work, and sort of distributed network became a real thing. So what you're seeing is, that there are different form factors, which are really good in different circumstances. Against the public cloud, you put a software firewall, you use VMs in various scenarios, when throughput becomes really important hardware is still the best option. And I don't think the whole world is going to end up only in the public cloud. By the way, we also sell firewalls to the cloud provider believe it or not, they need firewalls in their data centers, because eventually the public cloud also runs in our data center. So, I think in that context, the demand for hardware is not going to go away. I think what Anand showed you beautifully that you're going to end up with all the form factors at most of our customers. And the key is these things need to work better together. I think if you go today, there are many customers who have a Palo Alto firewall and a firewall from another vendor. Now if we can give them SASE, we can give them software firewalls. There is no reason that they should be on two hardware vendors when they are a single software vendor, and a single SASE vendor. So, I think the point we want to highlight here is, there is a further consolidation opportunity in the firewall space driven by the Zero Trust needs as well as the UI that Anand gave you a sneak peek into. So, I think that's the way to think about it. We like hardware. It's great.
Andrew Nowinski: Thanks.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks, Andy. Next question is from Brian Essex at JPMorgan followed by - Jonathan Ho at William Blair. Go ahead, Brian.
Brian Essex: Great. Thank you, Walter. And thanks for taking the question. And Nikesh, thank you for making this a better Friday night than some of those conspiracy theories floating around implied?
Nikesh Arora: We have 5,500 dialed in, Brian. That makes up, like, the last six earnings calls we've had. So I don't know maybe there's bear here.
Brian Essex: Yes, so I just want to touch on the security copilot, Prisma Cloud copilot XSIAM I would imagine these work best with your platform products, but to what extent will you partner with other vendors? How do you incentivize the use of how Alto's platform with these products in mind. And will we get metrics to help us assess any improvement attach rate with these, copilots and AI tools may drive and when we might expect general availability, I know that's a lot of, but not one topic?
Nikesh Arora: Yes. Let me tell you. I think that we've all heard of this concept called hallucination or the idea that it doesn't give you the perfect answer all the time, right.
Brian Essex: Yes.
Nikesh Arora: And I'd say we are working really hard to see how do, we reduce the error rate in the answers that the copilot comes up with, because in security, we can't afford wrong answers. So, I think our teams are working really hard. What we've discovered in the process, is that irrespective of which LLM you deploy, you need better knowledge articles, you need better integration of the UI. So our teams are busy doing a lot of non-regrettable work. And you saw them give you some sort of glimpses into what the art of the possible could be. I would say sometime before the end of the year, we will start testing it with a bunch of customers to get real feedback from customers, I think the best way to think about it is, like, the examples you saw, it's like security is complicated. UI and security is also complicated. If you don't know where to look, sometimes it's right there. You just don't know where to look. If you can ask that question, and give you the answer that improves the productivity of all of our customers. It, improves the configuration capability of all of our customers. It improves our ability to provide real time customer support to our customer setting. There's lots of advantages if done, right? And I say it's always like, people often, overestimate the short-term and underestimate the long-term. That's why we give you a three-year forecast. I think it may, we may get the three-month or six-month wrong, or we'll not get the three or five-year wrong. Three to five years from now, the world will be different. UI will be 50% natural language. We'll be generating tons of efficiency from people using AI driven tools. I think that's the opportunity. And you don't get there if you don't work hard now.
Brian Essex: Fair enough. Thank you very much.
Walter Pritchard: Thanks, Brian. Next is Jonathan Ho from William Blair. And after that, we're going to have Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, Jonathan.
Jonathan Ho: Thank you. And let me echo my congratulations as well. Just in terms of your comments around reducing vendor sprawl and platform consolidation, this has been a significant goal for the industry for some time. So why do you think it will be different this time? And how can you sort of sustain innovation across such a large set of products? Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: So, Jonathan, I think, you saw, I think Dipak, Lee, myself, all of us have made this point, so did BJ around the fact that without innovation, we're out we're out of the game. We launched 74 different capabilities last year. And so, we'll probably do more next year than 74. But I think what's interesting, what you're seeing is these 74, many of these are existing point products in the industry, which we're re-launching by adapting them to our platforms. And the reason it's going to work this time, Jonathan, because it's working. Well, one of the deals we talked about, the SASE deal with a large professional services organization, we consolidated seven vendors, right? Our XSIAM deals, which totaled $200 million consolidate on average three to seven vendors in the SOC. So it's working. Now the question is, I'm already in the SOC. I've consolidated seven. I go to my customers running to them and saying, listen. You got these other five things hanging around. Look, I've got these five new modules in XSIAM. Why do you want to do five new vendors, and solutions which don't talk to each other, right? So I think what we have in opportunities, once it's kind of like, I think you like to call it land and expand. I think we're landing with our platforms. We used to land with SASE. We used to land with firewalls. Now we're going to say, listen. You have a hardware file. You have our SASE it looks beautiful UI. It brings it altogether when you clean up the rest of the infrastructure. I think it's an evolution in the industry. I think, five years ago as an idea, we're seeing it actually happen. You're seeing us put distance between ourselves and single product vendors in many categories, because people are seeing the power of the platform. That's just the opportunity. And that's something BJ, Lee, Dipak, me and the gang have to execute on, and it's just relentless execution that's needed.
Lee Klarich: Jonathan, I'd like to add this to create my service. One is prior attempts to do this generally required a tradeoff for the customer. It was the capabilities that were delivered on their attempts to do a platform where not industry leading. And so, the customer had to make a tradeoff between, worse capabilities, but in one place, or best-in-class capabilities, and that's a hard trade off in cybersecurity. That is one thing that we're not asking our customers to do. We're making sure that everything we do is industry leading on its own. The second thing we're doing is making sure that when we integrate it, they're actually integrated together in solving hard problems that can't be solved as standalone capabilities. So, we're it's not just about consolidation, although that's a clear value. It's about delivering technical, outcomes through the integration that cannot be achieved otherwise.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thank you, Jonathan. Next, we're going to go to Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs. And after that, Roger Boyd from UBS. Go ahead, Gabriela, with your question.
Gabriela Borges: Good afternoon. Thank you. My question is for BJ on the go-to-market, and I'm looking to understand to what extent NGS cross sell is or isn't still tied to the file of refresh cycle? And as you think about the conversations you're having with customer and platformization, I'm curious to what extent Microsoft is coming up in those conversations as a potential security platform, and how you help customers think through the advantages of standardizing on Palo Alto Networks instead of potentially Microsoft at some point in the future with security?
BJ Jenkins: Good question. Look, I think all of this starts with what Lee ended with is, we get to sell I think the best products in the industry, and we deliver better customer outcomes. We have three primary consolidation motions. One has been around, network security services on the firewall, but also in the SASE. And actually, we have within that now, we've landed customers with SASE, and are going back, and getting the network firewall business. So our core reps, tend to focus on that. They are - the account owner - and represent the whole portfolio. The second motion is, we talked about, code-to-cloud, and we usually land with workload protect or posture management, and then branch out into other modules off of that to either shift left or get a complete platform for the customer on cloud security. With Cortex, we have three outstanding solutions that we land with. We either win with XDR, for customer focused on automation. XSOAR is a great starting place for us, attack surface management with Expanse. And, many of our first wins with XSIAM have been leveraging that installed base, to deliver a full SOC transformation. Again, on the surprising side, though, many of our XSIAM wins, we also didn't have an installed base in Cortex and the customer jumped completely in. We have specialists in those areas in both code-to-cloud and in Cortex. And so, the core team works with those specialists, to run those consolidation plays also.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks. Next question is going to come from Roger Boyd at UBS, followed by Patrick Colville from Scotiabank. Roger, go ahead with your question.
Roger Boyd: Great. Thanks for the question. And a happy Friday. Nikesh, you mentioned you're now extending the Cortex to the core sales force. I'm wondering how you think about the repeatability of the success you've seen with SASE? I think you mentioned last quarter, 80% pipeline contribution from the core reps within a year of selling that product. But if I think about SASE versus Cortex, and SASE may be benefiting by being a little closer to the core network operation function that's buying firewalls, how do you think about that as a challenge with the core upselling Cortex? Any thoughts there would be great? Thanks.
Nikesh Arora: Look, the whole idea originally was to have sales specialists because we were in the early stages of our products. We're trying to build them out. We had lots of changes. We want to make sure they were trained and available as extra resources. Now think about it, we did a $44 million XSIAM deal. Everybody was involved. The core rep wasn't going to let that deal go. That's a lot of money of commission for the core rep if he or she can understand XSIAM. So I'll tell you, BJ and I are going to have this wonderful sales conference starting Sunday. I promise you, every one of those guys will be lined up for the XSIAM session, because they want to learn more about it because, see, this deal size, deal size is equal to dollars for the company equal dollars for the salesperson. And they're all very smart people. So, they're going to go gravitate towards where the real business is. So, I think when you can get salespeople to lean in to learn something, it creates a great outcome. And also, guess what, I mean it's not like people suddenly woke up yesterday and became Cortex specialist. They used to sell cybersecurity before. They just did a good job of embracing and getting trained. So our products are at a point where we believe they are mature. We understand the differentiation of the market. There is reputation out there in the market. We have people in the back who can stand up POCs. I think we can do this. I think we showed that with SASE we can do this, and we can do this with Cortex. The cloud thing is slightly different. Cloud is still early in the customer and from an adoption perspective. It's a consumptive model. It's an ACV ARR model. So that it lends itself to a slightly different sales motion and there, we're not going to be in a hurry to merge that. But I think from a Cortex perspective, it's not just merging the team. It's opening up the floodgates for 3,000 people to sell it. That's the way we think about it.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thank you, Roger. Next question from Patrick Colville at Scotiabank followed by Michael Turits at KeyBanc. Go ahead, Patrick. Patrick, are you on? All right. We're going to go to Michael Turits at KeyBanc and will be followed by Tal Liani at Bank of America. Go ahead, Michael.
Michael Turits: Hi, guys. Good evening. And just a sort of question for Dipak. So you have the 10% bogey for out there for hardware in the out year. How do we think about product, which is a broader category at this point, both in terms of how that ramps over the years? And what other products or categories might fall into that? SD-WAN has been in there, portions of the M-Series. So how should we think about that line in a dynamic way?
Dipak Golechha: So I think, obviously, we've got the technical side of Watson products. There's VMs, there's SD-WAN. There's all of those different things that are in there. I think a lot of it will depend on like what customers want in terms of their network security architecture. We believe that the software side of the product continues to grow faster. We've been talking about that a lot. I think last quarter, we talked about, how 30% of product revenue was software. But honestly, we're not guiding to product anymore. And I think, the reason for that is, because it's not as relevant, right…?
Nikesh Arora: I think, Michael, one of the things that, I think, we should tell you is that we're in the process of reexamining how to classify the revenue to make it much more easier for you guys to think about it, because product was the artifact of hardware. It comes from - in 1919 or 1930.
Dipak Golechha: 1970, yes.
Nikesh Arora: SEC - 1970, thank you. FASB requirement that has to be physically tangible. And I think with the emergence of SaaS companies, it's become sort of hard to do that. So, I think we're going to take a look at that, and I didn't want to do it on a Friday night, and to add one more exciting thing you guys have to think about. So as the year progresses, we'll find a better way of letting you think about our revenue, which is more measurable, more trackable and possibly more predictable for you guys. But yes, this is like a product we have to [indiscernible] percent of product that's not hardware every time to tell you how to split that between hardware and software. I think it suffice us to say, we're looking at it as a business across the board. We look at RPO, we look at revenue, obviously. We look at margin. We look at free cash flow, which our numbers we're guiding to. And that's what we manage on a sort of day-to-day basis to run the business.
Michael Turits: Just in case, Dipak, you weren't thinking about our workload, we do appreciate not having to rebuild the model tonight. Thanks, Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora: I was hoping one of you guys was going to show up with a glass of wine, at least, but...
Michael Turits: I got on my T-shirt and this as close as I'm going to get.
Nikesh Arora: All right. That's good.
Walter Pritchard: All right. Thanks, Michael, for your question. We're actually going to go back to Patrick Colville, who I understand is now connected from Scotiabank, and then we'll go to Tal Liani from Bank of America. Patrick, go ahead.
Patrick Colville: Yes. Thanks, Walter. I never thought I was going to hear The Cure and Friday I'm in Love on an earnings call. So a really quality way to start a Friday evening. Dipak, another one for you. I mean you've shared lots of like juicy metrics with us. The standout metric, to me at least, was Palo Alto guiding to, was it 17% to 19% billings CAGR to fiscal '26. I mean, clearly, implicit in that is the firm's consolidation message you see resonating with customers, which we see as well. But what I wanted to ask is in that billings target, you mentioned your M&A philosophy, but I just want to double click. Does that billings target need a steady stream of tuck-in acquisitions to hit it? And then also would Palo Alto ever do a transformative deal? I mean what would kind of change your mind there to do a transformative deal?
Nikesh Arora: Let me start with the second question first. If you don't think we've transformed the company in the last five years, I don't know, man. I don't know what else to do to make you happy, okay? I'm sorry. It's Friday night, I'm going home. So I think we've been doing transformative for the last five years, and what we've shown you is transformative in itself. And I'm just, in part, just - I don't - look, you don't need me to buy businesses for you. You guys, you're shareholders, you're smart, you can do it yourself. Unless there's a huge leverage that we can prove that something we can take 1 plus 1 and make that two, possibly 2.5 for you guys, it's not sensible for us to do it. And so far, we looked at everything in the world. We look at everything every day. We see what - how things operate. So far, we haven't felt compelled because we have a lot of work to do ourselves. I mean if we've been busy integrating a transformative acquisition, we'll miss the next 5 trends because we're busy. So that's how we think about it. It gives you some insight on how we think about it. As it relates to tuck-in acquisitions, I think the better way to see if it goes back to what I said. Look, there are technologies out there that other people are working on. But we are not the only security company in the world. We're not working on everything. And if something becomes relevant, something becomes an important feature that we think is needed by our customers, and we haven't been working on it, it behooves us to go out and partner or acquire, which is what I said. So should you expect us to maintain a rhythm around how we acquire companies? Yes. But you should understand, we have a five-year track record of doing that responsibility, doing it judiciously, doing it in a way that we integrate the acquisition, doing it in a way that would generate more ARR. And pretty much most of the ones we bought in the last five years have really not contributed on day 1 to the ARR or revenue because they've been mostly tech acquisitions. So I think that's the way to think about it, if that helps.
Walter Pritchard: Next question from Tal Liani at Bank of America, followed by Joe Gallo at Jefferies. Tal, go ahead with your question.
Tal Liani: I want to ask about the synergy between the various components of next-generation security. When you talk about Prisma Cloud and Prisma Access and Cortex and even firewalls, talk about the synergy to a customer. Are these the same customers that they have benefits of buying multiple solutions from you? Or are you addressing conceptually different customers with different products and kind of addressing the entire market?
Nikesh Arora: Tal, you get the question of the evening award. In the last 5 years, we went out and we used our various products to do the land. We sold SASE where it was needed. We sold hardware firewalls where it's needed. We sold software firewalls where it was needed. 1,700 of our customers in some way, shape or form, have all of these things. I think the next step in our evolution is going back to them and saying, listen, you have the hardware firewalls. It works way better with SASE. You want to integrate this across as a network security platform? That's where we have to show value. And you started to see glimpses of that what I ensure you. Cloud XDR is a combination of endpoint and firewall data. That has been now expanded to all the data that you have in XSIAM across your entire state. So now you're - we're offering capabilities that Splunk has. We're offering capability that QRadar has, we're offering capability that Chronicle and Sentinel have in XSIAM, right? So we're doing that. To your question, you should expect us to say, listen, you have XSIAM, if you had Prisma Cloud, it will work a lot better. If you have the XDR, the Prisma Cloud host protection and XDR host protection should work a lot better. So you'll start to see us selectively start to create -- demonstrate value across our platforms. So it's a great question, I think. But it needs to -- customers need to be evolved to that because everybody has a bunch of products out there and not everybody is lined up with the same day for end of life. So I think you're right, you could see more of that from us in the next 3 to 5 years.
BJ Jenkins: I'd just add one thing. For many of the large deals that you saw in the presentation, it's not just looked at as a solution acquisition cost. We put together for that customer not only the solution acquisition costs and the better security outcome you get, we talk about their operating costs, how they have to train their people, how many people do they need to operate these solutions in the environment and the savings they get. So that when they go to justify an 8-figure deal with their CFO, they're talking about reducing capital and operating costs with better security outcomes. And I think Lee hit on this in his earlier answer. There hasn't been a company that's really been able to do that before in this industry. And when you combine those two, I think it's what's helped us in a tough economic environment to continue to close larger and larger deals with those customers.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thank you. Next up, we have Joe Gallo from Jefferies. And our final question will come from Adam Borg at Stifel. Go ahead, Joe.
Joe Gallo: And great results, and I appreciate the long-term framework. Just wanted to drill into the visibility into fiscal '24 guidance. You guys just stood up 18% billings growth, which is incredible on a 44% comp. I imagine that had some backlog benefit, though. Now you're guiding to an acceleration in billings next year relative to 4Q which, as an opening guide, we would presume to be conservative. So what underpins the confidence in that, especially as you have hardware and duration headwinds?
Nikesh Arora: So first of all, Joe, you did a great job on CNBC today navigating the questions about our stock. So thank you very much. On your question, look, we have conviction in some of the platforms, like let's start with our favorite one today. It's like XSIAM came out of left field. It did $200 million for us. Even we - would have been happy at $100 million for our fiscal year. It came in at $200 million. So part of what you're seeing is that there are some products where we have tailwinds. And I think the part we're sort of normalizing for is the - not normalizing for, the part we sort of we said to you, the part that we're careful about is the hardware normalization, which we've been anticipating. We're always positively surprised every quarter, and it finally came home in spades in Q4. So I think the forecast we have is what we represent to our Board. That's what we're saying we're going to go do. That's what we're telling you. Now are we going to try and work hard to go beat it? Yes, of course, that's what we do every time. There's lots of puts and takes. So based on the puts and takes, based on where we are in different products based on what plans we have to launch different things, this is our best estimate as of now. And we're trying to give it our best to go out and deliver it. I think that's the best way to describe how you think about our numbers. Yes, of course, it's hardware headwinds. There's SASE tailwinds. I don't know if you saw, we became the only vendor in SASE far right in a single vendor, sort of SD-WAN plus SSE. So there's some good tailwinds we have. Customers pay attention to these kinds of things.
Walter Pritchard: All right. Our last question from Adam Borg at Stifel. Go ahead, Adam.
Adam Borg: Awesome. Maybe just for Nikesh or BJ, just on the federal vertical talk of some large deals in the quarter. Maybe just talk about the opportunity that you're seeing, especially as we head into the fiscal year-end for the government next quarter?
BJ Jenkins: Yes. I think to Nikesh's credit, even before I came on board, there was a large investment in our federal team. And the knowledge that with many of the federal directives, the budget being put in, and obviously, some of the geopolitical events, it was an opportunity for the company. And so we're seeing the benefits of many of those forward investments, and we're going to continue to invest there. There's obviously large-scale projects that are occurring. We had one last year that we announced was our largest deal of the year. There - those take a long time to mature. And we're involved in many of them. So I feel like we have a great opportunity going forward in that space. There are specific ones obviously out there that we're looking to -- we've got some first orders and then gain momentum with them, and I think we'll be talking more about that in the coming quarters.
Walter Pritchard: All right. Thanks, Adam, for your question. With that, we're going to close it out, and I'm going to pass it back to Nikesh for some closing remarks.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you, Walter. I just want to take the opportunity one more time to thank all of you. I know this was a unique one. Will you be telling your future mentees that you're going to mentor in the analyst community, maybe talking about that one Friday afternoon call which Palo Alto hosted out of their sort of misdirected sense of trying to get you guys to go do this over the weekend for us. So, we really appreciate taking the time. We apologize for taking up some of your Friday. We will be available tomorrow and day after for some of you who've been kind enough to schedule time to talk to us because we want to make sure you get all your questions answered. It would be remiss of me not to both acknowledge and thank our employees, which is what makes all of this happen, and all of our partners out there who help us deliver this capability. And of course, I also want to thank my entire management team for delivering a really, really good FY '23 and what has been a yet another sort of different year. And I don't think I've had a normal year in the last five years between the pandemic and supply chain and inflation and money and this. So I look forward to possibly a normal year next year. And again, once again, thank you very, very much for all your support and your indulgence.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-05-23 16:30:00) =====
Walter Pritchard: [Starts Abruptly] 23, 2023, at 1:30 PM Pacific Time. With me on today's call are Nikesh Arora, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dipak Golechha; our Chief Financial Officer. Following the prepared remarks, our Chief Product Officer, Lee Klarich will join us in the Q&A session. You can find the press release and other information to supplement today's discussion on our website at investors.paloaltonetworks.com, while there, please click on the link for Events and Presentations where you will find the investor presentation and supplemental information. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections regarding the company's business operations and financial performance. These statements made today are subject to risks and uncertainties. We assume no obligation to update them. Please review the press release and our recent SEC filings to see these risks and uncertainties. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations are in the press release and the appendix of the investor presentation. Unless specifically noted otherwise, all results and comparisons are on a fiscal year-over-year basis. We also note that management is participating at the Bank of America Global Technology Conference on June 6th. I will now turn the call over to Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you for joining us. Thank you, Walter. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our earnings call. As you can see, once again our teams have delivered a balanced quarter between our top and bottom-line performance in the current macroeconomic environment. In Q3, our billings grew 26% year-over-year and revenue grew 24%, while RPO grew ahead of these at 35%. Our Q3 non-GAAP operating income and our trailing 12-month adjusted free cash flow, both grew about 60% year-over-year, while we achieved our fourth consecutive quarter of profitability on a GAAP basis. Let's talk about the macroenvironment. The overall macro trends of cautious spending, deal scrutiny, and cost and value consciousness persist. Moreover, the behavior continues to be more widespread across a larger swath of our customers. Against this backdrop, we have been staying ahead with rigorous execution. We've increased our own deal scrutiny, gotten ahead of the challenges, and continue to sharpen our business value focus while demonstrating superior security outcomes to our customers. From a technology trend perspective, there is no significant change. The teams we have seen around cloud adoption, automation, and hybrid work continue with minor variations. Network transformations, albeit with long cycles continue to be undertaken because they offer cost-savings and are part of the modernization stack for most customers as they go down their cloud and network transformation journeys. This in turn continues to drive a sustained demand for SASE and hardware and software firewalls. As we have shared before, the theme of consolidating around platforms continues to come up and we are well-positioned to offer solutions in this regard. Needless to say, in the last three months, ChatGPT and Generative AI have revived the interest in AI as a technology. As we have always maintained, AI is a data problem and security is a data problem and has an interesting -- AI has an interesting role to play in security, both for its ability to help deliver superior security outcomes in near real-time and unfortunately the potential threat associated with AI being used to generate attacks. We have and continue to work on these problems, we should talk more about this today. On the other hand, we continue to see limiting -- limited underlying growth in hardware in the industry whilst the supply chain crisis and its effects are all but over, there is a shift that the crisis created. We have seen a higher appetite for software-based solutions and networking and higher appetite for cloud delivered form factors. This is particularly salient to the current CapEx-constrained environment. On the adversary front, there seems to be no impending recession and threats, increased cloud activity and connectivity continues to drive the threat environment. This is best illustrated by recent findings in the seventh installment of our Unit 42 Cloud Threat Report. It still takes the average security team approximately six days to resolve a security alert. In contrast, it only takes a threat actor a few hours to exploit a newly discovered vulnerability. While over 7,000 malicious versions of open-source software packages were circulated in 2022, less than a quarter of those packages are sourced properly to ensure a clean software version is incorporated into a typical customer's code base. Regulatory interest continues to rise and is prevalent across multiple governments. There's sustained activity around incremental regulatory mandates and executive orders to create awareness around cybersecurity. This is true not only at the government level but also as company's Board of Directors are bringing additional oversight and drive an alignment of accountability for cybersecurity. This requires incremental organizational focus and investment by our customers. On the macro front, customers anticipate that global growth may slow. Some are grappling with rising capital costs and are watching their bottom lines more closely. This means looking for efficiencies in their business. Within cyber security, complex architectures, and long vendor rosters have come into focus, and many customers see this as an opportunity to simplify and drive consolidation. Five years ago, when I highlighted the need for platform architectures and consolidation, the idea was met with some resistance. But over the last few years, our industry-leading solutions three-platform approach has continued to take hold and has allowed us to provide a much-needed option for simplicity, a modern stack, and better security outcome for our customers. I mentioned earlier that our customers are engaging in more scrutiny of deals and value resulting in robust discussions internally and with us. We continue to work hard to stay ahead of deal cycles engaging the CFO and procurement departments. The cost of money continues to become a topic of conversation as customers enter into larger and longer-term relationships with us, some also seek more flexible business terms. A strong balance sheet allows us to accommodate customers, while we maximize our medium-term cash flow. Let's turn to efficiency and operations. As we started this fiscal year, we pivoted our efforts and focused our efforts in doing more with less. Our teams responded effectively. Coupled with the waning of the supply chain crisis, we have been able to adapt our operating model significantly. Dipak will get into specifics, but it's suffice is to say, we have found a new rhythm, and at our scale we believe we can continue to drive better margins for our business. We have achieved this through selective hiring in our customer-facing teams as well as streamlining our go-to-market efforts in addition to hiring for key innovation areas, which we expect to continue to do. These efforts are self-evident in our higher Q3 operating margins and our increased operating and free cash flow margin guidance for the year. We continue to see platformization in cybersecurity. I talked about consolidation earlier. A key part of our thesis at Palo Alto Networks has always been to drive superior cybersecurity outcomes for our customers. Due to that, we need a robust portfolio that works both individually and cohesively to reduce the burden on our customers who have to stitch together disparate cybersecurity products. We've had to navigate this fine line with our customers. We continue to see the benefits of this approach and think we are in a multi-year trend. We have the opportunity to do the security what we have seen done in financial software, HR software, or CRM where customers have adapted to platforms due to the inherently superior benefits from data integrity, integration, seamlessness, and outcome orientation. As they say, the proof is in the pudding. You can see our success here driving larger platform transactions. Across the board, the size of the transactions we are signing is increasing. This is evidenced by booking from transactions valued at over $1 million, $5 million, and $10 million in third quarter, which are up by year-over-year by 29%, 62%, and 136% respectively. We see a similar trend in cohorts of our customers. For example, when we look at the average lifetime value for our 200 largest customers, we've seen steady growth of 30% plus over the last three years. When we look at purchases of our platforms amongst the Global 2000, we see now that 53% of our customers have bought a product in all three platforms of Strata, Prisma, and Cortex, up from 48% a year ago and 33% three years ago. We see this as a continuing trend. It convinces us that the opportunity to impact outcomes for our customers is large if we can get this right. We see the paths to continued success with large customers and multiproduct expansion around installed base. I'll now update you on our three platforms starting with network security. We are the comprehensive Zero Trust Network Security Company. This quarter, we were proud to be named a new leader in Gartner's most recent Security Service Edge Magic Quadrant. This recognition is apt as our teams have been delivering significant innovation and seeing stronger customer adoption in SASE for years. This in addition to our leadership position in SD-WAN, makes us the only SASE vendor in the industry to be named a leader in the Gartner SSE and SD-WAN Magic Quadrants. Add to that, our leadership position in network firewalls and our number one market share position in virtual firewalls, we are the only vendor with clear leadership across Zero Trust Network Security. This leadership across our network security category is a testament to our ability to drive significant innovation in new markets while maintaining our leadership in core markets and offering this innovation as part of our cohesive platforms. Let's talk about SASE. SASE remains one of the fastest-growing markets within all of cybersecurity. Our ARR is growing over 50%. At scale, we have surpassed 4,200 customers in Q3. Our success has spread across all three major geographies, as highlighted by large deals in each of these territories in Q3. Let me tell you about three of these notable wins. First, a global beverage company with US headquarters signed a transaction north of $30 million, which includes $24 million of SASE for a complete SASE transformation that included Prisma Access, Prisma SD-WAN, and our ADEM, or Autonomous Digital Experience Management for tens of thousands of employees. Second, a Japan-based technology company signed an eight-figure transaction to modernize its network and its network security after an extensive POC. Before standardizing on our SASE, the customer replaced its legacy firewalls and other network security capabilities, and standardized on our next-generation firewalls, driving a full Zero Trust Network Strategy. Finally, a European technology company signed a high seven-figure SASE deal that was part of an overall transaction to Palo Alto Networks of once again, nearly $30 million in total value the customer bought from us because of our multiple network security form factors. In the broader transaction, we added capabilities such as IoT and fully adopted our core network security subscriptions. You all might remember at the beginning of this fiscal year, as part of our scaling efforts we combined our SASE sales organization into our core sales organization. Drive us here with that we saw SASE demand going mainstream and we saw encouraging signs that our core sellers could sell the more complex SASE offering. After three-quarters of executing as a combined organization, we're delighted to report that over 80% of our core reps participate in the creation of Prisma SASE pipelines as we enter Q4. Q3 was a strong quarter of innovation, highlighted by our AI-powered SASE launch. This flagship releasing capabilities to enable organizations to automate their increasingly complex IT and network operation center functions with AIOps. They need to improve monitoring for Networks and Apps in the branch office and significantly improves integration with IoT Security. Moving over to our firewall business. Broader than SASE, the future of network security is clear to us. It is centered around software. And while we have led and expect to continue to lead the hardware appliance market for many years, software and cloud deliver form factors have been an increasing focus since I joined as CEO. There are multiple reasons why the shift to software is accelerating. In the changing microenvironment, customers are more challenged in their CapEx budgets, which often fund appliance purchases. As a result, their interest in software and cloud-deliver form factors remain high. This is especially true when tied to strategic initiatives around cloud adoption. Illustrating this, we saw a significant uptick in customer requests to evaluate our virtual firewall offerings at the beginning of the pandemic. Customer interest in VM-Series is also sparked by supply chain challenges where we saw evaluation sustain. We continue to see primarily net new demand for software and cloud deliver form factors, however, we are seeing more appliance replacements and planning for this trend to continue and possibly accelerate. Beyond the strength, I already covered in SASE, we saw VM-Series deals over $1 million more than double in Q3, including an eight-figure deal we signed with a government agency where they moved from a primarily appliance-centric model to VM-Series as they fully leveraged public cloud as their primary infrastructure. This year so far, our VM-Series bookings are up more than 40% year-over-year and it grew over 55% in Q3. Most investors have equated our product revenue with hardware. However, given the drivers I have mentioned here, this has been rapidly shifting. Software now contributes 30% of our product revenue. This is up from about 10% three years ago. We expect this trend to continue and as Dipak would remind you, bookings from our VM-Series and SASE transactions are recognized as revenue, more over time than on appliance booking. Given the conversation about AI, as I mentioned, there is a renaissance in artificial intelligence driven by significant advances in large language models. The development of more powerful and efficient computing with the broad availability of large volumes of training data. As a result, we have all seen some of the fastest innovation cycles and launches of unique applications over the last several months. At Palo Alto Networks, we have been focused on this technology for many years and our efforts have been accelerating over the last two years. We first introduced machine-learning capabilities as part of our WildFire Offerings seven years ago. In the ensuing years, we added AI and machine learning capabilities across our network security portfolio and has been a critical driver of our innovation and differentiation of the market. In 2020, we introduced the industry's first machine learning-powered next-generation firewall, where machine learning detection move in line to prevent zero-day attacks. Since then, we have overall nearly all of our security subscriptions with advanced AI capabilities. DNS Security, Advanced URL filtering, Advanced Threat Prevention, and Advanced WildFire, all harness machine learning for in-line detection and prevention of zero-day attacks. This means even new attacks that have never been seen before are blocked at the very first attempt used by an attacker. Additionally, we applied AI to IoT Security to discover identify and secure IoT devices and most recently it was expanded to cover both medical IoT and OT security needs. We had a signature release in SASE that included AI-powered autonomous digital experience management in addition to leveraging the AI IFRSD-RAN as well as AI-powered phishing prevention. In short, we have really been accelerating the application of AI to our network security stack and it's one of the most matured application of AI in the security industry today. We are not only ahead in investments in AI and machine learning as a differentiator in our products, but these investments have driven tangible customer benefits. In a typical day, we analyze nearly 750 million, yes, 750 million new unique telemetry objects worldwide. This includes files, URLs, domains, DNS connections, and other signals. Our AI models analyze this data and every day we see 1.5 million new attacks that have never been seen before. We take these new insights and add them to all [Technical Difficulty] already know about, and we use them to block 8.6 billion attacks across our customer base daily. This forms the foundation of how we do better security across our network security platforms and this is how we continue to get better and better at detecting zero-day attacks and being in a position to actually to prevent those attacks as well. Moving on to Prisma Cloud, our early data in Prisma Cloud continues to strengthen. Most of our competitors continue to provide only point products, while customer demand continues to shift towards the platform approach. Within this connecting the left side to the right side, otherwise known as core to cloud is becoming paramount. As an example of our platform success, we continue to see strong usage of our cloud security posture management, and cloud workload protection offerings. Customers are increasingly standardizing on these foundational modules with 49% of Prisma Cloud customers using both CSP, MNC, and WP. This quarter Gartner noted that in 2022 only 25% of enterprises buy these capabilities from a common vendor. They expect this will increase to 60% of enterprises by 2025. At the same time, we continue to stay ahead of the industry's need for new capabilities, but just core to our commitment to the platform. We are on track to launch our 11th module as we innovate cybersecurity. We're also focused on driving industry certification in Prisma Cloud and just last quarter we were accepted by the Joint Advisory Board and reached ready status for FedRAMP high, a first for our cloud security platform. This comes in addition to other certifications we have achieved including recently announced Prisma Access achieving Impact Level 5 or IL5 Provision Authorization. IL5 is the highest unclassified authorization level for DoD agencies under the FedRAMP process. We continue to see steady growth in consumption of Prisma Cloud credits, which were up 44% year-over-year in Q3. Our platform is key to the steady growth. We continue to see customers increase their consumption as they deploy workloads and strategically leverage the public cloud at the core of their IT and business strategy. This includes migrating workloads to the hyperscale clouds, building new applications in the clouds, and leveraging new cloud services. They're also deploying new Prisma Cloud modules of which we currently have ten. The number of customers using two or more Prisma Cloud modules grew 37% year-over-year, while the number is in four or more modules almost doubled. We now have one in five of our Prisma Cloud customers using our cloud code module across our capabilities, infrastructure is good, SCA or Software Composition Analysis, and sequence management as they leverage the more efficient approach to detect and remediate security issues as core decision for cloud applications before it reaches production. Now moving on to Cortex. This has been a net-new business for Palo Alto Networks, a business which was born in the belief that we need to bring next-generation innovation to the SOC and all the related activities. Just like we have brought firewall business three years ago. We're delighted to announce that Cortex achieves a $1 billion booking milestone in the last 12 months. Cortex was born in 2019 and since then we have focused intensively on ensuring we have industry-leading capabilities across endpoints, SOC automation, and tax surface management. In the last four years, we have risen to a leading player in automation, application of AI, attack surface management continue to climb the charts of the XDR industry as one of the most technically capable solutions. We are particularly proud of the fact that XDR has consistently led in security efficacy, XDR delivered 100% prevention, and 100% detection across 19 evaluation steps conducted by MITRE and has had the highest quality deductions of any product in the latest round of evaluations. On the back of our hardware driving these capabilities we have built Cortex Business to over $1 billion in bookings over last 12 months. As I mentioned, it's up from $150 million in annual bookings when we launched Cortex as the business in 2019. As we look forward, these three core capabilities in Cortex, our precursors to leading the next-generation autonomous security operations center, which pulls this all together, it was launched publicly a few months ago called XSIAM. Our next-generation SOC platform XSIAM built totally on AI is on track to be our fastest-growing new offering. XSIAM represents another significant opportunity within Cortex, as we fulfill our vision around autonomous security operations like network security over a decade ago, security operations have evolved slowly. XSIAM is now paving the way for us to drive AI-driven security transformation outcomes. After our GA launch in late Q1, our design partner has made significant commercial commitments to XSIAM. We followed that up in Q2 by broadening our go-to-market and achieving early success with $30 million in bookings. This quarter, the established momentum for XSIAM, with quarterly bookings more than doubling sequentially as we signed our first eight-figure deal and transactions across all three of our major geographic theaters with this product. We remain optimistic about the prospects of XSIAM for the product at the center of customers' security operation center of transformation. We're seeing XSIAM give us access to a broader swath of our customers' budgets based on what we have achieved this quarter and what we see in the pipeline, we are confident we can achieve our goal of $100 million in bookings faster than we originally anticipated. This will make it one of the fastest-growing security platforms from Palo Alto Networks. Not only does XSIAM bring together the core capabilities of Cortex it also brings AI-driven outcomes to customers. This heads a new approach to security, an outcome-based approach. The inspiration came to us from our own SOC where we were woefully slow in our own meantime remediate five years ago. IMTTR wasn't days, which in today's adversarial environment is unacceptable. With that insight in mind, we were able to collect billions of events, and then using AI, it is down to just over 100 alerts from a handful of incidents from here, continuing to use AI and automation we are able to investigate and respond while detecting incidents in a matter of seconds and responded to high priority ones in under a minute. This is one of the most compelling outcome stories in security. So far in the early customers that are farthest along on the journey with us, we are seeing the benefits accrue in a similar way. We processed over 3.5 petabytes of data a day, across the customer state of XDR and XSIAM. From here, we apply approximately 1,000 AI models to detect the attacks. We then leveraged smart scoring in this automation to accelerate the investigation response. We are seeing early indications that customers are able to see the reductions meantime to respond from days or weeks down to hours or minutes just like we did. Stepping back, we are fortunate to be focused on the part of technology market that is more resilient. Our customers depend on their partnership with us to address challenges that are only becoming more sophisticated. The market is tough and definitely more challenging than when we started the year. I am proud that our team has executed through this environment. Our strategy focused on having industry-leading capabilities helping customers simplify their architectures, and consolidating vendors is working. Given our diverse portfolio of products, some of our products are growing faster in any given quarter and others are moderating. Combined you see this portfolio benefit in the topline results we reported today. We also see significant opportunity as we begin to embed generative AI into our products and workflows. There are three ways that are concerted investment in generative AI will benefit us. First, generative AI will help us improve our core under-the-hood detection and prevention efficacy by further advancing the state-of-the-art AI and ML in our products that I spoke of today. Second, to manifest itself and how our customers engage with our products. We will leverage our large cyber-secured dataset and telemetry to provide a more intuitive and natural language-driven experience within our products, which will improve NPS and drive efficiency benefits for our customers. And finally, as our employees leverage generative AI, it will drive significant efficiency in our own processes and operations across the enterprise. We intend to deploy proprietary Palo Alto Networks security LLM in the coming year and are actively pursuing multiple efforts to realize these three outcomes. Our portfolio approach company's oral scale and focus on efficiency have enabled us to drive significant leverage. We are well ahead of schedule here and we're not done. As we continue to execute our plans, we see additional opportunities for efficiency. With our visibility into incremental leverage, we continue to see the operating profitability levels in our fiscal year 2023 guidance as a baseline to build upon. With that, I will turn the call over to Dipak to discuss the details of Q3 and our guidance.
Dipak Golechha: Thank you, Nikesh, and good afternoon, everyone. For Q3, revenue was $1.72 billion and grew 24%. Product revenue grew 10%, total service revenue grew 29% with subscription revenue of $838 million, growing 31% and support revenue of $495 million, growing 25%. Moving on to geographies, we saw revenue growth across all theaters with the Americas growing 24%, EMEA up 23%, and JPAC growing 24%. The strength of our next-generation security capabilities continues to drive our results. With NGS ARR of $2.6 billion growing 60%. We saw strength across all three platforms, network security, cloud, security, and security operations. We delivered total billings of $2.26 billion, up 26% and above the high end of our guidance range. Total deferred revenue in Q3 was $8.1 billion, an increase of 38%. Remaining performance obligation or RPO was $9.2 billion, increasing 35% with current RPO just under half of our RPO. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was significantly ahead of our guidance, growing 83% year-over-year. We again delivered strong cash flow in Q3 with trailing 12-month adjusted free cash flow of $2.8 billion, growing 68% year-over-year. Moving on to the rest of the financial highlights. Non-GAAP gross margin of 76.1% was up 320 basis points year-over-year, driven mainly by a higher software mix, reduced supply chain costs, and some efficiencies in customer support. Our non-GAAP operating margin of 23.6% increased 540 basis points year-over-year. In addition to improving gross margins, slower headcount additions contributed to our operating leverage. Based on our performance in Q3, we are raising our fiscal year '23 non-GAAP operating margin guidance. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter grew 86% to $359 million or $1.10 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22%, we again delivered GAAP profitability in Q3 with GAAP net income of $108 million or $0.31 per diluted share. Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended Q3 with cash equivalents and investments of $6.7 billion. It is worth reminding investors that our 2023 convertible note will mature on July 1, 2023, and we expect to settle the principal obligation with cash on our balance sheet of $1.7 billion. The excess will be settled in shares. These shares have previously been accounted for in our non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding. Q3 cash flow from operations was $432 million with total adjusted free cash flow of $401 million this quarter. Stock-based compensation declined by 90 basis points as a percentage of revenue sequentially on a year-over-year basis, stock-based compensation was down 220 basis points as a percentage of revenue. As we look forward, we remain focused on profitable growth. At our Analyst Day in 2021, we outlined plans to drive 50 basis points to 100 basis points of margin expansion annually in fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2024. In the months leading up to this profitability commitments, we focus in-depth on optimally balancing investments in our business and opportunities to capture efficiencies and benefit from our growing scale. As a result, we came out of this effort with significant conviction in meaningful operating leverage. In fiscal '22, we started influencing these plans but faced supply chain challenges that unexpectedly drove higher costs. While the supply chain was uncertain as we entered fiscal year 2023, we also saw signs of the changing macroeconomic environment. As such, it was the right time to accelerate our efficiency plans. We focused our headcount additions in sales and R&D to fuel our medium-term growth prospects. Outside of these critical investment areas, we've leveraged our scale and employed technology to accommodate our growth in other business areas. Additionally, supply chain challenges have continued to abate at an increasing pace, helping to improve our gross margins. The result has been a significant acceleration in operating margin expansion through the first three quarters of fiscal year 2023 and also increases to our operating and free cash flow margin guidance through the year. As you see with our guidance for non-GAAP operating margin in fiscal year 2023 were nearly 300 basis points ahead of the midpoint of our fiscal year 2024 range, but we implied back in 2021. We now see our fiscal year 2023 non-GAAP operating margins as a baseline to build on in the future. Moving on to guidance. For the fourth fiscal quarter 2023, we expect billings to be in the range of $3.15 billion to $3.20 billion, an increase of 17% to 19%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.937 billion to $1.967 billion, an increase of 25% to 27%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of 126 to 130, an increase of 58% to 63%. For the fiscal year 2023, we expect billings to be in the range of $9.18 billion to $9.23 billion, an increase of 23% to 24%. We expect NGS ARR to be in the range of $2.80 billion to $2.85 billion, an increase of 48% to 51%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $6.88 billion to $6.91 billion, an increase of 25% to 26%. We expect product revenue growth in the range of 15% to 16% of fiscal year '23 as we see supply chain challenges normalize as we exit fiscal year '22. The fiscal year '23 we expect operating margins to be in the range of 23% to 23.25%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of 4.24 to 4.29, an increase of 69% to 70%. We expect our adjusted free cash flow margins to be 37.5% to 38.5%, and we expect to be GAAP profitable for fiscal year 2023, including in Q4. Additionally, please consider the following modeling points. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 22% for Q4 '23 and fiscal year '23, subject to the outcome of future tax legislation. For Q4 '23, we expect net interest and other income of $50 million to $55 million. We expect Q4 diluted shares outstanding of $326 million to $332 million. We expect fiscal year diluted shares outstanding of $322 million to $324 million and we expect Q4 capital expenditures of $35 million to $40 million. With that, I will turn the call back over to Walter for the Q&A portion of the call.
A - Walter Pritchard: Thank you, Dipak. To allow for broad participation, I would ask that each person ask only one question. Our first question will come from Saket Kalia of Barclays with Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley on deck. Saket, you're muted. All right. Why don't we go to Hamza?
Saket Kalia: Okay. Can you hear me now?
Walter Pritchard: Go ahead.
Saket Kalia: Sorry, I didn't unmute. Thanks so much for taking the question here and a nice job to the team executing in a very challenging environment. Nikesh, maybe a lot of good things to talk about, but I'd love to just double-click on the operating margin improvement here that you've seen and really a new baseline that the team is creating going into next year. Maybe the question is, can you and Dipak maybe talk about what areas the team is -- what areas the team is finding efficiency and what are the opportunities for efficiency maybe going forward as well? Thanks.
Nikesh Arora: Yeah. Look, I’ll preface that as Dipak highlighted, the supply chain crisis is all but over and there were some adverse impacts to gross margins driven by hardware. I think the product mix is in our favor. As we go from hardware to software our gross margins are way better than software than they generally are on hardware given the software firewalls are much, much more profitable for us. Coupled with that, I think what Dipak really has been driving for the last year as we flipped into the new macroeconomic environment has been a real focus on resource utilization, ROI as well as making sure we are focused our hiring only on stuff where it's important. He also talked about streamlining the sales force. If you remember, Saket, we have the conversation around making sure our SASE team has integrated with our core, which saved us hundreds of heads in terms of efficiency as well as driving more outcome and output from a SASE perspective. So generally, those have been some of the key drivers but, Dipak, did you want to add something?
Dipak Golechha: No, I think you covered it all. I think Saket, we've talked this before on cloud. We scale well as a company, right? And I think that's across all the different elements of our P&L. I think Nikesh has talked about the supply chain, he talked about the OpEx, I'll just also mention cloud-hosting and cloud consumption as we get bigger and we can see more, we have the ability to go back to our service providers and trying to negotiate better contract. So I think across all the areas of the P&L, we scale pretty well as a company.
Nikesh Arora: And I think to your question in terms of where this goes, as Dipak said, this is a new baseline. We think there is continued opportunity from here and we haven't even factored in the potential impact of generative AI. As you've been hearing all the conversation in the industry, we're still working on it, we're understanding it, we're really looking at processes, but we believe there is a there, there. We think there will be an opportunity in the future to get more efficiency from generative AI as we go ahead and implement some of the capabilities through our organization. So I think there is upside both in the continued efforts of what Dipak has been driving for the last nine months and there is the sort of the icing on the top is the potential application of generative AI as we continue to grow business over the next few years.
Saket Kalia: Got it.
Dipak Golechha: Thanks, Saket.
Walter Pritchard: Well done. Thank you. The next question is from Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley with Brian Essex from JP Morgan on deck. Hamza, go ahead.
Hamza Fodderwala: Hey, guys. Good evening. I hope you can hear me okay? Maybe a question for Nikesh and Lee Klarich if he is around. Nikesh, on AI you've clearly been thinking about this a lot based on what I can tell from your twitter. But we were at RSA last month, and while there's lot of opportunity around AI there seem to be a lot of risks around data security, around sort of the data that these models are trained on. So I'm curious as you have the AI-based conversations with your customers, how are you getting them comfortable around that to really leverage the full capabilities of AI to automate their SOCs?
Nikesh Arora: Yeah. I think there's two different parts of it. I think, one part is, us using AI already in our products, where we have been using it for a while look at pattern recognition, look at what is telling us from a real-time analysis of data perspective, as I mentioned, we deploy over 1,000 AI models to go look at what happened in XSIAM. This all proprietary is happening. In our instance, this is not an LLM that's going out and getting trained, this is a proprietary AI model used by Palo Alto Networks, built by Palo Alto Networks being used for a specific use case and tasked for security. Now to the extent that we intend and we'll deploy conversational AI in our models, we are working with every public model and open-source model out there to understand how can we build it using our own proprietary data. I don't know Lee, did you want -- can you elaborate on that please?
Lee Klarich: Yes, of course. It's very early in the large language model adoptions that we're seeing. And as you point out, there are a number of risks associated with them, particularly in enterprise use cases. We've already seen some examples where data has fed into large language models without the understanding of how the data will be used and the data has been publicly -- made public available even though it was confidential. So it's very clear that there is sensitivity there. There's also sensitivity from a security perspective of things like prompt injection attacks, data poisoning and things like that, that have to be taken into account. The -- and so I think what we'll see is the enterprise use cases of LLMs will evolve a little bit more -- actually, I should say, need to evolve a little bit more methodically and carefully to take the security challenges into account. At the same time though, it's also important to recognize that they offer tremendous promise, as Nikesh mentioned earlier in terms of being able to help guide product adoption, product usage to help enhance security capabilities and to drive greater efficiencies across the business.
Nikesh Arora: Yeah. I think to cap it off, I think there is no doubt we will continue to deploy our proprietary AI models for XSIAM or for our network security use case as I highlighted. We believe in our preliminary analysis over the last three months and driving a lot of these work streams internally that there is a dare there with generative AI. So we believe that we will be deploying generative AI over the course of the next few months, and we'll talk more about it At a later event. But we think that has an opportunity both to significantly improve our customer efficiency and the efficacy of our products, at the same time, also to drive efficiencies within the way we run Palo Alto Networks. I think last but not the least, which is something you didn't ask, but I'll say, separately, Lee and his team have been working hard to see and look at the adverse impact that generative AI could have in terms of adversaries using Generative AI to build new malware, to try and attack our customers. And there's a lot of work we're doing as well to make sure we are able to protect our customers against any such activity that is conducted using generative AI.
Hamza Fodderwala: Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Thanks for your question, Hamza. Next question is from Brian Essex at JPMorgan, followed by Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank. Brian, go ahead.
Brian Essex: Yeah. Hey, good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. And to follow up on Saket’s comments, nice progression in operating margin here, and it's good to see cash flow margin guidance go up as well. If I could tick down -- if you could maybe peel back a couple of layers on that, core drivers of that cash flow margin improvement, how sustainable it is, we noticed that CapEx looks like it's a little bit lower than you previously guided to. So just wondering, as we kind of look at that as a foundational metric to lean on for valuation, how sustainable is that? As we kind of forecast operating margins going forward, should that I guess, gap between operating margins and cash flow margins remain relatively consistent going forward?
Dipak Golechha: Yeah. So Brian, thanks for the question. Let me just start off with like the biggest driver over the long term is really just to strength in your bookings. At least your billings and then comes down. Then the foundation really is your operating margins that then makes up the base that you can do on your cash. There are multiple other factors, but do recognize that when we came into the year, the interest rates were at a different level. We have had the benefit of higher interest rates. We've deployed a lot of our cash that we earn interest income. We're not predictors of interest rates, but fundamentally, we believe that, that will continue to be a tailwind for our cash generation. And then last but not least, we do have PanFS. We have a certain amount of our business that we do structural and financing. Frankly, that's been broadly in line with what we assumed at the beginning of the year, but those are really the drivers, and we feel pretty comfortable on what we're able to do with those different drivers and delivering on our numbers?
Brian Essex: Great. Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks, Brian. Next question from Brad Zelnick at Deutsche Bank, followed by Andrew Nowinski at Wells Fargo. Go ahead, Brad.
Brad Zelnick: Great. Thanks so much for the question and nice job, both to Nikesh, Dipak and the entire team. Nikesh, my question is about M&A, which I feel like typically comes later in the call, but like it feel like it's such a great opportunity right now. What's the hurdle to doing a large deal and can you remind us how you think about transformative M&A? And just related to that, your competitors naturally knock you on having grown through required innovation. Just to set the record straight, can you talk about how much of a priority and a focus it is to have a deeply integrated product?
Nikesh Arora: Yeah, Brian. I think, first of all, I'm amused that you're asking for transformational M&A. I think I feel like somehow we at Palo Alto Networks have been going through a transformation already for the last five years. Let me talk about it in two different parts. One, and I'd like to bust a myth of the notion that we've grown our innovation through M&A because pretty much the entire XSIAM product that we've built, which is now going to be one of the fastest platforms of Palo Alto Networks is homegrown. It was built by our team internally. It was designed, built and delivered by the Cortex team. So I think it's a disservice to them to say that some of the fastest-growing platforms being built at Palo Alto Networks was acquired. Similarly, our next-generation firewalls or our SASE product or SASE product for the most part, is entirely homegrown, driven by the security capabilities that we built using our firewalls as well as our virtual firewall business. So I think majority of our M&A has been focused on building our cloud security portfolio where we felt where we needed to be assertive and be out there in the front. And I would say, auxiliary capabilities, whether it's in automation with XSOAR or auxiliary capabilities around tax purpose management. So bottom line, we're very comfortable with the three platforms that we have and what we need to get done. I think we've been very clear about from an acquisition perspective, we look for product capability, where we can take product capability and attach that and make sure we can solve more problems for our customers that they're looking at. So from that perspective, my view on M&A is consistent that we find something interesting, an industry trend, which is added incremental tech capability, we will do it. I think from a transformational M&A, I think we can transform this company and have continued to transform it to where it is based on our innovation and our balance of execution. I think we will continue to do that. I don't think the market is particularly cheap yet. If you were to try and look for transformation M&A, and I think it's kind of a dual double-edge situation. One, I think we continue to get stronger as we get execution under our belt, and we continue to grow in value as Palo Alto Networks. And if some of the large players out there end up committing missteps and we'll go take a look at it for now. I feel very comfortable with the position Palo Alto has in the industry. I feel very, very comfortable with the amount of cash we have on our balance sheet. And I believe it is our job to keep our heads down and keep executing because it's a tough market. And I think one of the things which was brought up just a minute ago, I think the opportunities from AI have not been fully comprehended by most enterprise businesses. I think we are going to undergo a transformation both at Palo Alto Networks as well as generally an enterprise software industry over the next 12 months to 24 months as we embrace generative AI. I think that's the real opportunity and challenge in front of us. And I think half of the people out there will get it wrong. And hopefully, we're on the right side of history.
Brad Zelnick: You're doing a great job, keep it up. Thank you, Nikesh.
Walter Pritchard: Thanks for the question, Brad. The next question is from Andy Nowinski from Wells Fargo, followed by Matt Hedberg from RBC. Andy, go ahead.
Andrew Nowinski: Okay. Thank you. And congrats on a great quarter. So nearly every single vendor and nearly every single reseller we talked to says they're seeing an elongation of sales cycles, yet you seem to defy those headwinds with massive growth in large deals and customer spending $5 million and $10 million with you. I guess would you view this as an important inflection point as it relates to sort of consolidation in that if you can drive large deals in this macro constrained environment, you could potentially see an acceleration of those consolidation trends when the macro improves?
Nikesh Arora: Are you predicting a macro improvement, Andy?
Andrew Nowinski: I certainly hope so.
Nikesh Arora: Well, look, I think first and foremost, I don't want to leave you the view with any impression that the macro is not hard. It is hard out there. I think everything you're hearing from resellers, from other people in the industry is true. Customers are spending more time paying attention to deals. Customers are taking longer, some are rightsizing deals, some are focusing things that are important. Some are looking for financing. Some want to pay annually. So all the effects that you talked about are true in the industry. And we recognize this towards the end of our first quarter. And I'll tell you what, we've been working at double time, like literally, the day Dipak shut the doors and us being able to book anything this quarter, we are out there hunting for next quarter. We have a big number to hit this quarter. We're out there in the field. We're executing our teams are out there. So as you probably appreciate, there is no magic in the world around the fact that our quarter ended July 31. There's no budget year-end for any part of the world on July 31. It's a date that's been created at Palo Alto finishes the year Q4 July 31, which means we have to run as hard as we can to get business done by July 31. We know that' the end of our year, we know that we see end of our quarter, our customers know that. So what we're doing is we're getting ahead of it. We're hoping that us getting ahead of it and continuing to rigorously execute is going to allow us to be able to improve our conversion rate. Our conversion rates on our pipeline are down, guess what? You dug up more pipeline, therefore, your conversion rate that's down still allows you to make the number that you promised the Street. That's what we've been trying to do. And as I've said, the macro is hard, and we're going to keep trying to keep our heads down and execute.
Andrew Nowinski: Thanks, Nikesh. Keep up the good work.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks, Andy. The next question is from Matt Hedberg at RBC followed by Gabriela Borges at Goldman. Go ahead, Matt.
Matt Hedberg: Thanks, Walter. Mike, congrats again team, outstanding results. I guess, Nikesh or Lee, on the success you've seen this far with XSIAM, you noted you essentially have full access to SIM budgets right now. I'm curious with some of the large deals you're seeing, are these generally replacing legacy SIM vendors? Or are you actually generating new TAM that didn't exist previously?
Nikesh Arora: So Matt, I'll let Lee jump in and talk about some of the specifics, but I'll tell you what every one of these deals is a replacement of a legacy SIM or a data store. In addition, we do not sell XSIAM without our endpoint products. So you have to buy Palo Alto Cortex XDR to deploy XSIAM because we believe the only way to have normalized good source -- single source of truth data is to deploy our endpoint products. And then we use that, as I showed in the AI funnel of how we can go cross correlate that and go drive great security outcomes. So in every case, we are replacing an existing vendor. But I will tell you, the SOC industry is upside down. It was designed so far to go understand when a breach happens, how the breach happened and trying to figure out how to remediate it. And those remediation times, as I highlighted are six days and now most modern attacks are in and out in under 12 hours. So if you've got a SOC infrastructure where it allows you to come up with what happened to you after six days, the bad actors have gone in and out in 12 hours, you have a mismatch. That is a problem. But Lee, can you highlight some of the key use cases that where we've seen in the first 30 plus customers that we have, what's driven some of this transformation?
Lee Klarich: Yeah. Look, nearly -- so XSIAM replacing the SIM is also replacing other tools in the SOC as well. The -- there's three core elements to how this is happening. The first is around data. As you saw, 3.5 petabytes a day is being ingested and analyzed. Data is the key to driving good AI and XSIAM is specifically designed to be able to ingest large amounts of data across different data sources into an AI data lake. Second is how we drive AI-based analytics on that data, be able to detect attacks in real-time. This is something that the traditional SIM industry was just not well designed to be able to do. That is driving the meantime the detection that you're seeing. And then three is the integration of automation natively into XSIAM that allows us to drive the meantime remediation down from what in the past used to be, in many cases, days, down to hours and even minutes. And so in all of the XSIAM deployments we're seeing, it's amazing how quickly we are seeing the outcomes that we saw in our own SOC when we deployed an operationalized XSIAM.
Nikesh Arora: I think the last -- sorry, Matt, the only thing I'll add on this is that over the last 15 years, what has happened is the cost and value equation in existing SOCs has diverged tremendously. So people are spending a lot of money collecting data in large data stores and they're not getting adequate value out of it and they're not getting adequate security outcomes out of it. So I think that is a big gap and that gap is something we've been -- we've built this product, try and fill -- and now it really is very early days for us. I think the fact that we'll get to $100 million in the time spend that you thought was aggressive less than that. I think tells us there's a huge potential out there, which means we have to keep our heads down, again, keep building, keep executing and keep trying to solve the problems that our customers are presenting in front of us, but I have a good feeling about it.
Matt Hedberg: Certainly seems that way. Thanks.
Walter Pritchard: Thanks, Matt. Our next question from Gabriela Borges at Goldman Sachs with Adam Tindle from Raymond James on deck. Gabriela, you go ahead.
Gabriela Borges: Good afternoon. Thank you. Either for Lee or Nikesh. I wanted to ask about your cloud security strategy in Prisma, specifically with respect to how you think about the right balance of incentives that you give customers upfront to catalyze adoption? And then also how you think about the balance of top-down growth versus product-led growth given that DevSecOps, DevOps some of those tools seem to be driven by product line growth as well? Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: Yeah. Lee, go ahead and answer that question.
Lee Klarich: So one of the challenges that we've set out to address with Prisma Cloud was this fundamental challenge in enterprise cybersecurity sort of the proliferation of point products. Every time there's a new security need, there's a new product and then customers become the system integrator of all deterrent point solutions. And they spend more time trying to be the system integrator than they are actually getting the value from the products. And so with Prisma Cloud, we've taken the unique approach of building a platform where we can deliver many different capabilities pre-integrated from the same location. Now at the same time, we did that on the technical side, we also approached it from a sort of the adoption side and, I'll call it, the procurement side of having a single Prisma Cloud credit system that makes it really easy for customers to buy a level of capacity and then simply use it to adopt as much of the platform as they need and when they need. And so we've -- it's allowed us to focus more of our attention in terms of how we engage with customers and how the product works on in product adoption, guided adoption of additional capabilities and enabling them to easily use more and more the services as they need them as opposed to having to go back and turn every module into a new transaction with a customer. And as you saw from what Nikesh showed, the new credit usage year-over-year going up about 44% year-over-year, but then also the number of customers there are two or more or three or more or four or more modules in the case of four more almost doubling year-over-year shows how well that is working.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks, Gabriela. Next up, Adam Tindle, Raymond James; followed by Gregg Moskowitz, Mizuho. Adam, go ahead.
Adam Tindle: Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon. I want to start by just acknowledging the progression in operating margin is really impressive and commitment to that being a baseline is a really important point. If I'm thinking about tomorrow, some of the distracting questions that might come up would be around product revenue. I think you grew 10% year-over-year in Q3, and you had previously guided the fiscal year to 10%. But if I saw in the slides correctly, I think you're now raising that to 15% to 16%. So what's driving that increase in product revenue and the acceleration in Q4 despite the cautionary comments? And anything we can think about in terms of puts and takes to product revenue as we think about fiscal '24, so we don't get ahead of ourselves? Thanks.
Nikesh Arora: Yeah, Adam. I think there are two parts to it. One is, as you will appreciate, we highlighted that software has become 30% of our product revenue. So we -- when you book a hardware firewall, you get a dollar for dollar for revenue. In software, you don't get a dollar for dollar for revenue there is some part of an amortized value we get from our software firewalls and some part of our SD-WAN, which becomes part of our product revenue. So we have to run harder on billings to be able to deliver product revenue in the context of software. But as I mentioned, our virtual firewalls grew at 55% this quarter. They grew at 40% for the year so far. This is a tailwind we had not expected. At the same time, the hardware, as I mentioned, is not as strong as we'd expected. So they balance each other out. But in balances in favor of software for now, coming off a low base of last year. So as a result, we have been able to improve our product revenue guidance. So obviously, it comes at the cost of services revenue because some of our software has now had to work triple time to be able to deliver product revenue. So I think that's the context in which you should think about it overall, where there's been a draw from one side and a partial give on the other side and the product revenue. However, given our RPO is growing way ahead of revenue, it just means we are saving up a lot of revenue for a future rainy day.
Dipak Golechha: No, for raining area. The only other thing that I would maybe just add to that is simply the supply chain dynamics that Nikesh talked about in his remarks, I mean that does have some factors, but we really have been able to -- with a world-class team get ahead of the supply chain reality. And so that may explain some of the variability you're seeing.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thank you, Adam. Next up, Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho, followed by Shaul Eyal from Cowen.
Gregg Moskowitz: Thank you. Can you hear me?
Nikesh Arora: Yes.
Gregg Moskowitz: All right. I have a follow-up for Lee or Nikesh on generate AI. So your comments on LLM were helpful, but do you think gen AI will tilt the scales in favor of Palo Alto and perhaps some other security vendors over time? Or is it ultimately more likely to cause an even faster game of cat and mouse between the vendors and the attackers, how do you see this playing out?
Nikesh Arora: Well, I think look, first and foremost, the benefit of generative AI so far is twofold, right? One is in its ability to summarize data and give you access to information much faster. Can I imagine a sales rep at Palo Alto having access to their fingertips about all Palo Alto information, of course, I can. Can I imagine my customer support people having access to amazing amounts of information that's at the tip of their fingers so they can answer customer questions much faster. Can I imagine for showcasing that information directly to my customers as you're seeing the industry now suddenly a plethora of copilots start to emerge in every product. So I think that is going to become an obvious benefit of generative AI. Now don't forget, it relies on one principle called having a lot of data. But it's very important that whether you're using it for sharing your own information from your customers to your customers, you need a lot of that data. You have to clean all your data processes and have that. Secondly, if you're in the security business, it definitely helps. If you have the largest data lake in the world, of security data. So from that perspective, I think it favors the people who have a lot of data already as part of their strategy, and they have built a business on the back of a data-led strategy. I think not just specific to security in any industry, especially consumer Internet, if you've been a UI company, you have something to worry about. If you're a travel booking operator or something with just takes other people's data and makes a better UI, you have something to worry about. So I think from that perspective, it favors companies which have tremendous amounts of data. I think the second thing is also important to understand, if I have 14,000 people, I spend thousands of billion dollars in customers support or more, there is leverage. I can go spend $30 million, $40 million, $50 million deploying at LM and saving up my cost. If you're running a small company and your entire cost of $50 million, it probably doesn't behoove you to go out and create a LM based generative AI project to go out and pay and take away $12 million of cost. So I think it also benefits people of scale who are able to drive efficiencies using generative AI across the enterprise, allowing them to grow their business much faster with limited resources. Does that help?
Gregg Moskowitz: It does. Thanks, Nikesh.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks, Gregg. And Shaul Eyal from Cowen our last question.
Shaul Eyal: Good afternoon. Congrats, team. Nikesh, I want to go back, actually, I know Brad was asking about M&A. I want to ask about the competitive landscape, but specifically with a focus maybe on the CNAPP front. So my question is, how do you think about it? Any change? Do you think that the product right now, as it stands, is comprehensive or anything you might be thinking of maybe augmenting specifically on the CNAPP front? Thank you for that.
Lee Klarich: That's by far the most comprehensive cloud native application protection platform there is. That doesn't mean that we do everything, but we do far more than any other solution out there. There's a tremendous amount of focus on delivering capabilities that we've been building internally, organically amongst the team. We've seen the most recent one we delivered with secret scanning just a few months ago. We've seen very good early adoption of that. At the same time, we're also delivering on the latest acquisition of cyber security, where we expect that to become a new module in the next couple of months available to all of our Prisma Cloud customers. And so the -- Nikesh talked about how we've leveraged M&A in the past to help build some of the key technology areas of Prisma Cloud, which is absolutely true. We have also shown an ability to deliver new cloud security capabilities organically and be very successful at that. And right now, I feel good about the balance of both those capabilities and how we're bringing them together and how we continue to deliver new innovations.
Shaul Eyal: Thank you.
Walter Pritchard: Thank you for the question. With that, we'll conclude the Q&A portion of the call, and I'd like to pass it back to Nikesh for his closing remarks.
Nikesh Arora: Well, thank you very much again, everybody, for joining us. We look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming investor events. I also want to once again take an opportunity to thank all of our employees who worked very hard in a very dedicated fashion, as you all know, to help us achieve the results. Not only that, a big thank you to all of our partners and our customers around the world. Have a wonderful day. Thank you.

Nikesh Arora: Thank you, Clay. Good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our earnings call. I'm pleased to report that we had another strong quarter with the balance of top line growth, significant expansion and non-GAAP operating margin and strong free cash flow. Billings and revenue each grew 26% year-over-year. Our RPO grew 39% as we continue to sign large multiyear deals with our customers. We also delivered an acceleration in our operating leverage in Q2 as we focused on driving profitable growth. Our non-GAAP operating income grew 55% year-over-year, supported by a non-GAAP operating margin, which exceeded 22% for the quarter, up over 440 basis points year-over-year. This translated to another quarter of profitability on a GAAP basis. We have now been GAAP profitable on a cumulative basis over the last four quarters. In addition, our strong free cash flow generation this quarter also puts us on track to outperform prior guidance. I know many of you are wondering about the macro environment, so I want to start with an update there. There's clearly a tougher macro emerging out there as the Fed continues on its crusade to tame inflation. The changing macro is clearly making business leaders more cautious. Some of our customers are seeing signs of a slight slowdown while others are less impacted. I, however, feel that we're not done yet. And while not expecting shocks, I do think we will see more cautious activity over the next few quarters. Clearly, caution is abundant, driving more scrutiny, making customers demand more value from their partners. We've seen some projects get delayed or descoped, non-canceled while most continue on track. We've always maintained that we expect cybersecurity to be resilient, and we continue to see evidence of that. On the large deal front, this behavior is definitely widespread. For us, this has meant we need to get ahead of this and work closely with our CIO and CSO partners. Not just that, it's creating more conversations around payment terms, discounts and scope of deal with purchasing teams, something we've been working with our customers on as well. I'm delighted that based on our field teams getting ahead of this problem, earlier this quarter, we did not see any major deals slip from the quarter. Our deal cadence quality was consistent with the same quarter last year. On an equally positive note, this environment drives the need for consolidation, not just to generate clear security outcomes, but also to reduce the security vendor sprawl that has been prevalent in our customers' infrastructure and the need for a long-term security strategy based on total cost of ownership and value. We feel fortunate that with our portfolio, we are best positioned to deliver this to our customers. Within our own business, two things have happened. One, we have become more focused on efficiency from early this year. For example, our headcount growth this year is likely to be lower than any of the last three years. At the same time, we do not anticipate slowing down the pace of our development or business outcomes. Dipak and his team have been rigorously inspecting our cost structures across our portfolio to ensure we are set up to deliver consistent gross margins in all areas. This has been one of the major drivers of our improved operating margin and we hope to continue to improve as we scale. Secondly, as anticipated, supply chain challenges and product have abated significantly versus six months ago. While this is evident in our product gross margins and our overall profitability, there are some lingering impacts, which we expect to further abate through the end of this year. Let's also take a moment to discuss hardware growth. Over the last 12 months, a lot of factors have impacted hardware growth, including supply constraints, uneven demand, given supply chain impacts and backlog. Additionally, we have noticed our customers continue to be more focused on their cloud, network and security operations and transformations and are willing to sweat their hardware assets longer. Underlying all this, we still believe that the industry hardware growth rate is in the low to mid-single digits. As all these extraneous factors mitigated over the next few months, we will see the long-term growth gravitate back to those levels. So what does this mean for the second half of this year and beyond? Somewhat counter to the market, we're raising guidance both on top-line metrics, metrics and profitability. Of course, this requires the current demand to sustain, and for us to maintain a continued focus on execution. We have a unique opportunity in this environment to strengthen our position in the market. Hence, we are investing with an eye towards disciplined growth and positioning ourselves to the partner of choice for customers looking to consolidate. You'll hear more about this from Dipak, but we are raising billings and next-generation security our guidance on the back strength in our software-based and cloud-delivered capabilities. In our hardware pipeline, we're seeing specific transactions that are on track for Q4, which has caused us to shift some forecasted revenue from Q3 to Q4 while maintaining our annual guidance. With all I have said about efficiency in better operations and the impact, we're now guiding to 21.5% to 22% operating margin for fiscal year 2023. Additionally, we're also increasing our cash flow guidance. Consolidation continues to be a key theme with our customers. Of course, customers are not willing to compromise on quality and cybersecurity. Given our market leadership in 13 categories, we are fortunate to be engaged in many such conversations. Those conversations are driving business, and many customers are on a long-term transformation path with us. The number of deals we closed over $1 million grew nearly 20% year-over-year, and the value of these transactions grew nearly 60%. Similarly, the number of greater-than-$5-million deals grew 84% and a number of greater-than-$10-million deals grew over 140%. We saw deal values in these cohorts grow significantly. This continued momentum is critical to us being able to drive platform consolidation. Time and again, we see early millionaire customers become an onboarding ramp to help us drive more cybersecurity value to our customers. Almost all of our $10 million deals involve multiple platforms on an underlying transformation that is driving vendor consolidation. Let's take a look at some of the ways we are driving consolidation. First, with Zero Trust transformations, we're helping customers standardize their appliance and software firewalls with a broad line of security subscriptions. A life sciences customer signed an eight-figure deal to standardize their operations using our next-generation firewalls, VMs and security subscriptions. In other cases, we're helping customers adopt SASE and software firewalls, and consolidate their security stack across our consistent set of offerings, driven by hybrid work and securing SaaS apps. A financial service firm recently signed an eight figure deal with us, because they wanted to transform their network and reduce both operational challenges and cost of ownership. They chose us over pure play SASE competitors, because of the breadth of our offering in our comprehensive Zero Trust network. Secondly, trial cloud transformations. We're using our Prisma Cloud and Prisma Access capabilities to help customers adopt hyperscale cloud and Software as a Service. Another financial services firm with a mandate to run over 90% of the apps in the cloud signed a high eight-figure deal to standardize in both Prisma Access and Prisma Cloud. Lastly, in SOC transformations, we're using our Cortex platform with XSIAM to help customers transform their security operations center and retool around high-fidelity data sources, AI and automation. A retail company started a relationship with us around Unit 42 incident response with an Expanse trial and small XDR deployment. They expanded the relationship with a high seven-figure deal to standardize on XDR and XSOAR. These strategic customer relationships and transformations would not have been possible without us building a new security industry paradigm, a paradigm around constant innovation. Our success is driven by investments in innovation and is increasingly clear to us that, there is a flywheel at play here. This starts with R&D investment, where we have the largest budget of all dedicated cybersecurity companies approximately $1 billion in non-GAAP spending on a trailing four-quarter basis. This is two to five times as much as our pure-play peers. Our scale also allows us to spread this budget across a larger revenue base and the shared needs of our three platforms. R&D investments then translate into a record number of product releases. Our first half major release is number 35, up 59% from the first half of last year. Some of the key releases in the first half included our flagship PAN-OS 11.0 Nova, our third advanced subscription, Advanced Wildfire, our new AI-based SOC platform XSIAM and new modules and updates in Prisma Cloud. This constant innovation is causing industry analysts to take notice. We recently received recognition for leadership in the cloud-native application protection platform category, or CNAPP, bringing our total number of active leadership recognitions to 13, which compares to nine a year ago. All these leadership positions have helped us grow our NGS ARR at 63%. We still believe there is a large untapped TAM for many of these services given the robust adoption of advanced software services that we have launched, which are all cloud delivered and us being in the early part of the SASE cloud life cycle, we feel confident in our future ability to drive NGS ARR. Let's take a deeper look at some of the highlights. I'll start with my personal favorite, our network security business. We launched our first SASE capability, Prisma Access, at the end of fiscal year 2019. In the first year, we booked less than $100 million in business. Over the last six quarters, we booked about $1 billion, with our largest deal last quarter being a TCV deal for $40 million for SASE. We now have over 4,000 customers and are growing ARR approximately 50%. In Q2, we saw a healthy number of large competitive wins in SASE, and SASE has one of our strongest pipelines looking 12 months out. Beyond the top line traction, we're also seeing improving economics in the business. Two years ago, we showed you how the five-year revenue from a SASE customer compares to an appliance customer. At that time, SASE was about two times higher. Since then, we've added additional value to SASE. We launched autonomous digital experience management in FY 2022, followed by AIOps and SaaS security posture management this year. AI has the power to transform SASE. Our integrated security services are now all powered by AI to detect and prevent even zero-day attacks. And we'll soon be introducing additional AI-driven capability to transform the user experience and using the platform. We now expect our five-year revenue from a SASE customer to be more than 2.5 times that of an appliance customer. We've also seen some improvements in our SASE gross margins over this period, as we have scaled to become more efficient. If you go to the other side of our network security portfolio, our software firewall business is going strong. This includes the broadest deployment options for customers, including VM-Series and CM series, which can run in their data centers or be purchased in the cloud marketplaces and the first-to-market integrated cloud next-generation firewall offerings for hyperscale clouds. We have the highest market share of any company in this market. We believe it's more than three times of our any closest competitor. The current macro environment is causing more customers to watch their CapEx budget. This shift, along with the fact that customers are transforming the data centers moving to the cloud, is leading more of them to adopt software firewalls. In Q2, the number of deals over $1 million for our software firewall was nearly doubled, and six of our top eight deals in Q2 included software firewalls in our offering. Moving onto our cloud security business. We continue to make steady progress with Prisma Cloud. Platform enhancements are important to our growth. We released the new API risk profiling capability to enhance our web application security module. This capability helps security teams assess their API stack surface, attack surface quickly based on more than 200 risk factors, including misconfigurations, exposure to sensitive data and access privileges. This helps teams prioritize the most significant risk and take preventive measures to address them. We also continue to shift left and focus on securing workloads as they are developed, solving our customers' application security channels. To that end, we closed the acquisition of Cider, and have brought their team under common leadership with our cloud code security team to help bring Cider's CICD security capability to our platform. After releasing Cloud Core Security a year-ago, over 15% of our customer base has adopted these capabilities. Our cloud core security customers in Q2 grew 30% over Q1. Our new secret management module launched in December scans code repos used by developers for hard-coded secrets like passwords and API keys to make sure this information is not exposed and used as a vector of attack. We continue to see these new capabilities and enhancements drive an increase in customer module adoption. For example, our customers with two or more modules grew over 40%, and customers with four or more modules more than doubled. Credit consumption of Prisma Cloud increased 48% year-over-year. This growth is being driven by new customer additions, customers increasing their cloud footprints and customers consuming additional modules. While there has been discussion on moderation and cloud consumption in the market, we believe the relatively early stage of cloud security adoption has and will continue to shelter us from this headwind. Before I move on to Cortex and talk about continuing signs of optimism I see in that category, I feel compelled to take a detour towards AI. Clearly, AI has been on everyone's mind given the continued conversation in the tech industry. Most of you know the story of arrival with the Palo Alto Networks. I talked about fragmentation and the need for a solution there, which we have talked a lot about. I also talked about automation and AI. We counted, I used the word AI more time than my first six months in Palo Alto Networks than platform or consolidation. The challenges you all know is that AI has been a data problem and continues to be so. Unlike consumer AI, where we can talk about Sonnets and ChatGPT's creative capabilities and the revolution that is going to drive in search or advertising, its ability to summarize data and continue to amuse and inform us, the demands from AI and enterprise are far more exacting and so are the returns. An enterprise AI needs to be clean. It has to have comprehensive data. And in security, especially it needs to be real time. So not only do you need to have the best data to create great security outcomes, you also need to be positioned in line to block threats. Let me make a case why with petabytes of data from trillions of events, billions of sessions, hundreds of millions of URLs and tens of millions of flies flowing -- files, not flies -- flowing through our product across cloud, network and endpoints daily, we are best positioned to deliver security outcomes using AI machine learning. Palo Alto Network's next-generation firewalls broke through the firewall industry in the early days because of our ability to then deliver next-generation security. These services were driven by expansive data collection capabilities, EAL, or enhanced application logs. We have since applied that capability across our entire network security stack. We estimate that this network secure data is just under half the valuable security data that is needed for any AI-driven outcome. We have over 60,000 customers where we can help them use this data. As we conceived with Cortex, we built XDR to ensure we collected the best endpoint data across the industry. We acquired and deployed the largest security automation footprint at XSOAR, but we're not stopping there. We then acquired and integrated Expanse, which looked at vulnerability data from a different and unique perspective. These formed the fundamental building blocks for XSIAM. With our leadership position in automation, analytics and attack surface management, again, we're driving an AI-based SoC transformation. With our 4,500 Cortex customers, we're able to bring what we believe is the next largest set of security data that is useful for AI. We applied the same thought and rigor as we built Prisma Cloud, integrating data from all hyperscalers, integrating shift-left data from developers. Slowly and steadily, the Prisma Cloud integration is being built on a stronger foundation of security data. Cloud is becoming an increasingly important contributor to AI, and our 2,000 customers will benefit from it. We have delivered unique AI-based outcomes, including blocking unknown yet malicious websites, command and control domain and files at scale. Also, we have shown in our own security operations center that we can reduce the mean time to detection to seconds and the meantime to respond to minutes. These are all outcomes that cannot be achieved without the data we have and the AI/machine learning expertise we apply. Let's take a look into how we believe this has made us more excited and encouraged us around XSIAM. In Q2, as part of the Cortex and XSIAM platform, we released important new capabilities, including SaaS-enabled XSOAR, delivering a cloud-based interface and Expanse active attack surface management allowing our customers to remediate issues discovered using XSIAM. We launched XSIAM and GA at the end of Q1. So far, we've closed approximately $30 million in business and have a growing pipeline of customers that are looking to transform security operations of the new platform. I think XSIAM is going to pave the way for us to drive AI-driven security transformation outcomes. We will continue to work hard with our early customers to drive evolution and success in XSIAM. I'm extremely positive, perhaps, and cautiously optimistic about XSIAM. Its early relevance, product market fit, and with the concurrent discussion on AI, it makes me hopeful that this could be the fastest ramp of any security product. We see our first milestone to getting to $100 million in bookings faster than Cortex SASE or Prisma Cloud in our portfolio. Before I turn the floor to Dipak, I want to put all this together and talk about where we're focused as we enter the second half of our fiscal year and beyond. We see a clear road map ahead of us. We intend to put our head down and execute. Right now, we're in the process of transforming our business to software-based and cloud delivery offerings. Our revenue, which is increasingly driven by our next-generation security capabilities, is becoming more recurring in nature, and we have an opportunity to own a greater share of our customers' cybersecurity budget. This should allow us to sustain high revenue growth for longer. Over the last couple of years, we set in motion a plan to expand our operating margin, including driving scale in our faster-growing businesses. Over the last six months, we've listened to investors who have encouraged us to focus on profitable growth and accelerate incremental leverage in our business, and we made good progress in Q2. We're now well positioned for the second half of the year. We are appreciably raising our margin target for FY 2023 up 200 basis points from our prior guidance and 250 basis points from our initial FY 2023 guidance. We believe we can continue to build on this into fiscal year 2024 and beyond, putting us three years ahead of our profitability targets we offered at our last Analyst Day in September 2021. As Dipak will describe, we believe the combination of sustaining higher top line growth and focus on efficiency sets up well to build on this base of higher profitability and grow EPS ahead of revenue. I want to emphasize that achieving GAAP profitability is an important milestone for our company. In support of this, we're actively focused on managing our stock-based compensation to continue bringing this down as a percent of our revenue. With that, I'll turn the floor over to Dipak to take you through our details of our results and guidance, and then we'll take questions.
Dipak Golechha: Thank you, Nikesh, and good afternoon, everyone. For Q2, revenue of $1.66 billion grew 26%. Product revenue grew 15%, whilst total service revenue grew 29%, with subscription revenue growing 32% and support revenue growing 25%. Moving on to geographies. We saw revenue growth across all theaters, with the Americas growing 22%, EMEA up 35% and JPAC growing 32%. The strength of our next-generation security capabilities continues to drive our results, with NGS ARR of $2.3 billion, growing 63%. Strength was broad-based across all three of our platforms: Network security, cloud security and security operations. We delivered total billings of $2.03 billion, up 26% and above the high end of our guidance range. Total deferred revenue in Q2 was $7.6 billion, an increase of 39%. Remaining performance obligation, or RPO, was $8.8 billion, increasing 39%, with current RPO representing about half of our RPO similar to recent quarters. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was significantly ahead of our guidance, and this metric, as well as our trailing 12 months adjusted free cash flow, accelerated. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.05 grew 81% year-over-year, while trailing 12-month adjusted free cash flow of $2.7 billion grew 76% year-over-year. Moving on to the rest of the financial highlights. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75.5% was up 150 basis points year-over-year, driven mainly by an increase in our software mix. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we saw less pressure from incremental costs related to the supply chain. We've made significant progress in driving leverage. This is something that we articulated at our Analyst Day in September 2021 and kicked off in fiscal year 2022. And we have accelerated this in fiscal year 2023 with a focus on profitable growth as evidenced by our Q2 performance. Our operating margin of 22.8% increased 440 basis points year-over-year. This result was driven by improving gross margins and a slower level of headcount additions. We expect to see ongoing improvements in our operational efficiency. And as a result, we are raising our fiscal year 2023 operating margin guidance. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter grew 79% to $332 million, or $1.05 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22%. Delivering fiscal year GAAP profitability is another milestone in our balance of driving growth and profitability. For the quarter, GAAP net income was $84 million or $0.28 per basic share and $0.25 per diluted share. This was our third consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability. And as Nikesh noted, we have now been profitable on a cumulative basis for the last four quarters. We believe we now meet the criteria for inclusion in the S&P 500. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended Q2 with cash equivalents and investments of $6.2 billion. Our average duration -- our new contracts increased slightly year-over-year, driven by deals with strategic customers. It remains at approximately three years, where it has been historically. Q2 cash flow from operations was $695 million, with total adjusted free cash flow of $685 million this quarter. Our strong free cash flow in Q2 was driven by increased operating profitability, higher interest income and improvement in billings linearity due to improving supply chain conditions. During Q2, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares at the open market at an average price of approximately $139 per share for a total consideration of $250 million. As a reminder, our share repurchase program is opportunistic, and we are committed to this method of returning cash to shareholders over the medium-term. Stock-based compensation ticked up 20 basis points as a percent of revenue sequentially, related to the issuance of our annual grants and the impact from the Cider acquisition. On a year-over-year basis, stock-based compensation was down 350 basis points as a percent of revenue. Before I get to guidance, I wanted to cover my thoughts on operating margin. We have continued to drive improvements in the profitability for our fastest-growing businesses as they have gained scale. Also, over the last six months, we have developed and executed on detailed plans to accelerate our operating leverage. This includes raising the bar around the return on investment we expect as well as remaining prudent in our hiring. We've also spent a lot of time looking at our peer group and studying benchmark data. As we look towards the second half of the year and into fiscal year 2024, we believe we can continue to execute against our plans and drive higher operating margins. We expect that this will translate into us growing our EPS faster than our revenue growth rates. Now moving on to guidance. We're offering guidance for Q3 and also Q4 to make this explicit and then offering updated annual guidance. You'll see we're maintaining our annual revenue guidance and giving explicit guidance for Q3 to Q4 based on what we see in our pipeline for product revenue. For the third quarter of 2023, we expect billings to be in the range of $2.20 billion to $2.25 billion, an increase of 22% to 25%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.695 billion to $1.725 billion, an increase of 22% to 24%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.90 to $0.94, an increase of 50% to 57%. For the fourth quarter of the year, we expect billings to be in the range of $3.12 billion to $3.17 billion, an increase of 16% to 18%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.937 billion to $1.967 billion, an increase of 25% to 27%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.18 to $1.22 per share, an increase of 48% to 53%. For the fiscal year, we expect billings to be in the range of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, an increase of 22% to 23%. We expect NGS ARR to be in the range of $2.75 billion to $2.8 billion, an increase of 45% to 48%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $6.85 billion to $6.91 billion, an increase of 25% to 26%. We continue to expect product revenue growth in the range of 10% for the full fiscal year. For fiscal year 2023, we're expecting our operating margins to be in the range of 21.5% to 22%. And we expect our non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.97 to $4.03, an increase of 57% to 60%. We expect our adjusted free cash flow margin to be between 36.5% to 37.5% and we expect to be GAAP profitable each quarter and for the fiscal year 2023. Additionally, please consider the following modeling points. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 22% for Q3 and fiscal year 2023, subject to the outcome of future tax legislation. For Q3 and Q4, we expect net interest income -- net interest and other income of $45 million to $49 million. We expect Q3 diluted shares outstanding of 321 million to 327 million shares. We expect Q4 diluted shares outstanding of 326 million to 332 million. We expect fiscal year 2023 diluted shares outstanding of 320 million to 326 million. We expect Q3 capital expenditures of $35 million to $40 million, with full year capital expenditures of $165 million to $170 million. With that, I will turn the call back over to Clay for the Q&A part of the call.
A - Clay Bilby: Great. Thank you, Dipak. [Operator Instructions] The first question will be from Brian Essex of JPMorgan with Hamza Fodderwala to follow. Brian, you may ask your question.
Brian Essex: Great. Thank you, Clay and congrats to everyone on some fantastic results. Really, really strong here. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe Nikesh for you, I just have a question on SASE. Maybe if you could dig in a little bit to the competitive dynamics there. Does it really help to -- I guess, how much does it help the platform to have full end-to-end SASE? I see a lot of private vendors building out full end-to-end SASE platforms, or is this more of a transformational push or maybe there's a little bit of both? Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: Hey, thanks for the question. Look, the SASE market, I think traditionally was a market which was focused on Internet access. Customers use that as a proxy-based way to onboard Internet access and was fine. I think the pandemic really flipped the switch, coupled with the whole cloud transformations that are going on, our customers, especially larger customers, want to create a first -- first-class citizen of any user who's not sitting in the office or in the campus, and they want to get to Zero Trust. So, I think the confluence of Zero Trust, the confluence of the cloud transformation, the confluence to apply a full security stack opened the door for full SASE deployment to network transformations, couple that with the fact that people are trying to get away from large wide- network-type network architectures, SD-WAN type network. So, I think, our confidence on all of these things created a real spurt in the SASE market. We have 60-plus thousand customers who use our firewalls. Now, we're showing them a path to migrate from a firewall-based, campus-based, data center-based architecture to a Zero Trust architecture, which spans hardware, software, and any kind of remote access and campus solutions. So, I think that's what's driving that for us. And whilst your guys -- you're impatient, your brains move faster than our ability to execute sometimes, it's only been three years. And I think I could challenge anybody out in the market. Anybody -- everybody read the same Gartner Magic Quadrant on SASE. I want to see how many vendors can claim that the last six quarters, they sold $1 billion SASE, and who just did a $40 million deal in SASE last quarter. So, I think that's our execution, our ability to work with existing customers, our constantly listening to customers evolving our product is allowing us to get here. It's a competitive market, but I think we're down to two, two and a half vendors in this market who we see at every customer now.
Clay Bilby: All right. Our next question from Hamza Fodderwala with Morgan Stanley with Fatima to follow. Go ahead Hamza.
Hamza Fodderwala: Hey good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe for Nikesh and Lee Klarich. Just curious around the early customer conversations around AI as customers look to automate their security operations. And to what extent is that aiding the conversation towards consolidation for Palo Alto Networks?
Nikesh Arora : That's a great question, Hamza. And I've been sort of on and off in terms of how to temper my enthusiasm for this space. And I was on my way to India to speak at a convocation, I experienced ChatGPT for the first time. And I turned around and rewrote my convocation speech saying, this is the best thing that happened to security, enterprise and to consumer, because I think it's kind of an inflection point, which is big. Now clearly, that's a conversation. I'd say, two months ago, customers were not asking us about AI, and now they all want to know, are you deploying AI in your security products? That's great. And that's why we spent some time on the earnings call trying to elaborate how we've been using this for a long time. The conversations are around how do I start making more sense of my data. I think the last iteration of using data in the security industry has been more about, I'd say, offline or reactive data analysis for the most part. And this is the first time the customers want real-time, proactive, block-the-threat outcomes, which is sort of our sweet spot, if I may say so. And that conversation is beginning to start. I'll tell you, on XSIAM, there's no deal less than $1 million. I haven't seen a security product that we launched in the industry which starts off at a minimum price of $1 million, right? We've done $30 million of business in the last 12 to 16 weeks, where our customers -- our teams are still getting trained. We're still getting traction. We still have, we think, 70%, 80% of the product developers still working on the rest of it as we get feedback from customers. So -- and I'm cautiously optimistic. And I think you will see this pave the way for deployment of AI. This is our first outcome-based product. This is the first time we can walk in and say, listen, I can reduce your mean time to respond, a mean time to detect. Otherwise, I'd say, use this, this is really good, it's going to save you, but he won't find out until something happens. In the case of XSIAM, I say, I can demonstrate efficiency, I can demonstrate lower cost of ownership for you. So, very hopeful. Don't get ahead of yourself. It's going to take a while. I really told you we'd be happy if I get $100 million faster than any of the product. And hopefully, this becomes another leg of growth for Palo Alto to give us more sustained top line over the long-term.
Clay Bilby : All right. Our next question from Fatima Boolani of Citigroup with Brad Zelnick like to follow. Go ahead.
Fatima Boolani : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Nikesh, this one's for you. You were pretty explicit that you are having realistic conversations with customers about payment terms and extensions and financial circumstances as most organizations focus maybe more on cash flow preservation than they had in the past. So maybe to specifically ask, it's not very apparent in your numbers that you're having those types of conversations. So a, how are you managing to circumvent a lot of that? And how is Palo Alto Financial Services as a financing vehicle maybe helping you drive a lot of those conversations that's not apparent to us?
Nikesh Arora : Good.
Fatima Boolani : Good.
Nikesh Arora : It means we are doing a good job of managing our cash flow margins and making sure our customers are happy. And this very rarely do I get to make both shareholders and customers happy at the same time. So it's one of those moments. Look, on a more serious note, yes, you're right. We are having those conversations. And I'd say, Dipak and his team doing a phenomenal job in making sure that our sales teams are supportive when the customer is talking about payment terms, annual billing plans or specifically using PANFS. So I'm going to pass over to Dipak and explain how he's walking the tightrope and making sure that we're doing this effectively with our customers. I will say, we're blessed because, as Dipak highlighted, we have $6.2 billion of cash on our balance sheet. So we have the capacity to be able to do this for our customers. But Dipak?
Dipak Golechha: Yes. No, I think, I would just say that, it's been very selective and very purposeful looking at the actual customer interaction. We have a whole team, that are very experienced at this. We brought a lot of people in with external experience. And it really is a case-by-case piece here, but that's how you keep it like very selective and strategic. And that's the only time we really use it.
Clay Bilby: All right. Great. Our next question is from Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank, followed by Tal Liani. Go ahead, Brad.
Brad Zelnick: Great. Thank you, very much, and congrats, Nikesh and team. Great, great job. Nikesh, Palo Alto Networks is far more than a hardware company. And that's...
Nikesh Arora: Oh, my God, Brad. You're reminding me of the meeting we had 4.5 years ago in my office. Go on.
Brad Zelnick: I'm so glad that I left that impression on you, Nikesh. But I'm still waiting for the odd word by the way. You can see behind here. It's still -- even though I'm in front of the building, it's a bit sparse. But good to see you. So, far more than a hardware company today that's on full display, but you've downticked on your industry hardware growth expectations from what you said last quarter. I believe last quarter, you said 5% to 8%. Now you're saying low to mid-single digit. I don't know if it's a material difference, but I noticed the difference. If anything, what's changed at all in your market view? How should we expect your hardware business to perform versus market? And what would you say, Nikesh, to a skeptic that's perhaps skeptical that a lot of the success you see in everything else in next-gen is riding along on -- and opportunities created when a sales person shows up and is selling hardware? I guess how much of that motion is happening away from hardware that we should appreciate? Thanks.
Nikesh Arora: So, Brad, I think it's important to understand, that we have a very large installed base. We have 62,000 customers who deploy Palo Alto firewalls. And let's just say, in my 4.5 years at Palo Alto, I don't know any customer has decommissioned us yet. So, I think that the solution of the hardware is not being deployed or not being used is not true. So there is hardware and [indiscernible] customers. Even though somebody may not be buying hardware, a lot of our subscription growth, our ELA growth, is driven by the fact that people have hardware, which they are extending the software capabilities on and buying more software capabilities from us. So it's not just that a salesperson shows up only to sell hardware, they actually show up to deploy more security capabilities on the software front. And couple that in the case of SASE, if you look at our large pipeline, it's clearly driven by a customer of Palo Alto, who is a firewall customer, or a potential SASE customer who's saying, listen, I know your security services, I know your Zero Trust policies, I want to be able to expand into it and deploy a full end-to-end SASE solution or a Zero Trust solution for you. So, I guess I'm trying to say is that, our success in software is not hardware-dependent. All I'm highlighting is that I believe that the market was very confused last year with supply chain. You couldn't get chips. There were orders being made. Customers are getting jittery, saying, I have capacities, I might need more hardware. So a whole bunch of conflation of effects that happened hardware. I have constantly maintained that hardware grows. The industry grows at low to mid-single digits. You noticed that perhaps a slight downtick in my expectations, and that's probably fair. You're perceptive. But I don't think it changes the overall outcome for us as a company. I do worry about people who are purely hardware-focused, who don't have the ability to position a solution which includes software. I'll give you an example. A large retailer comes to us and say, I'd like to deploy a SASE solution across my entire retail base. I'd like to upgrade. I want to do AR, VR for my store. I want to go get more bandwidth in there. Technically, there are multiple ways to solve the problem. What you do is sell firewalls and say, hey, put a bigger firewall in your store. And I can deliver SASE because I have security capability. I can say, put an SD-WAN box in there, go deploy a lot of bandwidth in there, and do a software-based SASE implementation. A, it's going to be much easier to replace software in there, upgrade software. I take care of that for you. B, it's more secure because you have the most latest upgraded software available right away. Three, it's scalable, you can improve your bandwidth requirement and security requirements over time. And; D, for me, it's great because it's 2.5 times more valuable for me to have you deploy SASE than put a box, which I'd have to keep sending a truck every year to try and upgrade this offer.
Brad Zelnick: Makes perfect sense to me. Keep up the good work. Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: Thanks Brad.
Clay Bilby: Great. Next question from Tal Liani of BofA, followed by Keith Bachman. Go ahead, Tal.
Tal Liani: …I wanted to show you my arc, I made it.
Clay Bilby: Tal?
Tal Liani: I wanted to ask you about the difference between revenue growth, billing and deferred revenue. You increased the guidance for deferred and billings that are very, very strong. We see less of an increase in revenue. What are the dynamics going forward?
Nikesh Arora: I'm going to let Dipak answer, but I will recommend you to try Dali. And you might be able to create a parallel poster of our, and we'll have to figure out who did, which one.
Dipak Golechha: Yeah. Look, Tal, I think at the end of the day, like we are an enterprise company. And as you see in our guidance, like we have a large Q4 guidance with a lot of customers sweating assets, as Nikesh mentioned in our -- in his script. I think, we're just trying to reflect that in our latest forecast, which is what drives the guidance. And so if you have people sweating assets, we don't know exactly what will fall in which quarter, and that's what drives the revenue.
Nikesh Arora: Yeah. Well, I think just to make sure that you don't -- we don't mix the forest from the trees. We are seeing better growth across our business on a TCV basis across our customers. That's driving the billings growth, which obviously then falls into revenue, both short-term and long-term and deferred. I think what you're seeing is the higher mix of software in our expectations going forward, which makes it more ratable over time. It gives us more predictability. Hence, the revenue looks consistent with expectations, and you see the software part, which is sitting in deferred grow faster.
Dipak Golechha: Certainly on SASE, that is the most…
Tal Liani: That makes sense.
Clay Bilby: All right. Great . Thanks. Our next question from Keith Bachman of BMO, followed by Patrick Colville. Go ahead, Keith.
Keith Bachman: Many thanks. Good afternoon, good evening. I wanted to ask you, Nikesh, about Cortex, if I could, more broadly, and I'll break it in two parts. The Cortex journey, the results have been solid, not just this quarter, but for some period of time now. And A, on the competitive front, we've been hearing a lot of discussion from some of the leading vendors that pricing has become much more material in winning share of the CrowdStrikes or what have you. It doesn't appear that that's the case at all in your results from the growth rates and the profitability. So I just want to hear a little bit about pricing. And then more broadly on B, just the competitive dynamics on your results, and you mentioned $100 million run rate on XSIAM, how has the portfolio helped shaping this outcome as you look out over the horizon over the next number of quarters in Cortex?
Nikesh Arora: So Keith, that's a great question. And I'm hesitating on my own analogy, which I was going to give you, but I don't think we should print that. It's clear, it's just -- I don't want to put a word against our Cortex business. First and foremost, look, I've always maintained that the opportunity in the security market arises when there's an inflection point. And I think the endpoint industry went through an inflection point a few years ago when we saw the emergence of EDR and XDR players. And you saw that, I'd say, perhaps the normalization of pure endpoint antivirus-type players in the market. And what's happened is if you look at the evolution, we've gone from a few endpoint players to many, and you're beginning to see convergence again down to two or three people. And I'd say that we are one of the three growing XDR vendors where customers are choosing us. We have one of the best POC outcomes across the entire market vis-à-vis other players. So I'd say today, if you're looking for an XDR outcome, there's possibly two or three vendors always in the fray are beginning to see ourselves to. That was not the case three years ago. That was not the case two years ago. So we're happy with our position, I think, one. Two, XDR is a pipeline business because it's pretty consistent to your point about pricing, the deal sizes are pretty consistent, and they're sort of in a range and you got to have a lot of deals to your pipeline and get some conversion going from them. Cloud and SASE can be big. I still have $40 million cloud deal, $40 million SASE deal. I don't have $40 million XDR deals. They're all in the same swim lane, and you can substitute one for the other. And we see consistent growth. Now where I think our secret sauce is kicking in and should kick in is XSIAM only works with XDR. And what's interesting is we've seen very early, we've had 15 customers of XSIAM in the last 12 weeks, and they're all north of $1 million. Very early, we're seeing customers saying, I'd like XSIAM. And we're saying, listen, you can only get XSIAM if you're going to buy XDR. So we're beginning to see there's a pull because of an outcome-based oriented XSIAM. Again, as I said to Hamza, don't get ahead of your skids, this is a shift we're trying to engender in the industry, but we think that the way to drive XDR for us in the long-term is going to be by creating the best security outcome in the SoC for the customer. But they realize I need good data. The only way I get good data is to Palo Alto, XDR which allows us to go create the security outcomes in XSIAM. So that's our approach. Until then, we're just going to keep our head down, grind at the pipeline, make sure we can win the deals. But for us, we're headed for the bigger price because I can do a lot of XSIAM business where I can XDR seed it into my customers. So XDR pricing is less contentious for me. It's more interesting for me to get the right customer in XDR. So you noticed there's a certain part of the market we play in. We don't play in the low to mid-end of the market in XDR. We don't have 500 customer -- 500 user customers. We like to get the 10,000, 15,000, the higher end of the XDR customers because we think that is a high transfer into XSIAM in the future. We've been doing that consistently for the last few years trying to build that base so as when the XSIAM is ready, we can start encouraging our customers to evolve from XDR to XSIAM.
Clay Bilby: Next is Patrick Colville of Scotiabank, followed by Matt Hedberg. Go ahead, Pat.
Patrick Colville: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. And it's good to be back. So I want to ask about margin. So I mean, really impressive to see what you guys printed in the margin. I mean, looking at the numbers for fiscal second quarter. To me, the two most important levers were the product gross margin and the sales and marketing kind of costs that were moderated. I guess as we think about the remainder of the year, how should we model out those two levers? So should we continue to expect less incremental pressure from supply chain costs on the product GMs? And how far can this S&M efficiency go?
Nikesh Arora: Well, I think, Patrick, first of all, is Dipak made your life easier by giving you an operating margin guidance for the year. So you don't have to worry about the component parts. So you can just look at the total and have a wonderful time. Save you some modeling at Palo Alto. So that notwithstanding, I think between Dipak and I, we've both said that -- I contemplated putting this in our earnings script. I had a meeting with an investor. Dipak and I had a meeting for hours about six months to seven months ago. And they took us through the brute force of profitability and margins and margin expansion and long-term EPS for Palo Alto. And the other day, Dipak and I looked at each other and say, you know what, growth is important, but growth -- profitable growth is even more important. And I'd say, there's a series of programs that Dipak has been running over the last six months, which include looking at gross margin across all of our products, looking at our spend across categories, looking at headcount. So this is a sustained program we have in place. We're going to moderate our way through it to make sure that we don't impact our ability to generate the right amount of growth and right amount of profitable growth. But I think, the thing I'll leave you with is that, we've given the guidance for the full year for operating margin, how it's going to evolve. We think it's a very good place compared to where we were expecting to be right now. And I think, we've also given you hope that we don't believe this is the end. We believe we can keep improving from here. So for now, that's all we're going to say.
Patrick Colville: All right. Thank you, so much.
Clay Bilby: All right. Next, we've got Matt Hedberg of RBC followed by Jonathan Ho. Go ahead, Matt.
Matt Hedberg: Cool. Thanks, guys. Congrats from me as well. Nikesh, I have to go back to SASE. I mean the 50% growth in ARR off of a large base is impressive. And you guys took a different approach this year in terms of integrating your core firewall and your SASE sales force. Can you talk about the strides in those conversations into the other sort of 50,000 firewall customers that aren't SASE customers? How does that discussion go? And if -- just because it feels like such a marriage that makes so much sense from a cross-sell perspective?
Nikesh Arora: Yes. Matt, look, I think a happy firewall customer is a customer who at least has a good feeling about Palo Alto. And I think, if they've deployed our security services, they're even better, because they know how those security capabilities work. And now we're working though each of these customers to trying to work with them on their Zero Trust strategy. SASE is generally a long lead time, long conversation, because it's not just security. I think the part which sometimes gets lost in this -- in some of the analysts, is that SASE is actually -- you're taking -- say, the firewall, I give you a firewall, you run the firewalls in your network, it's all good. You run your growing product. In SASE, I run your network. I take the traffic from your laptop onto me, on to GCP, and route the traffic for you. So now I'm part of your mission-critical capabilities. That means my network has to be strong, my latency has to be low, my availability has to be high. That's not a traditional question security CoIP companies have been asked. They're not used to running networks. That's why I just fall off my chair when I keep hearing, there are seven other vendors building SASE solutions. I'm like, yes, good luck, learn how to run a network. So there's no coincidence that we decided that we were not going to run the network. We're going to let AWS and GCP run the network for us, because that's what they do really well. And they have cloud capability with low latency. So we've built our SASE stack, which runs now concurrently on GCP and AWS, allowing us to give you availability, which is higher than those two individually. So we think in the long term, that's the right answer, right? Now, clearly, we're not 11 years old in SASE. We're 3.5 years old in SASE. So there are some things which we’ll get stumped on, because there are features and capability we need to keep building, because there are edge cases which had been brought to the forefront. That's where Lee and his team are doing a phenomenal job, continuing to keep us at the top of the sort of pyramid of that topic. We're working on some really exciting capabilities in the upcoming future. We'll inform you in the next upcoming quarters. But we feel very good about our SASE pipeline, our on ramp. They're lumpy. They're large deals. But there is product market fit, and we're seeing success.
Clay Bilby: All right. And our next question from Jonathan Ho of William Blair followed by Saket Kalia. Go ahead, Jonathan.
Jonathan Ho: Congratulations. Just wanted to maybe start out, you've seen some tremendous large deal success this quarter. In terms of the platform consolidation discussions with customers, what are you seeing? And is there evidence of customers maybe standardizing on Palo Alto across multiple areas? What could drive that sort of trend over time? Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: So William, the reason we showcased the millionaire customers, the $5 million deals and the $10 million deal slide, is there's a journey. By the way, I'm going to send you a Palo Alto shirt, so you can at least wear that in this meeting. You can wear that other one other times. But anyway, so yeah, we showed you a slide of $1 million and $5 million and $10 million because customers go through a journey. And it's very rarely you walk into a fresh customer, and we convinced them to go spend tens of millions of dollars to this and consolidate. So it's usually an evolutionary process where we've become the firewall vendor of choice. They go with us on SASE. They're working on cloud. They see the concurrence of cloud and SASE. They have XDR. They want to get to XSIAM. So slowly and steadily, we are showing them the benefits of consolidation. I'll tell you, us being leaders in 13 categories helps because the first time you used the word consolidation, the first reaction of the CIO or CISO is, wait a minute, I want the best stuff. I just don't want it because you have it. Then we say, wait a minute, our stuff is the best up as well as it works together. So it's a journey. It is not something that is a panacea that every customer comes in and walks in, but our teams are now focused towards trying to evolve our customers down that path or across that journey, right? And that's why we can go out and do a deal. I think our largest deal this quarter is north of $75 million.
Clay Bilby: All right. Our next question from Saket Kalia of Barclays followed by Joe Gallo. Go ahead, Saket.
Saket Kalia: Okay. Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. Numbers speak for themselves, Nikesh. Maybe a question for you. A lot of excitement around XSIAM. Some interesting wins you called out as well in your AI section. But maybe a strategic question for you. As you think ahead, maybe the next couple of years for XSIAM, how do you think that, that will have started to disrupt the SIM market, either from a tech or a pricing perspective? And maybe just to flip that on its head a little bit, is it possible that tools like XSIAM maybe help expand the SIM market?
Nikesh Arora: So I think, Saket, the SIM market doesn't have a pricing problem. It has a value problem. I spend a lot of money. I don't get enough value. And if you ask some of the customers out there, how do they use the SIM, SIM is used post-breach or post-event to figure out what happened. A SIM is not doing on-the-fly real-time blocking. So when SolarWinds happens, Log4j happens, you can go to your SIM and look at where it happened and figure out and trace it back and try and block the whole. What it won't do for you is stop it mid-flight. And that's a paradigm shift as far as security is concerned. The only way you can do that and stop it mid-flight is analyzing data as it's being created. So to us, the reason we call XSIAM not SIM is here's our words. We watch the data in flow. We watch it coming from the endpoint. We cross correlate mid-flight with firewall data. We go and triage it. We automate some of the alert, some of the noise away. And we're looking at like real incidents between triage already, which are not being put in some large data lake and then running query language against to see how do I solve the problem. They're already doing it in the back end. Now of course, with the availability of new LLMs that are out there, which you all I'm sure have been talking about and dealing with in their free time, they do a lot more useful things than write poetry for your wife. They can actually analyze data to tell you what is anomalous and what is off pattern. And if you can figure that out, then what do you have to do? You have to go ahead and remediate it. How do you remediate it? You got to be a firewall to remediate a network. You've got to be an endpoint to remediate the endpoint. You got to be Prisma Cloud, remediate it in the cloud. So I think what XSIAM is going to do is going to bring real-time capability in the SOC, or real-time capability in security. It's early days. Again, I'm going to say – keep repeating, reputation doesn’t spoil the prayer, don't get ahead of itself, but this is where we're heading. And if you can picture chat ChatGPT 10 years from now, picture AI and security 10 years from now. You will not have humans trying to analyze because it'd be too hard for humans to analyze petabytes of data. Already, the data in an organization is too much for a security analyst to analyze.
Clay Bilby: All right. Great. Next question from Joe Gallo of Jefferies, followed by Ben Bollin of Cleveland. Go ahead, Joe.
Joe Gallo: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Can you just comment on the execution in cloud security despite the backdrop of hyperscaler growth moderation? And then maybe more importantly, where customers are in the journey to cloud security consolidation? It still feels like the Wild West of a lot of disparate products in that category. When does that market merge, which I'd imagine benefits to? Thanks.
Nikesh Arora: Thanks, Joe. So two quick answers. One, we're still the largest player with north of 2,000 customers in cloud security. I don't know, if you explicitly called it out, but our largest cloud security was $40 million this past quarter. I don't know any other vendor in the cloud security space who's doing half of that in a quarter in one deal. So yes, there are many small players out there, but we've seen a bit of churn in the market where some small players have kind of been acquired and gone. Does that mean we'll be the only player? No, there'll be other players in the medium term, but we feel comfortable that there are people who are consolidating. It feels like the Wild West because customers are still not fully in the full cloud security platform mold. So they've not fully embraced the need to have all these things connected, but I think it's a matter of time and a matter of demonstration that it's going to happen. In terms of your question around where we are, and we talked about that in the prepared remarks around hyperscalers. Remember, the cloud security market is a few billion dollars. The hyperscalable market hundreds of billions of dollars. Now the difference is when you commit to a hyperscaler, you commit that you're going to move, you're going to transition, you spend a lot of money. And a lot of that stuff sits in deferred revenue because they are not fully deployed, or customers haven't fully consumed. Cloud security applies to stuff that you consume, right? Like, if you haven't consumed it, or you aren't ready to consume it, they're not going to be buying cloud security. So I think we have a little bit of a gap in terms of when people commit to when they deploy it, to when they take cloud security. I just think the – that stuff can slow down for a while, but it's still got – there's a lot of headroom for us to get from where we are. Even, if we got to all the customers who are in deployment or are deployed, I think we should see a steady continued growth for Prisma Cloud. So the market demand, to me, is not where the challenge is. The challenge for us or the opportunity is to go convince as many customers as we can that this is a platform play. You have to consolidate across multiple modules. You have to have stuff talk to each other on a constant basis, otherwise, you end up in the same situation as you were in enterprise security many --.
Clay Bilby: Our last question today is from Ben Bollin of Cleveland Research. Go ahead, Ben.
Ben Bollin: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. Nikesh, you've talked about some GSI opportunities in the past. I'm interested in how you see that channel developing? What type of tail you see there? And how meaningful your platform is becoming for those partners? Thanks.
Nikesh Arora: Thanks, Ben. I used to say that, about a year ago that, I've had more CIO conversations in a quarter than I did in many years. I'd now say that about GSIs. I'd say in the last six months, I've had more GSI conversations than I had in the first five years of Palo Alto, or four and a half years of Palo Alto, right? And the reason is GSIs are interested in transformation. They're interested in where they can go into a customer and deploy a much better security outcome for them. We were not relevant as a firewall company with SASE, with cloud security, with now XSIAM, they see a real opportunity to go in and do some transformation for their customers. And transformation for them means revenue to them and means a solid product in the back. I'd say most GSIs are still early is in their journey to build a full cybersecurity competency across the board. And there, they'd rather deal with lesser vendors than more. So, us being leaders in certain categories, plays into our strength and our ability to partner with them. I think you -- we are already, without specifically calling out deals, there are many deals where we are partnered with GSIs, where they are the front. We work with them to be as part of a larger transformation project, and we're seeing more and more of that.
Clay Bilby: With that, we conclude the Q&A portion of our call today. I'll turn it back over to Nikesh for his final remarks.
Nikesh Arora: Look, first of all, I want to thank all of you for joining our call. I also want to thank our employees, who work really hard towards delivering these results. I have to say six months ago, when we've started to see warning signs, we pivoted hard. We made sure that our teams got ahead of it, and they have delivered. So, I want to thank all of them for their contribution. As I said, this is this is a challenging macro environment out there. And the only way we're going to get through this as Palo Alto Networks is to keep our head down and execute. And that's what we intend to do. Once again, thank you, guys and see you next quarter.

Nikesh Arora: Thank you, Clay. Good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our earnings call. As you can see, we had a solid first quarter where we showed balanced top line growth and a demonstrable focus on profitability. Early in the quarter, we saw some customer behavior changes and have adapted our operations to align with the changing market conditions.  On the top line, billings grew 27% year-over-year, while RPO grew 38%. We have consistently maintained that cybersecurity is the most innovative sector of the technology industry. Demonstrate progress on our transformation, we have shared how our new cloud delivered and cloud-enabled offerings are contributing to our business via our NGS ARR. In that context, this quarter, our NGS ARR hit a key milestone. It crossed the $2 billion mark and grew 67% year-over-year.  As the macroeconomic environment changes, we are accelerating our efforts to drive incremental operating leverage in our business. Given that we're the largest independent cybersecurity business, we can meaningfully improve our margins over the next phase of our company's next cycle. Our focus on profitability in the quarter drove operating income growth of 44% year-over-year with operating margins up 260 basis points during the same period. We also generated over $1 billion in free cash flow in the quarter.  For the second quarter in a row, we generated net income on a GAAP basis as we focus on GAAP profitability for the fiscal year. At the center of our strategy is the need to drive more consolidation to get customers to a better security posture. Towards that end, we continue to see large cross-platform buys and grow our millionaire customers at a steady clip.  Our customers have been in a journey with us, initial deals that give them comfort with our products and help distinguish our abilities from our competition, over time, lead to customers seeing an opportunity to consolidate into one of our platforms. As they get comfortable with either Strata, Prisma or Cortex, we see them looking at further consolidation across multiple platforms from us. This strategy has allowed us to continue to transition our deal sizes with satisfied customers, and we expect this to continue.  Consistent with that approach, we have had some marquee deals this quarter. The U.S. federal government agency chose our Cortex technology. This transaction allows the total spend to grow into 9 figures with additional years in customer option. This selection highlights unique capabilities and market leadership of our Expanse technology, which was at the center of this transaction. We received a purchase order for the first 3 years of the deal for over $60 million in Q1.  A large U.S. utility signed a 7-figure deal for software firewalls, security subscription and the Prisma Cloud. The customer has hundreds of appliance-based firewalls, and chose our software firewalls because of our consistent architecture, and choose Prisma Cloud as a standardized security across 4 public clouds. A major European media company signed an 8-figure multiproduct deal, replacing several incumbent network security vendors and consolidating on Palo Alto Networks, including our full line of cloud delivered security subscriptions.  We closed a 7-figure deal with a U.S. technology company, spanning all 3 platforms. The customer did not have our physical firewalls in the environment, but valued our consistency of software firewall deployment across on-premise and cloud. Our unique Expanse offering and the total cost of ownership benefits of consolidating on our platforms. You can see evidence of our broader success with large customer commitments in our active millionaire customer count, where we added over 230 year-over-year in the first quarter.  We continue to innovate across our platforms and get recognized by the market for our abilities. This quarter saw us launch software composition analysis in Prisma Cloud, SaaS security posture management and SASE, and just this week, across our next-generation firewalls. Lastly, we announced the general availability of XSIAM in Cortex.  External recognition of our innovation is important to us as many customers rely on this third-party validation as a part of their evaluation process. This quarter, we received leadership recognition in 2 new categories, adding cloud security posture management, or CSPM, and cloud-native application protection platform, or CNAPP, to our list.  Let's take a deeper look at our 3 platforms. We have continued to see solid growth in our network security business. Our innovations in the appliance firewall form factor, including our Gen 4 refresh and our investments in the virtual form factor, have continued to drive our share gains. On a year-over-year basis, we have gained approximately 3 percentage points of market share in the appliance market and 7 percentage points in the VM market. Our customers see an opportunity to drive standardization and make decisions to move away from competitors that have not kept up with our pace of innovation.  We also see many customers extending the standardization to SASE. Many are in the relatively early stages of executing SASE, given it involves changes to their security network architectures. Our Prisma SASE offering has gained industry recognition, and we've seen an increasing number of wins within our installed base, as well as with new customers. To put this into perspective, our firewall customer base is over 15x larger than our SASE customer base. With our core sellers now enabled and executing and driving SASE into the installed base, SASE continues to represent our largest pipeline.  Consolidation of network security capabilities by our customers is driving a [tad] (ph) subscription into our installed base across all firewall form factors. Our constant innovation and capability expansion in network security has been a hallmark of our platform since we entered the market over 15 years ago. While we have highlighted the number of new subscriptions we offer, we have also reimagined our existing capabilities. Our advanced URL filtering and threat prevention versions leverage deep learning to block evasive, zero-day unknown attacks in real time. Yesterday, we introduced the advanced version WildFire to stop more zero-day cloud attacks as part of our PAN-OS 11.0 Nova release. The new subscriptions provide significant additional value to our installed base and have already seen promising adoption.  Moving on to Prisma Cloud. Prisma Cloud continues to be the industry's leading CNAPP platform built from best-in-class acquisition and organic innovation. We acquired Bridgecrew 18 months ago to shift left and introduced the cloud core security module with infrastructure as code scanning. Building on this, we released our SCA, or software composition analysis solution in Q1. The integration of SCA with the Prisma Cloud platform, enables developers and security teams to prioritize known vulnerabilities that impact the application life cycle proactively. We have seen hundreds of Prisma Cloud customers use our IAC and SCA capabilities as part of our cloud core security module.  We continue to see Prisma Cloud customers increase their credit consumption as they expand their hyperscaler footprint and adopt more of our 9 modules such as cloud code. Half of our Prisma Cloud customers are using 2 or more modules, and nearly 20% are using 4 or more modules. In Q1, our credit consumption grew 55% year-over-year.  Building further upon our success, shifting left with IAC Security and ASC adoption, we're doubling down on investing in software supply chain security. Today, we announced our intent to acquire Cider Security, which is key to the strategy. Cider brings the ability to visualize customers' application development and deployment environment, analyze the tools, identify risks and how to remediate them. This ability to secure the software supply chain is backed up by Cider's leading CICD security research team. With the integration of Cider's capabilities into Prisma Cloud after the closing of the acquisition, we will further our leadership in cloud security, helping enterprises secure applications from code to cloud.  Across Cortex, we are focused on driving momentum in a number of areas. The first key is ensuring we are winning customers with our best-of-breed product capability. In Q1, we saw strong Cortex large deal performance. We had success not only with XDR, XSOAR and Expanse on a stand-alone basis, but a number of notable examples of multiproduct deals. This included a multimillion dollar transaction at a European construction company, which replaced their existing SIEM and SOAR with XDR Pro and XSOAR. One of the government customer adopted XDR Pro and XSOAR in a 7-figure deal as it formalized a new SoC for multiple agencies. These are in addition to the federal customer we already talked about.  We continue to innovate across Cortex during Q1, delivering a new managed detection and response service built on our XDR capability and enriched by our Unit 42 world-class threat intelligence. I'm most excited about the general availability of XSIAM, our breakthrough autonomous security operations platform. Our launch event for XSIAM were oversubscribed, and we see a lot of resonance with our product and its future roadmap as customers reimagine the world of SOC management.  Just a few months ago, we had launched a design partner program. Most recently, we've had 2 multimillion-dollar commitments from XSIAM design partners as they expanded into production deployments. At this point, the majority of our design customers have transitioned to paying customers. In fact, we are carefully managing how we onboard future XSIAM customers because we want to ensure fast customer time to value. Our interest list is north of 50 customers, who would like us to deploy XSIAM. We're qualifying them and carefully onboarding them so that we can scale the business appropriately and give them value.  In summary, I feel our teams did a good job in a seasonally tough quarter, where also the macroeconomic climate is fast changing. I'm sure all of you are trying to figure out what all of this means for us over the next 3 quarters.  As we all know, the Fed is working to tame inflation impacting growth. While cybersecurity is somewhat resilient, we do see some marginal signs of impact. Cybersecurity deals are getting more scrutiny, suggesting deeper and longer reviews of transformational projects. New conversations that include payment terms and discounts are causing deal cycles to elongate.  On a positive front, while some deals have been sized down and broken to phases, we are experiencing few deal cancellations. We do this -- expect this behavior to become the norm over the next year. The impact is not uniform across all sectors, but those feeling the impact of interest rate increases are more likely to scrutinize their budgets than those prospering in the high interest rate environment. Technology, CPG and some parts of retail are feeling an impact, while utilities, oil and gas, defense and public sector verticals continue to be on course of their plans.  Coming off Q4, Q1 tends to be a seasonally more challenging quarter, but we were able to tame some of these early trends by doubling down on execution. FY '23 will require continued excellent execution to overcome some of these macro impacts.  Towards that end, we have already taken concrete action. We have front-loaded hiring of our field teams to increase coverage across our customer base. We have also expanded our level of activity around both new accounts and existing customers to ensure faster time to value with our products.  As we discussed last quarter, we have seen some customers delay hardware refresh plans. While they will ultimately need to refresh, some are choosing to defer and reassess at a later date. I continue to believe that hardware will have a long-term industry growth rate in the 5% to 8% range, and we might trend to the lower end of the range. However, coupled with an easing supply chain, I expect that near term, we'll continue to report a low double-digit growth rate for product revenue.  Too many vendors leads to complexity and increased risk. Given the increased scrutiny and return requirements, the silver lining for Palo Alto Networks is that we are having more conversations around consolidating platforms than we've ever had before. We think customers are less likely to purchase newer security products. Instead, they will continue to consolidate towards like-for-like capabilities from fewer vendors.  Cybersecurity is critical to IT transformation and hyperscaler adoption. We believe that whilst there may be short-term bumps to the pace of investment by some of the customers, these projects will continue for the medium and long term. We see cybersecurity spending as resilient, but not immune to customers adjusting for the current environment. Having said that, I continue to believe that we can overcome these macroeconomic impacts with strong and focused execution, which is what we plan to do.  It was just 6 to 9 months ago that we were talking about the challenges we face in the competition for talent. We're now finding it easier to recruit and hire top talent, but also seeing lower attrition rates, which necessitates fewer overall new hires. We will closely monitor our hiring as well as our overall spending to further sharpen our focus on efficiency. As we proceed through the year and focus internally how we respond to the external landscape, sharp execution from our teams will be paramount.  Before I turn the call over to Dipak, I want to provide some perspectives on how we're thinking about the forecast. We are adjusting the high end of our guidance ranges for revenue and billings for the year for the upside we saw in Q1. Within our revenue, we do expect slightly higher product revenue growth in the range of 10-plus percent as we are able to ship some orders that had previously been held back by the more challenging supply chain situation I mentioned earlier.  We're also reflecting the strength we saw in NGS ARR during Q1, with higher NGS ARR guidance range for the year. This reflects not only the performance of our Cortex Prisma Cloud SASE and software firewalls, but also the success we have seen in advanced cloud-delivered subscriptions that I noted.  On a positive note, we're focusing more and more on execution and how our teams focus on driving incremental operating leverage. Towards that end, we were able to take steps to accelerate the profitability we previously outlined at our Analyst Day, which was reflected in our Q1 operating margin and EPS performance. We will remain focused here. And as a result, we're raising our operating margin guidance for the year by 50 basis points.  This, as well as higher interest income, is driving the increase to our EPS and cash flow guidance as Dipak will cover. Over the last 3 years on a compounded basis, our EPS and adjusted free cash flow have grown below our revenue growth rate as we made significant investments. We are not targeting EPS and adjusted free cash flow to both grow north of 30% at our guidance midpoint, which is ahead of our revenue growth.  We are confident in our strategy and wouldn't trade our position with any other cybersecurity company. We believe our broad portfolio focus as an advantage as we focus on emerging areas where customers are allocating new budget dollars, while also capturing an increased portion of the customers broader cybersecurity budget as they look to consolidate spending. We will continue to invest for the long term with our commitment to fund innovation, while we also pursue near-term opportunities to drive efficiencies in our business.  With that, I will turn the call over to Dipak.
Dipak Golechha: Thank you, Nikesh, and good afternoon, everyone. For Q1, revenue of $1.56 billion grew 25% and was above the high end of our guidance range. Product grew 12% and total services grew by 30%. By geography, we saw growth across all theaters, with EMEA up 32%, the Americas growing 24% and JPAC growing 26%. Our next-generation security capabilities are increasingly driving our results, and our NGS ARR grew 67% and at $2.11 billion exceeded $2 billion for the first time. We continue to see strength driven by our broad portfolio within next-generation security. This includes Cortex, Prisma Cloud, Prisma SASE, software firewalls and the advanced versions of cloud-delivered subscriptions. We remain optimistic about the prospects of this broad and diverse portfolio.  We delivered total billings of $1.75 billion, up 27%, which was above the high end of our guidance range. Total deferred revenue in Q1 was $7.2 billion, an increase of 39%. Remaining performance obligation, or RPO, was $8.3 billion, increasing 38%, with current RPO representing about half of our RPO similar to previous quarters.  Moving beyond the top line metrics. I already highlighted non-GAAP gross margin of 74.3% was down 10 basis points year-over-year, with some incremental supply chain-related expenses being incurred for components and shipping. Operating margin was 20.6%, an increase of 260 basis points year-over-year. This strength in operating margin was the result of lower expenses as a percent of revenue across all 3 expense lines, R&D, sales and marketing and G&A. We have already focused on aligning our investment plans to the areas of highest return. And thus, as we proceed through this environment, it is sharpening of these efforts.  Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter grew 56% to $266 million or $0.83 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22%. GAAP net income was $20 million or $0.07 per basic share and $0.06 per diluted share.  Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Our balance sheet is strong, closing Q1 with the highest cash and investable balance ever with cash equivalents and investments of $5.9 billion. We have ample flexibility to repay debt coming due, invest in the business, do tuck-in acquisitions and return capital to shareholders. We're in the enviable position to be able to do all of these at the same time.  Q1 cash flow from operations was $1.24 billion. We generated more than $1 billion in free cash flow for the first time in our history, with total free cash flow of $1.2 billion this quarter. This puts us well on track to hit our annual guidance, which we are raising today. This cash flow performance was largely driven by strong collections in the quarter, that we expected based on the strength of our business in Q4. During Q1, we did not repurchase any of our shares. As a reminder, our share repurchase program is opportunistic, and we're committed to this method of returning cash to shareholders over the medium term.  As Nikesh discussed on the M&A front, we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Cider Security for approximately $195 million in cash, excluding the value of replacement equity awards, subject to adjustments. We expect this deal to close in the fiscal second quarter. We expect the financial impact of the transaction to be immaterial to our fiscal '23 guidance.  Stock-based compensation ticked up slightly as a percentage of revenue quarter-over-quarter as expected with the issuance of a portion of our fiscal year '23 grants. On a year-over-year basis, we continue to manage our down as a percent of revenue, in line with our long-term plans. As we've had a number of questions about the impact of foreign exchange volatility on our business. I wanted to remind investors that we price our products in dollars around the world and therefore not exposed to the direct translation impact to revenue that you may be hearing about from other companies.  Now moving on to our guidance for Q2 and for the year. For the second fiscal quarter of 2023, we expect billings to be in the range of $1.94 billion to $1.99 billion, an increase of 21% to 24%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.63 billion to $1.66 billion, an increase of 24% to 26%. We expect non-GAAP EPSto be in the range of $0.76 to $0.78, an increase of 31% to 35%.  For the fiscal year, we expect billings to be in the range of $8.95 billion to $9.1 billion, an increase of 20% to 22%. We expect NGS ARR to be in the range of $2.65 billion to $2.7 billion, an increase of 40% to 43%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $6.85 billion to $6.91 billion, an increase of 25% to 26%. We expect product revenue growth in the range of 10%, up slightly, as Nikesh outlined in his remarks. We expect fiscal '23 operating margins to be in the range of 19.5% to 20%, up 50 basis points versus the range we outlined coming into the year.  We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.37 to $3.40, an increase of 34% to 37%. We expect adjusted free cash flow margin to be 34.5% to $35.5%, and we continue to expect to be GAAP profitable for fiscal year 2023.  Additionally, please consider the following modeling points. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 22% for Q2 and fiscal '23, subject to the outcome of future tax legislation. For Q2 '23, we expect net interest and other income of $18 million to $20 million. We expect Q2 '23 diluted shares outstanding of 320 million to 326 million shares. We expect fiscal year '23 diluted shares outstanding of $325 million to $331 million. We expect Q2 capital expenditures of $40 million to $45 million, and we expect fiscal year capital expenditures of $190 million, $200 million.  As an additional modeling support based on our prior seasonality, we expect the quarter-over-quarter revenue and billings growth for Q3 '23 to be in line with last year. Also, we expect operating income in Q3 to be roughly flat with our Q2 levels.  To wrap up, we are confident in our strategy and wouldn't trade our position with any other cybersecurity company. We're focused on sharp execution and sales intensity to stay ahead of the changing macroeconomic environment. At the same time, we're focused on taking steps to accelerate our profitability as I guided.  With that, I will turn the call back over to Clay for the Q&A portion of the call.
A - Clay Bilby: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question of the evening comes from Saket Kalia of Barclays.
Saket Kalia: Okay. Great. nice set of results. Nikesh, maybe for you. You mentioned some early customer behavior changes. I was wondering if you could just expand on that a little bit and how that manifested in the business? It doesn't seem like there was much of an impact in the NGS business. In fact, that accelerated growth year-over-year. I wonder if you could just expand on where that customer behavior changed and how you've incorporated that into the full year guide?
Nikesh Arora: Look, Saket, as I mentioned, we are seeing customers spend more time trying to understand what they're spending money on. There's more questions, the CFOs are getting involved. So larger deals are getting more scrutiny. We noticed that early in the quarter, so we accelerated our efforts in trying to get those deals in front of those CFOs much faster than earlier in the quarter as opposed to waiting towards the end.  In certain cases, customers came back and said, I'd like this now. I'd like to hold off on this and buy it next quarter. That just means we have to go far more pipeline much faster and much harder to make sure we can make up for those deals with other deals in our pipeline. At any point in time, our pipeline, as you would expect, is larger than what we expect to deliver in that quarter. So we have deals in the pipeline. We just have to work with our customers to solidify them. And what we have done is, because of that behavior, we have increased scrutiny internally, we've increased efforts with our sales teams to get ahead of this and we're just increasing the activity of execution. We front-loaded our hires. We hired 550 direct sales rep as quickly as we could in the quarter because this environment is going to continue. And the only way to fight this to get more coverage out of the field. Get work coverage, get more focus on getting deals done, get them across the line.  There's not a demand problem, right? All that is happening is that people are pushing out some of their products, means you just need to get more active with our customer base to make sure we get more business into our pipeline. This is what we're doing.
Clay Bilby: Next question from Hamza Fodderwala of Morgan Stanley..
Hamza Fodderwala: And a lot of great clarity in the prepared remarks. Nikesh, I wanted to talk a little bit about supply chain security and Cider. I think a few months ago, there was an executive order from the Biden administration around securing software supply chains. I know it's early days in the acquisition, the acquisition is not even dry yet, but -- what do you feel about sort of the pipeline, the opportunity the Palo Alto Networks being now the largest cybersecurity vendor for the U.S. federal government? What are you seeing there? And is there interest already from that front?
Nikesh Arora: Let me comment, and then I'm going to let our birthday boy, Lee Klarich speak to this, because we've got to give him work to do. It's his birthday and came to work. As you know, Prisma Cloud continues to go from strength-to-strength. We see very large deals in the hopper in our pipeline, and we're beginning to see more and more seriousness on cloud security from our customers. I highlighted a customer which has 4 public clouds deployed. They can't do that. They can't secure it with for different native cloud CSP platform security. So we are seeing more interest. We are seeing more engagement. As I've always maintained, I don't believe all the cloud security products have been created. And as you start to see the customers move. So we saw the shift left movement. We went ahead, did Bridgecrew. It's fully integrated. We've seen 65% of our customers begin to use that.  As we're talking to them, we're realizing they have some legacy, some new apps tech vendors in place, which they're deploying and they're trying to use that to take care of supply chain security. Some of that is older architectures, older ways of doing things. But we decided we want to do it differently. If I answer the question, Lee, everything say, Lee, answer the rest of those question.
Lee Klarich: Thank you, Nikesh. Good question, Hamza. So let me make 1 thing very clear. It's not just a U.S. federal government challenge. Anyone who is developing and deploying applications into public cloud, which today is basically everybody has a supply chain risk that they're dealing with. That supply chain risk can come in the form of software, in the form of open source software that they're building into their applications, which brings a certain type of supply chain risk.  And the second type is through all of the tools and applications that they need to use in order to actually build an application. And we've seen that this can easily be hundreds of different third-party tools that they incorporate into the development process that have access to their source code. That is the second form of supply chain risk and sometimes referred to as CICD pipeline risk, and that is a key component of what cider will add to the broader capabilities we have with Prisma Cloud.
Clay Bilby: That is not good to be on mute. Okay, Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank with Andy to follow.
Brad Zelnick: Congrats on the strong execution. Nikesh, I wanted to circle back on your comments about the using supply chain and expectations for hardware growth to be above long-term trend this year. I believe you said low double digit. Just making sure the uptick is solely your view on supply. And just relatedly, when we look at product gross margin, it still seems to be under pressure. Can you help us just reconcile how much of this is mix versus COGS and any other factors to appreciate and what to expect the hardware gross margin?
Nikesh Arora: First of all, Brad remind me to send you a painting for your office, it looks a bit sparse. But that notwithstanding, but I've always maintained the underlying hardware growth in the industry is about 5% to 8%. And I'm not deviated. We've seen changed behavior, people have tried to order ahead because of supply chain constraints. You've seen pricing impacts to drive some of the growth. But I think the underlying growth continues to be the same.  What has happened in the last, I'd say, 4 to 6 months, slowly and steadily, we are seeing easing of some elements of supply chain. There are some components that become easier to get. As you've seen some semiconductor companies are talking about cutting supply or cutting production in memory and NAND and DRAM. So you're already going to see easing in various certain amount of components, which is allowing us to ship product faster. At the same time, some, I'd say, real and perhaps some artificial supply chain constraints are being maintained in the industry. I expect them to ease over time, which should also ease up somewhat pressure on gross margin.  The gross margin impact is purely us having great expedite fees for certain parts. It's really not an underlying component cost issue. So we think those will ease over the next it really depends on suppliers. I think the supply chain easing is happening as we speak, and we should be out of it in the 6 to 9 month time frame at the far end 12. It all depends on when the suppliers stop extracting more from us to try and get us those parts.
Clay Bilby: Next is Andy Nowinski of Wells Fargo.
Andrew Nowinski: Congrats on a great quarter. One of the key metrics that stood out to us, I guess, was the next-gen ARR growth, particularly your net new ARR growth. And I think you mentioned you saw strength across all I was just wondering if you could put a finer point on that and maybe a lot of now the largest component of next-gen security and whether that big deal was included in that ARR this quarter?
Nikesh Arora: So go ahead, Dipak.
Dipak Golechha: Yes. So I would say, look, we feel very good about all the elements of our NGS ARR. Like just to repeat, we've got SASE, we've got Cortex. We've got cloud and we have some of the new cloud live services. The majority of the growth continues to be the SASE cloud Cortex side of the house. So I think all of that is good. There are portions of deals we don't comment on deals like specifically, but if they have the appropriate products, then we contribute the appropriate amount of ARR on them.
Nikesh Arora: Yes, to your direct question, yes, the expanse deal is in the net new ARR that you've seen.
Clay Bilby: Next up is Phil Winslow of Credit Suisse, with the Tal Liani to follow.
Philip Winslow: Congrats on another phenomenal quarter. I wanted to focus in on Prisma SASE and Prisma Access. You gave some interesting stats there in terms of penetration into your existing firewall base. But also wins in the cloud for -- with customers that are not current on-premise firewall customers of yours.  When you look at the momentum you're seeing, are you getting better at penetrating that existing base? And are customers starting to understand the value of on-premise off-premise 1 policy? Or are you seeing more momentum even in, call it, displacing competing vendors in the cloud now?
Nikesh Arora: So Phil, first of all, thanks for the compliment. Thanks for the great question. As [indiscernible] asked, and I think I've maintained that I have seen, again more activity this past quarter in C-level executives, some our customers engaging on consolidation plays or getting cloud transformation plays going? And what is interesting is not only our customers are beginning to see increased engagement with GSIs, so global system integrators. So the system integrators are being brought in to try and keep costs down and create a transformation.  So I'm not going to name any one of them, but I'd say more engagement gains across the board with the SI community as well as our direct customers.  In terms of your question, are we seeing engagement from existing customers and net new customers is both there are existing customers who are stepping up and they are on a path to do their transformations, whether they're adopting the cloud. The big highs, Phil, we used to be a firewall company. these to sell firewalls. I got a very secret for you. CIOs and CSOs doing bare walls. Network architects do and they live in 1 corner of the enterprise. CIOs and CISOs do transformation projects. They'll do cloud transformations, they'll do network transformation, they will do soft transformations. And to be honest, we never had a portfolio until about 2.5 years would actually had those conversations.  So what's beginning to happen is we are really building a new muscle as a company, where we are able to engage with CIOs and CSOs. So you've got Amit flying in one direction, [indiscernible] from Europe flying in the other direction. We got PJ Jenkins flying in the third direction, and we let Lee out as well once in a while. So across all of these people, we're having a lot more engagement across customers. And these are long-term plays, but the good news is we show you that a few of these always land in the quarter, so we get a large 8-figure deals in a quarter. These are a consequence of these large transformation conversations would take between 3 to 10 months to germinate into real big deals.  So I think the activity is still high. As I said on the margin, there's scrutiny because people are saying, wait, this is a big deal, can we parse it out and adapt it to our budget. But we're not seeing a reduction in conversation or activity.
Clay Bilby: Next is Fatima Boolani from Citigroup, with Mike Turits next.
Fatima Boolani: Happy birthday, Lee. My gift to you is I won't be asking you a question. Nikesh and Dipak for you, is a commentary on the payment concessions and flexibility in light of a more challenged macro. I want to get a better sense of how pervasive these conversations have been for you in the installed base and maybe more directly what are some of the impacts debut at maybe you're seeing from a deferred revenue mix standpoint and how we should think about invoicing duration and billings duration when we think about our cash flow trajectory in the context of some of those comments.
Nikesh Arora: So Fatima, let me give you context. I want to make sure I'm clear. So far, these are on the margin, okay? This is not mainstream. We do expect the activity to get more in that direction because you can see the Fed continuing to be on this mission to go steam growth, and we expect that's going to cause more customers to pay attention. But let's not -- now as I said in my remarks, there are some industries which are making money hand over fist, talk to oil and gas. They've never made so much money. So the public sector continues to spend with all the geopolitical issues that are out there. And financials, they're making more money, believe it or not. They're fine.  So there are certain segments of the market where these conversations are happening. It's not across the board. We don't expect. I think 50% market is not feeling any pain with the interest rate increases. So take that aside, we take the rest of it -- some of our budgets in place. They have transformation plans in place.  So on the margin, yes, those conversations will increase. As you know, in anticipation of this, we built PANFS, we have a very good motion around providing financing. We're sitting at $5.9 billion of cash. So we are able to finance our customers if they so need to be able to facilitate their transformation project. So the conversation happens between us or our third-party vendors, they're able to go make this happen. I don't know, Dipak, if you want to comment on the deferred billing and deferred revenue comment.
Dipak Golechha: I would say, Fatima, I think Nikesh explained it excellently. And I would just say everything is included in our guidance, like in terms of what we think.
Nikesh Arora: Couple of the flip side, as we've said, we have $5.9 billion in cash. Our entire interest income last year was $19 million. I think our Q1 interest income was twice that. So there's the flip side of that.
Clay Bilby: Okay. Next is Michael Turits of KeyBanc and followed by Jonathan Ho.
Michael Turits: Congrats on solid quarter in a tough environment. Last quarter, Nikesh, I believe that when you talked about your billings guide, you also commented that you could achieve that billings guide with no reduction in product backlog. Is that -- maybe you could talk a little bit, if you could, about backlog in any way to the extent you can in terms of what happened with it this quarter, up, down, flat? And whether you still assume backlog, product backlog, I think, is what you said, flat into the end of the year in order to make the numbers that you've got.
Nikesh Arora: Michael, we don't comment on backlog. As I have said and as Dipak has said, because of supply chain constraints having eased a bit, we have been able to ship product to our customers much faster, which has a positive impact on attached services that we're able to ship them. But remember, our billings grew at 27%. And as we've said in the past, backlog in the overall scheme of things is not as substantial as you might think.
Michael Turits: Okay. So no change to that comment from last quarter about holding backlog to make the billings number?
Nikesh Arora: No. We don't hold backlog to make billings numbers. We try and ship our products to our customers as soon as we can to ensure that they get their products as quickly as they would like. And we report the quarter based on what we've been able to ship.
Clay Bilby: Next to Jonathan Ho, William Blair, with Roger Boyd to follow.
Peter Auty: Great. Let me echo my congratulations as well. And happy birthday, Lee. Can you talk a little bit about the XSIAM traction that you're seeing? And maybe help us understand what this means from an upsell potential standpoint when customers start to move in this direction?
Nikesh Arora: Jonathan, that's a great question, because I'll tell you what, I was positively surprised by the reaction of customers wanting to engage in an XSIAM conversation, both directly, as well as many of the system integration partners who are there. So clearly, there seems to be a pent-up desire to reimagine their so. People are relying on old data ingestion platforms. People are lying on old alert-based optimization and prioritization things. And they all understand that it's physically and humanly impossible to intercept cyber threats by doing it manually. And that seems to be a common realization.  Yet, none of them actually had a solution base presented to them for a long period of time. So what we thought we were doing design partners, we signed up 8,9 design partners. Guess what? In 3 months, all of them say, we don't want to be a design partner, we'd like to start using the product on a commercial basis. So we accelerated our general availability of the product because we had to make sure it's available for those 9 customers, and all of them turn to customers.  Now our sales teams are trying -- are aggressively trying to go out there and pitch it, and we actually have to maintain a wait list to make sure we won't need implementation resources to be able to implement. This is a lift. You're ripping out a data ingestion lake, you're ripping out their existing SIM, yet they have to keep running their SoC in a way that we can transform that. So we're working with GSIs. We're working with third-party partners for them to build the capabilities so you can get this done with a variety of customers.  I've said this before and I still maintain this. Four years ago, when we embarked on this journey, we decided we're going to build a cloud security business, we're going to build a Cortex business, we're going to build a SASE business. As I said, all 3 businesses are on track to be $1 billion businesses. I think XSIAM has a similar potential in a similar time frame to be our fourth business that's going to be in the same category.
Clay Bilby: Is Roger Boyd of UBS, with John Deputy to follow.
Roger Boyd: Congrats on the nice results. Nikesh, you had talked last quarter about extending Prisma Access, Prisma SASE to the entire sales force and really becoming a SASE-first sales organization. I'm just wondering, relative to your expectations, any comments you can provide on what you're seeing from a sales productivity efficiency standpoint?
Nikesh Arora: Well, we said that, and we are in the midst of that transition, we have trained all of our salespeople to become SASE first. We have hired a bunch of people from SASE competitors to lead some of these areas for us. So we continue that field force transformation. At the same time, and as I said, we've hired 550 direct salespeople in the first quarter because we want to increase the coverage. At the same time, we've been able to do that without having to create a specialist sales force on top of that.  So you can see, we also said in our prepared remarks, we are accelerating our path to more profitability because we believe we are going to get those efficiencies we anticipated by making a SASE-first field force. But also doing some other things to drive more and more efficiency across the organization, not just in sales. So we feel pretty comfortable that not only will we get sales productivity, but we also believe we'll get overall productivity in the organization so we can accelerate our operating margin aspirations ahead of our 3-year plan, we'd shared about near than a quarter ago.
Clay Bilby: Next, John DiFucci from Guggenheim with Josh Tilton to follow.
John DiFucci: So really strong NGS ARR quarter, guys. My question is more on the product line. We heard just in [indiscernible] into the quarter of any product refresh that might be happening perhaps is getting extended. And perhaps, and I think it sounds like maybe because of the macro backdrop, some of the stuff you talked about, Nikesh. I guess, first of all, is this accurate? And if so, should we be thinking about perhaps a little like in this quarter, a little bit lower product growth than we saw over the last several quarters, but decent product growth, nevertheless, for perhaps a longer period of time?
Nikesh Arora: I am trying to interpret your question.
John DiFucci: Okay. So I'm talking about the -- what I think is a product refresh and then...
Nikesh Arora: I'm going to let Lee answer it. I promise we got more than 1 question.
Lee Klarich: So John, one of the things I've said in the past in talking about product refresh, as it pertains to the new models that we release is these refreshes typically play out over a fairly long period of time. And so I would suggest like not looking at it as a singular quarter when you think about the trend and how this evolves. Most of our customers are large enterprise customers. They make long-term decisions. These decisions take place over 1, 2, 3-plus years of refinements. So these harder refreshers play out over cycles like that as opposed to on specific quarters.
John DiFucci: Well, it actually affected the results the last time you did it in 2017 for about 2 years. And it looks like you're about a year into it. And I was just wondering if perhaps it could last longer than 2 years this time. That's really the question.
Nikesh Arora: The only thing I am seeing this time - we've seen a lot of extraneous factors which have muted the outcomes for the industry, with the supply chain crisis, with the pandemic, with the Poland supply chain. Now with the Fed increasing interest rates, I'll tell you, one of the easiest decisions for our customers to make is to sweat their assets a little longer. Because it's not like these firewalls suddenly blow up at the end of life. They can be extended. So laces and I don't rather put the money in my cloud transformation and sweat the asset a little longer.  So if you add all to the miss, that's why we went through this whole cybersecurity transformation of the company. We wanted to take away the impact of any 1 product line.
Clay Bilby: Next is Joshua Tilton of Wolfe Research, with Adam Borg to follow.
Unidentified Analyst: It's Patrick on for Josh. It's Patrick on for Josh. Over the last several second quarters, the sequential billings guides have been in the 9% to 10% range. But the guide for next quarter implies a 12% sequential growth. So how do we interpret that? Is it a little more aggressive than usual?
Dipak Golechha: I think probably the way that I would -- I wouldn't interpret too much in it. But at the end of the day, we have pipeline. We have lots of large deals. It really depends on when deals come in. They can have a significant impact on your billings. And so we're just trying to be as transparent as we can in terms of the information that we have on hand. There's no magical math behind the guide.
Clay Bilby: Next is Adam Borg of Stifel, with Rob [ph] to follow.
Adam Borg: I really appreciate it. Maybe just on a topic we haven't heard today on OT cybersecurity, that's an area that we're just picking up more in our checks is seeing some more focus. And I love to think about -- hear a little bit, Nikesh, how you're thinking about the opportunity and what [indiscernible] plays?
Nikesh Arora: Yes, we've been very focused on making sure that we make IoT capability available as part of our integrated portfolio. So you don't have to put get 1 more sensor and get 1 more cybersecurity vendor. Surprisingly, the [indiscernible] can you talk about? We'll let Lee talk about it, yes.
Lee Klarich: Look, OT environments have long been secured by keeping them disconnected from everything else. And there's OT environments that are still running Windows 95, Windows NT, for those who have been around for a while. That obviously has significant risk. And so the way to control that is simply segmented and walled off from the rest of the world. But what's been happening over the last couple of years is OT networks are increasingly being digitized, specific parts of them are having to be connected to the cloud, which also means the OT and the IoT are starting to merge together a little bit more. And so as that happens, there's a greater interest in thinking about what the next generation of security for an OT environment looks like. And so this is where our ability to come in with a next-gen firewall infrastructure that can provide the segmentation where it's needed. But layer on top of that, the IoT OT security capabilities designed to secure that transformation is starting to pay dividends.  I still think this is early days in transformation, but there definitely is a strong interest in these types of organizations. And as Nikesh mentioned earlier, many of these are oil and gas utilities and others that actually are seeing some of the benefits of some of the recent macro environments. And so that's also part of an opportunity to leverage and make investments now.
Clay Bilby: Next, we've got Rob Owens of Piper Sandler with Matt Hedberg to follow up. Go ahead, Rob.
Robbie Owens: Could you drill down a little bit in terms of Fed and what you saw in period, obviously calling out a couple of large deals. But if I rewind, the thought process was that Fed was going to get more linear and less budget flushed typical to the September quarter. So are you seeing those trends play out? Or was this more a budget flush type of quarter? And was it in line with your expectations?
Nikesh Arora: No. It wasn't a budget flush quarter. We've been working the deal, which we announced for a very long time, as you can imagine. Those size deals don't happen overnight. It just happened to converge at the right time for us from a timing perspective. But we're beginning to see the Fed activity get stronger because we're at that point in time with this administration where they've gotten their stuff together across the various agencies, and they've actually started executing against the strategy. So we think, yes, the Fed spend will continue to stay strong and we continue to get linear as time passes, as we get through the rest of this administration's term.  It's always dicey in the first year or first 1.5 years because it's a whole new set of characters, especially if you change institutions where they're still trying to figure out what they want to endorse and what they don't want to. So I think things are more stable and things are going to continue to stay strong in that space.
Clay Bilby: Next is Matt Hedberg from RBC, with Paula.
Matthew Hedberg: Congrats from me as well on the quarter. Dipak, a question for you. Obviously, your pricing U.S. dollars -- but I'm wondering, in international markets, obviously, there's been a huge currency movement. I know historically, partners would absorb a lot of that price movement. I'm just sort of curious how that's happening in some of these customer conversation where the dollar is appreciated pretty materially.
Dipak Golechha: Yes. So I think, look, there's always going to be the isolated instances where it comes up in discussion. But for the most part, our sales reps will try to manage that through different tools that they have available to them and then that's pretty much it.
Nikesh Arora: I think, Matt, that's a fair question in addition to what Dipak said. There have customers who come back and said, look, the currency has moved a lot. Our price has gone up in the last 2 weeks and what can we do about it? In that case, it becomes a conversation. In some cases, we had to adjust prices. But at the same time, like you said, some of them get absorbed by the channel, some of them will get absorbed by the customer, some get absorbed by us.
Clay Bilby: Our last question for the evening will be from Gray Powell of BTIG.
Gray Powell: Congratulations on the strong results. So yes, the NGS ARR really stood out to me. Within that, can you just sort of -- can you remind us on the economics of settling SASE to that of the traditional firewall? Is there any sort of like 1-year trade-off? Or just like how should we think about that playing out as SASE becomes a bigger piece of the mix?
Nikesh Arora: I think it's kind of interesting, all of our SASE deals, I think like-for-like are much larger than our firewalls deals even with the same customer. And they can range from 2x to 3x, and sometimes even up to 5x, depending on the comprehensiveness of the requirement and the customers' desire to deploy. So we have lots and lots of 8-figure deals out there that are being competed for in the SASE space. And I think there's 2 vendors fighting for those deals.  We were not a player, as you know, 2.5 years ago in that space. Now we're almost in every one of the large deals out there head-to-head. So either the deal gets won or lost, but we're in every one of them, and they're typically large sizes. And the economics are better than the security posture is better for the customer, because imagine, if I sell 500 firewalls, it takes customers a serious amount of time to go deploy them, and every time I give a software upgrade to customers to go drive a truck and upgrade all those firewalls because they want to sandbox the upgrade, which leaves them exposed from a security perspective.  And SASE, I can -- I actually -- we actually do the upgrades, and we can get the entire customer base upgrade in this matter two weeks. In some cases, we just announced [indiscernible] 11.0, and we still have a lot of customers who have not upgraded to 10.2, right? So this does improve the security posture, improves the total cost of ownership. And that shows up in a larger deal size because we're shifting costs from the customer to having to be software managed by us and our partners.  So look, the economics of SASE are phenomenal from a deal size perspective as well as from -- they're pretty consistent from a margin perspective. So I think there's still, as I've said in the past, is an $8 billion to $10 billion SASE market out there, and that space is growing in double digits as an opportunity.
Clay Bilby: All right. And with that, we'll conclude the Q&A portion of our call, and I'll turn it back over to Nikesh for his closing remarks.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you, Clay. Thank you, everyone, again, for joining us. We look forward to seeing many of you at upcoming investor events. I also want to thank our customers, partners and employees around the world for helping us deliver these great results in such a tough environment. With that, have a great day.

===== 2022 Q4  (2022-08-22 16:30:00) =====
Clay Bilby: Good day, everyone, and welcome to Palo Alto Networks Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. I am Clay Bilby, Head of Palo Alto Networks Investor Relations.

We would like to note management is scheduled to participate in the Citibank Global Technology Conference and Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology Conference in September. I will now turn the call over to Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you, Clay. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for our earnings call. As you can see from the video, we were excited to celebrate the 10th anniversary of our IPO in early July. Our employees are engaged and excited as we continue confidently on our mission to be the cybersecurity partner of choice. Moving to Q4, I'm pleased to report that we again saw very strong results, starting with top line results that were well ahead of the guidance we initially outlined for the fiscal year '22. We delivered this growth while balancing our profitability commitments, we also made significant investments to continue to transform our company and take advantage of the large and rapidly growing market opportunity we see in cybersecurity. On the top line, billings growth of 44% was the highest we've reported in four years. We also grew RPO ahead of our revenue growth rate. The key focus of our team has been rapidly positioning us as a constant cybersecurity innovator. And one way we measure our progress is how our NGS ARR develops. We're delighted to report this metric grew 60%, reaching $1.9 billion exiting the year. We are expecting it to reach $2.6 billion in FY '23. If this was an independent start-up, it would be amongst the fastest-growing cybersecurity businesses to achieve scale. Within our core network security business, Firewall as a Platform billings grew 26%. When we started reporting this metric, the intent was always to show that we continue to take share in the network security market; at the same time, transform the business to a software business. Today, close to 50% of that comes from software form factors. Operating income grew 52% in Q4 and our operating margin for the year finished to the high end of the guidance range, with adjusted free cash flow margin coming in above the high end of the range we provided. We achieved a major internal goal we've had on the profitability front, delivering GAAP profitability this quarter. Looking forward, we're guiding to full year GAAP profitability in fiscal 2023. We've had many of you ask us about the macro environment and how is it impacting our business and the markets we serve. In the last year, we arguably saw the most challenging supply chain conditions the technology industry has ever seen. We executed through this well during the year with modest impacts to our gross margins. We expect conditions will eventually ease. For our planning, we're assuming a material improvement won't be seen prior to the end of fiscal year '23. However, as the supply challenges fade, we expect this will start to have a favorable impact on our product gross margins. There's a continuing debate on inflation, it's nature and duration. We saw some labor and other inflationary pressures in the second half of the fiscal year. We do not anticipate these pressures going away in the next fiscal year and we have planned for it to persist through fiscal year '23. And hence, it is included in our plan and is reflected in our guidance. With respect to the macro impact on demand, we've just come out of Q4 with exceptional 44% billings growth. In enterprise sales, as most of you know, there is Q4 magic. We did, however, see some marginal changes in the macro environment in Q4. Whilst early, it is important to see how the overall macroeconomic conditions develop over the next year. First, we saw more longer duration deals as customers increasingly have the confidence to make large long-term commitments with us. This is important to the transformation objectives we set out for Palo Alto Networks. It confirms and validates our view that customers will consolidate if we give them constant best-of-breed products and ensure that they are integrated to deliver better security outcomes. Second, we saw some isolated instances of customers extending the life of hardware potentially driven by macro forces. We expect that on the margin. This could continue into FY '23. It is counterbalanced by some customers refreshing their state and our continued share gains in the hardware form factor. Third, in transformational projects, the vast majority of our customers continue on their investments here despite the expected short-term macro impacts. Security spending is tied into our customers' desires to move to the cloud, drive more direct relationship with their customers, modernize their IT infrastructure as well as drive efficiencies while adapting to a new way of working. Those efforts continue. Coupled with heightened awareness and need to do something around cybersecurity, we expect secular tailwinds to persist in cybersecurity, and we are best positioned to deliver against our customer needs. Another trend I would like to highlight is the return to Palo Alto Networks by employees who had left for seemingly greener pastures. Over a six-month period, as part of our Welcome Home Program, we have engaged with many former employees. To date, dozens of top performers have been rehired with many more in the funnel. Over 70% of people reached out to have expressed a desire to come back to us and a significant number already have. 50% are returning from start-ups, the next largest percentage coming from peer companies. We're happy to welcome these employees back to Palo Alto Networks. As we embark on new fiscal year, my fifth as Palo Alto Networks CEO, it’s worth reflecting where we came from. Our transformation strategy has not been easy, but we are unwavering in our resolve to build the most comprehensive and relevant offerings for our customers, taking away their complexity and delivering a better security outcome for them. We see a path to being the largest cybersecurity company backed by constant innovation and excellent execution becoming our customers' cybersecurity partner of choice while delivering increasing value to our shareholders. Just four years ago, we were a different company. We have reinvented the firewall market and captured the market share leadership position. There are glimmers of our next-generation security strategy, but it made up just 8% of our billings. Our software story in network and security was early, with some traction in our virtual firewalls and a fledgling precursor to SASE called GlobalProtect Cloud Services. We made our first acquisition in cloud native security and had early point products that will become part of Cortex. When we step back and took stock in the industry, we had a key hypothesis, which we then tested, proved to ourselves and have reproduced across the business today. There has not previously been a cybersecurity company with a leadership position in multiple categories, nor did the customers believe that a cybersecurity platform could anchor their architecture. We set out on this ambitious journey as you see at Prisma Cloud and Cortex as well as innovated significantly in our network security capabilities. Fast forward to today, our transformation has taken us far. We are a recognized leader in 11 cybersecurity categories across our three platforms. Next-generation security contributed more than 38% of our billings, helping to accelerate our growth. In network security, we now have the most comprehensive solution across three form factors that share a common architecture and also offer a suite of market-leading security subscriptions. We have built, assembled and integrated capabilities in nine modules that make up Prisma Cloud, which is now the leader in cloud native security.  Lastly, we have three anchor products in Cortex, which with our new XSIAM product showing promise in the revolutionized security operations is going to hold us in good stead. The proof that this transformation is working is in the momentum we are seeing in our customers. The number of customers that spend over $1 million annually with us continues to grow, with the millionaire count now in excess of 1,200 and the number of Global 2000 customers that have purchased products in all three of our platforms is now 50%. While we've had many large customer wins recently, I want to highlight a team in three transactions. The first is a technology company that purchased products in all three of our platforms and a transaction over $75 million in value. The second is a financial services company that standardized its network security in our platform, including adding VMs and deploying Prisma Cloud spending north of $40 million. And third is a professional services company that spent over $75 million across Strata, Prisma and Cortex. One of the outcomes from our transformation over the past four years is a steady increase in our subscription and support mix primarily driven by the growth of our next-generation security business. Subscription and support now exceed 80% of our billings. This has resulted in greater predictability in our revenues. We have seen growing commitments from our customers represent a greater portion of our next year's revenue. As we enter fiscal year '23, that number is 59% at the midpoint of our guidance. Increasing revenue visibility gives us further confidence in our ability to invest and drive future growth. This number is over 70% for the revenue we expect in Q1. All of this has occurred while our revenue growth has accelerated from FY '20 to FY '22, in part due to the accelerated growth in our next-generation security offerings, while we have also taken share in traditional network security appliance form factors as reported by third parties. Despite the success so far in our transformation, we still see significant potential ahead of us. We estimate our large addressable market to be growing at a rate of 14%. At 29%, our fiscal year '22 revenue growth more than doubled this market growth rate. As we have transformed the business, we have seen our revenue growth reaccelerate. Even with this significant growth over the last four years, we still only represent approximately 6% of our TAM we last presented at our Analyst Day in September 2021. 6% share of the market is low for the market leader as compared to other categories and technology. So we see there is ample room to grow. There are numerous trends that excite us around our ability to drive this growth and continue our share gains. You may soon see a day where there will be $1 trillion in public cloud consumed. Our observation thus far in this early market is that companies allocate 2% to 5% of the cloud budgeted security, creating a significant Prisma cloud opportunity. There are 3.5 million worldwide cybersecurity jobs that are unfulfilled. Our view is that more training and hiring alone will not effectively and efficiently counter the growing use of automation employed in attacks and the volume of alerts that is overwhelming the security operations center. We believe a new paradigm and security ops is needed that heavily leverages AI and automation. We are targeting this opportunity with our Cortex products and XSIAM products specifically. Lastly, hybrid work is here to stay. There are more than 1 billion knowledge workers globally. We believe we have a strong position in SASE with our coverage of users and branch offices today, just catching the surface of loss opportunity. We have a clear mission in front of us in each of our security platforms to harness the opportunity that we have outlined. As this is Q4, I figured, rather than having me outline all the accomplishments from our product team, I would invite Lee Klarich, who patiently listens and sits in our calls, to give you a more detailed update to help you understand how we will continue to build on our success we had in FY '22.
Lee Klarich: Thank you, Nikesh. As Nikesh highlighted, across cybersecurity, one of the biggest challenges has always been the overwhelming number of point products that customers must deploy, integrate and operationalize to achieve the security they need. In most cases, this has never fully achieved, leading to expensive yet suboptimal security outcomes. We are bringing into approach, one that delivers market-leading capabilities tightly integrated in three platforms. FY '22 has been a significant year for us in network security, where we have furthered our position delivering a consistent security architecture across hardware, software and SASE. We neared completion of our Gen 4 hardware rollout, which on some models delivers close to 10x performance over Gen 3. As a result, we saw over 50% of NGFW hardware sales in Q4 on Gen 4. Also in FY '22, we introduced the cloud NGFW across three of the major clouds, enabling our customers to adopt best-in-class network security in a cloud native service. And Prisma SASE had three major launches in FY '22, including the most recent ZTNA 2.0 launch, firmly establishing our next-gen approach to Zero Trust. Across our hardware, software and SASE form factors, we are able to deliver a consistent set of core security capabilities as ML-powered cloud services. In FY '22, we saw the rapid adoption of Advanced URL Filtering, and we now see nearly all URL Filtering sales on this advanced ML-based service. Advanced Threat Prevention, which was introduced in fiscal Q3, is also now off to a strong start. And perhaps most importantly, customers can manage all form factors and security subscriptions from a single management console to deliver consistent user experience and tremendous operational leverage. While we believe the full platform is where customers will end up, we want to ensure customers can start their adoption with any form factor and receive a truly best-in-class solution. The number of $1 million lifetime value SASE customers that are also customers of our two other network security form factors ended FY '22 at 210. This is up eightfold since FY '19. We have seven customers that have purchased all three of our form factors with $100 million in lifetime value in network security. More broadly, when we look at our network security customer base, customers that have bought all three platforms from us, spend 10x more than those who are customers of only one form factor. This showcases the true value of our network security platform. In Q4, we introduced ZTNA 2.0, which redefines state-of-the-art and Zero Trust network access to bring uncompromised security and deliver zero trust with zero exceptions. We have seen significant momentum in our customer traction on SASE in FY '22 on a number of fronts. Our overall active SASE customer base grew by 51% in Q4, and our $1 million SASE deals also accelerated this year, up 83% with over 50 $1 million deals in Q4 alone. While many of these large deals are coming from our installed base as they see the value across our form factors, it is equally important that over 30% of our new SASE customers in Q4 were new to Palo Alto Networks. This highlights the competitiveness of our SASE solution and enables us to reach net new customers. Additionally, once we land with the new SASE customer, we are seeing customers look to standardize on our hardware and software appliances. In the cloud, we see that most customers are still relatively early in their journey. They are migrating workloads to the cloud and building new applications, growing their footprints, consuming more sophisticated services and adopting multiple clouds. With this has come an expansion in their cloud security needs. Our approach with Prisma Cloud delivers a comprehensive platform with a growing set of capabilities to stay ahead of our customers' needs. Increasingly, cloud security needs to start at the moment developers write their first lines of code through to deploying and running this code in public cloud. The acquisition of Bridgecrew brought us Infrastructure as Code, a way of detecting and fixing security issues during development. IAC became our ninth integrated module of Prisma Cloud at the end of January. And in the first six months of availability, we already have over 200 customers, making it our fastest-growing new module. We designed an incredibly easy way for our customers to activate any of the nine modules and have grown the number of customers that use more than three modules to over 1/3 and those using four modules to nearly 20%. This frictionless module adoption has helped to fuel our 55% growth in credits consumed on the platform. We are also closing in on 2,000 customers for Prisma Cloud. It's great to see all the third-party recognition like the SC Award as best cloud workload protection solution that we announced today, but we're not done yet. We see several opportunities for new modules and we'll continue to look at both organic development and external technology to drive continued expansion of the Prisma Cloud platform. We are earlier in our Cortex platform journey, executing well across our three core product categories of XDR, security orchestration and automation, and attack surface management. We saw significant progress in FY '22 as we drove sales of our key products and increased traction, combining offerings in larger cross Cortex transactions. Our customer count surpassed 4,000, and we also signed 52 transactions greater than $1 million in Q4. Combined with this customer success, we also continued the rapid innovation that we believe will be required to be a leader in security operations more holistically. When we envision the future of cybersecurity, I don't see a path to success that is not heavily driven by AI and automation. Attackers are too well funded and determined while customer networks, clouds, applications and users are too complex to manually defend. The only way to deliver meaningful security outcomes is by collecting rich useful data normalizing all data sources to a single source of truth and then applying AI models to detect attacks and automate responses in real time. We are now taking this to the next level. Earlier this year, we announced XSIAM, a fully integrated AI-driven SOC platform and kicked off a program with a limited number of design partners to ensure we had strong product market fit. The results of this design partner program are incredibly encouraging, proving our assumptions about the value of good quality data powering AI-based attack detection and native automation simplifying and speeding response. And I'm happy to say our first paid customer was a seven-figure purchase and most of the other design partners are likely to purchase in the coming months. We are on track to launch the product into a broader set of our customers in the first half of fiscal '23. We could not have accomplished all we have in the last several years in advancing our lead in network security, standing up our cloud-native security platform and progressing towards the autonomous stock without our investments in innovation. Over the last several years, our R&D spending has grown in order to enable our ambition to lead with the three platforms. You see this in major product releases, which reached nearly 50 in FY '22. As we move into FY '23, we are more committed than ever to leading in cybersecurity innovation. My team went through a rigorous process of prioritizing our most important investment areas across our three platforms. With the continued investment in R&D, I'm confident [Technical Difficulty] 
Nikesh Arora: [Technical Difficulty] about our financial targets in FY '23. I highlighted the strong drivers at play, including technology sector forces as well as drivers within cybersecurity. We just talked to you about all the innovation we have underway. We continue to have confidence in our team's execution and the traction we're seeing across our platforms. We expect to continue to deliver strong results, in line with the profile we have talked about for the last year since our Analyst Day. For fiscal year 2023, this includes billings growth of 20% to 21% and revenue growth with increasing predictability that is in the mid-20s. After achieving operating margins at the high end of our guidance in fiscal year '22, we intend to deliver operating margin expansion of 50 basis points to the high end of our guidance, with adjusted free cash flow margins of over 100 basis points at the high end of our guidance while absorbing increased supply chain costs and inflationary impacts. We achieved GAAP profitability in Q4 fiscal year '22 and we project this will continue for fiscal year '23. Lastly, today, we also announced a 3-for-1 stock split. This was done to help ensure our shares are accessible to all employees and investors. The stock split also demonstrates our belief in the future of the company and the momentum and confidence we have in our strategy. With that, I will pass on to Dipak to discuss our Q4 results in more detail as well as our Q1 and fiscal year '23 guidance.
Dipak Golechha: Thank you, Nikesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we again reported another strong quarter, which culminates in a strong fiscal year for Palo Alto Networks. For Q4, revenue of $1.55 billion grew 27% and was at the high end of our guidance range. Products grew 20% and total services grew by 30%. By geography, we saw strong growth across all theaters with EMEA up 33%, the Americas growing 26% and JAPAC growing 24%. The Next-Generation Security ARR grew 60% to $1.89 billion with strength across the portfolio. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we delivered total billings of $2.69 billion, up 44%, which was above the high end of our guidance range. Total deferred revenue in Q4 was $6.99 billion, an increase of 39%. Remaining performance obligation, or RPO, was $8.2 billion increasing 40% with current RPO representing about half of our RPO similar to recent quarters. With nearly all of our hardware products now refreshed, as Lee had mentioned, over 50% of our Q4 product orders were booked with Generation 4. Customer reception has been positive, with the majority of customers still in the early phases of their upgrade. Our Firewall as a Platform billings grew 26%. We also continue to see an increasing software mix within our FWaaP billings, up 2 points to 48% in Q4. Moving beyond the top line metrics I've already highlighted, non-GAAP gross margin of 73.2% was down 210 basis points year-over-year as we continue to incur additional expense for components and shipping. We expect this headwind to persist to March of fiscal year '23. Last Q4, we guided for a fiscal '22 operating margin of 18.5% to 19%. We're pleased to have achieved the high end of our goal by delivering 19% operating margin for fiscal year '22, while absorbing higher-than-expected supply chain costs. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter grew 57% to $254 million or $2.39 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22%, GAAP net income was $3 million or $0.03 per basic and diluted share. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We finished Q4 with cash, equivalents and investments of $4.69 billion. Days sales outstanding was 98 days, several days above where it would have landed without the impact of late quarter shipments. Our discounts continue to be in line with what we have seen over the last year. Q4 cash flow from operations was $524 million. We generated adjusted free cash flow of $485 million. We achieved 33.3% adjusted free cash flow margins for the year, above the high end of our 32% to 33% guide for fiscal year '22. During Q4, we repurchased approximately 755,000 shares on the open market at an average price of approximately $483 per share for a total consideration of $365 million. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $915 million for share repurchase, refreshing our authorization for future share repurchases back to $1 billion expiring December 31, 2023. On the M&A front, we closed one very small acquisition in Q4. We reduced our stock-based compensation as a percent of revenue by approximately 3% year-over-year and quarter-to-quarter. SBC will remain a focus area in fiscal '23 as we balance the use of SBC to attract and retain top cybersecurity talent with scale leverage we expect in this area. Lastly, moving to guidance and modeling points. It is worth noting that in fiscal '22, we have flexibility built into our plans that allowed us to execute through some real-time developments during the year, such as supply chain and labor inflation. We've used the same approach in building our fiscal year '23 plans, incorporating a degree of flexibility of outcomes. It's also worth noting that we saw a very strong Q4 business activity. In some cases, this was from customers taking advantage of ordering hardware and especially subscriptions ahead of a price increase that took effect on August 1. We also saw some customers make large commitments in the fourth quarter that might have otherwise happened in fiscal year '23. As you think about next year, note that in the second half of fiscal '22, we have very strong billings with some benefit from an increase in invoicing of multiyear contracts for a few large customers. In Q4, without this impact, our billings would have been in the mid to high 30s. Turning to our guidance for the fiscal quarter of 2023. We expect billings to be in the range of $1.68 billion to $1.70 billion, an increase of 22% to 23%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.535 billion to $1.555 billion, an increase of 23% to 25%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $2.03 to 2.06%. For the fiscal year '23, we expect billings to be in the range of $8.95 billion to $9.05 billion, an increase of 20% to 21%. We expect NGS ARR to be in the range of $2.60 billion to $2.65 billion, an increase of 37% to 40%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $6.85 billion to $6.9 billion, an increase of 25%. We expect product revenue to be in the mid to high single-digit percent range year-over-year. We expect fiscal '23 operating margins to be in the range of 19% to 19.5%, which is 50 basis points ahead of the range we provided at our fiscal -- for fiscal '22 and consistent with the growth targets we presented during our fiscal year '21 Analyst Day. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $9.40 to $9.50. We expect adjusted free cash flow margin to be 33.5% to 34.5%, and we expect to be GAAP profitable for fiscal year 2023. Regarding our fiscal year '24 financial targets, which we outlined at our September 21 Analyst Day, we have strong confidence in achieving those objectives and we hope you take away from our call today some of the reasons behind this confidence. Additionally, please consider the following modeling points. We expect approximately 42% of our operating income to come in the first half of the fiscal year and approximately 58% in the second half. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 22% for Q1 fiscal year '23, subject to the outcome of future tax legislation. For Q1 '23, we expect net interest and other income of $6 million to $8 million. We expect Q1 '23 diluted shares outstanding of 108 million to 110 million shares. We expect fiscal year '23 diluted shares outstanding of 111 million to 113 million shares. We expect our Q1 capital expenditures of $35 million to $40 million. And we expect fiscal year '23 capital expenditures of $190 million to $200 million. And finally, as Nikesh noted, we announced today a 3-for-1 split of Palo Alto Networks common stock. The decision was driven by a desire to make our stock more accessible to our employees and the broader group of investors. It is also supported by our underlying confidence in our continued business momentum. Shareholders of record at the close of business on September 6, 2022 will receive two additional shares after the close of business on September 13, 2022 for every outstanding share held on September 6. Our stock will be trading on a split-adjusted basis on September 14, 2022. With that, I will turn the call back over to Clay for the Q&A portion of the call.
A - Clay Bilby : Great. Thank you, Dipak. To allow for a broad participation, I would ask that each person ask only one question. The first question comes from Hamza Fodderwala of Morgan Stanley, with Rob Owens to follow.
Hamza Fodderwala : A really nice set of results. Dipak, just a clarification question for you real quick. Did you say that the billings growth in Q4 would have been mid to high 30s, excluding the estimated pull forward? And then also for Nikesh, you mentioned some early macro commentary about longer duration deals. Are you also seeing any changes in the sales cycle as you guys do more seven, eight-figure [nine] (ph) deals? And then did that reflect in the guidance at all?
Nikesh Arora : Yes. I just keep the efficiency of time. Yes, Dipak did say that if some of the -- it's important to understand, not just pull forwards, we had some large long-duration deals, having normalized for them. We just want to make sure we set expectations for next year, that 44 was exceptional and some of that was because of some large longer duration deals. I mean normalize for that, then you'd end up in the mid to high 30s. So this is more precautionary in our part as opposed to telling you that we're not doing well. On the front of like -- deal life cycles have been elongating at the top end of the market for us as the deal size have grown. This is not net new to us. This has been happening over the last two or three years. When I came, the largest deal we did was $28 million, now we've done deals closer to $100 million. So obviously, it takes a longer time to get a $100 million deal in place and requires a lot more validation from our customers' POCs and getting engaged. So that trend is consistent. We have not seen any change in that driven by economic factors. So that is your question. As I said, the three effects we saw, we shared a little bit of sweating of hardware assets to push them out a little longer and we've seen some people look at transformation projects. You can see them not go away from transformation. We've seen consolidation. Those are the three things we've seen.
Clay Bilby : Great. Next question from Rob Owens of Piper Sandler with Phil Winslow to follow.
Rob Owens : Would love to drill down into the success you guys are seeing in Prisma Cloud. And what are the biggest factors and/or technical differentiation that's driving your success right now?
Nikesh Arora : Let me give you sort of an overarching picture, and Lee has been kind enough to elicit our product capabilities. But like -- very quickly, we're noticing that if you go out look that there's hundreds of billions of dollars of cloud being sold by our cloud service providers, the top 5 around the world. And what is becoming clear is most of the top end or large customers are in multiple clouds. They're not just in one. We ourselves are in GCP and AWS instances and delivered Azure. So we're seeing ourselves in multi-cloud scenario. So one, that multi-cloud development is causing customers to look for a multi-cloud solution, and that's normally not driven by one cloud service provider, it’s typically somebody like us. That's one part of it. The other part is if the customer is looking for a point solution, it's harder for us, but most customers are migrating away from point solutions, looking for a more platform approach. As Lee highlighted, which Bridgecrew, which we acquired operates on the left side of the development life cycle, the build life cycle. Prisma Cloud used to traditionally operate in the run cycle where you put things into production. By connecting build and run, we've created the sort of even the extension to the development life cycle. So we are seeing people who are taking a serious view towards cybersecurity in the cloud come to Palo Alto Networks and not chase some point solutions. If you look at the industry, there are no platform solutions available. Most industry groups have already validated that as the SC Awards we heard about this morning. So Lee, do you want to add something, technical differentiation?
Lee Klarich : You've been well trained, Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora : All right.
Lee Klarich : I'll add one piece, and actually, Nikesh said it in his prepared remarks. Not only do we have a platform approach, but everything that we deliver from the platform is best in class. And that combination is critically important for our customers to have the trust and confidence in using Prisma Cloud.
Clay Bilby : Great. Next, Phil Winslow of Credit Suisse with Adam to follow.
Philip Winslow : Congratulations on a great end to the fiscal year. Now when we speak to your partners, a growing message back has been an increasing amount of demand for Prisma access, which obviously had a great quarter. It's coming from enterprises that have been customers of other competing on-premise firewall vendors. However, they do not offer as robust a set of cloud service as Palo Alto Networks does. And lead to your point, during your slides, the number that jumped out to us today was that more than 30% of new SASE logos in Q4 were new to Palo Alto Networks. So Nikesh, maybe Lee, if you could comment too. If you think forward here, what is the opportunity to not only monetize SASE and Prisma Access but also to potentially transition that largely on-premise installed base of those competing firewall vendors to Palo Alto Networks platform, what are you hearing from customers and why?
Nikesh Arora : Phil, I think in the last year, I would say, our ability to deliver, deploy and sell SASE has grown. And as you picked up the number, 30% of these customers are net new to Palo Alto. And the way it works is we go to them, they appreciate our firewalls, but the problem is they now have bought firewalls from somebody two years ago, three years ago, five years ago, and there's still a lot end of life on them. So they like us, they like our solutions, but they're not able to execute because somebody before them bought them or they bought them at a moment when they [were deluded](ph). So it now comes to a point where we are able to convince them that our SASE solution is right. Our excitement for these 30% customers is that, over time, they will then migrate their on-prem hardware to Palo Alto as well. And we're noticing early days, but we're noticing some of these customers who bought our SASE solution because they understand our security fabric then have deployed it, then it's a simple attach of putting hardware because security solutions have already been put into place. So we have taken share in the firewall market by most third-party estimates, somewhere between 300 to 400 basis points. And we think part of the driver is us being able to deliver a more comprehensive zero trust network security capability. As Lee highlighted, we have customers who have spent north of $100 million of lifetime value and network security with us, which is hard to do.
Clay Bilby : Great. Next is Adam Tindle of Raymond James with Brian Essex to follow.
Adam Tindle : Okay. Nikesh on the NGS portfolio, congrats on the success. You're just under $2 billion at this point. And I thought I'd maybe touch on the growth versus profitability algorithm for that piece of the business now that at this level of scale. If I look at the fiscal '23 guidance, it implies that new NGS ARR is going to be just over $700 million, which is a big number, but it's about the same dollar amount as you added in fiscal '22. Could you maybe speak to kind of the crossroads of opportunity to invest more for NGS ARR, maybe a new step function level of new ARR growth versus is it a better opportunity now to harvest and improve profitability and certainly, any metrics you can provide on where you are and where you can go and NGS profitability would be great.
Nikesh Arora : So I'm sorry, I'm confused. Are you saying 50%, 60% growth is time to harvest or trying to grow faster? Sometimes I can never make you guys happy. It's like three years ago, we said $1 billion you guys always said, that's a big number. You won't get there. We get you to $1.9 billion in four years, and they sit and say, that's par for the course now, just like start making more money. Like, as Lee highlighted, we are trying to balance our R&D spend with our growth aspirations. I personally believe there is so much room in the cybersecurity market as we've demonstrated. Since I came, we've -- revenue growth is up 50% in terms of percentage growth. So we used to grow in the 19%, 20% range, growing at 20% to 29%. And I think that's a good place. It's such large numbers. We're growing at a good number. We're going to keep balancing our investment yet showing you fiscal prudence. Could I go spend more money and let the operating margin language lower? Yes. But I don't want to. We promised that we keep extracting operating margin to make sure we're fiscally prudent, and we're going to do that. But at the same time, we use the opportunity of every dollar to make it more efficient and keep spending for growth. We think our growth profile, obviously, as you would expect, has improved for most of our products that we were taking bets on about three or four years ago. I think it's also important to understand ARR is a leading indicator of revenue. So revenue comes in after ARR and then you have costs come in on day one. So yes, our operating margins for these new areas are getting better, in some cases getting to positive from negative. But I think we're still further away until you see the impact of the $700 million, $800 million we added this year. As that flows into revenue, the next 700 flows in revenue, we hopefully will keep expanding operating margins, which is fueling our ability to give you that 50 basis point expansion over the years. But we're going to keep striking the balance.
Clay Bilby : Great. Next is Brian Essex of Goldman Sachs, with Fatima Boolani to follow.
Brian Essex : My congratulations on the results as well. It's great to see. Maybe, Nikesh, if you could help us reconcile what you're seeing on the product revenue side, particularly within the context of your guidance next year, particularly given what you said about consolidating, sharing your platform, early stages of refresh cycle, but it sounds like you've got some great VM series traction and the percentage of revenue of total Firewall as a Platform business is accelerating. What are the underlying assumptions behind that mid to high single-digit product revenue growth? Where could you see upside? And how are things different underlying those expectations compared to what you're seeing today?
Nikesh Arora : Yes, Brian, as you know, thank you for the question, and thank you for your kind words. Look, we had the similar set of expectations last year going into the fiscal year. And we benefited from some price increases, as you know. We also benefited from some pull-through activities by customers because there were supply chain prices and people were trying to make sure,, they're stocking up. We just want to be prudent. We don't anticipate more price increases because our philosophy is we don't want to keep driving prices up. Because when you keep increasing prices, when supply chain settles down, you have to cut prices. And I don't want to be in that scenario where we're showing you tremendous volatility in our product revenue. So that's kind of one factor is the price normalization. The second factor is potential pull-in by customers because of supply chain constraints and ordering ahead. If you balance that out, we think the number is still in the low to high single-digits. But again, as I've told you from perhaps five years ago, we are focusing on Firewall as a Platform. The more I drive SASE, the more I drive virtual firewalls, the better off we are as transitioning our business. As we highlighted, 70% of our revenue now is predictable going into next quarter. We highlighted that 80% of our software subscription is coming from software. So we are trying to make sure we keep transforming this business and software business. We love our hardware business. It drives a lot of its installed base. It lies with lots of refreshes. It drives a lot of our advanced prevention capability. So please don't take away, that's not now a favorite child of ours. But at the same time, we are cautious and we're making sure we balance the growth in our hardware business with the thrust we're putting into SASE and Cloud and Cortex.
Clay Bilby : Great. Next from Fatima Boolani of Citigroup with Saket Kalia next.
Fatima Boolani : Nikesh, for you, if I calculate a rough back of the envelope math, you had roughly maybe 10% of your billings tied to a handful of transactions. So as I think about large deal dependency and $75 million, $100 million deals becoming the norm at Palo Alto, how do you put your head together with Dipak to sort put guardrails around the guidance as the business becomes a little bit more levered to some of these larger deals, especially given your scale?
Nikesh Arora : Let me lay back. First of all, we were careful, we said mid-to-high 30s. So it's not exactly 10%. It's somewhere between 5% and 8%, if you will, if you were bringing back of the math envelope. But yes, 5% to 8%. But look, part of it is we also told we have 1,200 millionaire customers. I think in cybersecurity, that makes us the largest number of millionaire customers you're going to expect. There's a large amount of customers between that and the $1 million customers, 100 million and 1 million, there's a lot of people -- there are lots of numbers between 1 and 100. So you can expect we have people pretty much at every number. Part of it is a balancing act in terms of what deals we prioritize and what deals we focus on. Remember, $100 million deals don't go away. They just take longer. So we could get it done in Q1. We'll get it done in Q2. So our customer has a wake up one morning and saying, you know what that deal we have been discussing over the last nine months for $100, it's not going to happen. If typically it becomes a $60 million deal, you say it's going to happen in the following quarter. So our job is to have a lot more pipeline in our portfolio to make sure that we're able to bring enough of them in, to be able to keep you hungry analysts away from destroying our credibility or whatever the right phrase is. Have we got you convinced yet, Fatima or not? I'm still waiting.
Fatima Boolani : I'm on the bullet train.
Nikesh Arora : All right, good. Fantastic. Thank you.
Clay Bilby : All right. Great. Next question from Saket Kalia of Barclays with Brent Thill next.
Saket Kalia : Okay. Great. Echo my congrats on a very strong quarter. Dipak, maybe for you. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you took the same approach with FY '23 guide as you did with FY '22, which was obviously very strong. So maybe the question for you is, as we all contemplate the impact of macro uncertainty for next year, how did you sort of think about that when you were kind of thinking about that billings guide for next year, which, again, was very strong at a higher base for '22?
Dipak Golechha : Yes. I don't think there's anything different and I'm going to tell you, Saket, that's already -- that's not already in our prepared remarks. I mean, I think it's really a question of just dissecting what are the impacts of the macro, figuring out what supply chain-related, what's inflation-related, what's demand-related and then just making sure that we methodically work through it, like Nikesh and I and the leadership team have a lot of debates, right, during the course of the annual planning process, and then we just try to make sure that we're thinking through scenarios and having enough flexibility for different scenarios. But really nothing to add beyond the prepared remarks.
Clay Bilby : Great. Next is Brent Thill of Jefferies with Andy Nowinski next.
Joseph Gallo: You have Joe on for Brent. Congrats on the result. Maybe just a follow-up to that last question. Appreciate the extra prudence, and I know that it's your fiscal first quarter, but is there any reason why the growth rate would half? I know there's some duration in 4Q, but just maybe talk about the billings guidance as it relates to F 1Q?
Dipak Golechha : So I think again, ultimately, we talked about how you've got to normalize it for some large deals. We did also take a price increase on August 1. I think, again, we're just trying to be prudent at the beginning of the fiscal year and make sure that we're not getting ahead of our skis. I mean the 20% to 21% is the fiscal year guide. I think we've guided a little bit higher in Q1, specifically, but I think -- yes, and still ahead of consensus. So I think we feel pretty good about the pipeline, all the metrics that we look at.
Nikesh Arora : Important to understand the overall market context. You've got companies which are reducing guidance, companies which are cutting EPS guidance. There are companies which are warning a potential customer deal life cycles being smaller. So we're trying to make sure that we are prepared for both the upside and downside scenario. I think it's fair for us to be prudent in that market.
Clay Bilby : Okay, great. Next, we've got Andy Nowinski of Wells Fargo with Joel Fishbein next.
Andy Nowinski : Great. First, I just want to extend my congrats on a great quarter and the billings guidance, particularly in light of the much higher comp you have this year. So for a question, I wanted to ask about your win rates on Prisma SASE because none of your competitors have firewalls or other solutions to offer beyond their SASE solutions. So I'm wondering if the rest of your portfolio might actually be your most sustainable competitive advantage that's driving that growth in new logos you're seeing with Prisma SASE.
Nikesh Arora : Andy, I think part of -- if you look at it historically, until about three years ago, we didn't have a SASE, we could actually go head-to-head with the industry leader, let's just say, right? What has happened in the last 1.5 years or two? We've become a force to reckon with. I'd say in the most -- the largest enterprise deal is head-to-head with two vendors. Very rarely do we see a third. This doesn't take a lot to guess who the second vendor is. And two years ago, we were not showing up to the party. Two years ago, getting one or two deals out of 10. Now we think we're in five to six out of 10 deals and our aspiration is next year to be 10 out of 10 deals. You know what, hopefully, if we can win half the deals that we're in, we'll be growing at big numbers like we did this year. So we think we are coming of age in our SASE business. We have a lot of respect for the other player in the market. We think we have a better solution technically. We're seeing that when enterprise architectures come to play where customers want to integrate a Zero Trust strategy across hardware, software and remote access driven solutions. We believe that we have a technical edge. At the same time, we made the early decision to deploy that on the public cloud. We actually are the only company that can deliver your SASE solution on the public cloud with redundancy. So GCP goes down, we hot switch to AWS. As AWS goes down with hot switch to GCP, so we give you the highest level SLA in the SASE business in the market today.
Clay Bilby : All right. Next, we've got Joel Fishbein of Truist Securities, followed by Keith Bachman.
Joel Fishbein : Nikesh, just wanted to follow up on Fed spending and SLED spending, particularly since Palo Alto is probably in the pull position to deal with the Zero Trust environment that the federal government's disposing a strategy around it, and I would love to just get an update. It seems like there's a lot of rhetoric, but not a lot of spending.
Nikesh Arora : Joel, as you'll appreciate, what typically happens when a new administration comes into place. The first six months, they spend the time getting to know each other. The next six months, they write a lot of executive orders and then we get into implementation, if we're lucky in year two. So yes, we have seen great signs of alignment in the Fed market. We have seen some good executive orders to align towards more awareness around cybersecurity. As you know, the SEC is also looking at it how to make it a more relevant conversation and Board. So all the signs are headed in the right direction. The fiscal year close for Fed comes in, in the next 1.5 months. So we should hopefully see some activity in Q1 around that. And I think next year should be a better year for Fed spending, especially around Zero Trust and SASE and cloud.
Clay Bilby : All right. Next is Keith Bachman, the BMO with Gregg Moskowitz to follow.
Keith Bachman : Great. Lee, I want to bring you into the conversation for a second, if I could. Lots of good metrics around Cortex. And I was just wondering how you're thinking about the growth potential in Cortex and particularly with XSIAM coming in the first half, does that you think actually caused an acceleration in growth in Cortex? And Dipak, if I could just ask a clarification, sneak one in here. For the billings guide, are you assuming duration neutral in FY '23? Or any kind of assumptions around duration and pricing that we should be thinking about in that '20 to '21 billings guide when you compare this year to last year?
Lee Klarich : Yes. Thanks for the question, Keith. The -- we saw another year of good traction with Cortex across XGR, XSOAR and Xpanse. And I anticipate that we'll continue to see that traction in FY '23 given the product innovation that we've driven and will continue to drive across those three products and the value they provide. When I think about XSIAM, I think of it as being the start of fairly exciting journey, but it's going to be a multiyear journey. I don't see it as being just a quick hit. It's a more architectural transformation. It is truly what I believe customers need but it will take a little bit longer for that to fully play out. And I'm very encouraged by the design partner program we ran, but there's -- we're going to see that play out over the course of the next year, and hopefully, that sets the foundation for the years to come.
Keith Bachman : Okay. Great.
Dipak Golechha : And then just to answer your question on duration and pricing, no significant changes on duration and no additional pricing beyond the ones that we've already announced. Recall August 1, we did have a price increase that was about 5% on our hardware.
Clay Bilby : Right, Gregg Moskowitz, Mizuho Securities, followed by Matt Hedberg.
Gregg Moskowitz : So Nikesh, at the beginning of your fiscal '22 year, you spoke about a more incremental period, a more moderate period, if you will, as it relates to acquisitions. But earlier, Lee also mentioned several opportunities for new modules and valuation multiples having generally come in, I'm curious how you're thinking about M&A in fiscal '23?
Nikesh Arora : So we outlined that we -- it's harder to do M&A now than it was three or four years ago because we had such a wide canvas or blank canvas in terms of various opportunities where we could go make acquisitions today, we have to balance the idea of an acquisition to make sure that is it consistent with our product strategy. Is it an overlapping acquisition or is it a complementary acquisition where we can integrate over time. So that reduces the amount of the opportunity out there. As I've always said, we're very focused on product area acquisitions as opposed to go-to-market acquisitions because we have -- as you can see, from our ARR or NGS, $1.9 billion. We have the ability to go sell good stuff if we get good stuff from our product better than here. So I think we will continue to stay on the lookout and scan the market. We are not in the mindset of acquiring large deals. We're in the mindset of looking for great product teams that we can complementarily attach to our capabilities. So we keep scanning the market and if something shows up, we'll do it. But again, I don't think it has ever been a significant part of our effort in terms of our market cap. When we did the first $2.5 billion, the market cap was $20 million, $25 million, now it's north $50 million. So you can imagine it's a small scale relative to what the opportunity for the company is, and that's how we think about it. We're not jumping at the bit right now. The market -- I think it's kind of like -- the public market has rationalized, the private markets probably haven't yet. It's a bit like real estate and people remember the last the neighbor's house, what is sold at, they kind of forget what their house is worth. So until people realize true value of their house, it's going to be a little longer before acquisitions come into the security market again.
Clay Bilby : Great. Matt Hedberg, RBC followed by Gray Powell.
Matt Hedberg : Nikesh and team, congrats on the results. The success of your SASE portfolio is obviously impressive. I'm wondering, as you approach the fiscal year, are there things that you're doing from a go-to-market perspective to even drive higher cross-sell? I believe you have about 54,000 firewall customers and now just shy of 3,600 SASE customers. Just kind of curious how you think about maybe driving even more cross-sell what has obviously been the top growth?
Nikesh Arora : So thank you for the question. It's a great question. It's something our management team has spent a lot of time thinking about. And what we are doing going into this fiscal year is we used to have SASE sales specialists. And what we've done is we have merged them into our core sales team, and we've been running boot camps for the last 6 to 8 weeks training everybody out in the field for SASE. So we're converting our entire core field team, our network security team into a SASE first team which is the way -- only way we can get amplification across 2,000 sellers and actually go make sure there's a SASE opportunity to be uncovered to every customer. So we think SASE's come of age. We think SASE is the linchpin towards our network security strategy. We think this is going to be a very, very large market in the next five to 10 years. And we say we're one of two vendors in the market who will be invited to every opportunity, and we hope to win our disproportionate share.
Clay Bilby : Right. Yes. Great. Our last question for the day from Gray Powell with BTIG.
Gray Powell : All right. And congratulations on the strong results. So yes, I guess I'll stick with the SASE theme. And I'd be really curious, I mean a lot of other companies that have reported earnings in the security space, they're talking about longer sales cycles, particularly for larger, more complex deals. How does that play into the Prisma SASE portfolio? Are you seeing any macro impact there, particularly in terms of pipeline? And then was that like a consideration in the NGS ARR guidance.
Nikesh Arora : Look, Gray, as I said, first and foremost, the large complex deals take longer to get done. And SASE does take longer because customers -- SASE is just not buying a security and bolting it on. It's actually re-architecting your network access. It’s actually just how your laptop delves in into your work if you're using Palo Alto SASE or Prisma SASE. So it's kind of important because if your laptop doesn't get access to BTIG's infrastructure in trouble. So it becomes a network play as much as a security play. So teams take a little longer to get it done. So I think that's kind of part of the process, less so the macroeconomic concerns, if you will, it's really doing the technology transformation agreeing to do it as an organization. That's what takes a little longer. In terms of our guidance, look, there's a whole bunches of puts and takes that are going in there. There are secular tailwinds. We obviously have a sense of the pipeline going into next year. As Fatima asked, we did some big deals, guess what, we didn't do some big deals, right? You couldn't have done every deal, so there's a bunch of deals that are still waiting in the wings. Yes, they're larger, and they're binary that if they all don't come in, we'll have to go hustle. If they all come in, we'll be in a great place. But our job as management to just balance all these factors, you've got to balance inflation, supply chain, deal cycles, various product investments. So I think across the balance, if you look, we think our guidance is prudent across all of these factors where we think some of them might be better for us. Some of them may be worse. But on the margin, we think we can deliver the guidance as presented to you.
Clay Bilby : Great. Thanks. That will conclude our Q&A. I'll turn it back over to Nikesh for his closing remarks.
Nikesh Arora : Well, first of all, thank you, everyone, for your attention and your questions and for joining us. We look forward to seeing many of you after this in separate calls as well as upcoming conferences. I also want to thank our customers, partners and of course, most of all, our employees who make us the great place that we are. With that, go Palo Alto Networks.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-05-20 16:30:00) =====

We would also like to note, management is scheduled to participate in the upcoming JPMorgan, Jefferies and Bank of America investor conferences in the next several weeks. I will now turn the call over to Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you, Clay. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our earnings call. In this time of increased macroeconomic volatility and geopolitical uncertainty, we saw a combination of strong cybersecurity market demand and our team's execution in line with our strategy to drive our Q3 financial results. We reported strong top line metrics with both billings and RPO growing 40% year-over-year. This is the highest billings growth we have reported looking back over the past 4 years and was driven both by strong demand for our next-generation security offerings and strong customer commitments to our network security business. In network security, we saw product again grow over 20% as we continue the transition to software. Customers continue to consolidate their network security to Palo Alto Networks as a result of the significant expansion in our subscription capabilities over the last several years. Our net security ARR ended Q3 at $1.61 billion, up 65% year-over-year. Our top line performance translated into non-GAAP operating income that grew ahead of revenue and enabled strong cash flow conversion. We were pleased that we were able to achieve these bottom line results despite challenges in the supply chain. Speaking of the global backdrop, whether it's supply chain, geopolitical conflict or rising interest rates and inflation, this environment is creating challenges for our customers and testing our execution. I'm pleased our teams have risen to the occasion and have shown strong execution across sales, operations and all areas that support the business. The trend that started with the pandemic and the widespread cyberattacks, the trend of network transformation, cloud transformation and fortifying one's infrastructure continue to be strong. Coupled with consolidation in cybersecurity, we expect this to continue to drive strength and growth both for the industry and us in particular given our unique 3-platform approach. Of course, the events of Ukraine are on everyone's mind. We stand with the people of Ukraine against Russian aggression and have been working to provide direct cybersecurity support to Ukrainian organizations. This geography has not been significant for us in terms of revenue or our overall growth expectations. For this quarter and our most recent quarters, our combined Russia and Ukraine revenue was well below 1%. We have halted new sales in Russia and we're also complying with all government sanctions. Since December, we've deployed protection for over 3,400 new indicators of attack that defend organizations from disruptive and destructive Russian cyberattacks. As you might expect, we're seeing heightened interest from commercial and government customers in Europe around mitigating this nation-state activity. This ever-challenging threat landscape is driving broader and more strategic customer conversations. We continue to see our customers look for an elevated level of partnership and this is expanding our market opportunity. We continue to see success in consolidating share within the enterprise market, and this has become a core tenet of our growth strategy. We see evidence of this in our multi-platform sales with 48% of our Global 2000 customers having transacted now with us on all 3 of our major platforms of Strata, Prisma and Cortex. The number of million-dollar-deal transactions we signed was up 65% in Q3 and the average size of our million-dollar deals increased in the quarter. We also saw the number of $5 million deals increase by 73% year-over-year. Large deals are an important selling motion for us as we further penetrate Global 2000 customers with our second and third platforms. Innovation is the engine that underpins our growth in the market, which Gartner estimates will total over $250 billion in end-user spending by 2026. With the trend towards vendor consolidation in the market, customers appreciate our best-of-breed capabilities within each of our 3 platforms. This quarter, we added 4 additional categories to the recognition we received for our best-of-breed capabilities. Remember, they're all integrated into our 3 platforms. So the customer gets the benefit of our platforms as well as the individual best-of-breed capabilities which compete effectively against independent vendors in our industry. Forrester recognized our position in cloud workload security with a leader designation in their inaugural wave in this market, the only company to have that recognition. Early recognition of the importance of attack surface management, which we entered through the acquisition of Xpanse in 2020 was validated as we were recognized as an outperforming leader by GigaOm. We received strong performer designations from Forrester in 2 categories, incident response and EDR. I'll next provide you an update on our platforms and what progress we've made in the last quarter, starting with Prisma Cloud. We continue to see strong momentum driven by both new customers and notable for this quarter, large upsell and expansion commitments, which drove 25 deals north of $1 million. This growth in customers and existing customer expansion is evidenced in our credit consumption, which grew 50% year-over-year in Q3. We continue to drive cloud security leadership across the industry. And as I've said before, all Prisma Cloud customers are inherently customers of hyperscalers, yet they choose us. Customers are looking for a scaled, integrated cloud security platform that Prisma Cloud provides, enabling us to deliver high double-digit growth. Our customers are increasingly recognizing that operating securely in the cloud means ensuring that software that is written for the cloud is secure. This starts with the developer. Our early observation of this trend led us to acquire Bridgecrew in early 2021. We have been focused on building out a portfolio of offerings targeted at developers. This is our fifth pillar of Prisma Cloud. Cloud Code leverages all the existing capabilities of Prisma Cloud, including its approach to credit consumption, deployment and reporting. One quarter from release, we've seen success in 6-figure commitments to Prisma Cloud driven by Cloud Code and also this is amongst the fastest modules adopted in Prisma Cloud in terms of credit consumption. Critical to our developer strategy, we continue to see strong downloads of our Checkov open source offering, which reached over 7 million in Q3. Moving on to Cortex. We are helping customers reimagine how they operate their security operation centers with automation and AI/ML at the core. Cortex customers grew over 60% in Q3, supported by multiproduct Cortex transactions in EMEA and the Americas. We achieved an important milestone in Q3 with approximately $500 million in Cortex ARR. In Q3, we saw strength in each of our established Cortex product areas with a record number of transactions for XDR and Xpanse and nearly that level of business with XSOAR. XDR continues to shine with industry awards and benchmarks. This quarter, XDR was recognized for 100% threat prevention and detection in the recent MITRE evaluation. Forrester also recognized the significant progress we have made with XDR in our series of releases over the last 9 months, recognizing XDR as a strong performer in its EDR Wave. Our Xpanse performance, with transactions up well over 100% in the last 12 months, shows that attack surface management is now seeing an inflection in mainstream demand. After our recent limited releases of XSIAM, we are making progress in our goal to initiate co-design work with 10 partners and expect to be on track at the end of this quarter with our plans. XSIAM will ultimately enable us to achieve our Cortex vision around SOC automation, delivering what we expect to be a very unique value to our customers and disrupting the multibillion-dollar SIEM category by offering a modern alternative that leverages AI and ML. Moving on to SASE. Last week, we made a call to the industry to adopt ZTNA 2.0, which ushers in a new era of hybrid workforce security based on key zero trust principles like least privilege access, continuous trust verification and continuous security inspection across all apps. Our mantra for Prisma Access is to provide zero trust with zero exceptions. The pandemic has accelerated the adoption of SASE. In addition to significant traction from our installed base, we continue to see strong momentum from net new customers for whom Prisma SASE is their first significant purchase for us. These customers then become opportunities for incremental engagements across our other platforms. SASE saw particular success with large transaction in Europe as we signed 11 large transactions in EMEA, further reinforcing the global nature of SASE demand. SASE is in the early innings, and we're making significant investments to ensure we continue our momentum in this category. Moving on to Strata, our hardware and subscription services platform. For the third consecutive quarter, we delivered north of 20% product revenue growth. We saw strength across our portfolio, both hardware appliances and software form factors. As you're all aware, the industry is dealing with unprecedented supply chain issues, which are likely to persist for yet another year. Our team is deftly managing these with our partners, allowing us to maintain better lead times than some in the industry. We have seen instances where we are advantaged in having supply where competitors cannot timely deliver and we believe this has helped contribute to market share gains. We saw our momentum validated by third-party recognition of market share gains in both hardware and VM form factors. In hardware, Omdia recognized Palo Alto Networks as being #1 in market share for the appliance market with over 27% share, up more than 5 points year-over-year. In the VM market, according to Dell'Oro, we added 6 points of market share year-over-year and command nearly 34% of the market. We continue to execute on our Generation 3 to Generation 4 transition. We have now released nearly all Gen 4 appliance models. Although customers are very early in their evaluation and adoption of Gen 4, we expect this Gen 4 adoption will help drive our appliance growth rates ahead of the market growth rate. We're seeing strong uptake of advanced URL subscriptions and strong early demand for our new advanced threat prevention subscription. We released next-generation CASB last quarter and saw solid Q3 performance here. Lastly, we announced our second partnership with a hyperscaler to embed our network security into the fabric of their cloud. This is differentiated innovation that leverages our engineering scale, our market leadership position and relationships with hyperscalers. Cloud Next-Generation Firewall on AWS brings the combination of Palo Alto Networks' industry-leading network security in a cloud-native form factor and marries it with the ease of use of Amazon Web Services. This relationship with AWS follows the launch of Cloud IDS on the Google Cloud Platform last July. We expect Cloud Next-Generation Firewall will drive further growth of our Firewall as a Platform and specifically, our software form factors. It also gives customers another reason to standardize on our network security platform. Innovations like Cloud Next-Generation Firewall on AWS, Cloud IDS on Google Cloud and our licensing of security subscriptions to SaaS providers to protect their cloud applications are differentiators for us versus competitors that are primarily focused on the appliance form factor. Bringing it all together, we are very pleased with our Q3 results, where we saw exceptional top line growth. At the same time, even while growing faster, we are prioritizing investments and delivering on the profitability targets we committed during our September 2021 Analyst Day. We believe this is an important discipline, and we intend to maintain this focus on profitability targets while maximizing growth. We continue to see broadening demand for cybersecurity, which is enabling us to grow and invest from a position of strength. As we focus on our mission to be our customers' cybersecurity partner of choice for today and tomorrow, we also aspire to deliver to our shareholders outstanding returns as a proxy for growth of the cybersecurity opportunity as well as world-class execution. We are very pleased with the first 3 quarters we have delivered so far in fiscal year 2022. We look forward to updating you in 3 months on our plans to continue accelerated growth, balanced profitability and look at how we intend to target GAAP profitability in the near future. With that, I will pass the call over to Dipak to talk about our results in more detail.
Dipak Golechha: Thank you, Nikesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Our strong results continue to be driven by solid demand across the breadth of our offerings with results again ahead of our guidance across all metrics. In the midst of top line strength, we balance profitability well. With the strength of this momentum and our favorable outlook, we are again raising our full year guidance. For Q3, revenue of $1.39 billion grew 29% and was above the high end of our guidance range. Product grew 22% and total services grew by 32%. By geography, growth was balanced across all theaters, with the Americas growing 30%, EMEA up 28% and JAPAC growing by 29%. NGS ARR grew 65% to $1.61 billion, supported by balanced strength across this portfolio. As noted in our Q2 earnings, going forward, we focus on NGS ARR as one of our core metrics as we believe it's indicative of the return we're seeing on our growth investments and also helps investors track the growing mix of this business within our revenue. We saw strong double-digit growth across all of our major NGS offerings with Prisma Cloud, Prisma SASE and Cortex as well as growing contributions from recently introduced NGS offerings. We are pleased with this diversified portfolio-driven growth. Overall, this performance as well as the continued maturity of our go-to-market organization in selling our NGS capabilities gives us confidence to raise our annual guidance for NGS ARR again in Q3. In the third quarter of 2022, we delivered total billings of $1.8 billion, up 40% and also above the high end of our guidance range. Total deferred revenue in Q3 was $5.9 billion, an increase of 34%. Remaining performance obligation, or RPO, was $6.9 billion, increasing 40% with current RPO representing a similar percentage of the total as in recent quarters. Our teams executed very well again in Q3, and you see the result of the strength in these top line metrics, which lead revenue. There were a few factors to call out that drove the strength that we saw this quarter. In addition to the significant strength in our NGS business, we saw strength in our attached subscriptions. We've seen customers use their budget to make incremental commitments to our attached subscriptions as they anticipate firewall upgrades and overall network security capacity increases. As well, they're seeing the value in newer subscriptions we have brought to the market over the last 12 to 18 months. This gives us further conviction around sustained demand for appliances as well as our software-based FWaaP form factors as customers look to benefit from our consistent architecture, including the subscription capabilities. Product revenue again was strong, growing 22% in Q3 with demand exceeding our ability to ship due to supply chain challenges. We estimate customers refresh their products every 4 to 7 years, with many now evaluating our Gen 4 hardware. We're in the early days of this refresh cycle with only a small proportion having updated their products. As I noted earlier, we're seeing signs of customers making commitments to our hardware platform, both based on strong subscription demand and also the beginning of our installed base refresh activity. Our Firewall as a Platform billings grew 25% on top of the accelerated Q3 growth in the year ago period. We continue to see this performance well balanced across our FWaaP form factors. Within our FWaaP offerings, the strength of our product business held our Q3 software mix at approximately 39%, in line with Q2 and the year ago quarter. Turning to the details of our results. Product revenue was $352 million, growing 22%. Subscription revenue was $640 million, increasing by 35%. Support revenue of $395 million increased 27%. In total, subscription and support revenue of $1.04 billion increased 32% and accounted for 75% of total revenue. Non-GAAP gross margin of 72.9% was down 170 basis points. The driver continues to be supply chain-related costs as we incurred additional expense for components and shipping. Despite the pressure on our gross margins, non-GAAP operating margin of 18.2% was up 120 basis points year-over-year. We were able to offset higher supply chain costs with lower operating expenses as we drove efficiencies across the business. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter grew 38% to $193 million or $1.79 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22%. GAAP net losses were $73 million or $0.74 per basic and diluted share. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We finished April with cash equivalents and investments of $4.6 billion. Product and associated subscription shipments shifted toward month 3, resulting in days sales outstanding of 71 days. Cash flow from operations was $390 million. We generated adjusted free cash flow of $351 million, a margin of 25.3%. With regard to capital allocation priorities, we did not repurchase stock during Q3. However, we do expect share repurchase to be a major use of cash flow as previously stated. We currently have approximately $450 million remaining on our authorization for future share repurchases. This current authorization expires on December 31, 2022. On the M&A front, we did not close any acquisitions in Q3. Managing stock-based compensation remains a management focus. This quarter, we reduced SBC as a percentage of revenue by approximately 4 points year-over-year and 2 points quarter-over-quarter. We will continue to apply discipline to this process while balancing reductions against the market dynamics for cybersecurity talent. Key to our ongoing success is maintaining balanced top and bottom line growth while continuing to acquire and retain top talent. Lastly, moving to guidance and modeling points. As Nikesh highlighted, we continue to see very balanced demand from customers across our portfolio. This includes demand for our appliance form factors that outstrips our ability to fulfill in the near term as well as strengthen our next-generation security portfolio. Our Q4 guidance takes into account the strong demand picture, the best information we have today on supply chain and other factors. Recall that a year ago in the second half of fiscal year '21, we were hiring aggressively. As we move beyond that comparison, investors should be considering the comments we provided around medium-term margin expansion goals. Turning to our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2022. We expect billings to be in the range of $2.32 billion to $2.35 billion, an increase of 24% to 26%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.53 billion to $1.55 billion, an increase of 25% to 27%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $2.26 to $2.29 based on a weighted average diluted count of approximately 106 million to 108 million shares. For fiscal year 2022, we expect billings to be in the range of $7.106 billion to $7.136 billion, an increase of 30% to 31%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $5.48 billion to $5.50 billion, an increase of approximately 29%. We expect next-generation security ARR to be $1.775 billion to $1.825 billion, an increase of 50% to 55% versus a very strong performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '21. We expect strength in product revenue to continue in Q4 with full year growth of 20%. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be 18.5% to 19%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $7.43 to $7.46 based on a weighted average diluted count of approximately 106 million to 107 million shares. We continue to expect an adjusted free cash flow margin for the year of 32% to 33%. Achieving the rule of 60 was an aspiration we called out in our September 21 Analyst Day. The rule combines revenue growth and adjusted free cash flow margin. Based on our Q4 guidance, we're pleased to project that the combination will exceed 60% for fiscal year '22, which is ahead of our prior stated plan. We've seen strong growth in fiscal year '22. On a revenue basis, our guidance for the year is 3.6% higher at the midpoint than where we started and 7.5% higher at the midpoint for NGS ARR. Along with this top line, we've absorbed incremental supply chain costs and are happy to be able to continue to project the same operating profitability range as at the beginning of the year. Additionally, please consider the following additional modeling points. We expect non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 22% for Q4 and fiscal year '22, subject to the outcome of future tax legislation. For Q4 '22, we expect net interest and other expenses of $1 million to $2 million. We expect capital expenditures in Q4 of $36 million to $41 million, and we expect capital expenditures for the full fiscal year of $190 million to $195 million, which includes $39 million outlaid in Q2 '22 related to our Santa Clara headquarters. Stepping back, we're focused on balancing our drivers of total shareholder return. We're recognizing not only the importance of top line growth as we focus on executing strong market demand, but also profitability, cash conversion and our capital structure. Balancing profitability is a commitment we made at our Analyst Day, and we've been able to deliver on this in fiscal year '22 despite increased costs related to our supply chain. We will continue to make progress on our commitment of 50 to 100 basis points operating margin expansion and 100 to 150 basis points of adjusted cash flow margin expansion beyond fiscal year '22 through '24 whilst balancing top line growth opportunity. We're on track to achieving our fiscal year '24 targets we outlined in our September 2021 Analyst Day, including $10 billion in billings and $8 billion in revenue. We believe we can continue to deliver to shareholders outstanding returns as a proxy for the growth of the cybersecurity opportunity as well as world-class execution. With that, I will turn the call back over to Clay for the Q&A portion of the call.
A - Clay Bilby: Great. Thank you, Dipak. [Operator Instructions] The first question will be from Phil Winslow of Credit Suisse, with Hamza Fodderwala to follow.
Phil Winslow: Congrats on just another great quarter of execution. Now in a quarter where a lot of numbers really jumped out, the one, 73% growth in $5 million-plus deals and the fact that nearly half the Global 2000 has purchased all 3 platforms really jumped out to us. Now if you put these numbers in the context of the upside, the Strata product revenues as well as the strong Prisma SASE customer count, Nikesh, what are customers telling you about why they're selecting Palo Alto Networks sort of at just an accelerating rate versus the traditional on-prem firewall vendors or they call it the cloud-native zero trust competitors? Is it just increasingly understanding the value of the hybrid nature of the portfolio, the value of all 3 together, et cetera? And how are you just seeing these competitive dynamics playing out?
Nikesh Arora: Phil, I'm accused of speaking fast. Dude, you're beating me at it.
Phil Winslow: That's why we get along.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you for the question, Phil. It's kind of everything you said. And we've been saying this for a while that cybersecurity is consolidating and the evidence we've been shown by people like yourself is, look, it's never happened before. And I still submit that the reason it never happened before because you didn't have a cybersecurity company which would show you 20 best-of-breed products in its portfolio. Because customers are not suggesting they will buy something you have because it's in your platform, they are still demanding best-of-breed. And we're able to demonstrate to them the best-of-breed. But not only that, I think in the last 3.5 years, we've been able to demonstrate our track record saying, if something is important, we will make sure we deliver to you with best-in-class capability. So we're seeing that. This allows us to go back into customers. As you can imagine, if all you got is EDR or XDR to sell, if the customer just bought it, you got to move on. If all you got is SASE, you got to move on if the customer has bought SASE. In our case, our sales teams have a very large bag of tricks. If you don't want SASE, you've got cloud security going on, let me talk to you about cloud security. If you don't have cloud security going on yet, do you want to talk about buying more firewalls or replacing somebody. If you don't have that, do you want me to help you automate your SOC. So just the ability for us to demonstrate that we can help them with the multitude of their cybersecurity challenges and also show them that we're not trying to get them to make a very large commitment across all 3 of our platforms, they can walk and then they can run. They actually start by taking one of our platforms, allowing us to demonstrate our credibility and our security capabilities, thereby giving us the opportunity to then bid for the next business that they have. And I think the $1 million deals and $5 million deals are just a way to look at it because $1 million deals are typically single platform deals. And as you get into the 5s and the 10s, you certainly see that there is more of a portfolio approach. So look, it's what we said.
Clay Bilby: Next, from Hamza Fodderwala of Morgan Stanley followed by Fatima Boolani.
Hamza Fodderwala: I'll try to speak a little more slowly. Maybe just on the consolidation theme, sticking to that. One, just from a macro standpoint, I'm wondering if you're hearing anything different from customers around how they're thinking about the spending environment? And in relation to that, given the macro pressures on IT budgets more broadly, are you seeing more of a willingness to want to consolidate to fewer vendors as opposed to multiple different point products?
Nikesh Arora: Yes, Hamza, it's a great question. Look, interestingly, if you compare and contrast what we're seeing today with what we saw about 2.5 years ago, 2 years ago when the pandemic hit, believe it or not, there were more industries impacted by the pandemic than are impacted right now by inflation concerns. The oil industry is not stressing about IT budgets. The commodity industry is not stressing about IT budgets. The CPG industry is not stressing about IT budgets. The tech industry is not worried about IT budgets. So it's funny. If you think about it, the impact is yet to be felt in the companies. And even when it is felt, you'll see it in some constrained industries because there's a services boom right now. There's more jobs than people need to be hired. So we're not seeing the pressure from an inflation or reduced economic activity perspective. I will tell you when the pandemic hit, we were getting letters from CIOs saying, listen, our revenue has gone away. We're not sure when it's going to come back and how it's going to come back. Oil prices were at $0 for a few days. So at that point in time, they were all in that scenario you described. We haven't seen that scenario. And I don't want to be way too optimistic, but the fact that we were able to tide over that pandemic moment as an industry to be fair in cybersecurity, I'm less worried about it right now given what's going on in the environment because I think on the flip side, as I said, you're seeing way more security awareness and concern more than I've ever seen. And we don't hear about it until there's a big ransomware discussion publicly, but trust me, they're going on right now as we speak. Clay?
Clay Bilby: Next is Fatima Boolani from Citigroup.
Fatima Boolani: I have a bean-counting question that I'd like to ask of Dipak. Dipak, on your billings performance, just to unpack the strength there a little bit. Can you contextualize any changes to contract duration, specifically reconciling some of the commentary on the megadeal volumes that you realized this quarter? And also giving us maybe some flavors on the Palo Alto Financial Services vehicle, the financing arm that you introduced 2 years ago? And then thirdly, just around any discounts that we're peeling off from the COVID era? So just to get some of those dynamics, how we should think about the really outsized billings performance.
Dipak Golechha: A couple of different questions there, Fatima. Thanks for the question. So overall, I would say, let me just start off with the billings growth was really quite widespread. Our contract durations have remained roughly at around 3 years. They've been around that time. At any one given quarter, they can change a little bit like a month or 2, not significant. So it's possible that we get a little bit of, which was the last year's fluctuation versus this year. But overall, it was very broad-based and we're not seeing really many issues related to that. With respect to the PANFS, I think we've had that in place for a while. We're roughly at the same level of exposure that we've had before. It's not massively growing. Nothing is really changing significantly on that. So I don't think that's an unpacked like reconciling item. It really is like strength of the overall business. And sorry, just remind me the third part of your question.
Fatima Boolani : Just in the COVID era, I think you had been generous or flexible with your customers with respect to payment terms. So there was maybe a point or 2 of impact of discounts that are probably rolling off. So I'm just curious if those have completely been flushed out of the model in terms of discounts.
Dipak Golechha: Yes. No. So we track our discounts obviously very, very closely. We haven't really seen anything particularly significant in our discount changes either. So I would say that as you unpack the model, it really becomes pretty clear that it's broad-based growth.
Clay Bilby: Okay. Next question from Brian Essex of Goldman Sachs followed by Gray Powell.
Brian Essex: Great. Congrats on some nice results for me as well. I have a bit of a bean-counting question as well. Maybe for Dipak. Could you help us understand a little bit what's going on, on the cost side of the equation? Really great job in this environment delivering on the operating margin side. So I guess from a gross margin perspective, impact of pricing increases and then from an OpEx perspective, where is it that you're getting better cost control measures? And how sustainable are they?
Dipak Golechha: So let me just start off with, the cost pressures are really all within the supply chain area. We did take pricing. We took 7.5% pricing in September of last year, followed later internationally. We monitor that all the time, and we try to capture the impacts we'll have on future inflation. We've seen reasonably good realization of that pricing, which has been good. But obviously, the supply chain environment remains fluid. I think when it comes to where we've been able to focus on our operating expenses to offset that, it really is just a laser focus. There's no magic silver bullet. It's just a laser focus on the execution, making sure that we're watching every single dollar, acting like an owner, incredible intense scrutiny on travel because that was a concern of, would that come back with a vengeance. We focused a lot there, looking at leveraging scale when it comes to all the areas, frankly. We've had good scale in R&D, good scale in sales, marketing, good scale in G&A, but it's really just making sure that we're purposefully looking at every single headcount and justifying it.
Brian Essex: Got it. And a lot of that is sustainable? I mean, in T&E, I would imagine it would be relatively flexible. But how much are you going back for sustainable cost measures?
Dipak Golechha: I think we're very comfortable with the sustainability like as reflected in our guidance. Going forward, we just need to continue to act with that kind of diligence going forward.
Clay Bilby: The next is Gray Powell from BTIG followed by Saket Kalia.
Gray Powell: Okay. And congratulations on the great results. So yes, a question on the product side. 12 to 18 months ago, we're all thinking that product revenue should be growing in like the low single-digit range. It has consistently been much better, closer to 20% the last few quarters. So how should we think about the sustainability of product revenue growth going forward? And then beyond the price increases that you called out earlier this year, is there anything helping product revenue growth in fiscal '22 that creates a tougher comp in fiscal '23?
Nikesh Arora: Gray, first of all, we said this last quarter. We have been positively surprised by the growth in product, obviously. And Lee has a very interesting explanation on why people need more firewalls as their Internet traffic grows. And I'll let him speak to it because otherwise, he won't come to these calls. He told me that. But before he does that, look, we are seeing the Gen 3, Gen 4 evals causing people to go through a refresh cycle, which typically lasts 12 to 18 months when it's in full flow and it's not yet in full flow. As we highlighted, the market share changes, but there are people in our industry who are not able to keep up to 12 to 18 weeks of supply chain and sort of deliver firewalls. We have seen certain isolated incidents where customers have drawn up POs for some of our competitors and chosen Palo Alto Networks because we have product and others are not able to do that, which the best way to measure that is through market share gains. And these market share gains are here to stay. They're not going to go away because you're buying something which has a 6 to 7-year life and you're basically making a technology decision to switch to Palo Alto Networks. So I think the combination of market share gains, the refresh cycle, the increased volume. And Lee, do you want to give your explanation?
Lee Klarich: Yes. I think one of the sort of misunderstandings with the move to the cloud is that everyone thought that, that would be the death of hardware. But the reality is, you have all of these users that need to now reach applications running in the cloud, and these applications generally are higher bandwidth-type applications. And so that triggers a need to upgrade the firewall infrastructure to be able to secure higher bandwidth connectivity. And so that, it actually is a positive trend toward hardware sales and hardware requirements, especially as we come out of the pandemic and more and more companies are moving back toward a hybrid workforce where more and more employees are showing up to the office as well.
Nikesh Arora: I'll give you an example. We're primarily in the cloud with our capabilities, but...
Lee Klarich : Yes. A few years ago, we had a pair of 1-gig links to the Internet at our main headquarters. We now have a pair of 10-gig links, just to kind of give you an order of magnitude and I don't think that's an unusual situation for companies to do.
Nikesh Arora: So despite us moving to the cloud, we've had to upgrade our firewalls in our headquarters.
Gray Powell: Makes a lot of sense.
Clay Bilby: Next question from Saket Kalia of Barclays followed by Michael Turits.
Saket Kalia: Okay. Great. Nikesh, maybe for you. Again, going back to the billings, great to see the acceleration. Maybe just to look at it from a different angle. You've talked about some new attached subscriptions that some of them might be higher value. Of course, you've got the NGS billings in there as well. Can you just talk to how much each of those are sort of driving that billings acceleration, some of those newer attached subscriptions to the core firewall as well as that NGS billings line.
Nikesh Arora: Well, Saket, thanks for your question. You've seen we share our NGS billing ARR with you. So it's quite transparent. And you see that, that number at that scale continues to grow in the 50%, 60% range, which is clearly a big contributor to our billings. Our product being at 20% also contributes to billings. We've highlighted that Cortex hit $500 million ARR in that number. So clearly, it's reached a milestone for us in that entire mix. And as you rightfully identified, we have now 10 subscriptions that we run. When I came 3 years ago, we used to have 4. So clearly, you should expect that there is a significant attach that is going on, which will persist as we continue to sell hardware in the current growth rates that we are. So higher growth rate of hardware drives more subscription and services which with a higher attach ends up giving a nice lift on our billings.
Clay Bilby: Next, we've got Michael Turits of KeyBanc followed by Roger Boyd.
Michael Turits: Great. So I think, Dipak, I'll ask you on the labor and wage front. Given the shortages out there on that side, we've seen some large corporations, some have hiring freezes, some are raising wages for their existing customers. So A, how are you doing in terms of hiring as many people that you need? And then B, what exactly are you doing in order to maintain costs in that increasing wage environment around skilled labor?
Nikesh Arora: So Michael, we haven't hired as many people as we were expecting to in this market. It's a very tight labor market at this current point as you see. Having said that, my personal view is the labor market is going to become easier in the next 6 to 12 months. And anecdotally, as you've seen, we're seeing hiring freezes anecdotally. If you think about it 6 months ago, we were losing people to start-ups. We were losing people to competitors whose stock prices were going up into the right. The market rationalization is causing people to take stock and say, wait, do I really want to go make this move. I've already seen anecdotally start-ups start to stop hiring because they're trying to hold on to their cash because they don't expect to be able to raise money in the market for the next 12 to 18 months. So I think from that perspective, the labor market actually, in our opinion, is going to ease up a little bit. We expect some degree of wage inflation, which is being caused because of the fact that we're in Silicon Valley, and we live around some very large tech companies who are trying to get people to come work there. So we have factored into our planning some degree of inflation on our wages, but I personally don't think it's going to be off the charts.
Michael Turits: Thanks for answering, Nikesh. Lee, hit you on product, but Gray got you first, so I thought I'd hit Dipak, but thanks for answering.
Nikesh Arora: That's all right, no problem.
Dipak Golechha: I'll just add one comment maybe to the overall is like wages is one factor that people look at when they choose a company. We've recently had a Welcome Home program. I think a couple of quarters ago, we actually showed you guys a video of it. And that's been remarkably successful. We find a lot of people that will leave realize that the culture of the company is equally as important as what was potentially short-term gains when they leave. Yes. Well, a lot more important ultimately than the gains and then the grass is not always greener. We've had remarkable success bringing them back, and we'll continue to do that.
Clay Bilby: Next is Roger Boyd of UBS followed by Andy Nowinski.
Roger Boyd: Congrats on the quarter. Just going back to the macro conversation. I think you noted a couple of larger deals in EMEA. Just curious of any commentary on what you're seeing around sales cycles and any sense of whether maybe you're pulling forward some demand given the threat environment?
Nikesh Arora : Yes. Look, in every quarter, we've seen some deals get pulled forward sometimes with our salespeople because they're trying to hit quotas. Sometimes the customer because they're in a compromised situation, they're trying to get something sorted quickly as possible. Sometimes it has to do with budgets expiring in different parts of the world. December becomes one of those moments. August becomes that for the federal government. So I think perhaps the best answer is that we have not seen any unusual activity around that topic. Having said that, as we said, we are seeing heightened activity from nation states, especially with proximity to where the war is. They're trying to fortify their defenses and make sure they understand their attack surfaces as a nation better, which they have not had to worry about in the past. They should have worried about it, but they haven't focused on it. But now as people are trying to petition to go become members of NATO, they've got to make sure that their defenses are robust in case they see retaliation.
Clay Bilby: All right. And next, we've got Andy Nowinski from Wells Fargo followed by Rob Owens.
Andy Nowinski : All right. Congrats on a great quarter. So I had a question with regarding your next-gen ARR. Obviously, a very strong quarter, and your net new ARR was also up about 32%. Yet your guidance suggests that net new ARR will decline about 7% in Q4. Other than conservatism, are there any other factors that we should consider that might cause net new ARR growth to significantly decelerate in your fiscal year-end?
Nikesh Arora: Andy, I look at it from the other side of the lens. The other side of the lens says, we had a great quarter. We're upping guidance across the board for Q4. We're upping guidance across the board for the full fiscal year way ahead of what we had promised to the markets in our Analyst Day not too long ago, and that seems to be a wonderful story and a happy place to be.
Clay Bilby: All right. Next, we've got Rob Owens of Piper Sandler followed by Jonathan Ho.
Rob Owens: Great. I was wondering if you could drill down a little bit into some of the supply chain advantages that you've alluded to both in the prepared script as well as Q&A here. Where do you see an advantage? How sustainable is it as well?
Nikesh Arora: I think, Rob, the real opportunity here is Dipak has a team of experts who spend a lot of time trying to understand the puts and takes in terms of being able to deliver firewalls in terms of ordering forward. And I think that's worked out so far for us. We have been able to deliver 20% growth, which is basically shipping as you've heard across the board in the industry that most hardware businesses are building backlog. We're no different than most hardware businesses out there. During the year, we have more backlog than we started with or it moves back and forth depending on what we can ship in different categories. So the teams already have sort of their marching orders in terms of what they need to go out and find. And I think the other way to think about it is that from a scale and scope perspective, if you're doing $300-plus million of product, the semiconductor cost of that is probably $60 million, $70 million. So in a year, we're looking for $300 million semiconductors in a hundreds of billions of dollar industry. So I joke that some of our other players in the industry need the entire truck. I just need the box that falls off the back of the truck. So we're doing a good job chasing trucks to find the boxes.
Dipak Golechha: So if I can just add like, the only thing that I would add is like, a lot of it just comes down to the people and the quality of the execution and discipline of the people. And that's really been like, I think, across the board, the execution across pretty much every part of our portfolio is what we feel most proud of and what gives us the most confidence in our guidance going forward.
Clay Bilby: Next, we've got Jonathan Ho of William Blair followed by Matt Hedberg.
Jonathan Ho : One question for Lee to make sure he keeps coming on to these calls. How should we think about the pace of adoption for Prisma Cloud? And are you seeing any specific drivers emerge there to drive some of this accelerated demand?
Lee Klarich: Yes.
Nikesh Arora: Thanks, Jonathan, for keeping him busy.
Lee Klarich: Appreciate it. Thank you, Jonathan. Look, there's some obvious drivers. Cloud consumption continues to rise and you have to secure that consumption of workloads that the companies are moving to the cloud. That's probably the most obvious one. But it goes hand in hand with that the recognition of all the different security capabilities that are actually needed to secure that cloud environment. If you look back just 3 or 4 years ago, a lot of cloud security was just maybe 1 or 2 simple capabilities. And today, whole businesses are being run out of the cloud and the understanding of how important the security is and what it takes to do that. And then that then ends up leading to a choice for many customers. Do they try to patch together a whole bunch of different point products from different vendors and find a way to integrate them and get them to work and operate them or do they go with Prisma Cloud, which is really unique in the industry as being a platform made up of best-of-breed capabilities that can secure their whole cloud environments. And that's really where we're seeing that not only the driving new customer adoption, but driving the expansion within our existing installed base as they adopt these new modules. And as Nikesh said in his prepared remarks, Cloud Code Security is the fastest-growing new module that we've introduced. And that just shows the ability to deliver a high-value new module to customers and then also the ease with which they can adopt those new capabilities into the platform they're already using.
Clay Bilby: All right. Thanks, folks, for sticking with one question. Our next, a question from Matt Hedberg of RBC followed by Ben Bollin.
Matt Hedberg: So I have another one for Lee. Actually, we'll keep Lee going here. Lee, obviously, there's a huge talent shortage out there for security experts. And obviously, the threat landscape is very challenging. Does that make your automation, orchestration capabilities even more important today? And maybe how does that manifest itself in platform attach maybe even beyond SOAR?
Lee Klarich: Yes. Great question, Matt. I'll actually reverse what you said. The first key value that customers are realizing in that shortage is being able to adopt security on top of platforms has a significant benefit toward the ease with which it can be operationalized. And so that actually is the starting point. Automation then becomes a layer on top of that where the remaining manual workflows then start to go through cycles of, what are the most repetitive tasks, how do we put those through an automation workflow engine like XSOAR and build that muscle of recognizing manual workflows, automating and then finding the next manual workflows and automating those. I'll give you an example within our own IT organization. We track this. We actually quantify every quarter the number of hours that we've been able to automate. A typical quarter for us, we will automate an incremental 30,000 hours of manual repetitive tasks. And it's not so much about the savings, it's about being able to then reallocate that focus toward new, high-value tasks that people need to accomplish.
Clay Bilby: Next up, Ben Bollin of Cleveland Research followed by Adam Tindle.
Ben Bollin: Dipak or Nikesh, I was hoping you could quantify the impact of supply chain you think was left on the table in the quarter and how you think about that in guidance? And any longer-term thoughts you have on how your strategy around supply chain has evolved or has changed because of what we've seen over the last several quarters?
Nikesh Arora: Well, look, as you can imagine, the teams work hard every quarter with our suppliers and partners to see what the art of the possible is, not just this quarter, but over the next 4 quarters and even longer and depending on the lead times of the items. And again, despite that, as Dipak characterized it as a fluid environment, things keep moving around even in that time frame. So we have robust plans with our partners. We look at the inventory. We understand the inventory. Remember, the whole industry has gone from JIT to just-in-case because you can have stuff lying around for 3 months because the required part doesn't show up for 3 months until you got to go integrate it. So there's a whole bunch of stuff that's moved. And as Dipak highlighted, there's a phenomenal team focused on executing that in a way that we can deliver our numbers. In terms of the demand, the backlog and what we have been promising, we have reasonable line of sight if all things work in terms of what we're likely to get on a quarterly basis. Hence, our guidance is consistent with what our best guess on what will be available is, and that's why we keep telling you guys that this is not a demand problem. This is a supply challenge that we're trying to address as an industry. So I think from that perspective, things are on track. Like at some point in time, this has to abate. At that point in time, we just want to make sure that we're not stuck with too much supply and we have the right stuff out there. So there's a lot of work that goes into forecasting, predicting, understanding product road map, understanding the refresh cycles of our customers, understanding which customers more likely to order Gen 3 or Gen 4. So a lot of planning, a lot of math that's going into this stuff because my sense is there is a big pendulum shift and a lot of people are ordering a lot of stuff. And there's definitely, at some point in time, there will be more supply, and we just have to make sure that we don't get stuck with too much supply. From a long-term perspective, we're trying to balance that. We've held a view that we're not going to do too many price increases because stuck with a lot of supply at a high price, it doesn't take a genius to figure out what the consequences are. So we've been very careful with our price increase. We're keeping them moderated. We watch our discounts. And we're making sure that we don't order so much that we're going to have a hangover. I think that works like that, does it? Okay. Does that help you better?
Ben Bollin: It does.
Clay Bilby: Okay. Next we've got Adam Tindle of Raymond James followed by Brent Thill.
Adam Tindle: Okay. Nikesh, you alluded to a GAAP profit in the near future in your prepared comments. And just wanted to challenge this but admit it's double talk since it's part of my thesis. But as I question myself, why is now the time to show GAAP profit and leverage? The flip side is, you're seeing momentum across almost all metrics. You could step on the gas even further and go to market given the portfolio is winning. You're having success in hiring yet human capital is scarce. And your R&D engine has developed products that are clearly showing differentiation. And Dipak, if you wanted to add any comments to that because there's some level of substituting this for increased cash margin in the future. So what to do with the incremental cash that has a better ROI than a more aggressive internal investment strategy?
Nikesh Arora: Look, it's kind of interesting. If you look at, we've been sharing with you in the past the amount of products we introduced into our field force. And we've actually asked Lee and his great team to slow down product introduction in the fourth quarter because I want to make sure that the teams out there are focused on delivering Q4, which clearly is one of the larger quarters that we deliver. So I don't think we need more fuel in the product pipeline. We need to make sure that the product pipeline gets to a lot of our customers. Having said that, as you see, as we traverse to larger and larger deal sizes, we keep driving efficiency from our go-to-market capabilities. And we think we have, and I think I was counting, Dipak probably said it 4 times and he wrote in my script twice. So he's clearly sending a message. We are managing growth with the right aspiration for profitability. So trust me, I am not shy if I feel there's an opportunity and I need to go overinvest. We did that when we bought north of 15 companies with $3.5 billion when the time was right to be able to build the product portfolio. So if we feel that we're leaving money on the table, we will go charge at it. But I think we're striking the right balance. And if we see better growth, we will make sure we go out and invest. But as of now, we feel we have ample resources in our plan in line with our growth expectations. And our key is to sustain those growth expectations over time to generate most value for our shareholders. What are you going to do with all that free cash?
Dipak Golechha: Look, I think it's a world-class problem to have, but I think I'm just going to echo what Nikesh said. I think everything in balance and then we really let total shareholder return and the ROI determine what we do within the boundaries of what we've committed to.
Clay Bilby: Okay. Great. Last question for today from Brent Thill of Jefferies.
Brent Thill: Nikesh, on the G4 refresh cycle, you mentioned it's early days. Is there a percentage through this you'd put on at 20%, 30%? Is there an easy ballpark you can give us on where you're at through that right now?
Nikesh Arora: Lee?
Lee Klarich : Yes. It's a great question. It's a low number. Remember, the biggest chunk of the Gen 4 hardware was just introduced about 3 months ago toward the end of February. So the first round was June of last year, but the broader set of platforms actually was just a few months ago. So we're very much early innings on this. We've seen very good early adoption and interest from customers. And as Nikesh said, these refreshes are 12, 18, 24 months in nature.
Clay Bilby: All right. Great. With that, we'll conclude the Q&A portion of our call today. I will now turn it back over to Nikesh for his closing remarks.
Nikesh Arora: Look, I just want to say thank you to our employees, our partners, our customers for allowing us to be both their cybersecurity partners, of our employees for doing a phenomenal job all around the world. And I also want to thank you for taking the time. See you guys next quarter.

We have included tables, which provide reconciliations between non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures in the Appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release, which we have filed with the SEC and can also be found in the Investor section of our website.  Please note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless specifically noted otherwise. We would also like to note that our management is scheduled to participate in the Morgan Stanley Investor Conference in March.  I'd like to apologize for the delay on our start time. We experienced a technical issue that required delaying the call by 30 minutes. I will now turn the call over to Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you, Clay. Good afternoon and thank you everyone for joining us today for our earnings call. As you've seen by our results, we released, we had an exceptional Q2. We continue to accelerate the growth of our business in line with our stated direction of fiscal year 2022, being the year of focused execution. First, let's talk about the market and the trends we're seeing. Firstly, we continue to see a strong demand for cyber security. We have not seen any changes in the IT spending patterns of our customers or a slowdown in companies investing in IT systems to drive competitive advantage. On the contrary, we see acceleration around trends associated with the shift to the cloud, as well as continued efforts to redefine network architectures, to enable employees to work effectively from anywhere, a trend which has been bolstered by the pandemic and we continue to believe we are still in the early innings here. Both these factors underpin continued demand for cybersecurity services. Secondly, we continue to see an evolving and complicated threat landscape. We have highlighted in the past that cybersecurity is at the front and center of all conversations around risks and threats at companies as well as nation and state levels. We believe cybersecurity will continue to become more and more relevant and important. With increased alliance on technology in the prevalence of cyber-attacks, there is an ability to disrupt businesses and critical systems making cybersecurity an area that will need continued focused investment. In addition to industry specific trends, we're seeing a trend that is unique to Palo Alto Networks. Given our investments in the areas and continued relevance across multiple platforms and needs of our customers, we're having more and more significant partnership conversations, which encompass the entire Palo Alto Networks offering. Whilst early, we believe this is the true differentiation that Palo Alto Networks provides both best of breed and integrated security that works. Thirdly, our continued focus and execution. This focus is bearing fruit as we execute multiple dimensions across our business. Execution from our product teams means continuing our rapid pace of integrated platform delivery. We will talk about the innovation across our platforms, but to highlight just today, we unveiled our XSIAM product, which is poised to reimagine security operation centers and truly deploy technology to resolve cyberattacks in real time. Execution from our go-to-market teams means focusing on the broader customer-driven priority of helping them significantly improve their cybersecurity posture. This is demonstrated by the multi-platform large deal commitments we're beginning to see. Execution from our supply chain team means we are able to work with our suppliers in this tough environment to deliver critical security appliances to our customers. We had to balance some of the increased costs of price increases as an offset, but we have been able to keep these increases modest in comparison to our peers. Execution from our people leaders means despite this being a hot market for great talent, we're able to attract and retain the best minds in cybersecurity. As you saw in the opening of the call, we launched a Welcome Home Program to welcome back employees that had left our company. We have seen good initial success here. Let's take a quick look at some of the outcomes caused by the focus and execution. In Q2, revenue was up 30% while the leading billing and RPO metrics up 32% and 36% respectively. We're building a more predictable business model. Our CRPO balance of $3.4 billion gives us significant visibility into our next 12 months revenue. Next-generation security or NGS ARR finished Q2 at $1.43 billion. As we hit our midyear point, we have greater confidence that our strategy is working, which is driving us to make further investments in these businesses. At the same time, we continue to transform our core network security business with a software mix within our Firewall as a Platform billings came in at 40% up five points versus last year. We drove these strong top-line results while balancing non-GAAP profitability even as we absorbed some incremental expenses from supply chain challenges. Operating income grew 20% and adjust to free cash grew 33%. We outperformed our non-GAAP EPS guidance midpoint by $0.09. For a number of quarters we've talked about our large deal momentum. To accelerate these results as we exited fiscal 2021, we layered on a sales strategy to elevate our focus and drive efficiency in our largest opportunities. With a growing portfolio of products across the platforms, making large deal selling repeatable process is core to our sustaining and accelerated growth trajectory. With BJ Jenkins, signaling the leadership role for our broader sales organization, you had an ability to increase management attention on the largest deals in the form of Amit Singh, our CBO. We're pleased with the results we have seen in the first half of the year. These deeper multi-platform relationships are win-win for Palo Alto networks and our customers. As a Testament to this, at the end of Q2, 47% of our Global 2000 customers use products from all three of our platforms up from 38% a year ago. In Q2, we closed 221 seven-figure transactions, including three transactions over $20 million. Our millionaire customers were 1077 in Q2, up 26% year-over-year. Our combined rate of growth in millionaire customers, as well as an increase in size of our large deals has helped us sustain the accelerated level of growth we've seen over the last several quarters. In all, for the strong quarter I want to thank our global teams for their strong execution across the board. Driving these results are the transformation of our firewall business and our focus on capturing the growth in next-generation security. In particular this quarter, our strengths were well balanced in both of these. Let's do a quick review of our progress across our three platforms. As you know, we have them design modularly, so the customers can initiate their partnership journey with Palo Alto Networks, whatever their current need is. But over time, we work with them to both expand across any one of our platforms, and also work with them to adopt our other platforms in line with their plants. At the heart of our three-platform strategy is innovation. This is a fuel for our growth, especially in next-generation security, where we play in markets that are early in their life cycle. In the first half of fiscal year, 2022, we had 22 major product releases, which is equal to all the releases we had in the full year of fiscal 2020. Even more impressive is that this quarter, marks the end of all, integrations of our acquired businesses over the last few years, i.e. all of our products are now seamlessly integrated and can have organic development continue on them. We were also pleased to receive two new industry awards, adding one in developer security tools and other in secure web gateway. We now have a leadership position in ten categories. Focusing first in our firewall business, we’re continuing to refresh our platform. And just last week, we announced two more new families with the PA-3400 and PA-5400. These new generation four platforms have industry-leading performance on real world encrypted traffic using our single pass architecture and performance that is 3 times faster than similar Gen 3 appliances. We also rolled out PAN-OS 10.2 Nebula release, which adds significant new capability in using machine learning to stop the current generation of highly malicious attacks in line. This capability powers our recently released advanced URL and new advanced threat prevention subscriptions, as well as brings significant enhancements to the capability of our DNS security subscription. We added the industries first integrated AIOps to our next generation firewalls. Our 10 subscription added to the firewall family. This capability assists customers to prevent firewall misconfigurations and proactively addresses performance issues before the impact customer networks. We were pleased with our ability to grow our product revenues at 21%. This contributed to our Q2 revenue upside and was the head of our guided mid-teens growth for the full year, which we will be raising. Our teams work tirelessly during Q2 to ensure we could fulfill product demands to customers as quickly as possible while also navigating through Gen 3 to Gen 4 refresh. We didn’t see demand for our next generation firewall appliances outstrip our ability to ship in the quarter and this is reflected in the growing RPO I spoke about earlier. Strong security demand, innovations we are bringing to customers such as our Nebula release as well as customer appetite for our Gen 4 gives us strong conviction and sustained product demand into fiscal year 2023. Next, I want to spend some time in our NGS business. This is one where our teams have done work, which I personally believe has not been done in the cybersecurity industry before. And this is what makes Palo Alto Networks special. We have built a formidable set of services, which are cloud first, and these services are resonating with our customers. This success is truly driven by us working with our customers to anticipate their challenges, delivering best-of-breed solutions in an integrated fashion whilst continuing to focus on security outcomes. This has resulted in us building an NGS, ARR stream of $1.43 billion driven by billings growth to 79% in NGS. Diving deeper into SASE, which has been a strong contributor to NGS. We continue to see strong uptake from our existing customers. We’re also seeing marque new customer wins, which are reflected in our current customer count of 19,083, which is up 62%. A recent report from the IT industry analyst enterprise strategy group noted that 78% of organizations have begun or are planning SASE implementations. We see this mirrored in our customer conversations where hybrid work is now the way many of these companies are planning and supporting the future work. We are pleased to against stand on Okta’s Business at Work report, where we were identified as a leading provider of remote access solutions. We’re seeing SASE emerge as a key platform for our customers. With these customers, looking to Prisma SASE to deploy DG capabilities. We rolled out integrated CASB within Prisma Access 2.0, including a new capability around inline DLP for SaaS, and in particular collaboration and applications. We continue to see success attaching autonomous digital experience management or ADEM as an upsell in Prisma Access as customers rely more on SASE as a foundation of the network architecture. On the cloud front, we’re seeing mainstream adoption of hyperscale public cloud in our customer base, as well as an acceleration and production workflows. This is driving sustained strength we’re seeing from Prisma Cloud. Four years ago, we made it a conscious strategy to be a first mover with multiple big bets to proactively invest or believe the future of security was going. Our pivot began with several acquisitions targeting companies with the best technologies. We developed a unique go-to market approach, allowing us to promote future modules as part of an integrated offering. We’re seeing tremendous success with this approach. While our active customers grew 21% to 1,810 in Q2, we saw north of 56% growth and credit consumptions driven both by increased adoption on the cloud by our customers and their continued adoption of more security modules in Prisma Cloud. While our two core modules, cloud security posture management and cloud workload protection are mainstream within most of our customer base. We’re seeing an increased adoption of three and more modules. There are two areas I would like to highlight in Prisma Cloud to support. First, the launch of cloud code security, and second, the launch of agentless scanning. Approximately one year ago, we acquired Bridgecrew, which has strong early attraction in DevSecOps enabling security to be shifted left into the software development life cycle. This addresses security problems before they are created in production deployments and is far more efficient. A single deployment template can be propagated hundreds of times. There are multiple vulnerabilities in the code; each deployment could create hundreds of security events even once in production. Bridgecrew had significant traction with its checkout open-source tool, momentum that has significantly accelerated since its acquisition closed, and downloads are up to 5 times year-over-year. Building on the Bridgecrew technology, in Q2, we released our fifth Prisma Cloud pillar, cloud code security, which is part of our 3.0 release. Our stand-alone Bridgecrew product has about 70 customers. We’re pleased to see DevSecOps customer momentum building as Prisma Cloud customers adopt cloud code security to several weeks after its integrated releases into our platform. Let’s talk about agentless scanning. You’ve seen a number of smaller provider focused on small initiatives in cloud-native security, providing only agentless scanning is one of them. What we hear clearly from a customer is that they want a platform approach to cloud security, which offers the flexibility of both agent and agentless scanning, depending on their architecture and security needs. Towards this end, our teams rallied and delivered agentless scanning in record time. This makes sure that our customers can deploy either approach via the integrated platform that is Prisma Cloud. Now turning to Cortex, our endpoint security, security analytics and automation solutions. We continue to see significant customer demand for automation and security as threat data and volume security events grow at exponential rates. The human-only approach to interpreting data and responding to events is not keeping pace. We’re seeing strong customer adoption of our market-leading technologies across XDR, XSOAR and Xpanse. Total customers across XDR Pro and XSOAR reached 3,232 and increased over 69%. Q2 was a strong quarter for new customers, both those that are brand-new to Palo Alto Networks and also cross-sells to Cortex. We also saw acute strength across all of our geographies for Cortex. At our Ignite event last November, we launched our managed partnership program, XMDR, and we continue to see partners join the program to further align the opportunity across our Cortex portfolio. We now have 27 partners there and have a strong pipeline of interest of partners working through the certification process. Core to our growing success with Cortex is the innovation investments we have made over the last years in XDR, XSOAR and Xpanse with market-leading capabilities in each. Shortly after leasing XDR 3.0 in Q1 to enable cloud detection response, we release XDR 3.0 – 3.1 in Q2 to further enhance our cloud asset visibility and insights. Q2 also marked the release of our intelligence modules for XSOAR providing end-to-end railroad certain intelligence to identify and discover new malware familiar – families or campaigns or attack techniques that are related to security incidents. This morning, we announced our Cortex extended security intelligence and automation management, or XSIAM, platform and shared our vision to provide an autonomous cybersecurity solution as a modern alternative to SIEM solutions. We believe security operations teams have an urgent threat detection remediation problem, and only by leaning into a natively AI-driven platform, we will be able to bring down response times from hours and days to seconds and minutes. We’re on a mission to revolutionize how data analytics and automation is leveraged in cybersecurity, and XSIAM is a product of years of research and development we’ve been doing in this area. XSIAM is currently available to a limited number of customers that will be broadly available later this year. In summary, I am very pleased with our Q2 results. We both continue to benefit from strength in our core next-generation firewall business and is a strong sign of our future growth prospects, significant strength across our next-generation security portfolio. This balanced performance is a hallmark of our long-term strategy to drive durable growth. On the back of this trend and based on what we’re seeing in our pipeline heading into the second half of fiscal year 2022, we are raising our total revenue, product revenue and total billings guidance for the year. Within this top line, given our confidence in both our pipeline and our sales execution NGS, we’re also raising NGS ARR for the year. Lastly, we’re delivering this top line while we continue to make significant investments in our business for future growth. We not only continue to see strong near-term demand but also strong medium-term trends in cybersecurity, fueled by underlying spend in IT spending and secular trends like hybrid work and cloud-native adoption. We have aligned investments both to building sales capacity for fiscal year 2023 as well as medium-term investments and product capability. These investments have been made while also absorbing unexpected supply chain-related costs this year. Despite this, we have been able to deliver upside to our non-GAAP EPS forecast so far this year. We're lifting our non-GAAP EPS guidance here, reflecting much of the upside resulting in Q2. With that, I will turn the call over Dipak to go into more detail in the Q2 performance of our guidance.
Dipak Golechha: Thank you, Nikesh and good afternoon, everyone. We again delivered results ahead of our guidance across all metrics as we continue to transform our business. Top line growth remains strong in Q2 with balance strength across our portfolio, including product and especially in our next generation security offerings. Supported by the strength in our differentiated offerings we're raising our full year guidance. For Q2, revenue of $1.32 billion grew 30% and was above the high end of our guidance range. Product grew 21% and total services grew by 32%. We saw strong growth in all geographies and across all platforms. By geography the Americas grew 33%, EMEA was up 22% and JPAC grew 23%. NGS ARR finished the quarter at $1.43 billion supported by broad strength across each of our platforms. Prisma Access ARR more than doubled year-on-year and we continue to see especially strong growth from XDR and Prisma Cloud. This demonstrates that our portfolio approach to driving growth in our high growth markets is working and what gives us confidence to rate our – raise our guidance here, which I will talk more about shortly. In the second quarter of 2022, we deliver total billings of $1.61 billion, up 32% and also above the high end of our guidance range. Total deferred revenue in Q2 was $5.4 billion, an increase of 31%. As a reminder billings as total revenue plus the change in total deferred revenue net of acquired deferred revenue. Our NGS billings grew 79% year-over-year. Going forward we encourage investors to focus on our NGS ARR metric as we view this measure is being more indicative of the underlying drivers of this business. We will not be updating NGS billings in the future. Remaining performance obligation or RPO was $6.3 billion, increasing 36% with current RPO growing largely in line with total RPO. As mentioned previously we believe RPO adds meaningful insight into our future revenue, as it includes both prepaid and contractual commitments from customers. The strength of our RPO growth gives us confidence in our future quarters as it effectively provides us a head start from a revenue perspective. Our product growth was 21% in Q2 and above what we have seen historically, reflecting strong customer demand for our appliance and software offerings. Within our firewall as a platform business, we saw billing growth 26% in line with the growth we have seen over the last year as customers purchased hardware, software, and SASE form factors. Within FWaaP, our software mix increased 5 points to 40%. Last quarter we raised our fiscal year 2022 outlook for product revenue growth to mid-teens. We're raising this outlet to height teams as we continue to balance the forces of very strong customer demand and supply chain constraints. Turning to the details of our results, product revenue was $308 million growing 21%. Subscription revenue was $618 million, increased 34%. Support revenue of $391 million increased 30% and in total subscription support revenue of $1.01 billion increased 32% and counted for 77% of our total revenue. Non-GAAP gross margin of 74% was down 130 basis points in part due to the ongoing cost associated with the supply chain. Our production teams have done an outstanding job in fulfilling the growing demand and keeping the priority focused on enabling shipments to customers. We will continue that posture moving forward. Non-Gap operating margin of 18.4% was again up sequentially and down at year-over-year as expected with higher product and support costs impacting the year-over-year track. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter grew 20% to $185 million or $1.74 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP effect tax rate was 22%, our GAAP net loss was $94 million or $0.95 per basic and diluted share. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We finished January with cash equivalents and investments of $4.2 billion. Days sales outstanding was 60 days unchanged from a year ago. Cash flow from operations was $483 million; we generated adjusted free cash of $441 million, a margin of 33.5%. In QT we again balanced multiple financial priorities with strength in both top line, underlying non-GAAP profitability and in cash conversion. We believe it is important to hold ourselves to this discipline even when growth is robust in order to drive a best-in-class financial model as we scale into a larger company. We continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities that outlined in our September Analyst Day. During Q2 we repurchased approximately 1 million share on the open market at an average price for approximately $534 per share for a total consideration of $550 million. We continue to expect a large part of our cash flow to be used for share purchase. We have approximately $450 million remaining on our authorization, for future share purchases expiring December 31st, 2022. On the M&A front we did not close any acquisitions in Q2. As we noticed at Analyst Day, we continue to focus on managing down our stock based compensation as a percentage of revenue. This quarter we reduced SBC by about two points zero over year, as we apply our overall discipline to this process, whilst balancing the current market for cyber ready talent. We look forward to continuing this trend. Similarly, we talked about an aspiration for achieving the rule of 60 combining revenue growth and adjusted free cash margin. You will see that with the revised midpoint of our fiscal year guidance, we are now expecting to achieve this once aspirational goal. Lastly, moving to guidance and modeling point. As Nikesh highlighted, we continue to see very balanced demand. This includes demand from our appliance form factors that outstrips our ability to fulfill them in the short-term, as well as strengthen our next generation security portfolio. Our Q3 guidance takes into account the strong demand picture as well as the best information we have today on supply chain and other factors. Turning to our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect billings to be in the range of $1.59 to $1.61 billion, an increase of 24% to 25%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.345 billion to $1.365 billion, an increase of 25% to 27%. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of a $1.65 to $1.68 based on a weighted average diluted count of approximately 106 million to 108 million shares. For fiscal year 2022 we expect billions to be in the range of $6.8 million to 6.85 billion, an increase of 25% to 26%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $5.425 to $5.475 billion, an increase of 27% to 29%. We expect NGS ARR to be $1.725 billion to $1.775 billion, an increase of 46% to 50%. We expect product revenue to grow in the high teens with the seasonality weighted to Q4 as we have seen in prior years. We continue to expect operating margins to be in the range of 18.5% to 19%. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $7.23 to $7.3 based on a weighted average diluted count of approximately 106 million to 108 million shares. Adjusted free cash flow margin is expected to be in the range of 32% to 33%. Additionally, please consider the following additional modeling points. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 22% for Q3 2022 and fiscal year 2022, subject to the outcome of future tax legislation. We expect net interest and other expenses of $5 million to $6 million per quarter. For Q3, we expect capital expenditures of $40 million to $45 million. For fiscal year 2022, we expect capital expenditures of $185 million to $195 million, which includes $39 million outlaid in Q2 related to our Santa Clara headquarters. With that, I will turn the call back over to Clay for the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you.
A - Clay Bilby: Great. Thank you, Dipak. [Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Saket Kalia of Barclays with Tal Liani of BofA to follow.
Saket Kalia: Okay. Great. Thanks, Clay. Thanks team. Nikesh, maybe I'll start off with a product question since it's hot off the press this morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the XSIAM product a little bit. Again, brand new given the announcement today, but maybe the question is, how do you envision disrupting the SIEM market? And how can you maybe leverage your existing portfolio to cross-sell into the customer base?
Nikesh Arora: Well, thank you, Saket. Thanks for the question. Look, when I came to Palo Alto Networks, our mean time to respond at Palo Alto Networks was measured into days. And for someone who did not work in the security industry, I found that a little flabbergasting because if it takes tens of days to figure out that you've been breached and all you're doing is closing the door after somebody is gone. So we challenged our team internally, said can you take that and turn that into seconds or minutes because that's the only way we're going to have a chance to be able to protect not just ourselves, but our customers in the future. That required us internally revamp from having north of, I'd say 15 to 20 other security vendors even in our infrastructure down to less than 10 because there are some areas, as we don't play in cybersecurity. But that coupled with automation, with data analytics; we're down at Palo Alto Networks just under one-minute as a mean time to resolution, which is how we can resolve Log4j within our company or SolarWinds within our company. And I think that's the capability that customers need. And we did a phenomenal job just in his video where he says, look, you take a car and you had adaptive control, you add park lane assist. You add all those features to an old car or is an a new car, but doors between around 20 years that doesn't make it an autonomous vehicle. You have to start from scratch. You have to build the software to build analyzing data and that's kind of the right analogy to think about it. The future of protecting our customers will have to depend on being able to analyze data on the fly, immediate on the fly, not wait for humans to analyze it and come back 10 days later and say now I know what happened. So towards that end we have launched XSIAM, it is an early release working with a handful of design partners to work with them to go replace to security infrastructure and align with what we've done at Palo Alto that allow us to learn and to build with them, but we expect this product will be GA-ed later in the year, really excited. The way it leverages our portfolio is we can do it quickly if you're using Palo Alto appliances, Palo Alto firewalls, Palo Alto endpoints. We can do a Palo Alto Prisma Cloud is an easy thing to do for us. We also integrate with other security vendors but obviously the quality of data becomes suspect as you keep going on to more and more legacy security technologies
Saket Kalia: Great. Thanks.
Clay Bilby: And our next question comes from Tal Liani of Bank of America, with Brian Essex next. Please proceed.
Tal Liani: Hi. I hope you can hear me. I have a balance sheet – I'm limited to one question, so I'll just ask the question that no one else will ask probably. I'll ask the balance sheet question. There is a long-term convertible note that was rolled into short-term liabilities, the magnitude is big. It's $1.6 billion. Can you explain this? Also, I'm looking into your SBC; it's getting to $290 million this quarter almost. It's a big number and if I go back, you're not profitable if I take into account SBC, and that has been the historical trend. So can you first explain the SBC and the outlook? We know how – what's going to be the trend with this account? And when are you going to turn profitability on a GAAP basis? What's the plan for the company? Thanks.
Nikesh Arora: Let me start with the second. I'll hand over to Dipak to answer your question on the balance sheet and add to my answer. Look, when I came, we bought a bunch of companies. And the way we bought them was we unvested the founders from their equity and their companies and revested them with Palo Alto stock over a period of four years. That was the only way we could secure the talent of all these founders of the companies we bought. So a significant part of our SBC is the embedded M&A cost of retaining founders. As you've noticed, we have not done any significant M&A in the last two or three quarters. As that begins to roll off, you will see a step change down in our SBC when all those acquisitions begin to roll off. Obviously, the earliest ones will start rolling off in about another six months. And then over the next year or so, 1.5 years, you'll see significant rollout. So that should show you that. In addition to that, as Dipak highlighted we are working hard to make sure that the normal SBC continues to be managed down. And of course, as you know, as a percent of revenue, if revenue keeps going up, it also acts as a benefit towards that direction. So we will talk more about what our forecast to achieve GAAP profitability as we lap Q4 this year because we'll have more visibility on the M&A stuff, but I will let Dipak add to that and as well talk about the balance sheet item.
Dipak Golechha: Yes. I think the only thing that I would add is like what we found in the company is when we really focus on something, we find opportunities. You've seen that on pretty much every metric that we focus on. This now becomes another metric that we're focusing on. I just want to say that we're going to balance that with the need to retain our talent. Just as you saw from the Welcome Home video, we want to make sure that we get the best talent as well. But that's really on the SBC. On your balance sheet question, Tal, like a couple of different points. The 2023 and 2025 notes eligible for early conversion from February 1st to April 30th, 2022, due to the share price exceeding the price thresholds. Those notes continue to be classified on the balance sheet as current liabilities in Q2, unchanged from Q1. In Q4, the 2023 notes were classified as current liability, and the 2025 notes were a long-term liability. So it's just a question of how they're classified on the balance sheet based on all the trigger events on the notes. But hopefully, that answers your question.
Clay Bilby: All right. Great. Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Essex of Goldman Sachs with Hamza Fodderwala up next. Brian, please proceed.
Brian Essex: Yes. Great. Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. Nikesh, I just want to touch on the hardware side of the business. I see the innovation with the updates of PAN-OS and Gen 4 hardware refresh. What – I guess first part of the question; have you adjusted sales incentives to drive better hardware adoption? And then maybe Part B of that question is how do you think about, I guess, the ability or the incentives to leverage the product side of the business to drive consolidation of share on your platform going forward?
Nikesh Arora: Great question, Brian. So two parts; one, as you probably heard from everyone in the industry who's in the hardware business, demand is outstripping supply. I suspect it partly has to do with supply, partly has to go volumes going up at a pandemic, inflation expectations. So we don't have to do a lot on sales incentives to die with more hardware. We have customers who would like their hardware delivered sooner than later. So we are seeing demand. And as I said, our ability to supply despite the 21% growth, still demand outstrip that 21% number, which is why you see our RPO continuing to rise. So I think that's your answer to the first part. In terms of the ability for us to leverage hardware, and I'll highlight a metric we shared last time, that 25% of our customers in SASE are – were net new to Palo Alto last quarter. We haven't declared that number this quarter, but that gives you a sense. And typically, those conversations, Brian, are hey, while I love your security platform, I love your security policy, I'd like to deploy it, but my firewalls are still around, and they have two, three years more to go. In that case, we end up with a SASE deal with the expectation that over time, when that customer consolidates their firewall, it gets to be a Palo Alto, end-to-end Zero Trust execution because the only way to do Zero Trust right is to make sure your hardware, your cloud and your remote users are all consistent in terms of security policies used. From that perspective, we see an opportunity to take hardware and further consolidate. In some cases its customers going from two hardware vendors to one. In some cases, its customers doing a replacement of some other hardware vendor with Palo Alto networks because now they already deployed SASE in their environment. So we see all of that happening. And one of the beautiful features some of the subscriptions I laid out, whether it's autonomous monitoring or AIOps or DNS Security or filtering, et cetera, we can make that happen consistently for our customers across both platforms. So, in that perspective, they already see the benefits of deploying that on a consistent basis.
Clay Bilby: Great. Thank you. And our next question comes from Hamza Fodderwala of Morgan Stanley with Phil Winslow to follow-on.
Hamza Fodderwala: Hey guys thanks for taking my question. So the NGS ARR grew really nicely, and you raised the full year guide on that, too, which you normally don't do midway through the year. The Prisma SASE, Prisma Cloud doing really well, as usual, it seems. But there appears to be an inflection on Cortex. Can you talk about some of the strategic initiatives that are driving that in the last couple of quarters in particular? And then maybe just for Dipak, can you help us understand maybe the gap between NGS billings and ARR growth going forward as some of the lower-duration stuff becomes a higher percentage of the NGS mix?
Nikesh Arora: Thanks, Hamza. Thanks for the question. Look, I think this was an all-out quarter strength across every NGS category, whether it's cloud, SASE or Cortex. I think there's an inflection point both in Cortex as well as Prisma Cloud. More and more conversations are around where customers are coming to the point they're saying, yes, I cannot do this with the cloud-native tools because I've got multiple cloud providers I'm dealing with or I cannot do this with the next start-up from two guys who started it, and that can cover one sliver. I need something that's more comprehensive. Because honestly, if I was going to replace security capability with a start-up capability, AWS, Azure, GCP already had that capability. It's not like they're lacking in capability from a security perspective. But just to give you an example, if you deployed security using one cloud provider, whether it's AWS or GCP or Azure, you'd have to integrate ten of their modules to get one Prisma Cloud. You have to do the integration work yourself. So, we've already done that not just within their tools, also across all public cloud providers. So, that's why the consolidation of security capabilities in Prisma Cloud makes sense. We're seeing that inflection. You see the number of customers. It's closing in on 2,000 customers, 80 of the Fortune 100. So we're not dealing with small enterprises trying to replace some features from CSPs. We're dealing with people who are now in complex production environment type scenarios and they are deploying Prisma Cloud. So we've seen that inflection there. And you're seeing that with 56% growth in credit consumption. You're seeing not only are we benefiting from people adopting multiple modules, but also benefiting from the fact that their native sort of production workloads are going up. And at Palo Alto Networks, I will tell you, our consumption of public cloud has always outstripped our forecast because of the success we're seeing in our NGS portfolio. So that's one part. In Cortex, I'd say, again, remember three years ago, we didn't have any of these products at Palo Alto Networks. We were busy selling firewalls. So, I think part of it is the sales force getting behind it, understanding it. And on most technical tests out there, XDR fares better than most of the names you would know in the XDR space. So, we have real technical differentiation advantage in the market. From that perspective, we are able to go down to our base. And look, I know we didn't have this product two years ago. It's time for you to renew. It's time for you to deploy XDR. Why did it try Palo Alto Networks for XDR? You're seeing both of those. I don't know, Lee, do you want to add something?
Lee Klarich: No. It's fine.
Nikesh Arora: Because I don't want to make Lee feel like he is not answering any questions. Excel is coming your way. It's a balance sheet question. Thanks, Hamza.
Dipak Golechha: Do you want me to answer the billings versus ARR? Hamza, it's a good question. It comes up quite often. I think fundamentally, the way I look at it is you're comparing apples and oranges a little bit here. ARR is really looking at your annual recurring revenue. Your billings is looking at whatever the duration is for what's out there. And so if you have like one deal that happened to be a long duration, right, you will get more billings and ARR within that quarter. Previous times, we've had that. So, I think the last quarter, our NGS billings grew less than the ARR, which is why – I'm probably more in the camp of let's just focus on NGS ARR. It's the source of truth and the one that we will focus on. But that's all that's happening. It's quite variable quarter-to-quarter based on some of the larger deals that Nikesh mentioned.
Clay Bilby: All right. Great. And up next is Phil Winslow of Credit Suisse with Brent Thill to follow. Please precede Phil.
Phil Winslow: Thanks guys for taking my question. Congrats on a great quarter. I just wanted to focus in on Prisma Cloud, Nikesh, maybe inception that question into my head with your fleece. But you mentioned increased attached to production environments as well as just being early in terms of consolidation, the functions at Palo Alto. What are you hearing from customers in terms of just adoption? Are we at that inflection point? And also, how are the competitive dynamics changing here?
Nikesh Arora: I'm going to hand over to Lee because I said if Lee doesn't answer a question, he won't come to the next earnings call. But before I give it to him, I will say one thing. We've deployed an adoption team on Prisma Cloud in the last six months, which is seeing phenomenal outcomes. And also, I want to say – I want you to intake it the right way. Competitively, the option is customers are not ready to go to a production quality, high-end and fully integrated cloud security platform. I'm fine with my DIY plus my cloud-native tools. But we don't run into a POC or compete with somebody else. It's usually, we either lose against ourselves because the customer would rather stay where they are. Now in the case of XDR or SASE, we have competitive environments. It's not like we don't compete. But in the case of cloud, it's usually based on the customer needs. But I'm going to let Lee talk about what customers see from cloud what typically does the trick?
Lee Klarich: Yes. I think – thanks, Nikesh. There's a couple of, I think, key trends that we're seeing. One, and following on to what Nikesh was saying, there were a number of companies, probably early adopters of cloud, that built a lot of their own tooling, used a lot of open source. And it's interesting. A couple of years ago when we talked to them they would say, “No, no, no, we've got this covered. We've built our own tools. We're happy to maintain them.” And many of them are now coming back to us and saying, “Actually, it turns out, this is more work than we thought it was.” It's surprising just how many distinct APIs exist in each of the different cloud products that you have to integrate with, pull data from and understand. Just using that as one example of many, right? So that's one trend that we're seeing is the challenge of doing it yourself. The second is, I think, the understanding of what actually needs to be accomplished. And again, early on, we saw it was, I just need compliance in the cloud. And now we're seeing customers fully understand the needs across all different five pillars that we have, and the importance of each of those and our ability to deliver on those. And lastly, I'd say, we've actually gotten fairly good, and we continue to work on this of building in-product adoption capability. So, we're not just dependent on people, customer success and adoption folks talking to our customers about adoption of new modules. We're building that into the product natively, suggesting to the customer what they need in order to be most secure, and we're seeing that drive a lot of adoption. You saw the metrics on the Bridgecrew integration and just how quickly we've got to 70 customers adopting that in product in just a couple of weeks since it was released into production. So, love to see this trend. Obviously, there's a lot more adoption we're going to see in the future, but I do think that we're seeing that inflection point.
Phil Winslow: Great, thank you.
Clay Bilby: All right. Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies with Rob Owens to follow, right. Please proceed.
Brent Thill: Nikesh, just on the demand environment, everyone is curious to hear your view on the strength of the pipeline relative to a year ago. And many of are questioning that this – has there been a pull-forward or not? Can you just address what you're seeing in the pipeline and ultimately why this has not been a pull-forward of demand in your perspective?
Nikesh Arora: I think Brent; it will be a pull-forward demand if you saw everyone posting numbers at this rate. You are seeing some other players in the industry who are low single digit in firewalls. So, we must be taking demand away from somebody else, whether it's us taking or Fortinet taking it, clearly, we're taking some demand away from somebody else. Look, some of it is pent-up demand where people did not have anybody to go into the office and go deploy a firewall because nobody was going to the office. Now people are coming back slowly and steadily. There are people to go deploy. So as part of it is that. Part of it is a refresh, as you know. We have now refreshed more than 65% of our portfolio, and that's still only three months in. So, we're still seeing demand for Gen 4 products being created at Palo Alto Networks. I think a couple of that. And I think, to some degree, there's a little bit of fear that they won't get the firewall in time, so people are ordering to get them. But I think we will still – as I said, we’re going to see this into fiscal year 2023 at least, and we’ll keep you posted.
Clay Bilby: All right. Great. And our next question comes from Rob Owens of Piper Sandler with Gregg Moskowitz to follow. Rob, please ask your question.
Rob Owens: Thank you very much. With the success that you guys are currently seeing in cloud, can you talk about the channel model in terms of how you go-to-market and longer-term, the potential economic implications, if there are any?
Nikesh Arora: Look, I think it’s fair to say, in the large enterprise customers, the model hasn’t changed from a channel perspective. On the margin, as you will appreciate, almost all cybersecurity products are slowly and steadily being listed on public cloud marketplaces. So all of us, including Palo Alto, we’re seeing some customers buy on those marketplaces. In some cases, it makes sense. We’ve got an embedded native firewall than GCP, and you can deploy it by accessing it to the marketplace, you will. In some cases, people are using unused credits on public cloud marketplaces to be able to buy security because that’s a feature that public cloud marketplace have offered. I think that’s on the margin. But I’ll tell you what’s more interesting about people. We’re seeing channel partners get very savvy and start building adoption teams and sales teams that are specific to cloud and specific to our portfolio because they see the market is shifting in that direction there. There’s a bit of a arms race amongst themselves, a channel where the more qualified people are likely to get more customers to buy it from them because – and it’s not always the person you use for your firewalls.
Rob Owens: Thanks.
Clay Bilby: Our next question is from Gregg Moskowitz of Mizuho Securities with Adam Borg to follow. Gregg, please proceed.
Gregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thank you and congrats on a terrific quarter. Nikesh, last quarter, you sized the pull-forward at about 10% of product orders. How do you think about the net impact of this for the Q2? And then maybe as a sort of a little bit of a follow-on to Brent’s question, is there any evidence of double ordering at either the partner or the customer level?
Nikesh Arora: So Gregg, on the first part, I think it’s – there’s a net wash. There’s a pull-through, but there’s a lack of ability to fulfill. So whilst I might be seeing a pull-through, you’re not seeing in my product revenue because that’s kind of within the range of what I’ve not been able to ship because of the exceeded demand. So in my numbers, you’re seeing a balance. You’re seeing – and you probably – if you had visibility you see in the booking, but you wouldn’t see it in the revenue because I haven’t been able to ship not have been a build. So I think that’s the answer to the first question. And in terms of – I know there is this question’s been asked at least for the last two quarters about double ordering and shadow ordering. We don’t work that way. When you order for us, you pay us. And I haven’t seen a refund being asked for on a firewall or a canceled order yet for the last two quarters. So it’s not in our numbers. And that may be true at the lower end where people have distribution channels, where channel will preorder and hold on to it. So you may see that there, where the end customer is not customer in record in the beginning, where you start – you have distribution stocking that goes on. We don’t do any distribution stocking. We basically have end customers in every purchase order, and we haven’t seen a canceled order or refund. Dipak?
Dipak Golechha: If I just to build on that, like our sales cycle, six months to nine months, and all of our purchase orders are non-cancelable. So it’s just to put a finer point on it, that they are non-cancelable.
Gregg Moskowitz: Helpful. Thank you, guys.
Clay Bilby: All right. The next question coming from Adam Borg of Stifel followed by Patrick Colville. Adam, please proceed.
Adam Borg: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just to drill down on Cortex for a minute, just given the traction there. And maybe you can talk a little bit more about attack service management. It just seems like that’s the area of interesting importance just given the breach environment. So I was hoping you could talk more about traction there and the opportunities going forward. Thanks.
Nikesh Arora: Lee?
Lee Klarich: Yes. Look, when we acquired Xpanse a little bit over a year ago, we talked about why we thought this was so important. And number one is the proactive side of it, the finding an issue so you can fix it before an attacker finds it. And attackers have increasingly automated tools, and so it becomes even more important. For example, if you look at Log4j, the – shortly after Log4j information became available, what we saw was attackers building automated scripts to basically try to find vulnerable Apache servers, right? And so that’s the kind of challenge that a lot of customers are up against. And Xpanse makes it very easy for customers to proactively find that fix it, et cetera. Second is in a reactive state, where something has become known publicly, Xpanse helps our customers find where they have exposure in order to address those issues first. And so both of these are examples of why Xpanse has become so important to our customer base. And we’ve seen our customer base really understand that better over the last couple of quarters and really embrace this as a sort of a must have product in their security operations.
Adam Borg: Great. Thanks so much.
Clay Bilby: And our last question for today will come from Patrick Colville of Deutsche Bank. Patrick, you may ask your question.
Patrick Colville: Thank you for squeezing me in. So I guess congrats on a really excellent quarter. I mean the numbers are so clean that I think we’re going to ask a philosophical question, if I may. It’s going to be about M&A. Valuations are roughly 30% cheaper than when we last spoke three months ago. The start of your tenure, Nikesh, as CEO was quite acquisitive. Is the moderation in valuations for private companies, public companies as well, does that mean that your philosophy around M&A might have changed versus the messaging you gave us six months ago?
Nikesh Arora: So there’s no change, Patrick. I don’t think the valuation in the private markets have quite normalized like the public markets have, first and foremost. So I think the private markets are still enjoying the lack of liquidity as the no reason to mark-to-market devaluation. So that’s just more of a philosophical answer, not correlated to my M&A point, right? I would like you to have it purely because some of those companies are trying to come attract talent for Palo Alto Networks as I’d like them to get mark-to-market, so people realize that these things can go down. But that having been said, there has been no change. Look, as I said, the reason we’re acquisitive in the beginning, there were many areas of cybersecurity which were up and coming and going to be important, and we were not in there and we were behind the 8 ball, or pick an analogy, we were late to the party. We hadn’t done the work needed to be ready for that market. Take cloud security, right? We bought six or seven companies in cloud security. Each of them had been in existence for three years to four years. So that’s four years of development that we were able to benefit from in a market we need to be first. With Prisma Cloud, it’s abundantly clear why we did that. Take XSOAR, we didn’t have automation workflows and platforms. We did that. Take SASE. We didn’t have an endpoint monitoring. We didn’t have SD-WAN. That’s stuff that takes four years to seven years to build. We didn’t have the time to go build it. Otherwise, the market – we would not be in the market. Today, we compete with Zscaler, Netskope. In SASE, we compete with CrowdStrike everyone in XDR. We would not have been a player. So that made sense. Today, if you look forward, I don’t see many areas of cybersecurity where we don’t have a leading product or a leading product that’s not on development. If you look at Palo Alto’s innovation cycle, I’d say creating firewalls continues to innovate, spend three years acquiring getting up to snuff to a place where now we can compete in multiple categories. And now with XSIAM, we’re delivering industry-leading innovation. I couldn’t buy anything for XSIAM because I looked at everything in the SIEM space. And I said, "Wait a minute, why do we need to look at something, which is 10 years old? I don’t need customers. I have customers they want to buy technology." So from that perspective, nothing has changed. I don’t think there’s any company out there that is valued to play where is so, oh, my god, this could be accretive when you go take this. Because I think the cost of integration in cybersecurity is going to make you from a leading player to a mediocre player because you spent too much time merging sales forces, merging customers trying to run two competing technologies. So that’s not our playbook. Our playbook is to go find good technology which you can absorb, make part of our go-to-market motion and to use those founders. And we’ve done that, and we’ve left the door open saying if you were to buy companies, it would be more in the product category, which will be more in line with the smaller to midsize acquisitions we made on anything else. So that philosophy hasn’t changed, Patrick.
Clay Bilby: All right. Great. Thank you. With that, we’ll close the call. I’ll turn it over to Nikesh for his final remarks.
Nikesh Arora: Well, once again, thank you, everybody, for joining us. And as like Clay said, we apologize for the 30-minute delay. We look forward to seeing many of you at upcoming investor events and some of you on calls after this. I just, once again, want to thank our customers, our partners, and most importantly, our employees around the world for helping us deliver a great quarter. Have a great day.

Nikesh Arora: Thank you, Clay. And good afternoon, everybody. As you can see, that was a video showing you some snippets from Ignite, our user and customer conference, which is just wrapping up. It has been a bit of a busy week at Palo Alto Networks, where we've had 27,000 customers and partners registered to engage with us virtually. Moving on to where we are at the end of Q1. Q1 was quite a familiar story from a demand perspective. We saw strength across major geographies and industries driven by heightened cybersecurity awareness. We've seen people at the top of organizations across government and private sector, they understand that it's their responsibility to ensure they are securing their environments against increasingly malicious threat landscape. This quarter, we saw a fair amount of press out of Washington, DC as Cyber Security funding was included in the recent infrastructure bill and executive orders are mandating focus from federal agencies.  In the private sector corporate boards are forming Cyber Security committees and directing their teams to raise the bar in terms of Cyber Security posture. We had powered the networks institute our security committee as well this quarter. Early in the year, Gartner updated its forecast for spending in information security and risk management technology and services, calling for growth of 12% year-over-year in 2021. We see this backdrop as sustainable beyond this year, as customers not only grappled with familiar events like brands on where, and data breaches, but also new threats coming to light, light as they adopt cloud services and also try to hire enough qualified security professionals to keep their environment safe. All-in-all, I think demand is strong, attention for cybersecurity is high, and there's a long-term positive secular trend in place, which gives us great comfort towards the 3-year plan we highlighted for you. Diving into our results for the quarter.  At our Analyst Day in September, we updated you on our Company's strategy and outlined our 3-year financial targets. The last three months have bolstered our confidence in this strategy in the numbers that we shared with you. We were extremely happy with our Q1 performance, which was ahead of our guidance on all measures. We saw revenues grow 32% year-over-year, our fastest Q1 in 5 years. Coming on the back of a strong Q4, our billings grew 28% year-over-year. Q1 strength was broad-based with exceptional performance from our hardware business, but also strength in our Prisma, both SASE and Cloud. Hardware strength fueled 25% product growth in Q1, a result of non-oil strong orders -- that we talked about on our Q4 call, but also a continuation of this trend in Q1 and our ability shipped those orders to our customers. Based on our strong performance in Q1 and visibility into our hardware pipeline in the second quarter, we're going to be raising our hardware forecast for the year in subsequent quarters.  Within our business, we continue to drive transformation towards higher mix of software solutions, as we continue to bring new innovations to market. You see this in our next-generation security ARR, which continues to increase with our business mix. Growth in our NGS solutions was driven by Prisma, SASE, and Cloud. We balanced profitability well, with non-GAAP operating income growing 9% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS was $0.07 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. The $554 million in adjusted free cash flow is the largest we have ever reported in a quarter as a Company. Beyond our financial results, we continued to see industry accolades highlighting the strong position of our best-of-breed products across ASCI platforms. I will always maintain that to be a leader in cybersecurity, we have to be the leader in innovation in cybersecurity, something I personally believe has not been practiced in the past decades by cybersecurity companies.  I'm delighted to see that we came out of FY 21 with a recognized strong position in 6 product areas. In Q1 we continued our position as a leader in the Gartner WAN Edge Magic Quadrant where again, named the leader for the 10th straight year in the Gardner Network Firewall Magic Quadrant. Additionally, we added 2 new awards being named a leader in Forrester's Zero-Trust Network Access, New Wave, and also a Strong Performer and Forrester's XDR New Wave. We look forward to earning further industry recognition driven by our strong innovation pipeline, as well as the efforts of our product teams across the world. Diving deeper into our 3 platforms -- Starting first with our Network Security business. We're benefiting from having the industry's most comprehensive platform across hardware appliance, virtual appliance, and as-a-service form factor. Supported by consistent set of security subscriptions and world-class customer support.  We continue to innovate rapidly in network security, with announcements we made this week at Ignite, that I encourage you to review, if you haven't already done so. Appliance demand was strong as our team capitalized on the broad opportunity across network security. As the pandemic conditions eased and offices started to open up, we saw an uptick in refresh activity. Our new appliances, with improved price performance, saw strong demand from both new and existing customers. We saw strong competitive win activity as customers looked to standardize on our broad network security platform. Lastly, we did see some impact from pricing actions and customers that were ordering product based on concerns around lead times and availability. These forces combined drove 25% growth in product revenue in Q1, a significant re-acceleration as strong demand continuing into Q2 as well. Let me comment a bit more on the supply chain challenges that the entire industry is dealing with and all of you continue to pay attention to it. As you have seen, despite the challenges, we have managed to deliver against our orders.  There have been some longer lead times -- selectively, for some of our customers, but overall, I think our teams have done a phenomenal job in managing in this environment. We will continue to do our best effort to manage over the next few quarters. I expect these challenged to dissipate over the next 6 to 9 months and we will do our best to continue to navigate. During this period the industry will probably end up having lead times, which are 2 to 4 weeks more than normal. The scarcity of some competence and needs to expedite our causing some short-term cost increases, which we are managing on the overall budget envelope at Palo Alto Networks. We expect to be able to manage our expenses within our guidance outlined to you for the full-year. We do expect, though, that given the vagaries of supply chain, we will not be able to beat them as aggressively as we have been in the past. Our focus is on making it easy for our customers to consumer firewall technology across public cloud and on - prem deployment. We introduced firewall Flex late last year. On the back of this, have nearly 1000 customers that have taken advantage of this license agreement.  We continue to take share in the firewall industry. But even our various form factors, firewall as a platform, billings grew 29%, the fastest growth we have seen in almost two years as customers consolidated on network security spend with us on account of the breadth of our product line and our leadership position in each area. Software was 37% of our F5 billings Q1, continuing to our transition to a higher mix of software. Switching to SASE. Prisma SASE continues to be a source of strength in our business as our customers proceed on their journey towards a permanent state of hybrid work. We see many customers in the very early stages, as is journey involves network transformation to enable access to all apps from any location. Only Palo Alto Networks can provide a comprehensive solution with our constant, consistent Network Security platform across all form factors.  We see many customers in our installed base recognizing this. So far, they have 1400 of our over 57000 next-generation firewall customers that have adopted our SASE technology, our Network Security sellers, and channel partners are becoming increasingly profession in this natural extension of our core firewall offering. And we see this as a continuation of our growth in this SASE space, allowing us to get gained share in firewall as a platform, as a category, as well as in SASE. Overall, we saw our SASE customers grow 61% year-over-year at over 1700. We're happy with our progress selling SASE into our installed base. What is also interesting is over the last 12 months, we have seen more than 25% of our SASE customers who have come from outside of our installed base, which is not just exciting to see because customers are choosing our Network Security stack, despite having other people's firewalls. it is also a sign showing that in the future you can expect to share our innovation in hardware and software firewalls through SASE customers, allowing us once again to expand our installed base.  We believe this is an important indicator, not just on the competitiveness of our SASE offering, but are also an opportunity for us to provide a comprehensive Zero Trust architecture to our customers. We're also seeing good initial interest and our OCU appliance, which we expect to be part of our enterprise solution later in this fiscal year. Switching to Prisma Cloud. Our Prisma Cloud business continues to benefit from the dual drivers of customer adoption of hyper-scale public Cloud technology, as well as the growing awareness and need for security and Cloud environments--as I've noted earlier. They introduce significant new enhancements to our Prisma Cloud offering this week at Ignite. And again, I encourage you to check out the highlights from the session that Lee and our CMO, Zeynep hosted on Tuesday. Total Prisma Cloud customers grew 26% year-over-year. Beyond customer adds, we remain very focused with customers consuming credits across our platforms. Credit consumed increased to 2.21 million in Q1, including strengths from some of our new modules. Credits being consumed are validation of customers deriving value from our products.  Beyond this broadening of consumption, we are also seeing an uptick in expansion as renewal volumes grow and greater participation in Prisma Cloud from our channel partners. This is all important as we grow the business and focus on SaaS economics. We have continued to see strong results from Bridgecrew. As a reminder, Bridgecrew, has a sales motion where they target developers and combined with this popular open source offering check-off, we have seen strong traction in the market. On a standalone basis a 5-figure opportunity is a large deal for Bridgecrew. As Palo Alto Networks, we're seeing these deals get substantially larger as customers understand how to leverage Bridgecrew in our comprehensive Prisma Cloud roadmap. This quarter Bridgecrew was an important driver of a $1 million deal in the insurance vertical.  Overall, Prisma Cloud is leading this important trend towards securing the Cloud native environment. It's clear that the oil market has caught onto this trend -- that we identified early and has been aggressively funding companies in cloud-native security, as you might have noticed. I think we do more ARR in 1 quarter than pretty much the annual ARR of most of these companies that are being funded at extremely lofty levels. We are growing quickly and executing well across with the Cloud where we believe we have a long-term ability to win. Switching to our security automation capabilities. Our Cortex platform continues to deliver innovative integrated capabilities, unifying our market-leading technologies across XDR XSOAR in expanse. Total customers across XDR Pro and XSOAR reached almost 2800 -- increasing over 75% year-over-year. Beyond new customer transaction, we also saw an increase in expansion on the back of increased general activity in Q1.  Our Cortex products again, received strong industry recognition. XDR, as I said, it was identified as a strong performer in the 2021 Forrester XDR new tech wave. This was based on our 2.9 version in early in Q1. We just released XDR 3.0. 3.0 significantly enhances XDR's capability in the Cloud, and also includes a built-in forensics response capability to help SOC teams automate the full life cycle of threat detection investigation response. XSOAR continues its leadership position, being named a leader in the gigaohm store evaluation. We also continue to see traction on the partnering front as well across Cortex. We saw strong partner activity continuing around the XSOAR marketplace, with over 80% growth in bookings influenced by our systems integrators and MSP partners around Cortex. At Ignite, we have just launched an XMDR partner specialization with our partner program, with launch alliance partners including PwC, Orange Cyberdefense, Critical Start, and Trustwave. On the back of very strong large deal performance in Q4, we followed this up with strength in Q1.  Driving a broad, repeatable, and efficient large daily motion is a key initiative for our sales organization in FY 22. Amit Singh, our Chief Business Officer is focused in partnership with our President, BJ Jenkins to drive deeper multi-platform relationships with a wider cohort of our customers. While Q1 is seasonally our lightest quarter of the year, we closed 160 seven-figure deals within the quarter. Furthermore, the total dollar value of the seven-figure deals signed in the quarter were up 36% year-over-year. Our millionaire customers were 1,025 in Q4 -- Q1, sorry, approximately 29% year-over-year. This is our 4th consecutive quarter where year-over-year growth in millionaire customers was north of 30% or close to. Turning to some of our larger wins in the quarter, there are several trends that should be evident in these large deals. First, we're seeing success with multi-product adoption. Second, customer commitments are increasing in size, reflecting both the growing important cyber security, as well as our leadership position across our platforms.  The value of our large deals is up materially year-over-year, and growing faster than our business overall. This is becoming a more repeatable process for us, and is also an area for us to continue to mature and drive efficiency in our sales organization. Third, there are a few areas of success emerging where you see trends. These include an uptake in proxy replacement, significant expansion in SASE, deployments in the back of initial purchases driven by work-from-home. Standardization of Prisma Cloud across customers Cloud footprints and consolidation across customers network security architecture. We highlight these deals because they are in-line with our strategy to lead in each of our platform areas, and also to drive cross-platform success. Bringing it all together.  As I said, I think we're on a much stronger, long-term secular trend for cyber security and Palo Alto Networks is uniquely positioned in that trend to be able to leverage all of our investments and innovations that we've made in last year, across all 3 of our platforms. We've had a strong Q1. I'm delighted by the innovation and execution of our teams. We laid out our strategy for the year and our medium-term vision in mid September at Analyst Day -- And we remain focused on these areas. We aspire to build a durable business and lead the industry through this unprecedented period of growth. Our focus is on driving innovation, embedding in all 3 platforms, embedding AI or machine learning across our platforms to shift the balance between our customers and cyber adversaries.  We leverage our scale to grow our business and drive efficiencies across the Company in order to be the trusted security part of our customers. Our revised guidance for the year reflects broad-based strength across our portfolio, resulting in higher revenue and billings FY 22. We're holding our EPS guidance for the year to make sure we can deliver on strong demand with the current supply chain backdrop. With that, let me turn the call over to Dipak, to go into more detail on the Q1 performance and our guidance.
Dipak Golechha: Thank you very much Nikesh, and good afternoon everyone. Please note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis and financial figures are non-GAAP, unless specifically noted, otherwise. We delivered ahead of our guidance provided in August across all metrics as we continue to grow and transform our business. In Q1, the acceleration of our topline continued driven by strength in our broad portfolio, including both our appliance offerings and our next-generation security offerings. For Q1, revenue of $1.25 billion grew 32% and was above the high-end of the guidance range. Growth was driven by product revenue in all geographies and all 3 platforms. Total deferred revenue in Q1 was $5.16 billion, an increase of 31%. By geography, Q1 revenue growth was strong across all regions. The Americas grew 30%, EMEA was up 35% and JPAC grew 38%. Next-generation security or NGS ARR, finished the quarter at $1.27 billion, continuing a steady growth trajectory.  Within NGS, we saw exceptional strength in our Prisma platform, as well as XSOAR and XDR. In the first quarter of 22, we delivered billings of $1.38 billion -- up 28% and above the high-end of our guidance range. As a reminder, billings is total revenue plus the change in total deferred revenue, and that's of acquired deferred revenue. NGS billings of $366,000,000 grew 38% year-over-year. Remaining performance obligation, or RPO, was $6 billion increasing 37% with current RPO growing in-line with total RPO. As I mentioned at our Analyst Day, we believe RPO adds meaningful insight into our future revenue, as it includes both prepaid and contractual commitments from our customers. As we also forecasted during our recent Analyst Day in September, our Appliance business accelerated in Q1 as we achieved 25% year-on-year product growth, the fastest product growth in ten quarters.  This was ahead of our guidance of low double-digit growth, as we saw both fulfillment of strong Q4 orders and also follow-through in demand in our Q1 orders. Customer reaction to the new Appliance launch in late fiscal year '21 has been positive. As Nikesh noted, strength in our Appliance business was broad-based. And whilst refresh was a positive driver, we also see signs that demand is sustainable beyond this refresh activity, as customers returned to pre-COVID patterns of purchasing. Subscription revenue of $579 million increased 35%. Support revenue of $373 million increased 33%. In total, subscription and support revenue of $952 million -- increased 34% and accounted for 76% of our total revenue. Gross margin of 74.4% was down a 140 basis points year-over-year as we incurred additional costs related to appliances.  We will continue to ensure that we are focused on enabling shipments to our customers in the current environment. Operating margin is 18% was up sequentially and down year-over-year--as expected, as we absorbed the strong rate of hiring we had in the second half fiscal 2021. Our operating expenses came in below our forecasted levels, as we focus on driving operating efficiencies to offset higher input costs on our products. Net income for the first quarter grew 8% to a $170 million or $1.64 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22% and our GAAP net loss was a $104 million or $1.06 per basic and diluted share. Turning now to the Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement. We finished October with cash equivalents and investments of $4.4 billion. Days outstanding on sales was 74 days, a decrease of 7 days from a year ago, driven by a combination of strong collections and improved billings linearity. Cash flow from operations was $589 million and we generated record free cash flow of $554 million of a free cash flow margin of 44.4%.  It's also worth noting that in Q1 we moved our customer count methodology to active customers from our historical method of sold-to customers. As we continue to transform our business with the growth in software form factors and ARR-based solutions in next-generation security, it's important for us to mature our customer acquisition, retention, and expansion framework. As we are increasingly focused on active customers internally, we believe it makes sense to align our external reporting in this way. In the appendix of our presentation, we've adjusted the customer counts provided over the last 5 quarters in our investor slides to conform to the active customer methodology. Our capital allocation priorities as outlined in our September Analyst Day are unchanged and aligned with the optimization of long-term shareholder returns.  The pillars of our total shareholder return framework were in action in Q1. We delivered industry-leading growth for our revenue scale, highlighted by 32% revenue growth, and the highest Q1 growth rate Palo Alto Networks has reported in 5 years. We're focused on investments that will continue to sustain this growth, while delivering EPS ahead of our guidance and the street for Q1. We did this with a bias towards making sure we can fulfill customer demand while driving operating efficiencies, to help offset higher product related costs. We believe this additional expense is a good investment for us as accrued value in our long-term customer relationships. Our free cash-flow margin of 44% for this quarter was strong and puts us on track for our annual and multi-year goals. We remain focused on share repurchases as the largest use for us free cash-flow generation. However, there were several material events in the quarter that made it challenging to buyback stock, including our mid-quarter Analyst Day and the transfer of our stock listings to NAT Stack. We’ll continue to be opportunistic buyers of our stock areas as you've seen, over the last 12 months. We have a billion dollars remaining on our share repurchase authorization, expiring at December 31st, 2022.  Lastly, on the TSR front, as many of you have likely seen in our 2021 proxy statements, our compensation committee revised Palo Alto Networks executive compensation program to add in a TSR multiplier into our fiscal year 22 plan, to better align executive pay with shareholder interests. We closed a very small acquisition during Q1 -- Gamma Networks, that brings us additional technology in the DLP area and was part of the announcements of our next-gen [Indiscernible] this week at Ignite. As we have assembled the key pillars needed to execute on our platform strategy, we continue to expect only incremental M&A activity in fiscal year '22 as compared to the recent past. Lastly, moving now to guidance and modeling points. As Nikesh mentioned, and your undoubtedly aware, there is some disruption in the global supply chains. Our teams have navigated through these challenges extremely well, although we did incur some incremental cost of product revenue in Q1.  The guidance we're giving today considers the latest inputs we have around the supply chain and other factors. We do expect that we will incur additional cost of product in Q2 and the fiscal year, which we have factored in. At the same time, we're focused on driving operational efficiencies in our overall business to help offset this. In that context, we're pleased in our ability to hold our operating margin, EPS, and free cash flow margin guidance for the fiscal year 2022. We note that at the high-end of our guidance range, we would achieve the rule of 60, which was our aspiration at our Analyst Day, adding together our revenue growth and free cash flow margin. For the second fiscal quarter of 2022, we expect billings to be in the range of $1.51 billion to $1.53 billion, an increase of 24% to 26%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.265 billion to $1.285 billion, an increase of 24% to 26%.  Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of 1.63 to 1.66 based on a weighted average dilution count of approximately a 105 to 107 million shares. For the full fiscal year 2022, we expect billings to be in the range of 6.675 to 6.725 billion dollars in an increase of 22% to 23%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $5.3% to $5.4 billion, an increase of 26% to 27%. We expect our next-gen security ARR to be $1.65 to $1.7 billion, an increase of 40% to 44%. We expect our product revenue growth percentage to be in the mid-teens year-over-year. We expect our operating margins to be in the range of 18.5% to 19%. And our non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of 7.15 to 7.25 based on an average diluted count of approximately $106 million to $108 million shares. Adjusted free cash flow margin is expected to be in the range of 32 to 33%.  Additionally, please consider the following additional modeling points. Based on the seasonality of spending we discussed last quarter, as well as progress during the year so far, we're forecasting that we will deliver slightly more operating income in the first half of the year that we noted on our Q4 call. To help you further calibrate your modeling of our seasonality, we expect approximately 33 to 34% of our annual operating income to come in Q4, we expect our Non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 22% for Q2 '22 and fiscal year 22, subject to the outcome of future tax legislation. We expect net interest and other expenses of $6 to $6 million per quarter, and for Q2 22, we expect capital expenditures of $80 to $85 million. For fiscal year 22 we expect capital expenditures of $205 to $215 million, which includes approximately $39 million related to our Santa Clara headquarters. With that, I will turn the call back over to Clay for the Q&A portion of the call.
Clay Bilby: Great. Thank you Dipak. And to allow for broad participation, I would ask that each person only ask 1 question. And our first question will be from Brent Thill of Jefferies with Patrick Colville and Deutsche Bank to follow. Brent, you may ask your question.
Brent Thill: Thanks. Good afternoon. Nikesh, on -- when you think about some of the supply chain issues you're going through, are you seeing clients being willing to trade off for Cloud or are they accelerating their workloads faster to the Cloud and therefore, just substituting your solution there? Can you give us just the color of what you're seeing in the customer behavior, based on what's happening right now. Thanks.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you for the question. Look, I think as Dipak highlighted and I said, we are seeing some customers get very sensitized around lead times and hence we are seeing them order ahead. We're also seeing customers think longer-term what they want for capacity for the full-year, hence we're seeing more visibility in terms of what their the needs are on the hardware front. I am also sure that there is some substitution going on because we know that not every player in the industry has consistently does what we're offering to our customers. So there is some substitution going on in the market from other vendors to us -- where they're already in the infrastructure as a first or second provider, or we have become a new provider in there. And outside of that? Yes, to some degree, we are seeing Cloud adoption continue to accelerate across the market. I think it's partly a function of the fact that people have made the shift to Cloud faster given the pandemic. I think there may be a marginal impact of people are running into the hardware issues, but it's not as widespread and broad-based as -- enough yet to call it a trend, but I'm sure on the margin that affect us there.
Clay Bilby: All right. Great. And our next question comes from Patrick Colville of Deutsche Bank with Sterling up to follow. Patrick, you may ask your question.
Patrick Colville: All right. Thank you so much for taking my question. Can I actually switch on to the NGS ARR? Very impressive as always, growing to $1.27 billion. I guess the sequential delta was maybe slightly less than we've seen with the recent trends. If my math's correct, about $90 million increase sequentially, which is about 8% sequential growth, which is a little bit below the trends we were seeing last year and before that. So can you just help me understand the puts and takes there of momentum around NGS, please?
Nikesh Arora: There's a lot of momentum on NGS, Patrick, as we highlighted both in the Prisma Cloud 's side and the Prisma SASE 's side. As you experienced last year NGS business is very heavily backend loaded in terms of Q3 and Q4, because the teams spend a lot of time getting the customer to a -- most of the products are either a part of their Cloud transformation journey --as a soft transformation journey, or the network transformation journey. The key word in all 3 is a transformation aspect. And transformational aspects require longer PLCs, longer discussions with our customers. We have ample confidence that we will, handedly meet our expectations for the full-year NGS ARR. We actually don't sweat the quarterly evolution because we look at it as annual pipeline. And as I said, we feel it's well in hand and I couldn't be more enthusiastic about it.
Clay Bilby: Great. And our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan with Phil Winslow up next after that. Sterling you may ask your question.
Sterling Auty: Yeah, thanks. Hi guys. Alright, so I want to go back to the supply chain -- which I'm sure a lot of us will. Is there a sense when you're talking to your customers, how much of the timing of these orders is for lead time -- meaning that you're--they're just joining in the first half, maybe you would've gotten some of these orders in Q3 and Q4. And how much of this might just be increased ordering because they're utilizing the solution in more ways. So more micro segmentation and other Zero Architecture used cases?
Nikesh Arora: Yeah, that's a great question, Sterling. I honestly -- I think if I was to rank order the impact we've seen 25% product growth -- Remember, we've just done a hardware refresh for part of our portfolio, and that always -- Traditionally we see that whenever your hardware refracture customers will step up and want the newest piece of hardware and they've kind of learned how to anticipate it. Clearly the number 1 effect we're seeing in the quarter. I think the second effect is -- to your point -- increase consumption, and increased deployment requirements that we're seeing. Because you can tell -- you can tell if a customer is pre -ordering -- ordering ahead or is a net new customer. That new customers has never been a customer of Palo Alto--he's not ordering ahead. They're actually transferring to Palo Alto. So I think that's the third impact. And the fourth one, to be honest, which I would consider a 10% impact --give or take. It's approximately what you're seeing into the ordering ahead category.
Sterling Auty: Thank you. Thank you.
Clay Bilby: Our next question is from Phil Winslow of Credit Suisse with Saket Kalia up after that. Please proceed, Philip.
Philip Winslow: Great. Thanks, guys. Nikesh, just a question for you on Prisma Cloud. Obviously, you continue to put up good customer metrics as well as those consumption numbers. There's obviously been a lot of focus from investors on [Indiscernible] Lifecycle and Shift Left Security. 2 questions here. Where do you think customers, in terms of their adoption of these technologies, what inning are we in? And then second, when you are winning these deals, what are customers telling you about why, what's the differentiation?
Nikesh Arora: I have the pleasure having Mr. Lee Klarich, our Chief Product Officer, and I don't want him to feel like he doesn't need to answer anything on these calls, so I'm going to ask him to jump in here, Phil. But the only 2 cents I'll give you, is that whenever the customer has been partly through their journey and their decided their homegrown tools or their point solutions are not the right solution for their infrastructure, it's typically where we see large Prisma Cloud engagements. Having said that, I'm not saying that they don't use us for those individual use cases -- They do. But eventually the step-up and say, I need to make a comprehensive confidence product bed. But I'm going have Lee jump in and talk about some of the shift left stuff we're seeing -- with the Bridgecrew, a recent announcement yesterday of offering wiz - like capabilities, which is 18-plus scanning. As well as integrating our Shift Left Enable [Indiscernible] Prisma collateral enterprise platform, so there's consistency.
Lee Klarich: Thank you, Nikesh. Look, I think a lot of customers are still in their journey to fully operationalized cloud security, there's no question about it. To some extent, they're even just still in their journey to even -- their shift to the Cloud and really understanding all the different dynamics that need to change in order to fully take advantage of cloud architectures versus traditional data center architectures. And so as we go through these shifts, and in a lot of cases we're helping to enable and drive these changes. There's a few that I would just highlight for you here. One is, we believe very strongly that for cloud security to be effective, it has to be embedded in the development and DevOps processes. This is why the announcement from earlier this week, where we're starting the Bridgecrew integration into Prisma Cloud is so important.  It's what enables the Prisma Cloud security capabilities to be integrated into the CICD pipelines that the developers and DevOps teams use to develop their Cloud applications--Absolutely critical. Second, you're also seeing us for some of the recent advances we announced around agent-less security for making it easier for customers to get that initial adoption. And then even supporting a hybrid model where they can just both agent-based and agent with scanning, where we're the only ones in the industry being able to offer our customers that choice. And we continue to put the attention around Cloud identity, and the permissions and entitlement, and how that affects Cloud Security, which has long been an area overlooked and not well understood. These becomes some of the more advanced capabilities that our customers are now getting ready to adopt. And like our personal Cloud strategy, our goal is always trying to stay a step ahead of those needs.
Clay Bilby: Great. Thanks Lee. Our next question comes from Saket Kalia of Barclays with Brian Essex. After that, Saket, please proceed.
Saket Kalia: Hey, thanks for taking my question here. Nikesh, I thought it was interesting to see on the Prisma SASE side, that roughly 1400 of the 1800 customers there, are also next-gen Firewall customers. And so the question was asked earlier about the short-term impact of substitution from one to the other. I'm kind of curious about how do you think about that long-term. Do you find the Prisma SASE is additive to customer spending or do you find that more often it is substituting or replacing what they are doing with Firewall? Does that make sense?
Nikesh Arora: Yeah, of course. I think a few quarters ago, my colleague, Mr. Lee Klarich, had done a phenomenal job of highlighting that the Prisma SASE customer is more valuable to us from an LTV perspective, i.e. on a like-for-like basis. And also it is a lower TCO opportunity for the customer, because now you're not upgrading every one of your hardware boxes. Take a case, you have 1400 stores somewhere, you got to put a hardware box everywhere and you got to upgrade them for every new software release we offer, and that's a truck roll and requires you to be comfortable that you want to do it. In the case of Prisma SASE, we'd roll it out, so all of our 1400 customers, boom, in 2 weeks, we have them upgraded to the next version of software, which allows us to do multiple software releases in quarters. And in the case of our firewalls, it takes 1 year to write the next big major release and it takes 4 months before our customers will be -- will tend to be agree to go and deploy it across their 40,000 stores because they're not, they're not comfortable yet because it's going to be a big change.  And if that chain doesn't work. So I think technically, conceptually, 5 years from now we're looking back saying, what a stupid idea to go roll trucks and upgrade hardware,--I give you a case. I apologize for distracting, but a friend of mine is very much into electric cars and he bought a new electric car. I have 1 too. Mine is a Tesla. It does over-the-year software updates. His, he has to drive to the dealership and wait in line, then they put a USB stick, and they'll upgrade it. You tell me which one you want. So I think in the long term, we're going to say SASE is like a Tesla to the -- drive the car to the dealership and stick a USB in it. So from my perspective, SASE is a better technical outcome. It's a better security outcome for the customers, It's a better value for us and it's a better value for the customer in the long term.
Clay Bilby: All right. Great. Thanks, Nikesh. Our next question comes from Brian Essex of Goldman Sachs with Ty Liani [ph] up after that. Go ahead, Brian.
Brian Essex: Thank you, and thank you for taking a question.
Nikesh Arora: Please give me shit, Brian. Because it's his car, I forgot.
Brian Essex: Not my car. For Nikesh or Dipak, whichever one wants to field this one. I think -- we heard a commentary around increased costs related to the product revenue, and in -- I don't know, we're in an inflationary environment, everyone's used to paying more for things. What levers might you have to offset that, whether it's vendor consolidation, actuary pricing increases, how do you -- how might you think about ways you can offset those higher costs on the other side?
Nikesh Arora: Yeah. Look, as Dipak highlighted, from a product revenue and product cost perspective, I guess, translation -- Some of our chip suppliers are asking for more money for the scarce chips that they offer us. That's what it is. So in the short term, there is no offset. You want to chip, you pay for it, you buy it. In the broader scheme at Palo Alto we can offset it with other cost containment strategies with Dipak's on top of -- in dealing with them. Maybe you could talk about some of the supply chain efforts your team is doing because -- I will tell you -- it's kind of funny. It's as we said, this is one of our highest product growth quarters in recent history in the midst of a supply-chain crisis. And you guys know, we can't book it until you ship it. So we've not only been able to book it, but ship it. So Dipak's team must be doing something.
Dipak Golechha: Let's just come back to your overall question. We look at all the different levers -- we did take a price increase in September in the U.S. November 1st -- internationally. So we do look at that as a lever. But fundamentally, I would say that one of the benefits that when you have already strong demand, is you have that visibility. Okay, so with that strong demand, with longer lead times -- but happening now though, we have extended our lead times by a couple of weeks. Like Nikesh had had said. That actually allows us a little bit more visibility and we have a world-class scene that uses that visibility to try and make sure that we can catch up as much as possible. I think beyond that, the levers that you would expect us to look at is everything and anything we have. We're looking at all of our vendors, trying to see how we can reduce costs there, leverage our scale, we would get everything about our payment terms that are lower costs, and also looking at all of our [Indiscernible]. But I would say it's a very balanced approach under the framework of total shareholders.
Nikesh Arora: And our shift to software helps.
Dipak Golechha: Yeah.
Nikesh Arora: Clay? Did we lose, Clay?
Dipak Golechha: Right?
Nikesh Arora: Got it. I think I think.
Clay Bilby: Okay. I was muted as well. Next question coming from Hamza Fodderwala of Morgan Stanley, with Adam Tindle to follow. [Indiscernible] you may proceed.
Hamza Fodderwala: Hey guys. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe just a quick one for Dipak, in case he's getting lonely there. Dipak, you gave a really strong total RPO number. I'm wondering if you can tell us what the current RPO was. And do you think that these CRPO metric is going to be a cleaner metric to gauge parallel to those underlying bookings growth as you shift more from hardware to software?
Dipak Golechha: Thanks. So in my prepared remarks I actually did say that current RPO grew at the same rates as total RPO. So I do think that both are important. the reality is, I think total RPO is critically important because that's all of our future obligations. I think current RPO is what I spent a lot of time looking up because that really gives you a good understanding of your predictability of revenue over the next 12 months. I think both are important. I think the macro comment is RPO is important. You have to look at both. You have to look at your contract lines, you have to look at everything and anything around RPO and candidly, I'm surprised that more companies don't spend more time on it.
Hamza Fodderwala: Thank you.
Clay Bilby: Great. Thank you. And our next question comes from Adam Tindle of Raymond James, with Rob Owens up next. Adam, you may proceed.
Adam Tindle: Great. Thanks for taking the question, Nikesh. I wanted to ask on go-to-market, and maybe you could tie in some feedback from new management members like Ahmed and BJ since joining. But kind of a two - parter. First, on the core sales team. On the last call you talked about them driving the majority of Cortex revenue, and I'm wondering if that's something that you could continue to drive that motion and apply to areas beyond Cortex. And then in channel, you had an inflection in partner-lead deals this quarter in Cortex. If you could maybe double-click on the drivers of that and what the team can do to push further into other areas beyond Cortex. Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: Great. Thanks for question. You know what, having BJ here has been amazing. We can actually now have -- Amit is in a room elsewhere during a CIO meeting, BJ 's in Europe, meaning customers and I'm here doing an earnings call. So we've been able to divide and conquer in terms of being able to touch more and more customers. Outside of your question on Cortex and [Indiscernible] Look, we've been on a journey. We caught this Cloud thing early in our mind. But we're getting our motion right, figuring it out, and now we started to enable channel partners. As we enabled channel partners, we have been able to amplify our ability to go and approach our customers with Cloud capabilities. So as you can imagine, this is still a nascent market in terms of it's -- I think, this is going to be a huge market in next 5, 7 years. No wonder you're seeing those lofty valuation of startups out there. I firmly believe we are 18 to 24 months ahead from a comprehensive platform perspective. We're not standing quietly.  I still -- we still have more engineers of Palo Alto building Cloud security capability than all the other startups roughly combined. So we're not worried about our strength and our ability. We have to remain nimble, we have to remain agile, and we have to make sure we amplify our go-to-market capabilities. So from that perspective, yes, you will see us continuing to amplify our Cloud go-to-market capabilities and our Cortex go-to-market capabilities. We are working on some very exciting product enhancements in our XDR front and Cortex front. More to come in future calls but that gives us confidence that as we keep seeding the market with XDR is going to open up a very large TAM thereafter for us in future quarters, for future years for the Company, allowing us to strengthen that third pillar.  And last but not the least, I will give you one more anecdote, Adam. In the last 90 days, I have met more CIOs personally than I met on the first three years of working at Palo Alto. And that's not because I was lazy first, it's because I have had the opportunity to go engage with them, because now, we have a comprehensive cybersecurity platform, and many of them are saying, "This point solutions stuff is not working. I'm moving to the Cloud. So now I have some sort of redundancy built into my DevOps environment. Therefore, I may be willing to go look at one vendor to help me in in the entire stack from one end to the other. " So that's the go-to-market update.
Clay Bilby: All right. Great. Thanks, Nikesh. Our next question comes from Rob Owens of Piper Sandler, followed by Irvin Lu Robit [ph]. Rob, you may take your question.
Rob Owens: Great. Good evening and thanks for taking my question. Curious on the federal fronts, given your end of quarter did span the end of the federal fiscal year, how things came in. But I think more importantly, what your seeing in terms of pipeline for the ensuing quarters, given it feels like a more linear federal spend coming. Thanks.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you for that question. Look, I think as we talked about probably at the end of last quarter, new administration, early days, they were still trying to put their authorized process to get their stuff in order. So we did see obviously because there was ample Fed business for us at the end of their fiscal quarter -- fiscal year and are in the midst of our quarter. That was strong. What is even more heartening is if you guys have time, I actually did a keynote for Ginny Easterly yesterday morning for our Ignite event and it's very fascinating to hear her because you are seeing there is a very strong directive and will in the U.S. government right now to really treat cyber security seriously, and you've seen that manifested in the various infrastructure bills, where there are specific line items for cyber security spend to the extent there are line items for that cyber management in various bills. So you can see that there is a lot of seeding of Cybersecurity that’s going on in the federal sort of budgets. As with everything with governments is thoughtful, it's -- it takes time and it happens slightly slower than analysts and CEOs expect.
Rob Owens: All right, thank you.
Clay Bilby: Great. Next question is from Irvin Liu of Evercore with Matthew Hedberg followed Urban, You may ask.
Irvin Liu: Hi, thanks for taking the question. You highlighted the completeness of your current platform, in that any acquisition in the near term would be incremental versus large scale. But I wanted to better understand, how do you weigh build versus buy decisions looking ahead? And which areas of the market do you see yourselves potentially having a product gap.
Nikesh Arora: So Irvin, we have been very clear about certain areas of the market which worked well with us through an API or connectivity - based. For example, we've been clear in identity access management. We think there's ample good players out there. Us going into that space is not going to add any incremental value. Or similarly with email security, we've steered clear of that space, not because we believe that, eventually people migrating to Google, Microsoft, and Proofpoints there and there's a bunch of other people. So there are some areas we've seen where -- I think the best way to think about it as we did this exercise 3 years ago. We identified a blue ocean called Cloud, and then moved to the Cloud. And we said this is going to be a lot of new security products created for the Cloud. Let's get ahead of the trend early, which is what we did. We were about 6 or 7 companies in that space integrated and the results are in front of you, and I think we announced for you [Indiscernible] for Prisma Cloud last Q4, so you can expect that has grown this quarter, which puts us, as I said, at 6 to 10 times on many of these startups are getting funded at $6 billion to $8 billion.  So clearly that's not a price I'd like to pay for that ARR given I'm sitting on 5 to 10 times of that AR myself. So from that perspective, it's both an area of the market that we want to pursue, ideally a Blue Ocean, which is Cloud Security, or we have a disruptive technology of you believe will compel the customer to replace what they have today. And that you are seeing happen in the XDR space, that used to be an endpoint space [Indiscernible] semantics, which is being structurally replaced by CrowdStrike, [Indiscernible], Carbon Black, and the others. So those are the areas where I pay attention to. A third one is where our firewall teams are able to go upsell and attach that capability to the firewall. For example, yesterday we launched next-generation CASB. I think that is a transformative product. I think it will replace majority of the CASB out there. You will not need to buy CASB separately from any other vendor.  Again, 3 years ago we had a long gaps and we were doing a lot of acquisitions. We've gotten to a point where it's almost in 8, 9 times out of 10 is better for us to build because we have 60%, 50%, 70% of the sensors, the capabilities, we just have to build the other 30%. In net new areas, that's the question and so far we haven't found any compelling area which makes us jump out of bed yearning go look at it. Having said that, Walter, me, Lee, we still see 5 to 20 companies every quarter in seriousness, not to acquire, but to understand what they're doing and if that is meaningful to the industry, I would keep track of it.
Clay Bilby: Our next question from Matthew Hedberg of RBC followed by Keith Bachman. Matt, go ahead.
Matthew Hedberg: Hey, thanks guys. The question for Nikesh or Lee. I think what stood out to me is you said 25% of SASE customers are from outside your core, which was great to hear. And I think really to the point of some of the earlier questions on Palo Alto is not only a consolidator, but also best-of-breed in these cases. Can you talk to how that trend has progressed, that 25% of the customer concept and are you seeing other things like that in other segments like Cortex, XDR, Prisma Cloud?
Lee Klarich: Yes. First, your comment on being best-of-breed, not just consolidators, that is a 100% spot on. Our focus from a product perspective is everything we do. We strive to be best-in-class in that specific area, such that when we bring it together, and integrate it for our customer from truly adding value and not just reducing number of vendors they have to do business with. And so along those lines, that's what fuels the number that you saw in terms of SASE adoption from net new customers to Palo Alto 's Networks. And it's a great starting point and it's an opportunity for us then to expand into other areas of network security, Prisma Cloud, Cortex after that. We've also shared similar numbers for Cortex in the past where we see a similar level of adoption of customers that come in for the very first time into XSOAR, into XDR, into Expanse. And quite frankly, Prisma Cloud is right up there as well in terms of net new adoptions. All of that has been made possible by being best-in-class in these different product areas and then affords the opportunity to expand in some cases fairly rapidly once they get in successful with the first product.
Clay Bilby: Thank you, Lee. Our next question from Keith Bachman of BMO with MIchael Turits, next. Keith, go ahead.
Keith Bachman: Thank you very much. I’d like to return to the supply chain if l could and direct to this to you, Dipak, sir. Can you help us understand what the price increases have been for your products thus far in the anticipation going forward? Just trying to understand what the impact to the topline may have been from price increases. And then the corollary question is, can you give us any quantification associated with the margin impact. You mentioned it was negatively impacted for the quarter and would likely be for the year. Just wondering if you could flush that out. I know you're offsetting with the OpEx line and doing a good job of holding the margins, but I'm just wondering if you could quantify the costs associated with it in terms of the supply chain impact. Thank you.
Dipak Golechha: Let me just start off with your comment about pricing. We took pricing on September 15th in the U.S. November 1st, internationally. The amount that you really see in Q1 is quite minimal in terms of that, because you'll see the majority of that come through in Q2 and beyond. I wouldn't say there's much there in our results to date. Obviously, it has been factored in our guidance. When it comes to the actual cost that's been a couple of million dollars. Like for Q1, we expect that will continue in Q2, Q3, and beyond. And as I mentioned before, we're looking at everything on the table from OpEx to other things that we can do with our suppliers to offset, to the best of our ability. That's why we've really held off guidance where it is, just to give us enough flexibility to manage the next few quarters.
Clay Bilby: Well, we had a soft microphone on Dipak. We'll try to get that into the transcript if you didn't catch that. Our next question comes from MIchael Turits of KeyBanc, followed by Jonathan Ho, who will be our last question for today. Michael, go ahead.
Michael Turits: Thanks. Nikesh, couple quarters ago you mentioned that you felt there were certain go-to-market challenges for both the Cortex and for Prisma Cloud or just some competitors. Are you now -- could you give us some stuff you're talking to? Until now, do you feel like you now do -- you need to do there? And you're getting enough from those product lines to contribute to next gen ARR as you might have hoped for this quarter?
Nikesh Arora: Michael I want to leave you with historical perspective. Three years ago we were not in these businesses; 18 months ago is when we launched many of these products. So today, am I delighted with where we are? A 100%. Are we ahead of my expectations? For sure. Do I high expectations going forward? Yes. Have we cleaned out some of the stuff? That's my job. Every day, every week, we clean out stuff in our processes to make sure our go-to-market capabilities, our product capabilities get better and better. As to the specific issues we were dealing with in Prisma Cloud and Cortex, we've hired some new people, they are doing a phenomenal job. This past quarter, we expect them to continue that job. Based on the visibility we have on Prisma Cloud front, similarly in the Cortex front, we're in a highly competitive market, yet we continue to deliver on our expectation and exceed them. Like I said, XDR is strategic in the context that I believe, overtime, there will be a convergence between what we do in XDR XSOAR, and our teams are working hard towards making that happen.  Also, I would [Indiscernible] that we do in Expanse, so we think we have critical mass in that Cortex space to really, really continue to build product capability over time, bring them to build that into a very large business. Similarly, on Prisma Cloud again, I think you can see from all the valuations people are getting or not. If it's not value, then we'd say it's a validation that everybody has identified that as a big area. And I honestly believe that, I'm not just saying, I believe that our teams have worked hard towards building an early lead, and our job is to keep, sustain that lead, strengthen our product continually, and make sure that capabilities are made apparent to our customers.
Clay Bilby: Great. And our last question for today comes from Jonathan Ho of William Blair. Jonathan, please ask your question.
Jonathan Ho: Thank you for squeezing me in. Just wanted to get a sense of where we are in terms of the return to work and refresh cycle uptake. And what is giving you the confidence that these trends will sustain longer-term? Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: Jonathan, that was interesting and thank you for asking the question. As I mentioned, I've been able to meet a lot more CIOs the last 90 days than I've had in my 3 years here. And I'll tell you every conversation with CIO is a conversation of adapting their information security and IT stack to the new reality in the market. The new reality is majority of companies are not expecting everybody to come back to the office. They're all looking for architectures which can make everything consistent. The most number of cyber attacks we've seen in the last year and a half or so have been in remote working and VPN, because people have had to deploy their older VPN technology and make it be functional from every corner of the world. So people are seeing that is the new threat factor. They are thinking about how do I take this and make this a long term, sustainable, network architecture? Couple that with their Cloud transformation, it's funny. Three years ago when I'd asked them the question, they were predict -- dipping their toes in the cloud, today, all of them are in two or three clouds. So there is a very strong secular trend behind the SASE opportunity as well as the Cloud opportunity. You pick your favorite sport analogy, I think we're in the first innings of baseball and we've bowled the second over in cricket.
Jonathan Ho: I understand that one. Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: It's alright. I don't understand the first one either. So, it's all good.
Clay Bilby: Fantastic. Well, with that we're going to conclude the Q&A portion of our call today, and I will turn it back over to Nikesh for his closing remarks.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you, everybody for joining. And I just want to reiterate in my 3.5 years of being here, I haven't felt more bullish in the business as I feel today, given the visibility into the pipeline and the results are being -- teams have been able to deliver in Q4, as well as the visibility we have going into our three-year plan off for the first quarter. I want to thank you for attending. I want to thank you -- I look forward to seeing you in upcoming investor events, as well as I want to thank all of our customers, our partners, and most of all our employees around the world for putting in the hard work to get us where we are. For that see you next time.

Management is also scheduled to participate and upcoming virtual investor conferences in September hosted by Citibank and Piper Sandler. And now I will turn the call over to Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora: Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to Palo Alto Networks Q4 conference call. I'm trying something new today so please bear with me. You just got an opportunity to see our ad campaign. You're the first people to see it. We spent a lot of time working hard, trying to understand what our customers really want to see from us. And the constant drumbeat we've got from them is innovation at the forefront of cyber security. Our ad campaign called “We've Got Next” amplifies the innovation that our teams have been delivering and our promise that we will be there with you as your partner.  We’ve Got Next. I look forward to seeing this ad be the drumbeat for all of our broadcast media and covering our many platforms over time as we go out in the public domain and keep sharing this with our customers. Moving on as you all are well aware, we've had a series of cyber security events over the last quarter against the backdrop of what we are seeing supply chain attacks, where bad actors tried to hack into core infrastructure pieces, which allows an access to enterprises or government systems. These vulnerabilities are being exploited by ransomware actors. The ransomware threat continues to rise.  Our Unit 42 team research shows that the average ransom demand in the first half of this year, grew from 5.3 million, which is up 518% year-over-year. What these attacks are highlighting is the constant shortcomings of enterprises and of government's infrastructure continually spurring demand and consolidation, as companies reevaluate their cyber security posture. It's against this backdrop that our platform approach is working. Three years ago, at our analysts' day, we set out the strategy of the Company on three fundamental tenets. One, that the network will transform with the introduction of the cloud. This has accelerated with the pandemic, with SASE and virtual firewalls leading transformation.  Not only that, we supplemented our firewall platform strategy with software capabilities like DLP, IoT, SaaS visibility, DNS Security and SDRAM. Our second insight, whilst the cloud is going to be big and it's here to stay. We have now 7 modules in our Cloud security platform, which is being used by over 75 Fortune 100 companies. And our third insight was more AI and machine learning will be needed to support the automation of our security platforms and our security operating centers. Out Cortex platform validates that for us every single day. Underpinning this innovation strategy has been a flurry of product releases at Palo Alto Networks. When I came to the Company, we sat down and decided what we need to do was to get our innovation and product strategy right.  Something many cyber security companies have struggled to do is stay relevant. You can see from the slide, we've gone from 13 major releases to 29 this year, tripling our product release capability over 3 years. Of these 63 odd releases, 11 of these -- 64 sorry. 11 of these have been through acquisitions. The other 53 have been done through organic innovation in the Company. And this is not all, we're going to see a lot more innovation coming down the pike as we unfold this year, we will tell you more about this in the Analysts Day. A rapid pace of innovation is also being validated by the industry. If you look at this slide, we’re recognized by two -- in two categories for leadership in cybersecurity.  In FY '21, we were awarded 6 different accolades to validate that now we're leaders in 6 different categories. Our aspiration is to grow that category leadership over this year, and hopefully get to double-digits by the end of this year. So, our pace of innovation is alive and it continues. Breaking down into the three different platform pillars, our network-driven pillar, which has been driven by SASE and virtual firewalls. I know at the beginning of the pandemic there was a huge debate, like how long is the work-from-home trend going to last. All I can tell you is it's far from over as it's going to become the norm. Hybrid work is about to become the norm and SASE is going to lead that transformation.  In this environment, all applications need access to every app from any location. Only Palo Alto Networks can provide a comprehensive capability with our consistent Network Security across all our platforms. We saw a phenomenal month number of large deals in this category, one of our largest deals was with the bank in the JPAC region, where it’s highly competitive and our customer spent over $10 million for Prisma Access was a cornerstone of that strategy. After a phenomenal amount of growth in our SASE product category, we've seen our customer count grow by 50% and now it's almost 2500 customers.  Also, 25% of these customers are net new Palo Alto Networks, which is great, not only are our firewall customers buying products of Palo Alto Networks, but our many new product capabilities are allowing us to penetrate the customer base even further. Beyond initial demand received for Prisma Access in our SASE category, we realized customers want more capability. We recently announced Autonomous Digital Endpoint Monitoring - Experience Management, sorry, ADEM. which [SASE] (ph) becoming a standard. We realized that bundling the ADEM capabilities with other capabilities around Prisma Access allows us to uplift our Prisma Access deals over time by 25%. In addition to our SASE leadership, last quarter we introduced our 4th generation hardware with high performance and attractively priced appliances.  The newly introduced PA400, which is ten times the performance of its predecessor, will expand our presence in the enterprise branch, SMB, international markets. Most recently in our quarter, a U.S., Canadian store chain that previously used us only at the corporate infrastructure, deployed PA400 series to 23,000 stores. Also on the high end of our hardware strategy we’re beginning to start seeing refreshes. This has been a trend which had been subdued, people were holding back, sweating their assets during the pandemic. And we realized as the pandemic has eased up, as companies are starting to come back to work, they're seeing volumes go up. They have not created more infrastructure.  As a result, we're seeing customers are coming back even in a hybrid form, starting to do refreshes in the hardware category, which has led to the hardware growth we saw this quarter, which is also underpinned some of the network-driven growth - our network platform-driven growth for us at Palo Alto Networks. Last but not the least, we continue to maintain a leadership position in our virtual firewalls. Recently launched our partnership with Google, powering their new Cloud IDS with our VM Series. As you can see, the continued acceleration of our software follow-up business, and its multiple form factors has allowed us to deliver approximately 47% of [Indiscernible] billings in a quarter where we even saw hardware growth accelerate.  We finished our fiscal year '21 with our software firewalls and Prisma SASE, next-generation security ARR at $425 million. As you will see, these numbers will add up to show that our NGS ARR for the quarter was north of 1180. Moving to our Cloud platform. As you know, we caught this trend early, investing three years ago in the cloud-native security opportunity. You might have all seen the flurry of activity from venture capitalists trying to flood this market with a lot more cloud security companies. We're delighted that they're validating our strategy, but we think we're far ahead. A key measure we use for understanding how well our Prisma Cloud services are performing is the consumption of our Prisma Cloud service.  In Q4, we had 2 million credits consumed. These consumptions broadening beyond our initial modules of Cloud Workload Protection and CSBM. We've launched IAM and [Indiscernible] modules. We already have seen adoption by north of 100 customers in the quarter. Or one-quarter of our global 2,000 customers are Prisma Cloud customers, with total customers growing at 47%. We're also excited that with our Bridgecrew acquisition, we've seen increased adoption of Bridgecrew as customers shift left with cloud security; we’re delighted with the results so far, and the progress we're making in integrating Bridgecrew with Prisma Cloud. We continue to see very large deals with Prisma Cloud. Our top three customers in Prisma Cloud committed over $40 million to bookings this quarter.  Our largest deal was $20 million in Prisma Cloud with a customer expanding Cloud Workload Protection and CSP and adding Bridgecrew for the entire cloud platform. Including our marketplace, VM Series, our Prisma Cloud business finished FY 21 with an ARR of $300 million. Moving on to Cortex. In Cortex, we have 2900 customers for our XDR Pro and XSOAR products, nearly doubling year-over-year. We booked our very first over $10 million follow-on transaction for Cortex in the pharma industry. Driven by the platform approach, our customers who bought most of the platform, they want XDR, they want network traffic analysis, they want XSOAR. Today, we announced XDR 3.0.  This expands our pioneering XDR service to cloud and identity based threats giving organizations a single console for holistic analysis. Expanse continues to innovate as a leader in the emerging attack surface management space, as well as delivering unique integrations with our Palo Alto portfolio. In Q4, released Expanse Capability that enables unknown Cloud assets to be discovered and brought under the management of Prisma Cloud. We finished FY ‘21 with Cortex NGS ARR of over $400 million. And last but not the least, we are very excited about Unit 42. Unit 42 is our capability where we can actually proactively support our customers.  This is how we go from being a peacetime company that provides products to our customers to a wartime ally when we are there for them when they need us. We launched proactive capability last quarter and our Unit 42 team our business went up 11 x in Q4 for the pr0-active services capability. One of the key engagements we are experiencing is ransomware readiness. We have 39 ransomware readiness assessments, where we got engaged and we have 300 more in the pipeline. Over time, we expect this service engagement to allow us to increase our product pull-through to our customers.  You can see that our leadership signs, where customers are integrating security and consolidating. As a company, we've continued to focus on getting more presence in our customers and getting larger deals with them. I'm delighted to say we had 18 customers sign transactions over $10 million in the quarter. We had our first customer that surpasses $100 million in their booked business during a fiscal year as they standardized from Palo Alto Networks across the entire enterprise. And our Millennium customers were up to 986 in Q4, approximately up 30% for the third quarter in a row.  The strategy is showing in our financial results, you can see we saw revenue acceleration in Q4 to $1.2 billion. We also saw that our billings went up to $1.8868 billion was up 34%, and our NGS billing of 1.18 billion was in excess of our guidance. Also delighted that our FY '21 performance where ClaiSec had an ARR of $734 million and revenue of $602 million.  Going into FY '22, we're further aligned around our One Palo Alto Networks strategy where we see the benefits of being able to cross-sell our platform. Also, I'm very delighted to say we had our first $2 billion quarter ever. I know you see the billions in the 1.868. But if you look at the difference between our [RPO](ph) and our revenue, we actually did more than $2 billion of book business this quarter. It's kudos to our team out there in the field and our customers who trust us with their cybersecurity.  During Q4, it is clear that we continue to see momentum in our business. We saw product revenue accelerated [Indiscernible]. This is revenue which we believe will sustain into one Q1 because we're seeing the refresh come in and we didn't ship everything that we saw in our product business in Q4 or are not able to. We're also seeing phenomenal growth in our cross-platform adoption. You can see that customers -- 43% of our customers purchased all 3 of our platforms. 28% purchased two platforms, and 29% purchased one platform. What's interesting is for customers that have acquired two of our platforms, deal sizes were three times the deal size for single platform. Also, for Global 2,000 customers that acquired All three of our platforms, some of the deals were 14 times the deal size of the largest single platform deal. So it’s very interesting to watch our platform approach of consolidation is beginning to show signs of success as we are able to go convince our customers that they should be deploying more than just one of our platform categories.  It is clear to us that our transformation is working. In September 2019, on our Analyst Day we provided FY ‘22 targets. Our just-released FY ‘22 guidance materially exceeds the FY ‘22 targets we set back in 2019, as you can see. As Dipak will highlight, our total company growth for revenue is the mid-twenties ahead of our prior [20%] (ph) CAGR target for two years ago. Our business is transforming faster, NGS is growing faster. I look forward to sharing new guidance for you for the next phase of Palo Alto Networks for the next three years at our Analyst Day in September.  But it's clear that over the last 3 years our product and strategic transformation to being an innovator in cybersecurity is working. Now we have to share the strategy over the next 3 years of how we continue to scale this business effectively and efficiently.  Multiple drivers give us conviction in objectives for FY ‘22 and beyond. Just to lay it out for you, how do I see growth for FY ‘22? And how do I see our scaling into that growth? One, I believe there is some pent-up hardware demand and we're going to see that come through in Q1 and the rest of FY ‘22. We've also launched new form factor hardware and we are very excited about the initial response by the customers to this new category of hardware. We also continue to benefit from the cloud adoption around the industry. And we think that benefit continues going to FY '22. As I said, work-from-home is a new normal. It's not something that's over.  I don't think the SASE train has barely left the station. I think there's a lot of room to go, not just for FY '22, but also beyond. And last but not least, I don't believe manual processes can keep up with the accelerating pace of sophistication for cybersecurity. So, I believe there is tremendous growth going forward, both for the cybersecurity industry and for Palo Alto Networks. On the scale front, we introduced the concept of speedboats 3 years ago. Our speedboat model is working well, we continue to iterate and improve it for growth and productivity. We also see our multiple platform success. We believe there's room for synergies as we get into a more cohesive sales motion as we start to see these things working. There is also some products which we have not yet launched, which you will see us launch during the course of the year. And we hope as we launch those products, there you're going to start seeing the benefits of our innovation and investments during this year and following years. And our journey to the Cloud is well underway. But we also have much to go in terms of optimizing our cloud spend. So, we believe there is an opportunity to create margin expansion over the long term. We also believe there is sustainable growth in the cybersecurity industry.  We expect to see these drivers of our topline combine with the continued but moderate pace of investment in FY '22 as we plan to add fewer employees in ‘22 than we did in the FY ‘21. Part of this is our expectation that acquisitions will be incremental versus substantive in the coming year. Beyond FY ‘22, we expect to grow operating income faster than revenue. We will update investors further on this at our September 13th Analyst Day. Ending I started, you can see why we are excited to talk about We've Got Next as we head into FY '22. With that, I will turn over the call to Dipak to talk about the details of our Q4 performance and our guidance.
Dipak Golechha: Hello everyone. Before I begin, please note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless specifically noted otherwise. We delivered results ahead of our guidance across all metrics as we continue to grow and transform our business. In Q4, we saw sequential revenue acceleration driven by strength in our hardware appliance business and in our next-generation security portfolio. We also continued to grow billings and our remaining performance obligation ahead of revenue as we build future predictability with the higher mix of recurring revenue. As a reminder, billings is total revenue plus the change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue.  In the fourth quarter of 2021, we delivered billings of $1.87 billion, up 34% and well ahead of our guided 22% to 23% growth. The size of the deals with our large strategic customers grew and our total customer account expanded with over 2500 customers added in the quarter. Q4 revenue of $1.2 to $2 billion grew 28% and was above the high end of our guidance range. Growth was driven by strong demand across all geographies and major product areas. Total deferred revenue in Q4 was $5.02 billion, an increase of 32%. The remaining performance obligation or RPO was $5.9 billion, increasing 36%. We believe that RPO has meaningful insight into our backlog as it includes both prepaid and contractual commitments from customers. By geography, Q4, revenue growth swaps strong across all regions. The Americas grew 29%. EMEA was up 25% and APAC grew 28%.  A hardware appliance business accelerated in Q4, driving product revenue of $339 million, growing 11%, and contributing 28% of revenue. Customer reaction to our refreshed on the 400 series and 5400 series appliances was positive. We saw strength overall in network and data center refresh and appliance coal through from customers standardizing on our platform. Subscription revenue of $535 million increased 37%, support revenue of $345 million increased 35%. In total subscription and support revenue of $880 million increased 36% and accounted for 72% of our total revenue. The gross margin was 75.3% up 100 basis points as compared to last year, driven by improvements in both our products and services gross margin. While the top-line outperformed, the operating margin was 17.5% down year-over-year as expected.  At some pre-COVID expenses returned in the fourth quarter and we continue to hire top talent, adding headcount in our go-to-market and engineering organizations. We ended the fourth quarter with 10,473 employees. Net income for the fourth quarter increased 12% to $162 million, or $1.60 per diluted share. A non-GAAP tax-effective -- effective tax rate was 22% GAAP net loss was $119 million or $1.23 per basic and diluted share. For the full-year billings of $5.45 billion grew 27% and total deferred revenue was $5.02 billion, an increase of 32%, fiscal year revenue of $4.26 billion grew 25%, an operating margin of 18.9% was up 130 basis points as COVID related impacts led to lower operating expenses throughout the year. Non-GAAP net income increased 27% to $614 million or $6.14 per diluted share.  Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We finished July with cash equivalents and investments of $3.8 billion, day sales outstanding was 74 days, a decrease of 7 days from a year ago, driven by a combination of strong collections and improved billings linearity. Cash flow from operations was $326 million, free cash flow was $298 million as compared to $302 million last year with a margin of 24.5% For the full-year free cash flow was $1.39 billion, was up 69% with a margin of 32.6%. Adjusted free cash flow for the year was also $1.39 billion up 43% with the full-year margin of 32.6%, Cash conversion remains an important part of our framework in supporting total shareholders.  Our firewall is a platform or F swaps billings grew 26%, reflecting another strong quarter as we continue to grow faster than the market. While we saw an increased contribution to the firewall as a platform growth due to increased product demand. A majority of firewall is a platform growth continues to be driven by software firewalls, including our VM series and Prisma SASE. Next-generation Security or NGS, exited the year at $1.18 billion, exceeding our original guidance of $1.15 billion. Within NGS, we continue to see exceptional growth in our SASE and software firewall portfolio, as well as strength in Prisma Cloud and Cortex.  For ClaiSec we were happy to have achieved results that were consistent with our fiscal year 21 financial goals. As we have gone through our fiscal year 22 business planning and oriented the focus of the Company around one Palo Alto Networks. We wanted to ensure our metrics reflect this one Palo Alto Networks strategy. We believe a focus on NGS ARR growth, and our transformation metrics are the best measures of progress on our strategy. In the appendix of our earnings slide deck, we've included the fiscal year '21 results and that SEC and Clay SEC. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged and aligned with the optimization of long-term shareholder return.  We remain focused on investments for organic growth and targeted value-creating acquisitions. We didn't close any acquisitions in Q4. And at this time, we believe we have assembled the key pillars needed to execute our platform strategy. We expect the incremental M and A in fiscal year 22 as compared to the recent past. Under our share repurchase authorization during the quarter, we acquired approximately 846,000 shares on the open market at an average price of approximately $388 for a total consideration of $328 million. Our Board of Directors authorized an additional $676 million for share repurchase, increasing the remaining authorization for future share repurchases to $1 billion, expiring December 31st, 2022.  Moving now to guidance and modeling points for the first quarter of 2022, we expect billings to be in the range of $129 billion to $131 billion, an increase of 19% to 21%. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.21 billion, an increase of 26% to 28% Q1 product revenue growth percentage to be in the low double-digits, we are providing this transparency, this quarter, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.55 to a $1.58 based on a weighted average diluted share count of approximately a 101-203 million shares. For fiscal year '22, we expect billings to be in the range of $6.6-$6.65 billion, an increase of 21 to 22% revenue is expected to be in the range of 5.275 to 5.3 to $5 billion, an increase of 24% to 25%.  We expect next-generation security ARR to be $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion, an increase of 40% to 44%. We expect product revenue growth percent to be in the mid-single-digit to high single-digit range year-over-year. We expect operating margins to be in the range of 18.5%-19%. Our Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of 715, 07-25, based on a weighted average diluted count of approximately 104 to 106 million shares. Adjusted free cash flow margin is expected to be greater than 30%. And we will report RPO and recommend this as an attractive metric as it captures the full value of our contractual arrangements and is a good indicator of future revenue. Additionally, please consider the following additional modeling points.  As I mentioned earlier, we hired aggressively in the second half in fiscal year 21, supported by confidence in our fiscal year 22 outlook for revenue and billings growth, with expenses from this investment flowing into the first half of fiscal year '22, and some return of COVID expenses, we expect operating income will be shifted to the second half of the year, in fiscal year 22, as compared to fiscal year 21. And we expect an approximate 43% to 57% first half, the second half splits during the fiscal year '22. We expect our non-GAAP tax rates to remain at 22% for Q1 and fiscal year '22, subject to the outcome of future tax legislation, we expect net interest and other expenses of $4 million to $5 million per quarter. We expect fiscal year 22 diluted shares outstanding of 104 to 106 million shares.  And for Q1 we expect capital expenditures of $35 million to $40 million. For the fiscal year. Which we expect capital expenditures of 4205--$215 million, which includes approximately $40 million related to our Santa Clara headquarters. Finally, I would like to invite you to join us for our virtual Analyst Day on September 13th when Nikesh, myself, and others from our team will provide an update on our Company and product strategy, financial outlook, and ESG plans. In closing, we are entering fiscal year '22 with strong momentum. We're pleased with our operational execution and organic growth prospects as drivers of continued momentum. With that, I will turn the call back over to Clay for the Q&A portion of the call.
A - Clay Bilby: Thank you, Dipak. To allow for broad participation, I would ask that each person ask only one question. The first question will be from Saket Kalia of Barclays with Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley to follow. Saket, you may ask your question.
Saket Kalia: Okay. Great. Thank you, Clay. Thanks for taking my question here. Nikesh, maybe for you lots of good stuff to hit on in the quarter. But maybe I'll just focus on next year's billings guide to start. Is great to see, I think the guide of 21% to 22% billings growth next year. That's better than where you started fiscal '21 in terms of billings growth expectations. And of course, subsequently beat, can you just talk about what's going into that higher starting point for fiscal '22. And maybe as part of that, how you're thinking about overall security spending in the areas that Palo Alto [Indiscernible]? Thanks.
Nikesh Arora: Saket, thanks for your question. As you know, when we went into FY ‘21, we're all looking at what's happening with the pandemic and we're trying to figure out how the pandemic was going to impact security Spend. how the pandemic was going to impact our customers coming back to work. What we realized in the course of the last year, that business must continue and, in that context, customers have come back and realized this way of working is fine.  Not only we’re working in terms of creating productivity and delivering their services, but also this way of working in terms of upgrading their IT infrastructure and, of course, staying ahead of the cyber security threat landscape.  So, in that context, we have a little more confidence going in this year where we believe the customer is going to go, of course, the pandemic hopefully will ease itself out over the course of the next few quarters.  But in the context, we feel a little more confident, therefore we've been able to understand what we can do as a business and share the guidance with you. In terms of cyber security spend as I said, the volumes of technology consumption have gone up in the pandemic no doubt.  I don't think this is a one-time blip that's kind of normal, I think this is a new normal. And that new normal needs to be protected, and to be able to protect it effectively, you are seeing customers are looking at consolidation strategies.  I shared with you the 3 platform purchases, the 2 platform purchases. In my 3 years at Palo Alto, and finally, I’m finally seeing customers wanting to consolidate and not deal with fragmentation, they're realizing this is a losing battle.  If you want to take point sliver products, and trying to integrate them yourselves. Now, that's our bet, has always been our bet, but it's not a bet which is contingent on us having a platform you have to buy it all. It's contingent on us being able to deliver best-of-breed capabilities and as I shared, we've gone from two to six, hopefully from six to double-digit this year, which means we actually deliver best-of-breed capability to our customers, even with the [Indiscernible]. So that's what gives us the confidence, Saket.
Saket Kalia: Thanks very much.
Clay Bilby: And our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley, with Rob Owens after that. Keith Weiss, you may ask your question.
Keith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question, and a very nice quarter. I think this quarter score is probably going to surprise a lot of guys in terms of the level of overall strength you saw in billings on next-gen doing really well, operating margins outperforming, the guide for operating margins outperforming. But probably the biggest area of contention coming into the print was product revenues. There's a lot of worry about supply chain issues and supply chain constraints. Doesn't really seem like that impacted you. You talked a little bit about product revenues heading into FY ’22. Does this account for any the guide -- does it account for any supply chain issues on a go-forward basis.  And this new level of for FY ‘22 up to mid to high single-digit growth, is that durable beyond FY ‘22 or is this a period of catch-up spend with that that pent-up demand around hardware you're talking about previously? Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: So, Keith, thanks a lot for your question. I also want to thank you for the balanced note, I thought you had a good assessment of our opportunities and challenges going as a quarter. Like you said, we are seeing the pent-up demand get released. We are seeing some impact of refreshes.  We are seeing some impact of some of the new form factors we've launched. We are working diligently, as I'm sure everyone is, with our suppliers to make sure that we're able to bridge the supply and demand gap. So far, we've been able to make it through Q4. Based on current visibility, we don't see challenges for Q1 going into it, which is why we've given you a guide for Q1 and we will keep working with our suppliers.  I think the supply chain issue is going to mitigate itself in Q3 or Q4 time-frame, anyway, in the industry. When there is a supply issue, a lot of the manufacturers, a lot of chip companies is actually working twice as hard to try and bridge the gaps. And we're also working hard with them to make sure we're very transparent about our needs in the quarter.  So far, we have guided with the anticipation that we will be able to keep managing our supply chain balance the way we have been able to manage for Q4. And in terms of your sustainability, I would welcome you to the Analyst Day on September 13th, and we’ll talk more about it then.
Keith Weiss: Excellent. Sounds great, guys. Thank you.
Clay Bilby: The next question comes from Rob Owens of Piper Sandler with Brian Essex to follow. Rob, you may ask your question.
Rob Owens: Great and thank you for taking my question. You talked a little bit in the prepared remarks about your success in the XDR segment, I was wondering given all the noise in that segment, Nikesh if you could unpack a little bit, where the competitive landscape is, and why Palo Alto is winning at this point. Thanks.
Nikesh Arora: Thanks, Rob. Look, XDR is a competitive space, is to new transform endpoint space which has a lot of players. And there were some legacy players in that space who lost ground to some of the newer players in the space, and we all know who they are, and Palo Alto came out of with a product, which was highly technically capable and competitive as we've shared with you, we have won various benchmarks in the industry versus other players in the space.  So, we are seeing dog fights or catfights or whatever the right analogy is in the customer space where we get in contention with a competitor. And it gets competitive and it becomes a question of, can you deliver the XDR capability we want? But I think over time what's happening is that customers are looking at it as a more expansive approach.  I think this is not just about EdR part, the endpoint part, it also needs to look at how do you [combing lateral](ph) network traffic analysis, how you put, take that together, and minimize the number of alerts that you're getting from different parts of the infrastructure.  As we just announced this morning, we've integrated Cloud capability in there, so now you can take a look at your cloud estate and take the alerts from the Cloud estate combing coming a lot of their endpoint, combing a lot of their NTA and trying to see how do you minimize the alert and how do you see a correlation amongst all those alerts, not just that, we introduced identity analytics this morning too.  So, I think over time, the XDR category is hurtling towards what used to be the SIM. And what's going to happen over time is XDR will engulf that space, but with a much more intelligent, normalized point of view where you can actually look at and say, this is valuable to me.  The SIM of the past was a data aggregation exercise and the intelligence was left for the customer to determine. I think XDR is bringing that next-generation capability to the SIM where it's cross-correlating prior to that, reducing your noise, giving you more relevant information. That's what's going to be the future. So that's why XDR, whilst competitive, highly strategic, and it's it behooves us because we have multiple pieces of the puzzle where we actually have Cloud security capabilities. We have firewall capability, not just on hardware, but across our virtual form factors. So being able to bring all that data makes sense of it and provide value to the SoC is where I think XDR is going. I think we're well placed in that space.
Rob Owens: Great. Thank you very much.
Clay Bilby: Our next question comes from Brian Essex of Goldman Sachs with Michael Turits next. Brian, you may ask your question.
Brian Essex: Great. Thank you for taking the question, and congrats on the results Nikesh. One quick question on the ClaiSec business. Wanted to understand -- I guess maybe on next NGS overall, confidence in the guidance, how much cushion is in that number.  I understand it's nice to see you leaning into ClaiSec with investment. Where are you investing for growth, particularly in sales and marketing? And maybe to cap it off management changes that we saw this quarter, particularly inviting BJ to join the Company. How that plays into the investment in ClaiSec as that remains a meaningful opportunity for you.
Nikesh Arora: Thanks Brian, you know, as we went on the speedboat strategy, our first job was to make sure that we had product-market fit. And in the early part of our strategy, we shared that we began to see product-market fit, which really, I think Q4 2019 was when we started to see traction in the space.  We spent the majority of the last 18 months after that trying to make sure that our sellers were able to understand the power of all the capabilities that Palo Alto has to offer. And we have some phenomenal results in terms of what percent of our core sales team can sell Cortex, can sell Prisma, and those numbers keep rising because we're trying to make sure that our sales team is able to go pitch the entire portfolio to our customers.  And that's exactly why we had the success we have been able to share with you, in terms of customers buying three platforms, two platforms, or one, and we believe that opportunities are still further ahead in terms of us being able to penetrate our entire customer base with our Cloud capabilities, our SASE capabilities, our Cortex capabilities.  So, we think there's more room to go. We are investing in more coverage and more capability, both in the U.S. and North America, as well as in international markets. That's one part of it. In terms of the management change, delighted that BJ Jenkins has joined us at Palo Alto Networks.  He was the CEO of Barracuda Networks. He understands security really well. He's a very seasoned phenomenal sales leader and also a great human being. He's going to come manage our teams, drive that growth continually further.  I also shared with you that part of our success as a company is being driven by very large deals. If you want to be the platform provider of choice, we have to be able to engage at the highest level for customer's organizations and convince them of our not just portfolio approach, but its best of breed capabilities.  Amit is going to continue to do that. He is working closely with BJ and Rick Congdon, our Head of Global Sales, and they're going to partner together and try and address the needs of the customers from the top-down, which allows us more bandwidth, more capability, and more management strength in being able to do that.  So, the sole part of the plan is to create an ability to go target customers at the highest levels. Trying to create large deals where they see a long-term transformation and be their cybersecurity partner of choice.
Brian Essex: Great. Helpful color. Thank you.
Clay Bilby: The next question comes from Michael Turits of KeyBanc with Jonathan Ho next.
Michael Turits: Congrats on the quarter. On both XDR and on Cortex and on Prisma Cloud. I think the impression a lot of us got last quarter was their competition was very tight, there was, I'm guessing you never got significant incremental investment there that was needed.  It sounds like those segments did well. And you know, you've guided moderately in terms of margins for next year, but it doesn't seem like any big shifts. So, are things moving better than you expected or is your funding a more streamlined rate of repurchases?
Nikesh Arora: Michael, I'll give you a quick sense of how things are going to have the lead jump in and give you a sense of the capability we built this year and the capability you're planning to build over the next 12 months. There's a sales part of the go-to-market part of it, which is working as I said, and our top-three customers committed over $40 million in public cloud spend.  I think many of the investors who have invested in these new startups and cloud security, that earlier [Indiscernible] not what we got from our top-tier customers. So, I think we are seeing traction in the market.  We are seeing residents and product-market fit, but it's not a static market. That market is continually evolving. We've gone from 07 modules. There's a lot more capability that people are looking for. Same time next year, I'm going to have Lee jump in and share some of the trends and where we are investing in next year.
Lee Klarich: Yes, absolutely. Look over the last 12 months we've made tremendous amounts of progress in both these products and you look at Prisma Cloud about halfway through the year we introduced four new modules, three of which have been built internally by the teams and one was the [Indiscernible] acquisition being integrated for micro-segmentation.  We've seen a lot of very good early customer adoption of those and going forward, I anticipate we're going to start to see mainstream adoption across the installed base and new customers as well. Rich Crews(ph) is doing nicely, as well with customers as they look more towards shift left and in the not-too-distant future, we will have that come out as an integrated module of Prisma Cloud.  Again, allowing us to more easily bring that to our existing installed base. XDR, [Indiscernible] with the announcement this morning with [Indiscernible], I think it just shows the continued innovation -- a pace of innovation that we are able to drive.  Extending it to Cloud, extending it to identity analytics, introducing the new [Indiscernible] module, and a whole host of other capabilities as well. And as Nikesh already alluded, you're seeing us start to extend the analytics, as well as the data aggregation layer to additional data sources and additional intelligence.
Clay Bilby: Our next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair, with Brent Thil up next. Jonathan, please ask your question.
Jonathan Ho: Excellent, thank you. I just wanted to go back to your comments around 2022 to give potentially as maybe a digestion year in terms of M and A. We think about sort of the further leverage in terms of the acquisition plays you've already made. Is it accurate to think 2022 as the [Indiscernible] Thank you?
Nikesh Arora: Well, Well, Jonathan. We digest as we eat. We took the 11 product capabilities, and if you look at our NGS revenue or NGS billings, a lot of their NGS billing is from a majority of acquisitions that we integrated into our platform. So, it's not like we have undigested parts of our acquisitions.  There are parts of our acquisitions where we'd like to see more traction on a pretty more wood behind the arrows. But for the most part, I think the way to interpret it, Jonathan, is that when we -- when I walked in 3 years ago, there were many trends in the Cybersecurity industry where we were not a player.  We were not a player in SASE. We were not a player in cloud security. We're not a full player in the XDR space, and the [Indiscernible]. We needed to become a player, and the cost and time required to build capability will take us four to five years.  That is where being able to look at the market's [Indiscernible] by the best in the market, which has already steamed -- which she already spent four to five years, and shown product-market fit was the right approach.  Today, we have to be very careful as we evaluate companies because pretty much in categories where we think there are relevant trends, we already have a product. So, acquiring anything that space would require us to spend a lot more time integrating, figuring out what to do their customers.  We have 2 competing products and I principally do not believe and having two products in the same category because creates confusion, destroys the strategy, increased -- lots of unnecessary gross profit in the organization. So that's why our opportunities to go expand in categories are limited.  We've decided at some places we want to play and we want to play to win, there are some places we're not going to play we don't want to play an identity. So, it doesn't matter if there is an open space and there are Companies out there.  We're not playing there, we're playing in Cloud Security where we will be very aggressive, we're playing in automating assault providing capabilities on the SoC and replaying a network firewall business.  And there we believe we have huge complemented capabilities. And as you saw from the slide, we're building lots of lots of organic capability. We did 53 product releases last three years, are all showing up. Hopefully in the billings that you're seeing that we're able to provide more capabilities, more subscriptions to customers.  That's the way I would interpret the M&A answer, and does it mean we might tuck in a product Company here or there? Yes. But it also means that we're not looking for substantive acquisitions at this current point in time.
Jonathan Ho: Excellent. Thank you.
Clay Bilby: Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies with [Indiscernible] after that.t Brent, you may proceed Nikesh, you mentioned that the sassy train has barely left the station. I'm curious if you can just elaborate on that comment and talk through kind of the next couple stations that you expect to land in with this train.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you, Brian. Look, if you -- I think the pandemic is partly to --[Indiscernible] more give credit to the fact that the SASE train is moving fast. Over the last 2 years, what you've seen as customers go commit to a large Cloud purchase to get involved in the development process of the Cloud purchase. And then they start to move their workloads to the Cloud.  As we begin to that, there are years of MPLS of datacenter spend, which is going on. Our customers realized I don't need to bring all that traffic back home. I need to start taking the traffic and have it gone where the data is, whether it's in the public cloud or my data center on those kinds of traffic routing splitting capabilities require you to have pushed that route into the edge, put SD lan under.  That also requires you to have security at the edge. Now, the majority of our customers who have security in the data center with our firewalls can easily take that capability, push it to the edge to the Palo Alto capability or Prisma Access without having to change their policy infrastructure allows them to be consistent across all form factors, all applications, all devices, which is actually through [Indiscernible].  And if you saw your leader in the [Indiscernible] by pretty much everybody else -- everyone else in the industry is behind. So, from that context, to deliver true [Indiscernible] with the sassy solution, we think we've reached a great position.  We've also aggressively supplemented that with software capabilities. And I'm pretty sure every Company out there in the Fortune 500 and Fortune 100, they're all going through their journey as we speak, I don't think their market is saturated by any means, shape, or form. And is not just a security play.  Actually, is a fundamental network play. People are shifting their traffic, taking away from the MPLS world to the more Cloud delivered security in the Cloud delivered Network World for GCP, AWS, Azure, others are providing the underlying network capability in addition to our security capability.
Clay Bilby: Our next question comes from Gray Powell of BTIG with Matthew Hedberg up next.
Gray Powell: Congratulations on the good results and thanks for taking the question. So, my side, I mean, we've heard that Palo Alto's implemented some price increases on the appliance side of the business. Can you just talk about what you're doing there and is that correct? How widespread are the price increases and does that have any sort of pull-through on cash subscriptions and support?
Nikesh Arora: So Gray, what has happened is with the supply chain initiatives that we saw in the industry, we've seen pretty much every player in the industry tweak their pricing for the upcoming year. And we've done something similar.  It's in the low single-digits from a price increase perspective, as you know, the net yield is contingent on a competitive situation. What the customer pays, what discounts have been negotiated with them.  So usually, typically you don't see the yield fully dropped to UPMLl. It will have some pull-through to our numbers as in when those price changes are affected in the field. But it's low-single-digits, it's just consistent with supply chain issues that the industry is seeing.
Gray Powell: Understood. That's really helpful. Thank you.
Clay Bilby: And our next question comes from Matthew Hedberg of RBC, with Joel Fishbein next. Matthew, please proceed.
Matthew Hedberg: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Hey, Nikesh congrats on the quarter. You started off the call talking about all the cyber threats these days, all the cyber risks, I was curious from your perspective, as we head into the U.S. federal budget season, yeah, how do you think about that impacting your business? Is it this year thing, is it more so next year? Just kind of wondering about the cadence of federal cyber funding.
Nikesh Arora: Well, as you know, the federal year-end is September. So, I think it's too late for them to have any material impact this fiscal year. I think they're busy trying to the new government in place with changing a lot of people and administration that they usually take, it takes in the first year of administration, takes a few weeks, months to work through those changes.  So, I think we're going to see stuff happen in the next fiscal year for the government. They have great intentions. They want to make sure that the Cybersecurity posture of the country, of infrastructure, is improved.  You've seen some executive orders in that regard. There is a very positive mindset in terms of leaning in and solving many of these problems. I'm hoping that may lead to a positive impact on the Cybersecurity industry.
Clay Bilby: Our next question comes from Joel Fishbein of trust securities with Keith Bachman up next. Joel, you may proceed.
Joel Fishbein: Thanks, [Indiscernible]. Just wanted to follow up on one of the themes that you talked about during the call, and that is vendor consolidation is something that we've been looking for a long time. What do you think the catalyst is there for that, and how are you positioned? Considering identity and endpoint are part of that -- those 2 markets.
Nikesh Arora: So, Joel, I think to look, my personal view, and I'm new to the industry even though have been here for three years, is I don't think there are many options in the industry to consolidate Cybersecurity spend. I think there were some phenomenal players in the market who had the amazing capability in their link, in there, swim lane.  What we've done in the last few years is build multiple swim lanes where you can buy the product in the news that strongly, or you can buy a product that connects across those simulates. And that's what we're proving with our Prisma Cloud, with our SASE strategy, and our firewall strategy.  We're adding more software capabilities. So, I'm going to tell you about my book. I think we're well-positioned for the consolidation around a minute majority of our platforms, at the same time, you don't have to buy it all from us if you don't want to, we're still integrated with other players in the market.  If your infrastructure is so designed or you actually have infrastructure players that you're deployed. In terms of correlating that to identity and endpoint well, we are an endpoint, XDR is the new endpoint play, where we do both EDR capabilities and XDR capabilities.  So, as you see, the transformation of relief from the traditional endpoint vendors to the XDR vendors, we have a play there. In terms of identity, I think the identity market will exist. I think there are players in the market.  But remember, identity is about two factual authentications and validating who you are once you're in the network, when you get past the initial identity checks here back in our network flow, you're back in our firewall.  So back in our Cloud instances. So, we do participate, really participate after being validated at the point at which we can get that information to integrate with existing identity players in the market. I don't know if the investors want me to go buy a [Indiscernible] player and make it better because there are some [Indiscernible] players in the market.
Joel Fishbein: Thank you.
Clay Bilby: And our next question is from Keith Bachman, of BMO with Bollin next. Keith, you may proceed.
Keith Bachman: Thank you very much. Nikesh, I wanted to flush out a little bit on the consolidation fee, but in a different direction, if you could just talk about your SASE wins. And are there some common themes within the SASE when the SASE wins, where are you winning and why?  And perhaps on the other side where you not winning and trying to understand as part of that theme is how are you winning within SASE, within your installed SASE, versus perhaps even. getting into some new customers that might turn into something more for Palo Alto. But if you could just talk about some common threads within your SASE environment?
Nikesh Arora: Keith, I'm going to lean on Lee to tell you about why we win, where we win. But as I said I'm prepared remarks, 25% of our Prisma Access customers are net new to Palo Alto. And this would typically be a customer who's got to apply deployed firewall which cannot give that extended sassy firewall Capex thing capabilities that liked to eventually replace those firewalls.  but then midlife, those firewalls, they would go with us on sassy, with us -- at least the hope and anticipation that we can go back and reverse into that with our hardware overtime as those firewalls from the competitors come to end-of-life. Lee, you want to jump in?
Lee Klarich: Yeah, I think the -- there's been a significant change in the market in terms of what customers realize they need from sort of thinking about users, employees that are off the network and sort of being like a nice to have, like maybe I can conduct into some sort of subset of applications, some of the time and that will be acceptable to the new realities of the hybrid workforce, where it's very clear that employees need to be able to access all applications, all of the time.  And for the enterprise, there needs to be a full security stack to protect those connectivity’s. And that shift really favors our position with present SASE, our ability to secure all applications, our ability to provide true enterprise tested enterprise-grade security and to do it in a way that is consistent with what many of our customers already have deployed for our campus environments, branch-office environments, et cetera.  And as Nikesh mentioned that that trend can come from two different directions. It can come from our existing customers who are really happy with us and his extending out to SASE or vice versa, customers that come in with SASE and then can extend into the campus and branch office environments.
Clay Bilby: And our next question, our last question for today comes from Ben Bollin of Cleveland Research. Ben, you may ask your question.
Ben Bollin: Evening, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. When you look at recent performance and even the forward outlook, how do you think about your share performance? Your share gains versus wallet share expansion within your customers. And then Nikesh, you talked a little bit about maybe within the networking, but what are IT silos do you feel like are donating spend into security as a whole? Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: Thanks, Ben. You saw we had highlighted one of our customers became our first customers spend a $100 in the air with us. And we have a few who were just short of that. So, it wasn't the only one who was getting there.  So, I think part of that gives you a sense of consolidation of spend and us getting a higher share of wallet. But I'd like to see it as us [Indiscernible] providing the capabilities to our customers. Are they able to do everything with us, they don't have to go and go stitch together multiple vendors because today there is a very high cost of stitching security because the cost is our ability?  And we're doing all the stitching for our customers, at least giving them the ability, they can go secure the enterprise and go do other stuff in terms of your question about where different parts of idea you're probably contributing, I think there is a large network contribution around the whole sassy topic because that's it effectively, not just a security plate also happens to be a network plate.  And that's where you'll see and you'll find, many times that our firewalls are procured either by the network team or the security team. So, you'll see that the whole network security space, there is a back and forth between whether it comes on the network budget or the security budget.  I think the same thing in the Cloud, people haven't quite figured out that the Cloud requires its own capability from a security perspective. And we're seeing that being baked into the budget. But very often that capability is coming out of Cloud spend where we're also able to go get credits from the public Cloud CSPM to have the customer pay for that given that answers the question.
Clay Bilby: And with that, we will conclude the Q and A portion of our call today. I will now turn it back over to Nikesh for his closing remarks.
Nikesh Arora: Well, I just want to say thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you at our upcoming investor events, and especially our Analyst Day. And I do want to take a moment to say thank you Thank you. Thank you to our employees, our partners, our customers, and everyone who made these results possible. [Indiscernible] have a great day.

Nikesh Arora: Thank you, Walter. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today for our earnings call. Let me begin with the current cybersecurity landscape. After the December SolarStorm attack, we saw an acceleration in attacks throughout our third quarter and after the quarter closed. These range from software supply chain attacks like SolarWinds and Codecov to ransomware attacks like Colonial Pipeline. Ransomware especially has been in the spotlight recently and data from our own Unit 42 shows that the average ransom paid in 2020 tripled from 2019 and in 2021 it's more than doubled again. The highest demand we’ve seen is $50 million, up from $30 million in 2020, with organized groups with near nation state discipline perpetrating coordinated attacks. The targets are not only corporations where healthcare and pharma is a focus with the pandemic, but also government organizations and shared infrastructure. The reason for this vulnerability is deep seated. Organizations run their operations on technology that is decades old, sometimes predating the internet. They continually bolt on new technologies to automate facilities, and make them compatible with the modern internet, but those platforms are inherently insecure. At the same time, cyber defenses are fragmented, making it very challenging to block sophisticated attacks and lengthening meantime to discovery and repair. Lastly, more and more businesses and consumers are coming online without a baseline of productive protection. In such a scenario, it is imperative that customers focus on securing their most critical assets, while also focusing on reducing the fragmentation and leveraging new technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning and using those approaches. With that backdrop, let's focus on our results. Overall, we saw continued strong demand environment and our own continued execution drove Q3 billings revenue and EPS side of guidance. We saw billings growth accelerated 27% in Q3 ahead of our 24% revenue growth forecast with growing ratable revenue contribution. I want to highlight one dynamic regarding our billings to help you better understand the drivers. During COVID, some customers were asking for annual billing plans to meet their needs. We noted to you that we saw success with larger, more strategic transactions in Q3. Along with these deals, we saw an uptick in annual billings plans. Normalizing for this, our billings would have grown greater than 28%, nearly two points higher than we reported, which is the highest billing growth we have seen in the third quarter since Q3 of fiscal year 2018. Last year, we saw billings plan have an approximate one point impact along with billings. We also saw 38% growth in our remaining performance obligations. This metric is growing faster than both revenue and deferred revenue, and will be a source of consistent revenue growth in the future. Within the strong performance, we also saw 71% growth in ARR or annualized recurring revenue from our next generation security offerings, where we finished our third quarter at $970 million up from $840 million in Q2. These ARR, billing and RPO trends drove 24% year-over-year growth in our reported revenue.  It's worth noting, given your attention to NGS ARR, that in the very first week, in the first day of Q4, we transacted one of our largest next generation security deals in the history of Palo Alto Networks, with a Fortune 30 manufacturer, which brought in $7 million in NGS ARR. So we're already at $980 million on the first day of this quarter. With the acceleration and incremental NGS ARR in Q3 and trends we see in the business, we continue to have confidence in our Q4 targets of $1.15 billion in [ending] (ph) NGS ARR. As part of the strong Q3 performance, we saw notable momentum in large transactions with 901 customers having spent $1 million Palo Alto Networks in the last four quarters. This cohort of customers was up 29% year-over-year growing ahead of our overall revenue and billings growth. This growth in active [indiscernible] customers has accelerated in recent quarters. As part of this large deal performance, our business is benefiting from growing adoption of multiple Palo Alto Network security platforms across startup [indiscernible]. In Q3, 70% of our global 2000 customers have purchased products from more than one of these platforms and 41% have purchased all three platforms. This is up from 58% and 25% two years ago. Turning to our product areas, earlier this year we started the dialogue around network security and cloud and AI and shared additional financial metrics to give you more transparency. Having these two product areas under the common umbrella of our world class R&D and go-to-market organization is key to our strategy being the largest cybersecurity company in the world. Starting with the network security side of our business, we are the leader in this business. Our strategy of selling customers leading firewall platform delivered to hardware, software or as a service form factor underpins our success in this market. This has resulted in the business that is 28% larger than our next peer on a revenue basis in Q3. Also if we look at leading indicators that include deferred revenue and RPO, our scale comes through even further, we are 40% to 50% larger. On this leading balance sheet metrics, we’re growing faster than our next peer. Three years ago, when I joined Palo Alto Networks, we were hardware based Firewall Company. We had a vision of a hybrid world where the enterprise and data centers would remain predominantly hardware oriented, growing adoption of software form factors like our VM series firewalls. Meanwhile, the remote access and remote office work, this opportunity has been transformed by cloud adoption and work-from-home trends to feel secure access service edge or SASE adoption. The reception to our strategy of delivering a firewall and multiple form factors has enabled the accelerating Firewall as a Platform growth rates we just showed you. Within our Firewall as Platform billings, we’re seeing a distinct mix shift towards software. The software mix, which includes our VMs and SASE business, now makes a 40% of Firewall as a Platform, up 21 percentage points from a year ago. We saw seven figure transactions for our software firewall capability, including VM and CN-Series with a U.S. government agency, a Fortune 30 manufacturer, and a diversified financial services company. While, we have seen the significant transition and form factors, one driver of growth in value in our business, our attach subscription support have grown at a steady rate over the last several quarters on a revenue basis. We expect the software mix to continue to increase in the medium-term, although along with this, we expect to continue to see attach subscription as a key growth driver. We’re showing you for the first time here, the NetSec annualized recurring revenue, which was 2.66 billion at the end of Q3 and grew 25%. As a reminder, this does not include our hardware business, which continues to be significant. This recurring revenue business is a key driver to strong cash generation, which we have guided to 42% for NetSec in FY 2021. We believe this high degree of recurring revenue and strong cash flow generated by NetSec is something that should be more clear now, given this incremental disclosure over the last two quarters. Now, turning to innovation and focusing first on Prisma SaaS, back at the beginning of the pandemic, we saw customers look to significantly expand remote access capability, while not compromising security or user experience. We’ve met that demand with free remote access trials and broad proof-of-concepts, enabling customers to see that value in Prisma Access, as well as supporting the network transformation as they move to the cloud. We’re seeing these efforts as well as momentum generated for the 2.0 launch, driving strong initial purchases and [indiscernible] expansions. This quarter, we saw a number of large Prisma Access transactions including a global technology company, a large manufacturer, and a Fortune 10 healthcare company, all eight figures or greater. Additionally over 25% of our Prisma Access new customers in Q3 were [net new] (ph) to Palo Alto Networks. Lastly, we're seeing early traction in our service provider partners for Prisma Access, including Comcast, Verizon, Orange Business Services. These relationships are part of broader initiatives to serve providers that we see as a significant growth opportunity. Just yesterday, we announced a significant release in network security focused around a comprehensive approach to Zero Trust. This is timed well and last week's executive order out of the White House that defines Zero Trust in a way that is very consistent with the Palo Alto Networks strategy. There has been a lot of noise in the industry around Zero Trust Network Access, a solution continue to be fragmented around either remote users, access control, or enterprise apps. Our approach covers all users and devices, all locations, all apps and the Internet applying consistent access control and security. Our new PAN-OS 10.1 release brings cloud based identity controls, integrated CASB and enhancements to our URL and DNS Security Services. Palo Alto Networks position across appliance, software and [SASE] (ph) is unique, and these new innovations are applicable to all our customers across all form factors. This is one of the most significant innovation releases for our next core, next generation firewall franchise, and gives us confidence in continued NetSec growth as we look forward. Now, moving on to cloud and AI, On the Prisma Cloud front, we continue to build on our early leadership position in Cloud Security Posture Management, Cloud Workload Protection capability, a marketplace delivered virtual firewalls, where we are the largest player across this opportunity set. Our strategy is to stay ahead of customer demand as they adopt cloud native security services across hyperscalars. We believe we've staked out a leadership position in cloud native security this business. We've achieved over $250 million in ARR across Prisma Cloud in our marketplace VM-Series. Fueling this growth is 39% growth in total customers and 38% growth in global 2,000 customers across Prisma Cloud. Our unique consumption model in Prisma Cloud based on credits, enables customers to use any of our modules across the cloud deployed workloads, including using multiple capabilities for workloads. We're seeing strong growth in credit consumption, with over 100% growth year-over-year in Q3. Despite our strong position with Prisma Cloud, targeting an early opportunity, we see the next big challenge in security at the developer level, or shift left security. We recently addressed this with our acquisition of Bridgecrew completed in Q3. Traditionally, security issues in code pose a challenge for the CCEL organization. And we're seeing leading companies drive a collaborative approach between the CCEL organizations to address this. Shift Left integrate security into the DevOps process to catch these issues upfront, where they are easy and quick to fix. It's a win for developers and a win for security. Bridgecrew has as an open source product; Checkov, this product delivers significant value to developers to a free download. Post the acquisition close on the release of 2.0 of Checkov, we our Bridgecrew download accelerate was also seeing strong momentum and speed customers, including a six figure customer in Q3. We're only in the very early stages of cross selling between Bridgecrew software and Prisma Cloud our cortex product area, we continue to focus on delivering significant volumes of innovation to XDR XOR, and our recently acquired expense product. In Q3, we deliver a new release of XDR, which expands endpoint query capability and improved visibility into network activity, XOR we significantly expand our market based partner integrations to increase the set of automation and security playbooks that customers can deploy. Seeing this result in steady cortex customer additions to XDR and extra customers, there were 2,400 customers starting from essentially scratch two years ago. Focus in innovation has been validated by the market as well. We were particularly proud of this validation where Cortex XDR in Q3 were regarded the best overall results in round three testing provider. Also in the recently released Forrester Wave, bring endpoint security software as a service market, named a leader. Source across 100 partner contributed content packs, and now has over 650 content packs in the marketplace. Our expanse offering was featured in Tim Jr.'s keynote this week at RSA, where research uncovered that one-third of leading organizations attack surface is susceptible to exposure and are the main avenue for ransomware. No other leading security company has the degree of visibility to identify and prevent today's most pernicious attack vector. Within Cortex, we are starting to see an uptick in large customer signings, such as a seven-figure transaction with the financial service firm, which included XRD Pro and XR. Last during Q3, we formed the new unit 42 under the leadership of Wendy Whitmore, who comes to Palo Alto Networks after building successful security services businesses. Our new team is a combination of two of the most capable teams in cybersecurity. The sepsis team is laser focused on the mission of conducting world class data breach investigations. Pas unit 42 team has focused on rapidly building threat intelligence and Developer Network products. This new unit 42 has completed over 1300 engagements in calendar, 2020, bringing to bear the power 140 consultants and responds to solar winds rant and ransomware attacks, Microsoft data breaches and other tax immobilizer consultants and rapid response engagements, which help customers through these difficult times. As we look forward, we're focused on using services to become an even more strategic partner to our customers. As I've reviewed with you here and should be evident innocuous results, we're seeing broad strength in our business across geographies and product areas. We see strength in our pipeline, and continued demand tailwind to remain strong, leading us to raise our FY 2021 guidance. I also want to update you on our plans we discussed in Q2 around exploring an equity structure for ClaiSec. We continue to focus on providing transparency for each part of our business. You'll notice the error for NetSec, which we've highlighted this quarter, we believe this has helped investors gain better insight into our overall financial profile, and especially understanding both sides of the business with a different growth and free cash flow characteristics. We have finished all the work required to file any form of equity on ClaiSec. However, given the state of the market, and offering extensive conditional shareholders we have decided at this point is best to continue with a single equity structure, and an integrated P&L postponing a decision to list ClaiSec equity. Lastly, we're excited to welcome Aparna Bawa, Chief Operating Officer at Zoom to Palo Alto Networks Board of Directors. She brings deep operational, financial and legal expertise, having served in diverse roles and rapidly growing tech companies such as Zoom, Magento and Nimble. Her addition comes off as February appointment of Dr. Helene Gayle to our Board. We continue to have a strong commitment to diversity at Palo Alto Networks, including at the most senior levels of governance in our company. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dipak Golechha, our CFO. We're excited to have Dipak step into the CFO role, enables smooth transition within our organization. He brings world-class experience. We're already seeing him bring someone's experience to bear in driving improvements. Over to you Dipak.
Dipak Golechha: Thanks, Nikesh. I'm excited and humbled to be part of this world-class leadership team. I look forward to driving total shareholder return. As Nikesh indicated, we have a strong third quarter as we continue to deliver winning innovation, while simultaneously adding new customers of pace. The strength gives us confidence to raise guidance for the year. We delivered billings of $1.3 billion, up 27% year-over-year, with strong growth across the Board and ahead of our guidance of 20% to 22% growth. We’ve continued to see some customers ask for billing plans. Many involving larger transactions as we become a more strategic partner to our customers. We’ve also use our Palo Alto Networks financial services financing capability here. The dollar-weighted contract duration for new subscriptions and support billings in the quarter were consistent year-over-year and remained at approximately three years. We added approximately 2,400 new customers in the quarter. Total deferred revenue at the end of Q3 was $4.4 billion, an increase a 30% year-over-year. Remaining performance obligation or RPO was $4.9 billion, an increase of 38% year-over-year. We continue to see these metrics is becoming more meaningful, as we drive growth from our ratable business. Our revenue of $1.07 billion grew 24% year-over-year ahead of our guidance of 21% to 22% growth driven by via billings and broad business strengths and amidst an increase in our audible subscription revenue. We remain focus on driving this high quality revenue with all new product offerings being pure or substantially all subscription in nature. Looking at growth by geography, the Americas grew 24%, EMEA grew 23% and APAC grew 25% showing broad executional excellence across the world. Q3 product revenue of $289 million increased 3% compared to prior year. Q3 subscription revenue of $474 million increased 34%. Support revenue of $311 million, increased 33%. In total, subscription and support revenue of $785 million increased 33% and accounted for 73% of total revenue. Our Q3 non-GAAP gross margin was 74.6%, which is down 60 basis points compared to last year, driven by product mix, which are less mature. Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 17%, an increase of 60 basis points year-over-year. There are several factors driving our operating margins. We have revenue upside, lower travel and event expenses, due to COVID and some shift in spending out of Q3. At the same time, we continue to aggressively invest the growth largely in the areas of sale capacity and R&D investments. With health conditions improving and geographies of many of our facilities, including our Santa Clara, headquarters. We're seeing more employees look to return to the office. We expect this trend will continue to gain steam in Q4, reversing some of the savings we've seen in the last few quarters in our OpEx. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter increased 22% to $140 million, or $1.38 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for Q3 was 22%, the EPS expansion was driven by revenue growth and operating expense leverage with an undertone of strong investments of growths. On a GAAP basis for this quarter, net loss increased $140 million, or $1.50 per basic and diluted share. We ended the third quarter with 9,715 employees, including 39 from the Bridgecrew, at the close of acquisition. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, we finished April with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $3.8 billion. Q3 cash flow from operations $278 million, increased by 64% year-over-year. Free cash flow was $251 million, up to 100% at a margin of 23.4%. Our DSO was 60 days, a decrease from three days from the prior year period and flat from second quarter. Our Firewall as a Platform, or FWaaP, had another strong quarter, as we continue to grow faster than the market. FWaaP billings grew 26% in Q3, and we continue our transition from hardware and software and SaaS form factors as Nikesh highlighted. Our next generation security or NGS continues to expand, and now represents 27% of our total billings of $346 million, growing at 70% year-over-year. In the third quarter, we added $133 million in new NGS, ARR, reaching $973 million. The acquisition of Bridgecrew, added an immaterial amount to this number, and we remain confident in our plan to achieving $1.15 billion in NGS, ARR exiting fiscal year 2021. Turning now to guidance and modeling points. For the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect billings to be in the range of $1.695 billion to $1.715 billion, an increase of 22% to 23% year-over-year. We expect revenues to be in the range of $1.165 billion to $1.175 billion, an increase of 23% to 24% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP ups to be in the range of $142 to $144, using 101 to 103 million shares. Additionally, I'd like to provide some modeling points. We expect our Q4 non-GAAP effective tax rate to remain at 22% and our CapEx in Q4 to be approximately $30 million to $35 million. As Nikesh indicated, we're seeing broad drivers across our business in Q3, driven by foundation of innovation and strong sales execution along with trends we see in our pipeline and the long trail demand tailwinds that remain strong, we're raising our fiscal year 2021 guidance. We expect billings to be in the range of $5.28 billion to $5.3 billion, an increase of 23% year-over-year. We continue to expect next generation security, ARR, to be approximately $1.15 billion, an increase of 77% year over year. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.21 billion, an increase of 23% -- 24% year over year. We expect product revenue growth of 1% to 2% year over year. We expect operating margins to improve by 50%, 50 basis points year over year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $597, $599, using $99 to $101 million shares. We expect regarding free cash flow for the full year, we expect an adjusted free cash flow margin of approximately 30%. Now let's review our fiscal year projections for NetSec and ClaiSec. Overall, we are confirming our ClaiSec projections, while raising NetSec billings by 300 basis points and revenue by 100 basis points, given the strong performance of SASE, VM-Series and subscription business overall within that NetSec. Moving on to adjusted free cash flow. We expect Network Security will deliver a free cash flow margin of 42% in fiscal year ’21, up from 38% in fiscal year ’20. We continue to expect Cloud and AI free cash flow margin of minus 43% in fiscal year ’21 an improvement from negative 59% in fiscal year 20. While we are focused on growth investments in Cloud and AI, overtime we expect Cloud and AI to -- to achieve growth, operating and free capital margins in line with industry benchmarks as we gain scale, our customer base matures and we become more efficient. In Q3 we repurchase $350 million in our own stock at an average price of $322. As of April 30, 2021, we have $652 million remaining available for repurchases. This is part of a broader capital allocation strategy focused on balancing priorities and maximizing total shareholder return. We start with fueling organic investments and managing priorities across innovation and go to market to set the foundation for sustainable growth the Palo Alto Networks. Second, we deploy capital for targeted acquisitions which accelerate this growth opportunity. We rigorously evaluate targets, focused on acquiring leading technology, retaining key members of the team and following through with integrating these acquisitions into our businesses. Finally, we work to optimize our capital structure using the options available to us in this dynamic market that includes deploying debts, using stock for M&A consideration and also buying back their own stock when we see it representing the good value. With that, let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Walter over to you.
Operator: Thanks. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Brian Essex from Goldman Sachs with Fatima Boolani from UBS on deck.
Brian Essex: Hey. Hi, thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. Maybe for unit cash, we've seen a lot of solid outperformance relative expectations on a network security side. And nice performance this quarter with respect to Cloud and AI ARR growth. Wanted to get a better understanding, given that the outperformance has been on the network security side, how confident are you in your ability to hit that $1.150 billion guide for the full year? How do we think about, you know, how that business is performed relative to your expectations so far this year?
Nikesh Arora: Brian, remember, two or three years ago when we set out targets for next generation security business, we didn't have the muscle [indiscernible] networks to figure out how we can get out of the firewall business and have that sales force go out and actually go sell Cloud and AI. The good news is over the last two and a half years we're building muscle, we're learning how the market operates. It's kind of interesting, every one of these markets operate slightly differently. If you look at NGS, it's a combination of SASE, Prisma Cloud and Cortex. Now SASE's characteristic are a lot of the free trials we gave a few quarters ago and this whole push to work from home is forcing customers to think hard about their security stack and it's no longer, you can access half the apps, half the time, you need to be access -- able to access everything from wherever you are. So we're seeing network transformations and that's what's driving the success on SASE and some of the huge wins you had on Prisma access. As I mentioned one of the deals, which we closed and shipped on the first of this month is our largest SASE deal ever, which gave us $7 million of NGS ARR, so you can see approximately the quantum of that deal. So we're seeing a lot of traction on the access front and the SASE front, so that's good. Cortex is an interesting space, because we compete there with people like CrowdStrike and SentinelOne and the others. We're great on the product front as we've showed you the Forrester Wave and the MITRE results. We're trying to create more muscle around being able to do those deals. Those deals are typically, you got to -- because it's a competitive market, you got to do a whole bunch of deals there, and they all range in the $1 million to $5 million range with the higher end and the smaller below that. So you don't get lumpy deals as you have to do a lot more deals, so that's what we're doing on the Cortex front. Last, but not the least, on the cloud front, we got 2,250 customers, but there the deals end up being large deals that are slightly lumpy, and they have very high variability in duration and consumption. So some deals have moved in the cloud, how to buy credit to the next three years, how many credits do I need. They suddenly find their deployment is slower because they haven't deployed fully on GCP or AWS or Azure. Others, you'll say, they've been customers last three years. They're upping because they moved all their workloads to the cloud and their workload ramp is increased. So, all three of them have slightly different characteristics. That's why we end up in a portfolio situation. You saw this quarter we added about $133 million in net new NGS ARR, I just told you about seven more, because I felt you guys are extremely curious in NGS and I don't want you guys to go out thinking we're not confident on 1150. So right now we all feel that we'll get to 1150 on NGS ARR, and it's going to end up being a portfolio call in terms of some things extremely doing extremely well something doing normal.
Brian Essex: Got it. Got it. Thank you for that. And then maybe a follow-up with Dipak. Appreciate the commentary on the improving operating efficiency or potential to improve the operating efficiency of cloud and AI. And I think that's one of the things that investors kind of struggle with when I think we've all looked at this business on the sum of the parts basis and the performance of each on its own, in the challenge with cloud AI that its burning cash at the rate that it is, what do you think about the term -- the timeline for improving profitability and cash flow generation from that business, because I think that might be a trigger for investors to maybe look at that business on a standalone basis and assign it a little bit more value?
Dipak Golechha: Yeah. So, maybe if I answered in two different ways. I mean, we look at what other companies have done as they've kind of like grown through there -- they've scaled over time. And we often benchmark ourselves versus where were they at this time and are there things that we can do to be able to get there. But at the same time, we're not shy from like making the right investments, if we see the opportunity there. So that's why I don't want to really box ourselves into a timeframe. It really is a question of what opportunities are out there at the time, so we have a base plan that's constantly improving, but we're also reflecting on the fact that this is a dynamic market, and sometimes you need to lean in, if it makes sense for the long-term.
Nikesh Arora: Yeah. If I can add to that.
Brian Essex: Great. Thanks. Oh, go ahead.
Nikesh Arora: Yeah. There are two parts one, as Dipak, highlighted. We continue to work hard towards getting gross margin efficiency on those products because the product development is in our control, and Lee who's sitting to my right, he and his team work hard at trying to make sure that we optimize the gross margin part. The rest of it honestly is the question of how much do we want to invest in sales capacity to be able to drive those? Don't forget, in each of those areas, we are dealing with extremely competitive situation. In the case of XDR we deal with dedicated salespeople from CrowdStrike, they outflank us 8:1 on the number of salespeople. So we have to look hard at how much investment we want to make on the sales side. We do get leverage with the Palo Alto sales people, eventually end up with hand to hand combat. On the Prisma Cloud side, I'd say we were doing fine and we are doing fine. But suddenly the equity of the venture markets have gone and provided phenomenal valuations and dumped a lot of cash in some very early stage companies who are not dangling large paychecks to our sales people [indiscernible] got the most qualified cloud security sales. And so, that's why I think Dipak is right in saying that, we're going to watch the market carefully. But again, we just told you another number. $250 million in ARR in cloud security, VMs and public cloud security. That's a number which is -- outflanks our next competitor by probably 25 times.
Brian Essex: Super helpful color. Thank you.
Operator: Great, Thanks. So just a reminder, let's limit to one question. So next up is Fatima Boolani and on deck is Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.
Fatima Boolani: Thanks Walter. Nikesh, maybe I'll start with you very quickly. You talked through a lot of the areas of strength from a product pillar perspective. But in terms of just zooming back, can you stock rank for us what specific product areas in the NGS portfolio really were the drivers of billings acceleration in the quarter? And then I have a quick follow up for Dipak, please.
Nikesh Arora: Yeah. As I highlighted, SASE is strong. Dipak highlighted the subscriptions are strong. We're pleased with the way Cortex is evolving and cloud ends up being lumpy. So some quarters we’ll get some very large deals, and then make up the billing. Some quarters they push. But across the board, the portfolio is performing in line with our expectations or slightly ahead, as we said, we hit 973 or 980, depending on how you count it.
Fatima Boolani: Very good. Dipak, nice to meet you.
Operator: Well, we’re just going to go to -- let's just go one question. Let's -- we're going to move on next to Keith Weiss with Sterling Auty from JPMorgan on deck.
Keith Weiss: Excellent, thank you guys; Very nice quarter and thanks for taking the question. I think, you guys are doing a very good job of illustrating the -- there's a difference between firewall appliances and more generally firewalling capabilities. And you're seeing that firewall is a platform growth, sustained really well, actually accelerating in recent quarters. And I think that's probably one of the key areas that investors are most cautious on, is the durability of growth and firewalling. Can you talk to us a little bit about where you're seeing that strength from? Do you believe it to be durable over the next couple of years, and is there anything that we should be watching out for in terms of tough compares or any one-time items from a year ago period that might upset that that growth trend that you've been seeing in firewall as a platform?
Nikesh Arora: Well, I’ll gave -- I’ll make two comments, Keith. One is, is there are situations where the customers are looking for, like you say, firewalling capability. We can walk in and say we can solve this problem with software or we can go deploy tons of hardware to solve the same problem. So take a large retailer, then go deploy 1,200 firewalls in each of their stores; if they choose to go down the hardware route, which is more costly to deploy, harder to maintain, harder to upgrade over time; or we can go in and say, let's do that with Prisma SASE, which is a software dependent solution, which has lower cost of ownership, easier deployment, easier to solve. So you're seeing us create some degree of substitution in our customer base. So if you compare us like-to-like with some of the leading hardware firewall businesses, which don't have that strength in that software capability, they cannot deal that substitution capability, which we think is better for the long term, because we just point to the ARPU. So look, we can grow ARPU at 38%. That just means we have future revenue coming down the pike on the FwaaP front, which is going to be harder to hunt and kill on a quarterly basis, if you were hardware only business. So I actually think there's more resilience in our network security business than most hardware develop -- dependent businesses. The second piece, I would say, in that context is what was proxy based architectures is now full firewall in the cloud. We’re seeing that in space and Prisma SASE, people are stepping back and saying, okay, let me understand this, how do I get my trading system to be accessible from an employee's home, you can do that with proxy based architecture. We talked about that [indiscernible] and we're seeing that really bear out in the success we're seeing in Prisma SASE.  My fellow colleagues Walter and Dipak will not let me throw out more stats in that area, but I'll just say I'm extremely delighted with the progress we've made in SASE from where we came. 2.5 years ago, there used to be a product called GPCS, and we would shudder, like you said the onetime items. There was one deal when I came to Palo Alto, we sweated the entire year to see how we left that in the following quarter. Now we do six of those in the quarter. And we've got tons and tons lined up in our pipe going forward.  So SASE is strong, which should give us continued strength. I think the network transformation is in a very, very early stage. If you think about it, if you see AWS, GCP, Azure clipping $40 billion, $50 billion of billing in a quarter, all those customers are going to stand up and realize wait I'm relying on MPLS based architectures to go back to my data center, now I don't need to go there, I need to go to a public cloud. And to do that, you got to go SASE. Right now, we firmly believe we have the best SASE solution in the market. We firmly believe that we have the most deployed customers out there at scale. 
Operator: Great, Thanks. Next question from Sterling Auty and Saket Kalia from Barclays on deck. 
Sterling Auty: Hi. Thanks. It's fun to see Walter on the other side trying to keep us to one question after all these years. I want to follow up on Keith’s question as well on FWaaP. Help us understand what are the metrics that we should look at in terms of and you gave a little bit of this last quarter, but when look at your install base of the on-premise appliances, as some of that starts to transition to FWaaP, is that happening? And if it does, how is the dollar-for-dollar comparison? In other words, do your customers still end up spending more, does they are still expanding under FWaaP versus their traditional clients? Is it smaller or the same?
Nikesh Arora: I'm going to bring in my colleague Lee Klarich, who spends a lot of his time making sure that these transitions work, and we see these transitions happen, Lee. 
Lee Klarich: Yes. Thank you, Nikesh. Good question, and actually last quarter we provided some insight into this, if you remember. There's effectively two transitions that we see play out. One transition has to do with movement of applications from data centers to the cloud, where the form factor often is changing from a hardware form factor to software form factors, VM series etcetera. The other transition is from -- based on how the employees and users are moving increasingly obviously, moving off the network and soon moving to more of a hybrid state where, in that case, it often is moving from hardware to hardware plus cloud-delivered SASE architectures. And so as you think about those, the net effect of all of it is positive for us in terms of the overall spend from customers. There's some puts and takes, hardware going to VM-Series and the cloud is relatively similar, hardware going through SASE is actually typically an uptick in overall spend because it's not just like-for-like, it's actually SASE includes network as a service. And a lot of the networking components, global network reach etcetera and so the overall spend envelope becomes larger as more of the capabilities actually get integrated into the service that we're delivering to customers. So overall, positive and we've been now tracking this and have history of this for a few years to be able to actually see how that plays out.
Sterling Auty: Great, thank you.
Operator: Great, thanks. Next question from Saket Kalia from Barclays, and then Matt Hedberg from RBC next.
Saket Kalia: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my question here. Nikesh, maybe for you. Can you hear me okay, Walter?
Operator: Yeah.
Saket Kalia: Okay, cool. Nikesh, that was helpful commentary on the equity structure around ClaiSec. I guess the question is what were some of the things that went into your decision to explore that last quarter, and then maybe reconsider it this quarter, and is it a matter of timing given the volatility in the market or would you say that the probability of exploring that down the road is still relatively low.
Nikesh Arora: I think Saket as we went through the mechanics of creating all the paper work required to file this. The debate began to happen with some of our shareholders, as look, the true value creations and they actually can take this and separate it, because you'll still have a stub or some sort of tracking stock. And the challenge with separating it, as you saw, 70% of our customers are buying multiple platforms. 40% of our customers are buying all three platforms. We're getting into conversations with CIO, and somebody goes to a breach or ransomware when they want to go, wall-to-wall and say, listen, come protect me, protect my cloud, protect my sock, protect my network transformation. And then we’re suddenly saying, look, we have all this vantage point from where we are, where we can go pitch all three platforms and go on the lock the customer with security and we're creating this artificial separation amongst ourselves, we're not going to be leveraged that. So that definitely went through the decision. I think the question which I can keep practicing. So just asked around to Deepak about the funding of ClaiSec vis-à-vis NetSec, I think, we'd still have to make that a self-standing profitable entity in its own due course. And I think it's too early to go think about separating that into distinct businesses, because we're getting phenomenal leverage from our firewall sales teams, who are sort of one and a half decades trying to build the relationships and get them better than our customers did.
Saket Kalia: Very helpful. Thanks.
Operator: Great, thanks. Great. Thanks. Next question from Matt Hedberg from RBC, and then we've got Tal Liani from BofA next.
Matt Hedberg: Thanks Walter. Hey, Nikesh, I wanted to talk about, all these recent breaches you alluded to President Biden, talking about the importance of zero trust. I guess, how do you think about that impacting your federal business later this year. And then also, as these breaches continue to accelerate in a post-COVID world, do you think you're going to be in a better position to consolidate security spending, there's always that debate on best of breed versus consolidation. Is this just accelerate your demand environment even more so?
Nikesh Arora: Matt, what interesting is, let's start with the second part first. Like, clearly, whatever approach was used to buy security hasn't worked, right? And we've traditionally been in a best of breed approach. You got the companies, they have 35, 25, 40 vendors, and this act of stitching all those solutions together is left on the shoulders of the customer. You coupled that are the two biggest technological transitions that have ever happened in the history of computing. One is the shift to the public cloud, but you have to fundamentally change your IT architecture. And the second is network automation that you're going through, driven by the cloud. So, CIOs are dealing with those two technology transitions and at the same time, having to take a hard look at security and bolstered up. And I think there, if you look at historically, I don’t think there has been many security companies who have been able to give you best of breed solutions across multiple capabilities. So our firewalls, nine times, top right, magic quadrant of our own capability, whether it's sassy or hardware firewalls, VMs fit in the category, so they can get the best firewalling capabilities across three different architectures, XDR measures the top right and Forrester Wave. We're the only cloud security native security company with Prisma cloud. We are top right in SD LAN and we're top right next sort of there was a corner. So we actually have the ability to give you a stitched set of products across five leadership positions, which is not available today in the cybersecurity industry. So, we're able to make the both the best of breed, and stitch platform argument right now, and is resonating because customers who are going through these agonizing times are stepping back and saying, wait, I need to look at it from a different approach. And I can go -- how can I go with a partner, where I can hold accountable for my entire security footprint.
Operator: Great. Thanks, Matt. Next up is Tal Liani with Keith Bachman from BMO on deck.
Tal Liani: Hey, I have an accounting issue -- accounting question. Great results, ARR, were better than expected, at least some people expected some issues there, but I looked at your filing and you change the definition of ARR a little bit this quarter, you edit the language. When I compare the language of this quarter versus last quarter, you edit the language that this quarter it includes certain cloud delivered security services to ARR, would you mind to quantify this addition was it material to the numbers this quarter? Thanks.
Dipak Golechha: I'll take that question. It's really not material to be overall, we added a couple of cloud delivered technology solutions like IOT in one example, when you have all of them that they're relatively de minimus in nature.
Tal Liani: Got it. Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: The early launches of our products and we want to make sure they fit in the right bucket.
Nikesh Arora: We can sell IoT against Cortex. Cortex data lakes and they sit in both places in our firewall business and in our cloud AI business.
Tal Liani: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Next up is Keith Bachman and then Gray Powell from BTIG.
Keith Bachman: All right, thank you very much. Nikesh I want to ask you to flesh out Cortex, a bit more in terms of run rate and expectations feedback we've been getting from the channels is Cortex certainly is doing better and I was wondering if you could talk about win rates, where you're winning. Some of the reasons why? Is there any metrics you can give us on growth associated with the Cortex brand, whether it's revenues or billings?
Nikesh Arora: Well, I can't give you a metric we haven't given, but I'll tell you, Cortex comprises three products; one is XDR, which we compete with as you see with CrowdStrike and SentinelOne. I think the challenge we have there is our product as you can see, has technically been now ranked better than CrowdStrike and at par with SentinelOne and others. The challenge we see is we don't have as much coverage as CrowdStrike, so they're in more deals and we are, and that's a virtue of the fact that they have eight times more dedicated sales people chasing the XDR category and we don't. Where we do end up against them, we pretty much don't lose technical PLCs, obviously because of the, you've seen the technical comparison market, then it becomes a price war, and we don't bend over on the price war. So, we see reasonably good win rates against them where we are present. I think our challenges were not present in as many deals as we'd like to be present and because they've got us -- they've been at it for seven years, we've been at it for two and a half. So, that's kind of like the XDR solution. XSOAR, it used to be Phantom and demister, for the most part we don't see much competition in the XSOAR category. We think pretty much where the customer believes they have a need, they will go with XSOAR, so we're not we don't feel challenged in that market, but it's a moderate deal size, it's not the deal size of cloud which can get to eight figures. It's a deal size just smaller than that, but we do see less competitive activity in the XSOAR category. And last but not the least [Indiscernible] access management is a newer category where people are beginning to understand that the hackers can look at the entire vulnerability footprint from the outside, so you're better off having a clear view. For example, any customer that goes into a Breach Report ransomware actually wants to understand that the entire footprint and the vulnerability associated with it. So we end up having an engagement expense, whenever that happens. What is going on is that with the formation of Unit 42, we're getting more and more involved in more incidents out there, and that's allowing them to drag and drop XDR and Expanse in those early days, but we have merged the forensic capabilities for example of Crypsis, which used to be a product called Hadron that has been embraced into XDR, that will go live very shortly, where our cars were where our incident responders can go deploy XDR and provide all the forensic capabilities that they do when a breach happened. So early days we are seeing more traction on Cortex, I think we announced that we have 2,400 customers. The only -- the real upside and opportunity for us is to go ahead and execute at scale over there to get into more and more deals, because the product is there. Two years ago – 12 months ago we didn't have the product.
Keith Bachman: Right. Okay. Terrific. Thank you.
Operator: 0Thanks, Keith. Next up is Gray Powell from BTIG. And on deck is Adam Tindle from Raymond James.
Gray Powell: Hey, great. Can you hear me okay? All right. Thanks for taking the question. So yeah, maybe back on Prisma Access, what's been the reception with Prisma Access 2.0 so far? And do you see that product update with proxy capabilities getting Palo Alto into more traditional secure web gateway replacement deals or potentially improving the pace of new logo ads on the product set?
Nikesh Arora: Yes. Look, we're really excited about the 2.0 launch a few months ago, great reception from customers, really excited about everything that was in the launch. Remember, this is where we introduce cloud management. So cloud native experience, onboard – easy onboarding activation. This is also where we launched the first ever Autonomous Digital Experience Management add-on module. So this allows our customers to monitor the actual end user experience that they're seeing through the service to the applications are accessing in addition to the proxy capabilities and cloud-based technology, et cetera. So it was a big release, very well received. The adoption, almost all of the Prisma Access customers have now been upgraded to 2.0 and very smooth upgrade process, we're seeing great adoption to cloud management, close to 100 customers are now using that in just the first couple months of availability. The Autonomous DEM, we're getting great feedback from customers from early adopters and growing the pipeline of that that's an add-on module that we can go and sell back into the Prisma Access customers as well as new customers. And you know the proxy capabilities interesting is, as you know the -- we still believe most customers are going to want the full fledged capabilities of Prisma Access and not just the proxy capabilities, but that capability has achieved what we wanted is remove that as an objection. It's allowed customers who need it, to be able to move to Prisma Access and just remove that as a criteria. And so we're seeing a number of customers that are testing that and using it and happy we added it and made the change.
Gray Powell: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thanks, Gray. Next up Adam Tindle from Raymond James and then Michael Turits from KeyBanc.
Adam Tindle: Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon. Congrats on the results. I wanted to ask on profitability, whether it's Nikesh or Dipak wants to weigh in. You're seeing deal sizes increase. You're seeing cross platform adoption and those were helpful metrics for us. We typically associate those with very healthy contribution margin. You did talk about 50 basis points of operating margin expansion this year, but I wanted to ask beyond this. Do you think that this is something where you can build on, you're hitting a turning point and we could see sustained margin expansion from here? You’ve talked about a 150 basis points annually, a couple of years ago at an analyst day, wondering the puts and takes to get back to that level of margin expansion? Thanks.
Nikesh Arora: I think the honest answer is it's pretty situational, right. I mean, I think every – every customer deal is different and like we're obviously going to lean in, if we have to, you know, in order to do that but I think what really drives us, is making sure that we don't leave any money on the table. I certainly think that as the portfolio grows, as the attack surface area becomes more complicated, hopefully, the leverage moves more within towards our favor over time and that will help us over time. But I think in general, I would stand by, it's always a focus area for us and we believe that with scale will come from margin expansion over time. But at the same time, we just don't want to leave opportunities on the table, if they're there for the taking.
Dipak Golechha: Yes. Just adding to that Adam, I read your note, thank you for your enunciation and upgrade. I noticed that you talk about operating margin leverage and as many folks have highlighted in this call, we have two businesses, the Network Security business, where you can see the leverage, 42% free cash flow margins are still growing at 26% of billings and 38% or some number out here, the metric is different. But, so, we see that’s where the leverage is. We use that leverage towards a ClaiSecc businesses. In the history of cybersecurity, nobody's build a 735 million ARR business in 2.5 years. So let's just take stock and pause and – and we didn't buy all of it. We bought some products into it but it has been built by a lot of go-to-market capability. If you benchmark that against the CrowdStrike and the Okta to the world, or the Zscaler to the world, you'll see there's a natural evolution, which doesn't happen in two years. So, do we believe there is operating leverage in future years? Yes we do. It becomes a real question, do I want to go hire another 300 sales people, and beat as many deals as CrowdStrike or do I want to hire 100 salespeople and have a lower growth rate, because I don't believe I have the capability on the product side. Palo Alto Networks has never been in a position like today from a product capability perspective. Our products resonate, we rarely get thrown out because our products don't correct. And given the heightened security awareness in the market, we're seeing more traction because, as you guys know, our products are on the margin slightly more expensive or premium than some of the other players in the market. As the security awareness or heightened you know, desire to have a more secure product goes up, they’re better for us because the customer is more willing to be – willing to be tolerant of a price point associated with Palo Alto Networks. So honestly, I think I'm repeating what Deepak said, is that, we don't want to toddle the growth opportunity for us. When I came to Palo Alto, we were growing at the low 20s. Now we just showed you 27 And you know, maybe 28, 29 if you adjust for the annual plan stuff, and that's acceleration and we'd like to see if we can maintain high growth rates going forward and that requires us to invest and look for leverage in future years, we'll do that as a management team.
Operator: Thanks. Next question is from Michael Turits at KeyBanc and after that Patrick Colville at Deutsche Bank.
Michael Turits: Yes, thanks. Nikesh, I think one of the – one of the you know investment features here has been that you're the company, most likely to balance, consolidate security, but to make that transition to software and to the cloud, and you're proving that out, but that said, you’ve also has been doing a great job this year on the product/appliance side up to 3% year-to-date versus what you got to do a flat. So I'm just trying to get a sense for the dynamics of that in the next three calendar quarters. Do you – could we get a boost from refresh of what wasn't done last year and is there any constraint to that, if it's going to happen from supply chain components?
Nikesh Arora: That’s a great question, Michael. I think the supply chain situation changes weekly. And you can see all those machinations play out in the market. As you can imagine like other players in the market, we have some degree of inventory capability vis-à-vis we are expected demand in the upcoming in the shorter duration and a longer duration, all bets are off in the industry, depending on how they bring up more fabs to go print out the chips and get them to us. So the good news is, as I highlighted we move 40% of our firewalling business software. So, if the industry starts to see supply constraint, we are able to solve the customers problem by giving them capability which is software based and we obviously will still have our baseline availability of hardware. We do have the units available for the recent announcements for hardware launch, which we just did, which we can talk about in a second. But again, I know we've talked about this Michael and we keep going back and forth on this is that, I honestly look at the overall capability of the firewalling capability and as much as I like product. I also like the idea of having more or less and less reliance on hardware because I promise you in a few years from now you're going to tell me, love your business but you still got this hardware hunt and kill requirement every quarter, and then you go punch the ticket and give me hardware. So we're trying to thread the needle with you here, trying to give you a great firewalling goes through to revenue growth side. Keep the cash flow high and still transform our business from hardware to software. But Lee you want to talk about this, firewall?
Lee Klarich: Sure. While we're, you know, transition the business there's still a wonderful business out there for hardware and the two new models that we just announced yesterday are pretty exciting really. We introduced a new high end appliance scales up to 150 gig throughput with all security turned on, 75 gig with full SSL decryption; Just amazing product for the large campus data center environments. And then, at a - for the branch environments, smaller enterprise environments, we announced four new appliances in the 400 series that basically 10x the performance of the previous platforms we had. And one thing is -- I think particularly interesting about how we were bringing these new products to market is, we have all of the leading security capabilities that health networks is known for. But we're bringing them out of price points that are incredibly competitive with even the -- some of the lower cost vendors out there. And so, we're same capability. Same great capabilities leading capabilities. But at super competitive price points, change the dynamic in the hardware space, competitive space.
Nikesh Arora: I can’t get Lee to say – wanted to say, keep saying leading competitors. Yes, we follow on the great security ex-pricing. You can’t do it.
Michael Turits: Okay, fine.
Operator: Last question here from Patrick Colville with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead.
Patrick Colville: Thank you for squeezing me in. I was actually going to ask about new appliances because I think that's a super interesting, but Lee covered it pretty comprehensively there. The questions we’d been getting from investors over the last hour has been about the definition of change on ARR. Do you mind just quantifying what the certain cloud delivered security services, how much is that in 3Q versus 2Q?
Nikesh Arora: Let me get that cracking. When I said that it was deminimus. It's less than $5 million. So just as a kind of like a -- an overall number to be able to work very quickly.
Patrick Colville: Great. Very clear. Thank you so much.
Operator: Great. And that concludes the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you all for joining and asking the questions. We're – I am going to turn it back over to Nikesh for closing remarks.
Nikesh Arora: Hey. I just want to take the opportunity to thank you all for joining our call. I also want to take the opportunity to thank the employees at Palo Alto Networks for all their hard work and dedication to allow us to produce these results. We are here because of what they do. So once again, thank you everyone. And I look forward to seeing you guys in our individual call backs.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-02-23 16:30:00) =====
Karen Fung: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today’s conference call to discuss Palo Alto Networks’ Fiscal Second Quarter 2021 Financial Results. I am Karen Fung, Senior Director of Investor Relations. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed on the Investors Section of our website at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. With me on today's call are Nikesh Arora, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Luis Visoso, our Chief Financial; and Lee Klarich, our Chief Product Officer. This afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our results for the fiscal second quarter ended January 31, 2021. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online on our website. We would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, management will be making forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the impact of COVID-19 and the SolarStorm on our business, our customers, the enterprise in cyber security industry and global economic condition, our expectations related to financial guidance, operating metrics and modeling points for the fiscal third quarter fiscal year 2021 and 2022, our intent to acquire Bridgecrew, our intend to be carbon-neutral by 2030, our expectations regarding our business strategies both in equity structure for the ClaiSec business and the vehicle for employees to invest in such equity, our competitive position and the demand and market opportunity for our products and subscriptions, benefits and timing of new products, features and subscription offerings as well as other financial and operating trends.  These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today. You should not rely on them as representing our views in the future and we undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. For more detailed description of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 19, 2020 and our earnings release posted a few minutes ago on our website and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K.  Also please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. For historical periods, we have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in the supplemental financial information that can be found in the Investors section of our website located at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. And finally, once we have completed our formal remarks, we will be posting them to our Investor Relations website under the Quarterly Results section. We’d also like to inform you that we will be virtually participating in the Morgan Stanley 2021 TMT Conference on March 2. Please also see the Investors section of our website for additional information of our conferences we may be participating in. And with that, I will turn the call over to Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you, Karen. Hello, everyone. I know Walter Pritchard, you are listening in. Enjoy your last earnings call from the other side. Next quarter, Walter will join us at this end as our new Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and M&A Finance. Well, moving on to the quarter. So let me start with SolarStorm, which many of you are describing as one of the most serious and sophisticated cyber attacks in history. The SolarStorm attack highlighted that enterprises need a comprehensive, up-to-date map of their full IT infrastructure environments, including understanding their own networks, as well as external attack surfaces and supply chains. In order for security teams to have an edge over the adverse adversaries, they need to embrace next-generation technologies that leverage AI, machine-learning and automation. To help our customers, we set up a rapid response program and when I say rapid, it was rapid. Our acquisitions of Expanse and Crypsis almost felt pre-assigned. The team swung into action. We updated XDR for all the new threat vectors.  We offered free assessments from our Crypsis team. We also evaluated the attack surfaces from the outside in for Expanse and discovered that there were dozens of affected customers, including major government agencies and large companies, many of which were actively communicating with SolarStorm malware command and controlled infrastructure. So far, we've received over 1,000 assessment requests and have completed over 500. We believe that the SolarStorm attack raises the mid and long-term criticality of the cybersecurity industry as a whole. This will result in more awareness and focus on cybersecurity, which in all candor, is the need of the hour given the complete reliance on technology in these times.  We expect that this attack will be a wakeup call to all enterprises to modernize cybersecurity and will serve as a net incremental tailwind, not just for us, but also for the industry. Before I turn to our fiscal Q2 2021 results, I have an admission to make. Perhaps I was too cautious at the outset of the pandemic. The current sustained performance, resilience of our teams, and execution has been turning more optimistic. We had a great second quarter with strong business momentum as the organization executed across all platforms and strategies. As a result, we beat Q2 guidance and consensus. Here are some highlights. We delivered billings of $1.2 billion, up 22% year-over-year with strong growth across the board.  Let me give you some additional context. Due to COVID, we have provided billing plans to a select number of impacted customers. When adjusting for these billing [Indiscernible] within the reported 22% year-over-year growth. This trend has been in place and has been growing over the last few quarters.  Consequently, our revenue growth is higher than billings growth and accelerated to 25%, reaching $1 billion for the first time ever. Yes. Our first billion dollar revenue quarter with accelerating revenue growth. The strength has been across the board. And as we continue down the path of more and more of a subscription-based model, the revenue predictability will continue to rise. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.55, up $0.36 from last year. DPS expansion was driven by revenue growth and operating expense leverage. While there continues to be beneficial impacts due to lower travel due to COVID, we do continue to hire resources to support our product expansion, which we expect to continue. Free cash flow margin for the quarter was 32.7%. And in the first half of fiscal-year 2021, we generated $838 million of free cash at a margin of 42.7%. We still expect free cash flow to normalize for the year round our full year guidance due to some seasonality we see in the second half.  Last quarter, we started the dialogue around network security and cloud and AI and shared the P&L for both businesses. We received great feedback on the additional transparency and we want to continue to drive more transparency to unlock shareholder value. Let's first take a deep dive into Network Security business, which we are calling NetSec. Our NetSec business is undergoing a transformation towards software and SaaS, making it more predictable and sustainable.  Starting with our hardware firewall business and associated services. Rather than building solutions only as hardware, we have chosen to offer security services and software subscriptions. Over the last two years, we have doubled our security subscriptions from four to eight with the introduction of DNS, SD-WAN, IoT, and DLP.  We are seeing great progress with DNS, which has acquired nearly 5,000 customers since launch. These new subscriptions, along with the introduction of higher tier of support, platinum support have allowed us to increase our next-generation firewall support and security subscription revenue [Technical Difficulty].  As you can see, we have sustained a 15% CAGR in hardware, subs and support and our hardware contribution has gone from 39% to 29% in that time. To continue to drive software growth, we have made these subscriptions available across all form factors, Firewall FLEX and Prisma Access 2.0. We just recently completed the process of making it available on our product Prisma Access 2.0, which is our firewall in the cloud.  Turning to our software firewalls. We continue to see a transformation to software form factors. With the introduction of advanced features, cloud-native integrations and the development of the industry's first containerized next-generation firewall, we continue to see product market fit.  As a result, VM and CNCs grow over 60% in the first half of FY 2021. We recently launched Firewall FLEX, another industry first, a unique approach in how we offer virtual firewalls in CN-Series to increase customer flexibility and enable a consumption model to drive additional growth. This new flexible consumption model features credit-based licensing that lets you consume VM and CNC's firewalls, choose the number of CPUs needed, and add any or all of our eight security subscriptions, which is previously limited to five.  We believe that by providing greater flexibility to our customers, we will continue to drive growth and achieve greater subscription attach rates.  To highlight how our software firewalls are transforming, how customers approach security, we closed a deal with a leading telecommunications company to secure their 5G network. The transition to 5G is driving a number of very important architectural changes, including a highly distributed design, containers as a foundation and security for enterprise customers as a critical business driver. We were first to deliver enterprise and service provider clouds, 5G and container security. In doing so, we empower our customers to provide a secure 5G service to their customers and provide managed security offerings to their enterprise end customers.  Now let's talk about Prisma Access, when COVID dramatically changed how work gets done at companies across industries around the world, the needs for securing a remote workforce have also changed. No longer is it sufficient to have partial access to applications or what is sometimes called good enough security.  Overnight, connectivity to every application was needed, security became business-critical and user experience determined the difference between maintaining productivity or falling behind. Even before COVID accelerated this change, we were already working on turning Prisma Access into an industry-leading solution for enabling a secure remote workforce.  What initially started as a GlobalProtect cloud service started to transform in 2019 with the launch of Prisma Access. In the last year-and-a-half, we've built out industry-leading capabilities. In that timeframe, Prisma Access has gone from less than 150 customers to now nearly a 1,000 customers and 30% of the Fortune 100.  Last week, we announced Prisma Access 2.0, the biggest update since introducing this service. Prisma Access is a full security platform, it’s the cloud with machine-learning-based security, preventing unknown threats in-line and line speed, a full firewall delivered as a service and includes features like Zero Trust Network Access, Secure Web Gateway, CASB, DLP, and IoT security. Prisma Access secures both web and non-web apps. As an example, conventional web security approach to cloud-delivered security misses 53% of all remote workforce threats that ride over non-web apps. Those threats cannot be ignored and unlike alternate solutions in the market we prevent them with Prisma Access. We have completely reimagined the way customers manage Prisma Access with an entirely new cloud-based UI that delivers better security outcomes through build and security assessments. The new digital experience management add-on provides native end-to-end visibility and insights for SASE and the ability to self-heal when digital experiences problems occur.  Prisma Access is built on a low-latency and highly scalable infrastructure with Google Cloud as backlog. Lastly, Prisma Access, along with the Prisma SD-WAN, our rebranded product from CloudGenix, delivers a complete SASE offering. With the recent addition of CloudBlades, we now have a SASE platform, which allows for an API platform for seamless third-party service integration.  Prisma Access securely enables access to all applications, delivers best-in-class security to meet enterprise security needs without compromise, and enables a user experience that maintains or even improves worker productivity.  In Q2, we closed an eight-figure deal with a leading technology company with over 100,000 employees with businesses in over 100 countries, as part of their digital transformation, the company was launching a new remote work initiative. In order to realize their vision, they needed a secure and optimized network that will support a flexible remote work environment. Palo Alto Networks was ultimately chosen ahead of several of our security peers as the customer saw us as the only vendor that was offering a true SASE solution.  Ultimately, Prisma Access was a key product given their goal to rapidly enable remote work, but the customer also purchased next-generation firewalls, VM Series firewalls, enhanced their store capabilities through Cortex XDR and XSOAR. This was definitely a cross-platform deal to be proud of and we look forward to a great partnership with the customer going forward.  Lastly, several of you have asked in the past about a software transition and the associated economics. While the first phase of VM and Prisma Access purchases have mostly been incremental use cases, we put together a few key examples on what we see in the market when a customer does choose to replace a hardware-based security solution with software and SaaS.  Our use cases are VMs replace hardware firewalls, like this example of a local retail store running software firewalls and third-party hardware, along with other software applications. We estimate that the five-year revenue of this VMC's deal is roughly equal with that of deals deploying a separate physical next-generation firewall.  For use cases, our Prisma Access replaces hardware firewalls. We took a typical branch office use case and estimated the five-year revenue of a Prisma Access deal is two-times larger than a next-generation firewall deal. From a customer perspective, we estimate that the customer's total cost of ownership is generally reduced as they move to virtual and cloud-delivered form factors. As you know, Prisma Access is only a year old. So our gross margins aren't as favorable as hardware, but we expect them to improve over time.  Now moving over and looking at our cloud and AI business. We started this call by discussing SolarStorm, but didn't talk about our own experience with an attempted SolarStorm attack. Back in December, we shared with the broader security community that Cortex XDR instantly blocked a SolarStorm attempt on Palo Alto Networks. Thanks to its behavioral threat protection capability.  We continue to be bullish around the rapid pace of innovation that is going into our Cortex XDR product. In fact, Cortex XDR was recently recognized by AV Comparatives as the strategic leader in their latest endpoint prevention and response evaluation, while still delivering lower total cost of ownership than several endpoint security peers.  Importantly, last month, Cortex XDR and Data Lake achieved FedRAMP moderate authorization, which should make it a key piece of technology in the Federal space. As further validation of our vision, we see more and more players in the endpoint security space rushing to jump on the XDR wave that we have established two years ago.  Overall, we continue to see the Cortex portfolio developing into the industry's first proactive security platform and we see penetration into the largest companies continue to grow. 35% of our Global 2000 and 66% of the Fortune 100 are now Cortex customers indicating that automation advanced threat detection are top of mind for these customers.  In Q2, we closed deals with a retailer. The company chose Cortex XDR to increase visibility control, and protection of the endpoints by adopting a more complete solution with XDR, rather than using EDR. With Cortex XDR support for mobile, the customer is also able to easily extend Cortex XDR to additional devices leveraged on-site of their stores identify their endpoint security policy across their entire enterprise.  We then expanded the conversation to address their SOC's operational challenges by demonstrating how Cortex XSOAR's out-of-the-box preprocessing rules and alert deduping could reduce their alert volumes dramatically. With the combination of enhanced visibility, protection and control with an entire endpoint estate, coupled with automating and orchestrating the - volume the Cortex platform will have an immediate impact on this new customer. Switching to Prisma Cloud, Prisma Cloud is building the most comprehensive and best-of-breed cloud-native security platform and we continue to see strong customer interest. Prisma Cloud has now acquired over 2,000 customers with 74% of the Fortune 100 and secures 2.5 billion cloud released workloads. We also continue to see an increase in Prisma Cloud customers who are using both cloud security posture management and cloud workload protection for containers and service with applications now at 50%. Additionally, last month, Prisma Cloud also achieved FedRAMP moderate authorization along with Cortex XDR and Data Lake, as we said.  This allows U.S. government customers to leverage our visibility, compliance and governance capabilities for securing multi-cloud and gov cloud deployments. The last deal I'd like to highlight is a largest Prisma Cloud deal that we've ever closed, an eight-figure deal with a leading SaaS company. Like many in the industry, they are moving from a private cloud environment to a public cloud. As part of this shift, they are moving to a containerized application architecture.  The customer had unique scalability, availability and vulnerability requirements for securing their containers across AWS, GCP, and Azure Clouds. The maturity, the superior vulnerability detection of the container security capabilities and the scalability of runtime protection of Prisma Cloud help convince the customer to choose Prisma Cloud as their container security platform of choice.  Last week, we announced our intent to acquire Bridgecrew, an early pioneer of security for the development community. The next big challenge we are taking on in cloud security is what is known as shiftless security. Developers are playing an increasingly important role in cloud security, both in terms of what products are used and how they are operationalized. Today, a single error in development can be replicated hundreds of times over resulting in thousands of security alerts to be faked. This drags down productivity and increases the likelihood of security issues and production applications. These issues upfront where they are easy and quick to fix. It's a win for developers and a win for security. Bridgecrew recognized the need for shiftless security and pioneered an approach to infrastructure as code designed for developers. To engage the developer community, they released an open-source product called Checkov that was downloaded over a million times in the last year and a paid for product gaining early traction.  When we bring network security and cloud together, we see tremendous synergies to power the platform of Palo Alto Networks. When looking at our Global 2000 customers, we see that these customers are increasingly adopting Strata, Prisma and Cortex, 68% of our Global 2000 customers have purchased more than one platform, up from 62% a year ago and 56% two years ago.  Given the momentum that we are seeing, we are raising guidance for the full fiscal year. For fiscal 2021 and at the midpoint of guide, we expect total revenue growth of 22%, up 200 basis points from our prior guide. Total billings was at 20%, up 100 basis points from our prior guide, slightly lower than our revenue raised due to the impact of billings plans as we discussed earlier. We continue to expect next-generation security ARR at $1.15 billion, up 77% year-over-year. Product revenue is flat year-over-year, unchanged from our prior guidance. Lastly, non-GAAP operating margin of 50 basis points and adjusted free cash flow of 29% unchanged from our prior guidance as we continue to invest to capture the opportunities in the market.  Now let's review our fiscal year projections for NetSec and ClaiSec. Overall, we are confirming our ClaiSec projections while raising NetSec billings by 100 basis points and revenue by 200 basis points given the strong performance of SASE and VMCs.  Moving on to adjusted free cash flows. We expect Network Security will deliver a free cash flow margin of 41% in FY 2021, up from 38% in FY 2020. We expect cloud and AI free cash flow margin of negative 43% in FY 2021, an improve from negative – improvement from negative 59% in 2020.  As mentioned last quarter, for the next few years, we expect cloud and AI to achieve gross operating and free cash flow margins in line with industry benchmarks as we gain scale and our customer base matures and becomes more efficient. As you can see, we have been able to dig deeper and align our resources further with our business areas of ClaiSec and NetSec. And as I noted earlier, there are tremendous synergies in the power of the platform at Palo Alto Networks. At the same time, we've also been increasing our focus on our software transformation and hardware firewalls, while building a new cloud and AI business. To continue this transformation and strengthen our financial profile, we feel that we can create more focus by aligning the teams around NetSec and ClaiSec.  So we are officially going from three speed both on aligning our efforts around these two business areas with six focused efforts as speedboats in our next fiscal year. NetSec, we are focused on driving this transformation from harder software and delivering a best-of-breed hardware solution as required. As you saw, this transformation is actually financially neutral to net positive for us and always beneficial to our customers.  The speedboat sales will be firewalls including virtual firewalls, SASE in our growing security subscriptions. ClaiSec, the business area where we drive cloud security and our Cortex efforts have proven that with focus and an opportunistic, organic, and inorganic strategy, we can create an industry-leading set of solutions for cloud security and solutions like XSOAR and XDR driven by AI and ML. Here, we need continued investment for us to drive customer scale and for us to continue to invest in both continued product development and customer adoption. We'll do so by continuing our focus on Cortex, Prisma Cloud and Palo Alto Networks' incident response services, a newly formed team combining Crypsis' Unit 42, which Wendi Whitmore has joined to help lead.  We are also excited to announce that with the Board's consent, we are finalizing the filing needed for an equity structure for the ClaiSec business. Our goal is to make sure the value of the ClaiSec business is more transparent. In addition, the Board approved the development of a vehicle for employees to invest in such ClaiSec equity, strengthening the alignment of shareholders and the interest of employees regarding the success of our ClaiSec business.  Lastly, I am also proud to say that Palo Alto Networks recently made a commitment to address climate change, which Luis will go over in more detail around how we will be carbon-neutral by 2030.  With that, let me turn the call over to Luis.
Luis Visoso : Thank you, Nikesh. Climate change is an existential threat and at Palo Alto Networks, we are all-in to do our part to address this crisis. We have done some important work up to this point including LED certifications, recycling, and community involvement. We plan to step up our efforts and contribute even more. I am proud of our commitment to be carbon-neutral by 2030. We have already activated renewable energy and high-quality carbon-offset strategies. We will be reducing our emissions aligned to science-based targets and we will work across our value chain to have a lasting impact and advocate stewardship. The Paris Agreement calls on all of us to limit global warming below two degrees Celsius by 2050. We plan to reach our commitments by 2030. We will keep you informed of progress along the way.  We will continue to participate in the carbon disclosure project and start sharing plans and progress – and progress using protocols set by the task force on climate-related financial disclosures. During the World Economic Forum's Davos agenda last month, we committed to increase transparency by reporting on the International Business Council’s stakeholders, capitalism metrics over time. It will take creativity, collaboration, and visionary thinking to protect the planet, and we are up for the challenge. We call on others to join us, consider aligning to the Paris Agreement and make your commitment to do your part.  Now turning on – turning to our financials, as Nikesh indicated, we had a great second quarter and we continue to deliver winning innovation and adding new customers at a fast pace. This strength gives us confidence to raise our guidance for the year.  I would like to start with our performance in firewall as a platform or FwaaP, which had a great quarter as we continue to grow faster than the market. FwaaP billings grew 21% in Q2, as we continue to transition from hardware to software and SaaS form factors. As you can see, FwaaP billings declined 3% in Q2 2020 and over the last four quarters, we've been able to drive sustained execution and growth in this area to 21% in Q2 2021.  Next-Generation Security or NGS continues to expand and now represents a quarter of our total billings at $309 million, growing 59% year-over-year. In Q2, we added over $120 million in new NGS ARR, reaching $840 million. Let me remind you, at our last Analyst Day in September of 2019, NGS was a gleam in our eye and we called for $1.75 billion in billings by 2022. We are on track to beat those numbers.  In Q2, total revenue grew 25% to $1.0 billion. Looking at growth by geography, the Americas grew 27%, EMEA grew 24%, and APAC grew 14%. Q2 product revenue of $255 million increased 3%, compared to the prior year. Q2 subscription revenue of $462 million increased 35%. Support revenue of $300 million increased 32%. In total, subscription and support revenue of $762 million increased 34% and accounted for 75% of total revenue. Excluding revenue from Crypsis and Expanse, subscription and support revenue increased 31%.  Turning to billings, Q2 total billings of $1.2 billion net of acquired deferred revenue increased 22%. Strength was broad based as we continue to see strong execution across the company. The dollar-weighted contract duration for new subscriptions and support billings in the quarter was slightly down year over year but remained at approximately three years. For the first half of fiscal 2021, billings of $2.3 billion increased 21% year-over-year. Product billings were $495 million, up 3% and accounted for 22% of total billings. Subscription billings were $1.2 billion, up 23%. Support billings were $733 million, up 34%.  Total deferred revenue at the end of Q2 was $4.2 billion, an increase of 30% year-over-year. Remaining performance obligation or RPO was $4.6 billion, an increase of 41% year-over-year. In addition to adding approximately 2,400 new customers in the quarter, we continue to increase our wallet share of existing customers. Our top 25 customers, all of whom made a purchase this quarter, spent a minimum of $59 million in lifetime value through the end of fiscal Q2 2021, a 27% increase over the $46 million in the comparable prior year period.  Q2 gross margin was 75.3%, which was down 110 basis points compared to last year, mainly driven by a higher mix of our NGS products, which are less mature. Q2 operating margin was 19.8%, an increase of 190 basis points year-over-year. The operating margin expansion is driven by operating expense leverage behind operational efficiencies, lower travel and event expenses due to COVID, which more than offset the incremental investment in headcount. We ended the second quarter with 9,038 employees, including 176 from Expanse at the close of the acquisition. On a GAAP basis, for the second quarter, net loss increased to $142 million or $1.48 per basic and diluted share.  Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter increased 28% to $154 million or $1.55 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for Q2 was 22%. Turning to cash flow and balance sheet items. We finished January with cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $4 billion. On December 4, 2020, our Board of Directors authorized an increase to our share repurchase program and extended the expiration date to December 31, 2021. As of January 31, 2021, $1 billion remained available for repurchases. Q2 cash flow from operations of $365 million increased by 19% year over year. Free cash flow was $332 million, up 29% at a margin of 32.7%. DSO was 60 days, an increase of three days from the prior-year period.  Turning now to guidance and modeling points. For the third quarter of 2021, we expect billings to be in the range of $1.22 to $1.24 billion, an increase of 20% to 22% year-over-year. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.06 billion, an increase of 21% to 22% year-over-year.  We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.27 to $1.29, which incorporates net expenses related to the proposed acquisition of Bridgecrew using 100 million to 102 million shares.  Additionally, I'd like to provide some modeling points. We expect our Q3 non-GAAP effective tax rate to remain at 22%. CapEx in Q3 will be approximately $30 million to $35 million. As Nikesh reviewed earlier, for the full fiscal year, we are again raising our guidance across most metrics. We expect billings to be in the range of $5.13 billion to $5.18 billion, an increase of 19% to 20% year-over-year. We expect next-generation security ARR to be approximately $1.15 billion, an increase of 77% year-over-year. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.15 billion to $4.20 billion, an increase of 22% to 23% year-over-year. We expect product revenue to be flat year-over-year. We expect operating margins to improve by 50 basis points year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $5.80 to $5.90, which incorporates net expenses related to the proposed acquisition of Bridgecrew using 99 million to 101 million shares. Regarding free cash flow for the full year, we expect an adjusted free cash flow margin of approximately 29%.  With that, I'd like to open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. 
Keith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and very nice quarter. I was hoping to dig in a little bit into SolarStorm and if you could talk to us about any impacts that you saw in this quarter and more expansively, how do you expect the impacts of that event to play out as we go through the year? Is there more on the comment? And what parts of the product portfolio do you think are going to get most impacted by that event?
Nikesh Arora: Hey, Keith. Thanks. Look, as we said in the call, we launched a series of initiatives to make sure that our customers are protected vis-à-vis SolarStorm. That was a sustained attack, which was planned or a series of quarters, if not years. And what we realized that once you get in the supply chain and start being able to respond to 18,000 customers, the impact is going to be far reaching.  What's happened is people were first reacting to that and starting to make sure on an emergency basis, there is nothing in their infrastructure, which is already infected and they have not effectively been compromised. Now with that slowly and steadily behind us, what's happening and we are noticing people are doing cybersecurity assessment. Every board is out there saying, take a look at what we've got, make sure that is - there is no breaches. Make sure that we won't be breached.  The first question was, are we breached? The answer was, no, we are fine. Somebody think, wait a minute. Could we have been breached, if we had SolarStorm? The answer is, yes. So what we are noticing is there not going a rethinking of the cybersecurity architecture. In that context, our Crypsis acquisition was very helpful, because that's where we had the field force to be able to go out and address these situations, which kind of sort of came to light and I don't know if you know Wendi Whitmore, PAN-IBM X-FORCE until now and she is going to come join us. She has had a stint at CrowdStrike and FireEye and Mandiant as well. So she's going to come drive that effort even more aggressively for us. We also saw that in our own case, XDR protected us, which again becomes an important distinction for us, because it was a zero day attack and we found it because of behavior anomalies that were happening on the endpoint, which is effectively a key feature of XDR. So we are seeing a lot more conversations around that.  And Expanse's ability to be able to look at what assets are exposed to the outside which, in this case with SolarStorm servers, we also used sort of an Expanse and out and looked and saw that there were hundreds of customers with open SolarStorm servers sitting on their network. So it's generally been useful for us in the XDR part, the XSOAR part, the Crypsis part, but more importantly, from a board focus on cybersecurity hygiene is been critical.
Keith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you. 
Nikesh Arora: Thanks. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Philip Winslow of Wells Fargo. 
Philip Winslow : Great. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on another fabulous quarter. Really want to focus in on Prisma Cloud and the VM and CN-Series. Obviously, you saw massive uptick in the number of workloads that you protect in the cloud with Prisma Cloud and then obviously a massive uptake year-over-year, I think, more than four x in terms of the number of firewall software customers. So I guess, kind of two related questions on here. First, Nikesh, why are you hearing that customers are choosing your Prisma Cloud obviously aside from the largest deal in that product's history this quarter. And then the follow-up to that, when you think about Prisma Cloud, plus the success you are seeing in the VM and CN-Series, are those two combined kind of changing the customer dialogue that you are having as you are seeing these customers see - accelerate their shift to cloud?
Nikesh Arora: Yes, Phil. Thank you. Look, if you look at it, if you abstract yourself, we grew our firewall as a platform 21%. Right? And we've been talking about trying to get that to the 15% range. You can see all that growth has come from firewall in the cloud, i.e., Prisma Access 2.0, and has come from our VM and CN-Series firewalls. And it's kind of – it’s hard to understand if you are not sitting with the customer. We have seen a few deals flip from hardware to software in the last week. Literally, customers aim to buy a bunch of hardware and said, wait, hold on. You guys launched this Firewall FLEX, why don't we just go into this flexible credit program where we can spin-up as many firewalls we want and spin them down if you don't need them and they can carry those credits to the cloud.  So what - I think what is something very important to understand, we are going through a hardware-to-cloud transition now in the industry. It does not mean as the demise of the hardware industry. It just means that the incremental shift is beginning to happen. It's gathering momentum. You can't keep posting tens of billions of dollars on billings for AWS, GCP and Azure and not see a decline in datacenter over time. It's going to happen. So if you look past the quarters and in that transition, it becomes very important, how are you going to protect yourself in the future? So we are beginning to see customers go from hardware to software and honestly, we are encouraging it to the extent the customer wants our opinion. We have the ability to sell the hardware, the best in the industry and the ability to sell them software firewalls, the ability to sell them Prisma Access 2.0 in the cloud.  We are sitting now with them and saying, you pick the best architecture. You want we'll service it. You ask us, we'd rather you went down the software route. And that's when all of you guys start asking us, wait a minute if you go to software, do you lose money, well, so we put up a slide saying, look, we don't lose money.  We make more money. We don’t say that not that loudly because that's not a good thing to say loudly, it’s a better security solution for the customer, reduced total cost of ownership, but we are seeing that transition. And I think that's the most important part of the story and as we highlighted, we did a big deal in the telecom space, where certainly, security matters in 5G.  Right? Because, in no offense, when you and I walk around with our iPhones and Android devices, you got malware on them, tough luck buddy. But if you are a car driving down the highway, and that can be infected with malware, that's a problem. So the 5G enterprise networks have to be secure. All 5G networks are being built in the cloud.
Philip Winslow : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. 
Nikesh Arora: Thanks, Phil. 
Operator: The next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. 
Sterling Auty : Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. So, in the context of the guidance increase, I did noticed that the next-generation security ARR is staying the same despite what looks like good results in the quarter. Was there any pull-forward or what additional commentary can you give us around that NGS ARR outlook for the year?
Nikesh Arora: Honestly, there is no hidden meaning and there we are not trying to tweak it in such a way that, look, we've seen strength in cloud firewall. We've seen phenomenal strength in Prisma Access. I have to tell you that this pandemic has forced the network conversation about how do I make sure Sterling can access every application at home, not just the ones that I let him access.  It's gone from a, it's good to have remote access, you have to have remote access and then the security and certainly start paying attention to network architecture. And then, and Lee and his team have delivered this phenomenal next upgrade where we can look at both web-based non-web-based apps. So we are seeing phenomenal success. So there is no tempering of our expectation and ambition on NGS. It's just how the math works right now.
Sterling Auty : That makes sense. Thank you. 
Operator: Next question comes from Saket Kalia of Barclays. 
Saket Kalia : Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my question here guys. Nikesh, maybe for you, you touched on this in your prepared comments. Can you talk about the cloud and AI equity structure? What's the reason for setting up that structure now? And how is it going to work mechanically?
Nikesh Arora: So, well, Saket, two-and-a-half years ago, when I came here, we talked about building a cloud security business and we talked about building an AI/ML-based business. Last quarter, we started showing you the two pieces of NetSec and ClaiSec. You've seen that we are aspiring against $735 million of ARR in cloud AI security.  We also shared our left-hand side, our Network Security business actually has phenomenal cash flow margin, 38% going to 41%. So that's a cash-generative part of our business whilst we go through a hardware-to-software transformation.  On the right-hand side, we are competing with behemoths out there today, like the CrowdStrikes of the world and in the XDR space and a bunch of start-ups in the cloud space. That's an area for investment. We think that the market inherently values both those business fundamentally differently. It values the network security business and cash flow. It values the cloud AI business and ARR. So we want to be able to create the opportunity for the market to value our businesses differently to create more transparency for the shareholders and it also allows us to keep investing in the cloud AI business and in the interest of driving more ARR. So what we've done is, as you saw, we've separated our financials, showed you both NetSec and ClaiSec. Luis and team have worked hard to get them audited and make sure that we can keep reporting them on a more regular basis going into next fiscal year and we are looking at various equity structures that allow us to create incentive plans as well as potentially in the future, monetize the ClaiSec business for a different set of investors compared to the Palo Alto investor.
Operator: Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani of UBS. 
Fatima Boolani : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. My question is around the firewall as a platform business and the metrics there. Appreciate that deals sort of changed flavor in the 11th hour, to your point, Nikesh. So, what are some of the core assumptions we should leave with around the installed base refresh opportunity, as well as the R&D pipelines for hardware and appliance refreshes within the product portfolio on the Strata side?
Nikesh Arora: Well, Lee, do you want to talk about the hardware refresh plans? All I am saying is, that we are not taking our pedal off the metal. We are going aggressively trying to continue to build the next generation of hardware and focus on refresh. I will tell you, in absolute dollars, we still sell the largest number of hardware firewalls in the industry. We get lost some percentages. It doesn't matter if other vendors are out there generating 18% growth. We still sell more absolute dollars of product in a quarter than anybody else.  But Lee, can you talk about the hardware?
Lee Klarich: Yes. We are always working on the next generation of hardware since the beginning of the company until now and we have some amazing new platforms coming. I won't tell you too much until they are out, but we are always working on that, really exciting stuff there. The software side as well with PanOS and new security capabilities, and another set of amazing things we are working on.  One thing I'll point out in that though is the leverage we get across hardware, software and cloud-delivered. Part of what really resonates with our customers is not that they get two, pick which one they use from us, but their ability to actually use hardware where they need hardware, software form factors when they need software, cloud-delivered where they need that, with a set of consistent security capabilities, easy to manage and operationalize, that's something that only we can deliver to our customers.
Fatima Boolani : Thank you. 
Operator: The next question comes from Brian Essex of Goldman Sachs. 
Brian Essex : All right. Great. Hi, thank you. Thank you for taking the question. I was wondering, Nikesh, if you could dig into a little bit Firewall FLEX and your credit-based licensing model for next-gen firewall. What was the timing of that roll out? How long has it been in market and how much adoption is that in terms of the way it's impacting your model?
Nikesh Arora: I'll give you the preface of it and then Lee can jump in and give you the details. But look, we hadn't refreshed our VM pricing policy, it was set up more like a hardware business, where you had to tell us which particular model of software you wanted and you were basically stuck to that model. And if you think about software deployment, it's a key. I can give you a key with more capacity or a key with lower capacity.  So, we just felt that we were being too pedantic in our approach in selling software in a very hardware-centric model, where you can only buy five subscriptions out of eight. So we worked hard over the last 18 months to get this all done into a new credit-based model where you can right size your requirements. So you can spin them up and spin them down. But if I say everything then Lee doesn't get to say much. So Lee, explain the – he often looks at me saying, why do you say you are going to help answer the second half and wait when you don't stop? So, Lee, I'll stop.
Lee Klarich: Yes. In my defense, the - like when we came up with the model that was sort of, I call it, the normal model, and that's what others were doing. I am actually – and our customers are very excited about this new Firewall FLEX model, because it is the first of its kind in the industry, giving our customers the flexibilities, and Nikesh was saying to choose how many CPUs do they need?  What subscriptions do they want? Where they want to deploy it. Cloud, on-prem, et cetera, that level of flexibility and to do in a credit model where each individual deployment can actually be different. So we've actually – it's one of those unique cases where we've given the customer a lot more flexibility and options yet made it simpler at the same time.  The last piece that I addressed was in the old model, it was getting too cumbersome on how to offer all the different security subscriptions. This model allowed us to easily scale up to all of the current security subs, plus any future subscriptions we come out with.
Nikesh Arora: How long it’s been working with this?
Lee Klarich: Sorry. We just launched the beginning of February. So, it's only been out for a few weeks. We are already having customers respond incredibly positive to it.
Brian Essex : All right. Very helpful. Thank you. 
Nikesh Arora: Thanks, Brian. 
Operator: Next question comes from Gray Powell of BTIG. 
Gray Powell : Hey, great. Thanks. Can you guys hear me okay? 
Nikesh Arora: Yes. 
Gray Powell : All right. Congratulations on the good numbers. So, yes, last week, you all announced cloud secure gateway features in Prisma Access. How important is that functionality to your customer base and do you think it creates an opportunity to gain incremental share from legacy players like Symantec or even some of the higher growth companies like Zscaler?
Nikesh Arora: Well, sorry. Okay. Now he changed his definition of legacy. Never mind. Sorry, I was just kidding. We get punchy after too much coffee on our earnings call day. So, Lee, go ahead. This one is yours.
Lee Klarich: Look, as I think all of you have seen or heard from us before, we used to set up this sort of either or approach, either it was next-gen firewall approach to security or it's a proxy approach and you've heard us talk a lot about the challenges associated with the proxy approach. Limited application support, some of the challenges with applications, and breakage and performance, but at the same time, we recognized is, there are certain use cases out there where there is a right way to do it.  And it is a -- could be very complementary to what we do from a next-gen firewall perspective. And so with this release, we basically integrated that into Prisma Access, such that we can now give our customers the ultimate of flexibility on how they connect to the cloud through both the secure web gateway model, plus our next-gen firewall natively integrate it and provide all the great security capabilities we have.
Nikesh Arora: So I think, Gray, what Lee is saying is, we changed near looks religion on proxies. Now we also support proxies as part of our product and we also support the app-based approach. So now you can go after web-based apps and non-web-based apps and you said 53% of your breaches come from non-web based apps, and proxies are used less in non-web based apps. But we cover both opportunities by doing it the proxy way or the non-proxy way.
Gray Powell : Got it. Okay. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Next question comes from Patrick Colville of Deutsche Bank. 
Patrick Colville : Hey there. Thank you for taking my question. I appreciate it. Just want to ask about Bridgecrew. So, is that deployed on-prem in the cloud? Who buys it? Is it the kind of developer buying it with the kind of credit card type payment model? Or just help us understand that product better, please.
Nikesh Arora: Yes, look, again, I’ll one, two, punch here. But we’ve been making bets for the last two-and-a-half years where the security is, in the cloud space especially. Went from workloads, went to containers, went to micro-segmentation, went to DLP, went to IAM. And what we come to the realization in what's happening is there is a bunch of – so what happens is you do, you build an application with a developer, you give it to your IT team and they deploy it and say, hey, you silly guy, you've got a bunch of security bugs and go fix it, the guy says, so what's my security bugs. Why didn't you tell me before?  They started going to open source and trying to find security monitoring software to see, let me just make sure, I don't build stuff with security bugs in it. So what happens is what Bridgecrew has is such a – it's a open source, free, no credit card needed, piece of software just starts tracking the security bugs in your development side, CICD side.  So it tells the developer, you are making a mistake, fix it. Now what happens is you fix it then you give it to the guy in security. The guy says, wait, you still have bugs. So wait a minute. I checked it. So what we've done is, we bought Bridgecrew. We'll take the open source tools that they have.  We'll look at the policies there. We'll map them with the policies in the enterprise side to make sure that if you need to find data, if they are going to check for it in real-time and in production, you get to check for it for free as a developer. So, there is 26 million developers developing, they are similar security professionals.  If you can get 26 million people to start checking it while they are building the application, building the software, then it's consistent with what they are going to be checked out in the enterprise side. That's the muscle we didn't have. That's a DevOps muscle. Most DevOps companies don't have security muscle. We have security muscle, we don't have DevOps muscle. We just bought DevOps muscle.
Patrick Colville : Okay. And so the monetization is, it’s via… 
Nikesh Arora: So, what happened is, they have an enterprise version of the free software to giveaway to developers. It's kind of like Slack. It's kind of like Dropbox. If a lot of people started using it, you want that to be in the enterprise section, because you don't want it being checked against a different product set of policies. We are going to merge that enterprise capability in Prisma Cloud, because we already checked it. And we will say, whatever your developers check for free is what we are going to check in production, they are consistent. So, if they didn't find a bug when they were writing the code, unlike to find it when we are running it.
Patrick Colville : Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Next question comes from Tal Liani of BOA. 
Tal Liani: Hi, guys. I want to go back and ask about the legacy or the hardware piece. I am trying to understand the competitive landscape now and trying to understand the customers' reaction to the fact that market is migrating somewhere else. Are there still competitive replacements? Or is this a case where customers just keep the status quo, whatever they have today, because if they take a decision, it's going to be a decision to migrate out of hardware into a more modern solution?  So, I am trying to understand the dynamics, the underlying dynamics in the market and from it to understand what's the competitive landscape like?
Nikesh Arora: Yes, Tal. Thanks for the question. Look, what's going to happen in my version of the world is, you will still have 40% to 50% of the customers who will still stick to a datacenter and a hardware-based strategy. I think what the markets are not fully embraced and understood is when you move to cloud, the cloud can be expensive. And many companies will say, wait a minute. I don't need to do all the stuff in the cloud. I am going to still keep a datacenter and do some of the less expensive stuff here, why do I want to take everything and make it real-time bleeding edge in the cloud. So you are going to end up in a hybrid world, where people are going to maintain datacenters and maintain the cloud. So, I don't think every customer in the world is moving to the cloud, but I think that on the margin, yes, you are seeing a bigger shift to cloud than you are people sticking out to. So with that fact in mind, we do see competitive replacements when customers have end-of-life for existing hardware installs, right?  They are sitting there and saying, I am coming to end of life for legacy vendor A, B, C, D or E. Should I go replace this with new versions of legacy A, B, or C? Or should I look at a new network architecture, which allows me flexibility of having hardware and software to more access. So the example we gave, we did a $20 million deal with a customer who built – who bought Prisma Access for half of their employees, who bought hardware firewalls for the datacenters and who bought virtual firewalls for their cloud and they make sure they are all consistent.  So, we do see customers end of life in legacy hardware, which is dead ended, which doesn't have a software form factor or a firewall in the cloud capability and we do see them transitioning to a hardware and software model. So it's not zero sum. It's not either or. It sometimes ends up being this and that.
Tal Liani: Got it. Thank you. 
Operator: Next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. 
Brent Thill : Thanks. Nikesh, there is a lot of questions from investors about this proposed equity structure and the timing and what this means. I am curious if you could just double click on what you think this looks like and why are you doing this right now?
Nikesh Arora: Thanks for the question. Look, it's not – first of all, we have spent the last six to eight months preparing for the financials visibility or transparency of ClaiSec and NetSec. It requires a lot of work on our accounting side, lots of rules to make sure how we do transfer pricing between the entities. How do we leverage our common sales force from Palo Alto Network.  So, and again, we are not doing anything yet. All we'd have is we presented to the Board, and they have agreed that this is an area for us to go ahead and work further on, which means we are looking at seeing how can we make the ClaiSec equity more transparent if we believe the market value is that differently than the Palo Alto equity.  Now the market could say, this is great, we just love your Palo Alto equity and we will help it achieve all the price targets some of the more enthusiastic and optimistic ones you have. In which case, we may not have to do anything. If not, we may actually go take a look at the ClaiSec equity and see how do we create more transparency, because fundamentally, if you look at it, you've got one business and generating $1.5 billion in free cash flow, which is fantastic.  We like it, 38% margin now gone to 41% whilst we are going through hardware-software transition. On the other hand, we have a $735 million ARR business growing at 77%. That business has negative cash flows and the market looks them together and values us one certain way, maybe the market will value it differently if we look at it differently.  So we are just exploring the opportunity of being able to make that value more transparent. We are not going to change the operating structure of the company. We are going to still run it as one company with two basically agile business units, if that makes sense.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Turits of KeyBanc. 
Michael Turits: Hey. Good afternoon, everybody, and nice quarter. It was a really good quarter on firewall platform as a service and you raised Network Security, but the product itself was just a slight beat and you didn't raise it. So what's the delta? What really raised that guidance on networks for the year and drove the outperformance? 
Nikesh Arora: That’s software.
Michael Turits: What was the biggest piece, VM-Series, Prisma Access, subscription attach, how would you rank those?
Nikesh Arora: Access, VMs, and subscriptions. Not because subscriptions aren't doing well. It's just a very large number. So, sustaining a large number growing at 30% is a good thing.
Michael Turits: Great. So it's really, Prisma Access was the big driver?
Nikesh Arora : Yes. I mean, look at Access has gone to a – when I joined, it was called GlobalProtect Cloud servicse. It was barely $10 million in the quarter. Now it's going gangbusters. I just said, now I just said, we did $20 million deal across a customer's entire enterprise, which included Cortex and Prisma Access in there. So, we can get to $10 plus million deals in Access in one deal where we were doing $10 million in one quarter, three years ago. So, that makes it interesting.
Michael Turits: Great. Thanks, Nikesh.
Operator: Next question comes from Jonathan Ho of William Blair.
Jonathan Ho : Hi there. I just wanted to get some additional color in terms of the subscriptions that you've been, I guess, selling with the firewalls. Is there any way that you can maybe provide some additional perspectives on, maybe which ones are doing well, and what the average number of subscriptions being taken are and, yes, that would be great. Thank you. 
Nikesh Arora : Yes, Jonathan, that the – obviously, we had four when I joined and they are all had over 50% attach rates even before. The one which has gone from zero to 500 is DNS secured in the last two years. As we just announced, we crossed the 5,000 customer mark. Many of the newer subscriptions were just launched as part of 10.0 with our software. So they are all very recent, which includes IoT, SD-WAN, DLP, those things. Yes, those things.
Lee Klarich : Right.
Nikesh Arora : And, sorry, I got Lee sitting next to me, socially distanced, I keep nodding, asking him what he - if I forgot anything. But, SD-WAN, you can see is combined with our CloudGenix efforts. So we see SD-WAN traction between the two of them. We are seeing a lot of interest in DLP, which is very early. It's only a few weeks old and IoT, we see situations but that's more of an architectural sales, because not just at that subscription. People want to look at the IoT architecture for the enterprise.  But we launched healthcare IoT. So it's part of the IoT effort. So, I have expectations from DLP. I have expectations from SD-WAN, obviously a combination of CloudGenix and IoT, but I think we'll see different approaches and different sort of trajectories in terms of adoption.  IoT is a bigger ticket when we sell it. DLP is a simple attach and it’s easy to deploy like DNS security is. So they take different trajectories at different prices.
Operator: Our last question comes from Andy Nowinski of D.A. Davidson.
Andy Nowinski : Great. Thank you for squeezing me in. So, you mentioned a number of eight-figure deals for both Prisma Access and Prisma Cloud, which were record deals for the company. Just wondering if you could provide any more color with regard to your overall large deal activity for the quarter? Was the activity up year-over-year? And if you did see an increase in the overall activity, kind of what drove the growth? Thanks.
Nikesh Arora : Yes. Andy, I think purely math. And I am waiting for Luis to go look. But purely mathematically, we added the same number of customers we did this year than we did last year and our billings grew 20%. So we got – we definitely got to have more bigger deals in there. Hurry up, Luis, what are you doing? So, yes, we are seeing strength.  But I would say, it's kind of interesting. If you look at the landscape, the higher end of the cloud sales see bigger deals, because you are comparing them to large GCP, AWS, Azure spend. So even if you get 2% to 5% of the GCP, Azure, AWS commitment, you end up with the large deal, which is typically the seven plus figure range.  And you see a similar activity in Prisma Access, because it ends up being a three-year TCV style deal with – if you get the top end, like 100,000 plus users, you end up with a seven-and-a-half figure deal. XDR in the market typically ends up in the $1 million to $2 million range, because of competitive pressures and competitive activity. So you just need to do a lot more XDR deals to get there. So, it's different depending obviously, firewall, again, depends on the installed base, the estate and the end of life and ELAs have their own characteristics depending on again, how much estate is there and how much people are reupping and how much software they are buying. Luis?
Luis Visoso : So, here is how I look at it. If you add up the billings of the last largest deals that we did this quarter and you compare that to a year ago, the total is 35% higher. So it just gives you a magnitude of how significant those large deals are for us.
Andy Nowinski : Thanks, guys. That's really helpful.
Nikesh Arora : All right. Well, see, Brad Zelnick, if you change your mind about us, you don't even get to ask a question. All right. Thank you everyone. Thank you for joining us, and thank you very much for all your questions. We look forward to seeing many of you in our upcoming investor events. I also want to thank our customers, partners, and of course, our employees at Palo Alto Networks.  Have a great day. 
Luis Visoso : Thank you.

===== 2021 Q1  (2020-11-16 08:00:00) =====
Karen Fung: Good morning. And thank you for joining us on today’s conference call to discuss Palo Alto Networks’ Fiscal First Quarter 2021 Financial Results. I am Karen Fung, Senior Director of Investor Relations. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed on the Investors Section of our website at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. With me on today's call are Nikesh Arora, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Luis Visoso, our Chief Financial; and Lee Klarich, our Chief Product Officer. This morning, we issued a press release announcing our results for the fiscal first quarter ended October 31, 2020. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online on our website. We would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our business, our customers, the enterprise and cybersecurity, industry and global economic conditions, our expectations related to financial guidance, operating metrics and modelling claims for fiscal second quarter and full year, expenses contribution to our fiscal 2021 ARR, our expectations regarding the timing of completing our acquisition of Expanse, our competitive position and the demand and opportunity for our products and subscriptions, benefits and timing of new products, features and subscription offerings, including those from our proposed acquisition of Expanse, as well as other financial and operating trends. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today. You should not rely on them as representing our views in the future, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call.  For a more detailed description of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on September 22, 2020, and our earnings release posted a few minutes ago on our website and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. For historical periods, we have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in the supplemental financial information that can be found in the Investors section of our website located at investors.paloaltonetworks.com.  And finally, once we have completed our formal remarks, we will be posting them to our Investor Relations website under the quarterly results section. We'd also like to inform you that we will be virtually participating in the Wells Fargo TMT Summit on December 1 and the Barclays Global TMT Conference on December 10.  Please also see the Investors section of our website for additional information about conferences we may be participating in.  And with that, I will turn the call over to Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora: [Indiscernible] user conference which stats tomorrow morning. This is my tenth quarterly call at Palo Networks. The one thing in common between the first and the tenth is they were both 5 am calls. I finally feel that we're turning the corner on all that we've over the last few years. We have a lot of interesting stuff in store for you on this call. In addition to sharing our first quarter results, we will discuss the financial impact of our proposed acquisition of Expanse. Since Luis joined us last quarter, he and I have had the privilege and opportunity to talk to a lot of you. And based on the feedback, we've come up with a more transparent approach to understanding our business. And hopefully, it gives you a better understanding of what we have been up to and a way to think about Palo Alto Networks 2.0.  Over the last 7 months, I've been cautious on the pandemic, and our teams have continued to deliver and surprised me to the upside. I'm delighted to report this is no longer a coincidence. Our customers are investing, our teams are executing and our strategy of innovating in our firewall business and focusing on the next-generation of products around cloud and AI in the industry is working. As you can see, we had a great start to fiscal year 2021 as we exceeded guidance across all metrics in Q1.  Here are some of the highlights. We delivered strong billings of $1.08 billion, up 21% year-over-year with strong growth across the board, driven by continued strength in Next-Generation Security or NGS Billings growing at 53% year-over-year and NGS ARR of $719 million. Revenue was up 23% to $946 million, driven by strength in our cloud-based subscription and support revenue businesses. Non-GAAP EPS was [indiscernible] from last year. EPS expansion was driven by revenue growth and operating expense leverage due to efficiencies as we have seen across the industry from lower spend associated with travel and events around COVID. Adjusted free cash flow margin was 53.4%. As mentioned last quarter, we expected a strong cash quarter following the record Q4 2020 billings. We think some of this will continue into the next quarter, but we expect this to normalize for the year around our full year guidance. This continued strength during the pandemic makes me cautiously optimistic about the future prospects of the business. While we expect the winter will try all of our collective resolve with COVID, the worst-case scenarios are unlikely to unfold, and we expect our customers to continue to invest in technology. I also feel that the strategic bets we made a few years ago are right for our customers in the current environment.  Against that backdrop I feel comfortable raising guidance for the full fiscal year even before including the contribution of our proposed acquisition of Expanse, which we announced last week. Fiscal 2021 and at the midpoint guide, we expect total billings growth of 19%, up 300 basis points from our prior guidance. Total revenue growth of 20% to 21%, up 300 from our prior guide. Next generation securing ARR to be approximately $1.15 billion up 77% year-over-year. We also expect non-GAAP operating adjusted free cash flow expansion up from our prior guidance to be flat year-over-year. Subject to close this includes a benefit from Expanse of approximately 100 basis points of billings growth, 50 basis points of revenue growth and $77 million in ARR. We will absorb Expanse’s operating expenses within the framework of our guide. Let me now highlight some of the key innovation launched in Q1 and the very positive customer traction, starting with our Firewall business. We continue to drive innovation within our Firewall business. We recently extended our new enterprise DLP solution to integrate with our complete Firewall platform. Our DLP offering is a cloud-delivered service that is powerful, simple to deploy and protect sensitive data where their customer keeps the data in the cloud, on-prem or takes a flexible approach. This launch takes our number of potential attached subscriptions to eight from four, just two years ago. We also introduced an innovative joint solution with our VMCs virtual firewall and AWS Gateway Load Balancer. Our engineering level partnership with AWS enabled us to launch this new capability that significantly simplifies deployment, improves the scale and performance and reduces the total cost of ownership of our VMC customers. Going forward, we will continue to provide leading innovation to our customers. One example of this is the upcoming launch of our new 5G native security offering. Our unique approach to 5G security, we're the first to introduce 5G network slice security, 5G context-driven security, and much more, all in a containerized solution matching the preferred architecture of 5G. Not only will this allow mobile operators to secure their 5G infrastructure, but it also enabled them to launch value-added security services to their growing enterprise customers who are leveraging 5G for many new used cases. As a result of our efforts to drive innovation our firewall business continues to receive industry accolades. I'm excited to share that Palo Alto Networks has crowned again as a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Network Firewalls. This is a ninth consecutive time we are a leader in this Magic Quadrant. Once again, we achieved the highest and furthest overall position in the Magic Quadrant for our ability to execute and our completeness of vision. Not only was our strength in next generation firewall product capability to recognize, but our services like DLP and focus on cloud security was cited as trends as well. In Q1, we were also recognized as the leader in The Forrester Wave™: Zero Trust eXtended Ecosystem Platform Providers report. Noting that we have assembled a robust portfolio that delivers zero trust everywhere, on-premise in the data center and in the cloud. Our strategy in firewall is working as Firewall as a Platform grew billings by 16% in Q1 2021 and we added approximately 2000 more customers for a total of 71,000 next-generation firewall customers. Our software next-generation firewalls, VM-Series, and CN-Series continue to gain momentum as well. And we now have over 10,000 customers using our software firewalls. Moving on to our SASE or secure access service edge solution, Prisma Access and CloudGenix, as SD-WAN has become the primary WAN architecture, organizations are demanding solutions with a better user experience while being simpler to deploy and manage. In the quarter, we introduced a number of new additions to our next generation SD-WAN solution, CloudGenix. This included new AML-base capabilities to enhance our AI Ops approach and further simplified network operations.  Two new SD WAN appliances, a small form factor appliance designed for retail and small offices and home offices and high performance applications suited appliance suited for large campus and data center locations. We also delivered the first CloudGenix and Prisma Access integration which seamlessly enables cloud delivered brand security in just a few clicks. In addition to the Gartner Magic Quadrants network firewalls, Palo Alto Networks’ CloudGenix SD-WAN was recognized as a leader in the 2020 Gartner Magic Quadrant for WAN Edge Infrastructure. For many of our customers, COVID accelerated the digital transformation timelines, and we continue to see conversion and remote access trials and very strong pipeline generation. We now have more than 1000 Prisma SASE customers, more than double from a year ago. To highlight a deal from the quarter, we won a seven-figure SD-WAN deal with a U.S. retailer who had already been a Palo Alto Networks customer for a number of years was an early adopter of Prisma Access. The success that we had with Prisma Access and the strong integration with CloudGenix was a winning combination. And this customer is now a full SASE customer. Switching to Prisma Cloud. Prisma Cloud is very well positioned for sustainable growth as it is at the heart of the global shift to cloud computing. In Q1 2021, we launched Prisma Cloud 2.0 introducing four new modules to enable customers to easily and rapidly extend their cloud security coverage in a number of critical areas, all within a single cloud native security platform. These modules are data security, which discovers and protects cloud storage data at a scale and velocity common in public cloud environments and addressing one of the most common data exposure issues in cloud transformation, includes web application and API security, which protects web applications from attacks. Our approach addresses the challenges of deployment, complexity and scalability by leveraging the same agent as our container and host security, making it very easy and horizontally scalable. We launched identity-based micro-segmentation with the integration of Aporeto technology, enabling zero trust security for cloud applications in a cloud native identity based approach. And lastly, IAM Security, which allows security teams to gain visibility into effective cloud identity permissions, user activity, implement governance and respond to issues. While only recently introduced we are excited about the strong customer interest we’re seeing. Prisma cloud now serves 20% of the Global 2000 companies, 70% of the Fortune 100 companies and secures 1.8 billion cloud resources. This customer momentum is up from the 14% of Global 2000 companies reported last quarter and up significantly from the 43% of Fortune 100, that we reported two quarters ago. We're also seeing substantial increase in Prisma Cloud customers are using both cloud security posture management and cloud workload protection for containers and serverless applications now at 45%, up from a third we reported last quarter. To highlight the benefits of our consumption model, we won a high seven-figure deal with a leading technology company to use Prisma Cloud for CSBM for AWS and cloud workload protection. This customer has quickly consumed the workloads purchased and we are working with them to support the expansion to new clouds and new workloads. Moving to Cortex. Cortex is on its way to being the industry's first proactive security platform, collecting data across the multiple security data sources, applying machine learning techniques to detect sophisticated threats before they have a chance to succeed and fully automating response for known threats. We've seen some incredible benefits to customers who adopted Cortex from customers seeing up to 50x reduction in alerts to customers automating more than one million incidents per day. And based on a telemetry, we can see that we have recently passed the marker 400 million actions automated up 100% in just four months. As a result, we're winning with customers who share our vision, including 34% of the Global 2000 and 65% of Fortune 100. We continue to drive product innovation in Cortex XDR. Our recent XDR 2.5 release, includes many new capabilities that have enabled us to catch up in a number of various or passing leading EDR products. For example, we introduced host insights. Our first add-on module for XDR, which provides vulnerability assessment, application visibility, and our new search and destroy feature. And to our knowledge, we are the first EDR product to offer the search and destroy capability that will greatly speed up security response and eliminate the need for additional endpoint agents. This might be a good time to highlight a customer when we had recently. We won a seven-figure deal, and this is a story we hear every day. The customer has a small SecOps team managing multiple point products that were generating too many alerts with too few resources to investigate every alert, leaving them exposed to advanced threats, being able to quickly investigate alerts and identify and remediate threats was a critical requirement. That existing EDR product was disjointed from the rest of the security infrastructure, making it difficult and time consuming to correlate data. At the same time, there's seamless consuming a large chunk of the annual budget with little ROI. We challenged their way of thinking by demonstrating how the Cortex platform could automate and streamline security operations allow them to consolidate multiple products, including the SIM into Cortex. We demonstrated how Cortex will help transform the SecOps team by automating routine processes and knocking down alert volume by more than 95%, allowing them to focus on the critical field. In Q1, we also launched the XSOAR Marketplace, which opened up the platform to both our partners and customers. And we now have over 500 content bags available to customers to enable automation for the security solutions. Additionally, we are seeing engagement and momentum within our partner ecosystem with contributions and used cases ranging from insider threat to cloud security and threat intel management. The last deal I want to share with you is a Fortune 500, diversified financial services company. Prior to implementing Cortex XSOAR, this customer was receiving over one billion threat alerts per week. Completely overwhelming their security operations team, leading to a state where alerts were disregarded creating a significant security gap.  By leveraging XSOAR and XSOAR threat intel management, they were able to take full control of threat information by aggregating disparate information sources, automatically customizing and scoring fees and matching indicators against that environment as well as leveraging playbook automation drive interaction. This combination of automation tactics reduced the number of threat alerts they received by more than 99%, creating a significantly more secure rand. Moving quickly to Expanse. Last week, we announced our intent to acquire Expanse and told you about what they do and how they fit within our overall vision of Cortex. Expanse has dedicated themselves to developing an internet collection and attribution platform that constantly monitors the global internet. Mapping the exposed and untracked assets of an enterprise that comprised its attack surface. This data gives organizations a crucial picture from the outside end. That is to say the same view that an attacker sees when hunting for potential weaknesses. It’s because of insight that their technology is trusted by some of the world's largest and most complex organizations from members of the Fortune 500 to the U.S. military. With our user conference Ignite kicking off in a little over 24 hours, we're excited to share that outside in view with our customers. We work with Expanse to offer all CIOs and CISOs attending in EXPANSE Exec Report, which provides a vulnerability map and immediate insights to customers complete attack surface, risks and suspicious activity. This is a great lead generation tool for us, sales teams to hit the ground running once we closed on the transaction. Expanse’s transaction multiples are very favorable compared to other companies of equivalent size and even more so when adjusting for growth.  Now to the financials. As we said in our call last week, on a standalone basis, we expect Expanse to contribute $67 million of ARR to our current fiscal year ending July 2021, continuing its 100% growth momentum. With Palo Alto Networks and subject to close, we expect Expanse to contribute $73 million of ARR in FY 2021. Assuming a mid to late Q2 close, we expect Expanse billings to contribute about 100 basis points of our growth to our overall billings for FY 2021, and adjusting for purchase accounting, we expect Expanse revenue to contribute about 50 basis points for overall revenue for FY 2021. I know that you get concerned about M&A strategy, perhaps because inorganic impact or P&L is hard to forecast new models. But if you look at the $2.7 billion of acquisitions we have done since 2019, they contribute approximately 15% for forecasted FY 2021 billings. A very large enterprise companies have been built by successful M&A strategies. Good M&A strategies need to ensure the products are easy to integrate their products customers want, and that we at Palo Alto Networks can significantly change the trajectory. We believe that our ability to acquire, integrate and leverage our go-to-market for acquisitions is a strategic competitive advantage, and we expect to continue to be opportunistic to increase our long-term growth strategy. As I mentioned, Luis and I have spent a lot of time with all of you and you've highlighted that you love our business, some of you have questions with that our Firewall business is under pressure, others have wanted more transparency on our gross margins, while some of you wanted more visibility around ARR, eventually how to put it all together. Well, we heard you. It has taken a herculean effort to share our quarterly results in the shortest period we've ever done. But also to deliver detailed reporting on two categories, just to show that our business is doing extremely well. Let's take a look.  Over the last quarters, we have discussed our total Palo Alto Networks’ performance and provide the details for next-generation security and firewall as a platform. We had hoped that the firewall as a platform metric shows you how we're continuing to create share in the firewall space. The challenge has been that we did not provide anything below that number. What we decided to perhaps the best way to lay our concerns is show you the pro forma P&L around FwaaP and show you how it enjoys great margin. And it's actually higher quality business since we are transforming our hardware business to software and subscription business. We like this shift as software revenues of higher quality and increases revenue visibility.  Our next-generation security business, which has been the thrust of our innovation over the last two years, has been highlighted to share with you how we're building a bigger and better business faster than anyone else in next-generation security.  Next-generation security provides a perspective in our fast growing SaaS business on a billings basis, NGS’ nearly a quarter of total buildings up from 8% in FY 2018. NGS ARR closed Q1 at $719 million, up from $651 million of Q4 2020, and up from $568 million from Q3 2020. To provide a better understanding for business, we juggled a few pieces around. For our firewall as a platform business, we added the related subscription, support and professional services, we call it network security.  We removed the software firewall from NGS in order for the two areas to make a whole. We call this cloud & AI. With that context, we have prepared the recast of our full year guidance, which I just raised across both categories. Let's double click it network security. Our network security business on a standalone basis is still the largest firewall business in the industry by revenue. It enjoys double digit growth driven by transformation to solve for form factors. Our success in VMs and Prisma SASE and increased subscription attach. This has allowed us to have lesser and lesser reliance on hardware and provides better revenue visibility. We feel comfortable that these growth rates are robust and sustainable. Our gross margins and operating margins are extremely healthy. The gross margin was slightly less than where they could be because of our SASE gross margins, which given the early stage of that product, scale, relative firewalls, it has slightly lower margins. As we scale our SASE business and the new subscriptions we have launched, we expect these margins to improve over the next few years. Needless to say, these numbers speak for themselves. And on a standalone basis, this will be a very valuable network security business.  As we noted, our firewall business had largest industry, the industry leading financials, and we're going through a transformation. We will continue to invest in this transformation. Palo Alto Networks has already transformed into a highly ratable business, but ratable revenue as a percent of total revenue is up from 59% two years ago to 71% in Q1 2021. Now into Cloud & AI. This story has just started. If you ask every CIO, the two trends that they're all excited about are the transition to the cloud and the impact of AI. Well, there's no transformation unless there is a secure transformation. I think we have put the rest any questions on the idea that customers would get their cloud security from the CSPs only with 70% of the Fortune 100 being served by us. I think this is our opportunity to build upon. We're singularly focused on continuing to improve our platform to meet the needs of our customers as highlighted earlier. On the AI front, we're in the second iteration of this trend. The first trend was around collection of data and attempted to correlate it for security. The next trend which we are well poised to capture is a trend of normalized data, reduce the signal-to-noise ratio and to improve the security posture using data AI based practice security using Cortex. We have organized our financials for our cloud AI security category. This business, which we started building two years ago is getting traction or ensuring that we build this as a SaaS and ARR business. We expect ARR for Cloud &AI to grow 89% year-over-year in FY 2021. Even when excluding the Expanse contribution, we expect the growth to be 71% year-over-year. While the gross margins look lower in FY 2021 compared to FY 2020 partially because the integration of Crypsis, we expect that this business will continue to improve gross margins every year and improve significantly over the next three, four years. Operating margins will naturally improve as ratable revenue is recognized from the balance sheet to the P&L. We believe there's a large opportunity in Cloud & AI, and this could be the next $100 billion TAM in security. That said, we will continue to invest aggressively for this business. In summary, if you put it altogether, we have two great businesses doing exactly what we'd like them to do. In conclusion, we had a great fiscal quarter across the board. And as a result, we are raising our fiscal 2021 guidance. We've been building two businesses at Palo Alto Networks. Our Network Security business is a largest Firewall player with sustained gross margins and operating margins. And we have fast-growing Cloud & AI business where we expect FY 2020 on ARR of 89% year-over-year. Lastly, I am going to give you a quick update on what we call FLEXWORK, I started this morning by calling out the continued resilience of our employees throughout COVID-19, we have been supporting each and every employee with our FLEXWORK approach, a series of initiatives to give employees far greater choice as they adapt to the challenges this year in areas from work location, to benefits, to learning, all underpinned by the way we lead and communicate, with compassion and authenticity. We continue to advance this approach through Q1. We launched the first phase of FLEX benefits, giving our employees and additional $1,000 allowance for the year to choose from a wide range of wellbeing and childcare options. We roll out the first module of FLEX learn, an individualized learning path for our sales teams, leaders, managers, designed to support them as well as they work and lead remotely. We're delighted to see our FLEXWORK approach now gaining traction beyond Palo Alto Networks. Last month, we launched FLEXWORK at Zoomtopia, and invite other companies to join to open source discussions and share case studies and learnings. Over 600 attendees showed interest in the work. Simultaneously, the CEOs from Uber, Box, Splunk and Zoom all join me in formally announcing the FLEXWORK coalition, the community of leaders coming together, develop and share best practices as we focus on the future work. We all agree that pandemic has highlighted areas of opportunity, where we can bring about enduring workplace change. I look forward to continued conversations with these leaders and about how we can accelerate new work practices that put our employees of the center.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Luis.
Luis Visoso: Thank you, Nikesh, and good morning to everyone. Before I start, I'd like to know that except for revenue and billings, all financial figures are non-GAAP and growth rates are compared to the prior year periods unless stated otherwise. As Nikesh indicated, we had a great first quarter as we delivered – as we continue to deliver winning innovation and add new customers. The strength gives us confidence to raise our guidance for the year. In Q1, total revenue grew 23% to $946 million. Looking at growth by geography, the Americas grew 27%, EMEA grew 16%, and APAC grew 11%. Q1 product revenue of $237 million, increased 3% compared to the prior year. Q1 subscription revenue of $428 million, increased 34%. Support revenue of $281 million, increased 26%. In total, subscription and support revenue of $709 million, increased 31% and accounted for 75% of total revenue. Turning to billings, Q1 total billings of $1.083 billion, net of acquired deferred revenue increased 21%. Strength was broad based, as we continue to see strong execution across the company. The dollar weighted contract duration for new subscriptions and support billings in the quarter was up slightly and remained at approximately three years.  Total deferred revenue at the end of Q1 was $3.9 billion, an increase of 31% year-over-year. Remaining Performance Obligation or RPO was $4.4 billion, an increase of 40% year-over-year. In addition to adding approximately 2,200 new customers in the quarter, we continue to increase our wallet share with existing customers. Our top 25 customers, 24 of which made a purchase this quarter, spend a minimum of $57.2 million in lifetime value through the end of fiscal Q1 2021, a 37% increase or the $41.7 million in the comparable prior year period. Q1 gross margin was 75.8%, which was down 80 basis points compared to last year, mainly driven by higher mix of our NGAs products, which are less mature. Q1 operating margin was 21.7%, an increase of 590 basis points year-over-year. The operating margin expansion is driven by operating expense leverage as we benefit from lower travel and event expenses due to COVID, which more than offset the incremental investment in headcount. We ended the first quarter with 8,376 employees, including 156 from Crypsis at the close of acquisition.  On a GAAP basis for the first quarter, net loss increased to $92.2 million or $0.97 per basic and diluted share. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter increased 51% to $158.1 million or $1.62 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for Q1 was 22%.  Turning to cash flow and balance sheet items. We finished October with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $4.1 billion. During the first quarter, we purchased $500 million or 2.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $242 per share. We have returned $2.7 billion to shareholders since Q1 2017 through the repurchase of programs and ASR where we repurchased 15.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $179 per share. Q1 cash flow from operations of $535 million, increased by 138% year-over-year. Free cash flow was $505 million, up 184% at a margin of 53.4%. As we mentioned last quarter, this was driven by the strong cash collections, following Q4 2020 record billings. DSO was 81 days, an increase of 18 days from the prior year period. We expect another strong collections quarter in Q2, which is expected to bring our DSO down to historical levels. Turning now to guidance and modeling points. For the second fiscal quarter of 2021, we expect billings to be in the range of $1.17 billion to $1.19 billion, an increase of 17% to 19% year-over-year. We expect revenue to be in the range of $975 million to $990 million, an increase of 19% to 21% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.42 to a $1.44 using 98 million shares to a 100 million shares.  Additionally, I would like to provide some modeling points. We expect our Q2 non-GAAP effective tax rate to remain at 22%. CapEx in Q2 will be approximately $30 million to $35 million. As Nikesh reviewed earlier, for the full fiscal year 2021, we will be raising our guidance across all metrics. We expect billings to be in the range of $5.08 billion to $5.13 billion, an increase of 18% to 19% year-over-year. We expect next-generation security, ARR to be approximately $1.15 billion, an increase of 77% year-over-year. We expect revenue in the range of $4.09 billion to $4.14 billion, an increase over 20% year-over-year. We expect revenue – product revenue to be flat year-over-year. We expect operating margins to improve by 50 basis points year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $5.70 to $5 80 using 99 million to 101 million shares. Regarding free cash flow, for the full year, we expect an adjusted free flow margin of approximately 29%. With that, I’d like to open the call for questions.
Operator: In the interest of time, please limit Q&A to one question. Our fist first question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citi Group.
Walter Pritchard: Hi, thanks. Can you hear me?
Nikesh Arora: Yes. Hey, Walter.
Walter Pritchard: All right. Great. Thanks. So I guess, you've seen really strong customer ads around Cortex and around Prisma and have – I think your Global 2000 Fortune 500 penetration is pretty strong here. Can you talk about where you are in terms of standardization amongst some of those clients and how you think about revenue from those products around up-sell versus new customers going forward?
Nikesh Arora: Look, we have a different answer for both of them. As you know that our Cortex XDR platform is only about two quarters old and we're delighted that we're crossing 1,000 customers in that category. We continue to see opportunity in penetrating both our existing customer base and new customers as far as XDR’s concern. As you know, we keep launching more capability in our XDR platform. We want to go from being able to just normalize data across their endpoints and firewalls to more and more data sources.  And with the combination of Expanse, we think that's a very powerful proposition, we think in the future, it's no longer about aggregating data and throwing it into a large data lake and running analytics. It's about being able to normalize the data. So I think we are early in the transformation of data and AI-based security around Cortex, and this is a very long runway ahead of it. In terms of Prisma Cloud, what's fascinating, as we highlighted an example in the call, where we had a customer who kind of estimated how much workload and how much capacity they need into cloud as they ran through it in a quarter. That's what we think over time happens to all the cloud customers because it's kind of interesting. The gap between how much people have actually sort of move to the cloud versus how much is ahead of them is huge. I'd say it took us two years to get to the cloud, to get 70% of the capacity of our data centers in the cloud. We had to buy everything two years ago to start ramping up to get there. So we think all of our customers are early in their ramps, relatively speaking. Some of them are further along. But we think most customers are early or maybe in the first or second innings of a ramp. And we think there's a long runway ahead as well for the cloud part. So in cloud, we're really focused on customer acquisition and landing customers. That's why we keep sharing with you 70% of the global Fortune 100 or 20% of Global 2000 because we think the more customers we can have, we expect consumption to keep growing for each of those customers. Hence, we have a consumption base order for most of our products now because the more they consume, we expect recurring remediates show up. Does it give you a better sense for it?
Walter Pritchard: Yes, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Keith, I think he might be on mute.
Nikesh Arora: Are you went back to sleep? I know it was a long call, Keith, not that long.
Operator: We will move on to the next caller Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. And then we'll move back to Keith afterwards.
Sterling Auty: Thanks, guys. Thank you very much for the additional disclosure, incredibly helpful, but just want to make sure I understand how should we think about, you gave the guidance for total product revenue improved to flat year-over-year, but I'm just kind of curious what impact you're seeing from SD-WAN and other areas that might actually provide some further improvement in that product growth rate as we move through the year?
Nikesh Arora: Sterling, thank you. We include the SD-WAN revenues mostly in our Prisma SASE product, which goes in the overall firewall as a platform billing. So you will see the impact of SD-WAN and our firewall as a platform billings number. Then we continue to see strengthen the SD-WAN category, as well as the entire SASE categories I mentioned. I think most remote work transformation, network transformations are not done. They're early in their sort of journey. And I think most of our customers are realizing that they're going to have to migrate their network infrastructure to more of an SD-WAN style infrastructure, as well as then we'll probably have to sustain a 100% percent capacity for remote working for much longer than anybody thought.
Sterling Auty: But I thought with the two products, one of it was on box. I didn't know if that was going to have the ability to provide some pull-through for some additional product, as well as we moved through the year?
Nikesh Arora: Even that on box SD-WAN subscription is part of our subscriptions number, which again shows up in the FY billings number. In this new left-hand side we just showed you.
Sterling Auty: Understood. Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: No problem.
Operator: We will try this again. The next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.
Nikesh Arora: Good morning, Mr. Weiss.
Keith Weiss: Good morning. Can you guys hear me now?
Nikesh Arora: Yes.
Luis Visoso: Yes.
Keith Weiss: Excellent. So I thank you for taking the question, bearing with me and my technical difficulties. Very nice quarter. Loved the Expansive disclosure. I think it's a really good view on the overall business. I wanted to get a little bit more onto the firewall side of the equation. I think it's going to surprise guys as both the growth in sort of the overall customer base. I think it was up 8,000 on a year-on-year basis, as well as sort of the overall and a billings growth in that business. Can you talk to us a little bit about one kind of where the customers are coming from, how you guys are expanding that overall firewall base? And then two, what are the kind of vectors of growth we should be thinking about on a going forward basis? Like where are we in terms of subscriptions per customer? How far can that go on a going forward basis? As well as kind of like the virtual versus physical mix, like how much further is that taking up your spending per customer?
Nikesh Arora: Yes, I think, Keith, the best way to think about it is that the software side of that business continues to see strong growth. The SASE pieces, Prisma access pieces, the SD-WAN capability and CloudGenix, that is also where we capture our subscription growth. Our subscriptions have gone from four to eight. We just launched the LP, which is getting sort of lots of interesting – a lot of interest from our existing customers. IoT which is very early still for us. It's also getting a lot of interest from our customers. SD-WAN ends up being part of a larger SD-WAN sort of infrastructure deal where they will turn on the SD-WAN capability in the firewall, and then they will also buy pure SD-WAN with CloudGenix and the architectures work, so they work together. So we expect most of the growth is going to come from the software side of the house. As we shared the VMs, I have gone over 10,000 customers. We've seen a lot of interest and activity there in the VM space. As we highlighted, we've launched the 5G capability, containerized firewall 5G capability, which is unique in the industry. We're going back to our service provider partners and saying, look, this is what you need to get 5G done, right? And to help your customers leverage 5G use cases that they're deploying.  So I expect a lot of the growth should come in the software side. The hardware customers are mostly refresh and some are existing customers. In some cases, you'll see people go away from legacy vendors who provide hardware firewalls. Sometimes we will see hardware wins, which come as part of an overall platform deal where people want to deploy the entire Palo Alto blueprint across their infrastructure. So hardware is harder than software, especially in the current environment.
Keith Weiss: Got it. Excellent. Super helpful. Thank you guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani from UBS. 
Fatima Boolani: Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Can you hear me?
Nikesh Arora: But just for you, because you didn't believe that we were growing a business on the other side.
Fatima Boolani: I could see that. Thank you for that. I'll keep it tight. Nikesh, if I can ask you to put a mix hat on for a second. Into fiscal 2021, you're going to have an even bigger portfolio than you did in fiscal 2020. So I'm wondering if you can speak to, or at least quantify to what extent enterprise adoption agreements or enterprise licensing style agreements are becoming a bigger part of your overall sales motion particularly as you look to drive more next-gen solution adoption activity?
Nikesh Arora: Yes, the enterprise agreements typically kick in stronger in renewables than in the first phases of our deal. So a lot of the deal – a lot of the original, the only business comes as on a product by product basis until we get to a scale where customers is, wait a minute, it makes much more sense for me to go consolidate all that stuff. It's rarely you'll see somebody walking in salon a $20 million, $30 deal. And let's go rip out everything in our infrastructure and replace with Palo Alto Networks. We see that it happens incrementally over time with our customers, as they get one product, they enjoy it, they get the next set of products, and we've seen that happen on a recurring basis in the last two, two and a half years I've been here. We expect they will continue to be important, but they're typically kicking in renewal. So we have reasonably good visibility as to which customers are up for renewal where it makes sense for them to be pitched enterprise agreement. But they play their fair role in our renewal capability. Well, we make sure that our teams understand that you cannot just renew somebody and call it an enterprise agreement. There has to be a significant amount of upsell and deployment of new products into the customer base before qualifies for enterprise agreement. And this hat is a little smaller. I tried on the weekend.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Ho from William Blair. 
Jonathan Ho: Hi, good morning. And congrats on the strong results. I just wanted to start out with, getting a sense for how the integration with CloudGenix is going and maybe what the initial customer feedback has been with the combined products? Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: I'm going to have my friend Lee Klarich to answer that question, since he's been sitting, just smiling. Go ahead, Lee.
Lee Klarich: Thank you, Nikesh. Good question, Jonathan. We’ve seen in the SD-WAN space in particular is even though it provides obviously a lot of value to customers, it's still can be very clunky. It can still be very difficult to roll out deploy operationalize. And obviously the approach for CloudGenix, we think we address many of those challenges, but further the integration with Prisma Access, where we can also deliver the cloud network and integrate those two together. And as you heard Nikesh stated earlier, we recently introduced an ability for those to be deployed with basically one-click integration.  And so all of that combination that we bring together as SASE is starting to resonate with our customers, and we see that as the future architecture for how customers are going to connect their branch offices, remote sites to a cloud of our network with cloud security and address those deployment challenges while gaining the best security they can.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Essex from Goldman Sachs.
Brian Essex: Hey, good morning. And thank you for taking the question. Thank you for me as well, and the additional metrics around NGS. It's really helpful. I know investors have been waiting a while for that. Maybe, Nikesh or Luis, how should we think about two things, one the gross margin progression is that just a function of the delivery on cloud infrastructure? And then two, seasonality, so comparing this to your overall business from a margin perspective, at what rate might this business be in parity with the rest of the business? And then from a seasonality perspective, I noticed that billings were seasonal this quarter similar to the larger business. How do we think about that on a go-forward basis? Thank you.
Luis Visoso: Yes. I think we – to the second part of your question, we will always see a little bit of seasonality with Q4 being stronger than Q1, right. So that would be kind of normal. In terms of gross margin, yes, we have strong plans, as you would imagine. And as Nikesh mentioned, we do expect to get very competitive gross margins over the next few years. We have very clear plans that include efficiencies in our cloud and AI business, so you should expect that business to significantly improve over time. And as I said, we have very concrete plans to achieve that.
Brian Essex: Is that maybe just on infrastructure side? Or is there something else driving that margin?
Nikesh Arora: As I mentioned, Brian, on the last call, the two largest parts of the gross margin are clearly are cloud infrastructure pieces. And we have worked hard both in Luis' team and in Luis' efforts in trying to lease those cost down. And we have a very clear line of sight as to how and when those costs will go down, so we're very comfortable saying that those gross margins should improve significantly in the next two to three years, that’s one part of it. The other part is, as you know, this is the revenue against cost metric and revenue comes in ratably, the costs come in front-loaded in customer success. Our deployment costs and customer deployment requirement is like we have to deploy $1 million deal in two months right now. At our cost to point the deal is now the $1 million come over two years. So you will see as that business scales, the customer success pieces in the pre-course gross margin numbers become relatively smaller compared to the total revenue side, but that also gives you a natural margin progression in the right direction.
Brian Essex: Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Philip Winslow from Wells Fargo.
Philip Winslow: Great, thanks for taking my question. And again, thanks for the added transparency in terms of disclosure. Obviously, it's a very strong quarter with a lot of very positive metrics here. One that really stood out to me was on Prisma Cloud. Customers using compute – shift to cloud security is something that we've been focused on for a while. But it feels like that's hitting an inflection point. So I guess a question for Nikesh and Lee. What are you hearing from customers about sort of adoption of computes or understanding of sort of the evolution of security in the cloud?
Nikesh Arora: I think we've maybe mentioned before the – I think a lot of early cloud adoption from enterprises was sort of more lift and shift. We saw take an application in the data center and simply move it to the cloud without rearchitecting it, without leveraging a lot of the benefits of the cloud. And the more mature companies, from a cloud perspective, are now taking more of a cloud-native approach. And those cloud-native approach sometimes is obviously leveraging PaaS services, but one of the key aspects is increasingly using containerized security architectures and deployment architectures. Interesting enough, that also sometimes comes back on-premise as well. And so as there is a greater and greater usage of containerized architectures, cloud-native architectures, the Prisma Cloud compute security capabilities become very important. And this obviously, for us, comes from the acquisition of Twistlock. We made about 1.5 years ago. And at the time it was best-in-class. We continue to invest in it and continue to receive great feedback from our customers when they do take advantage of it.
Philip Winslow: Great, thanks team, keep up the great work.
Nikesh Arora: Thanks Philip.
Luis Visoso: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gray Powell from BTIG.
Gray Powell: Great. Thanks. Can you hear me okay?
Nikesh Arora: Yes.
Gray Powell: Cool. So yes, I maybe want to go back to an earlier question on the core Firewall side. How should we think about attached subscription growth on the core Firewall side? Because I think you have four new subscriptions, some of them seem to be getting pretty good traction. You introduced a higher cost premium support to your – but at the same time, product revenue growth is flattening out, which means that the installed base and subscriptions going to attach to is flattening out. So I'm just trying to think like how those two things should net against each other?
Nikesh Arora: Well, they shouldn't net against each other because you see the four new subs that we've added, we believe, should be applicable to majority of our customers. And most of our customers don't have them. I mean, the one which has seen some traction, which we talked about last quarter, was our DNS Security sub, which is penetrated over 5% or 6% of our base. So we expect there is still a lot of runway in the new subscriptions to be able to penetrate our base of 70,000-plus Firewall customers. So we don't think that, that should all be on top of the product base that we have out there. And whilst product revenues are flat, our install base continues to rise because this is a one-time sale. Every time we sell, it's to, hopefully, a new set of customers. And over time some of them renew. So I think you are still seeing customer acquisition as is it evident from the 8000 new customers we have between last year and this year. Although they are prime candidates for subscriptions that get attached. In addition to that some of these customers whilst they might be flat from product revenue, they are deploying Prisma SASE or Prisma Access, also deploying VMs where VMs and Prisma Access also allow you to do subscriptions. The subscriptions are not specific only to our hardware business. You can get as of soon DLP with Prisma Access, you can get IoT with Prisma Access. So our subscriptions go past, they apply not only to the 70,000 hardware customers, they apply it to a significant part of our 10,000 software virtual firewall customers or a 1000 Prisma SASE customers.
Gray Powell: Got it. That's really helpful. Did you say DNS is already at 5% to 6% penetration about that's only been out like a year?
Lee Klarich: About 18 months? Yes, I'd say we said 3000 last quarters, 3000, I think, my math says is approximately…
Nikesh Arora: Your math is good. 
Lee Klarich: My math is good in the morning. Yes.
Gray Powell: Alright, thanks.
Lee Klarich: Early in the morning.
Gray Powell: Thanks.
Nikesh Arora: That’s great.
Lee Klarich: Just want to make sure, 5% was right.
Operator: Next question comes from Andy Nowinski from D.A. Davidson. 
Andy Nowinski: Great thank you. And congrats on a good start to fiscal 2021. At a high level question, when you look at the thousands of new customers, you added this quarter, I'm curious what percentage started with just your cloud AI products, or do most customers start with the network security products? Just trying to get a better understanding of which one is driving a new logo growth. Thanks.
Nikesh Arora: Yes, my CFO will not, let me tell you the number of exact number of new cloud AI customers. But I will tell you there's a significant part of the – both of the Fortune 100 and Global 2000 base, where they have no interest in some of our hardware products, because these are born in the cloud companies, so they are going through cloud transformation. So we are seeing a reasonable number, a significant number of customers, be our first time customers in Prisma Cloud customers who had no interest in buying a firewall because many of them don't have a substantive data center, but they have a cloud presence because that's kind of what they chose to go with. And now with the eight modules, seven modules we provide in Prisma Cloud, they find it interesting to go down that platform route. Many of our customers who are on the defense side or the financial services side where we've not had such a strong presence are getting – we are seeing renewed interest, both in the cloud transformation, as well as the data collection capabilities, Cortex XDR and hopefully expense in the future. So, we're seeing a new set of customers we're able to address with our cloud AI solutions, which we were not able to address with our hardware capabilities.
Andy Nowinski: Thanks Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora: You are welcome. 
Operator: This question comes from Saket Kalia from Barclays.
Saket Kalia: Okay. Hey, good morning. Can you hear me okay?
Nikesh Arora: Yes, Saket. How are you?
Saket Kalia: Okay. Excellent. Good. Nikesh how are you? Luis, maybe for you, maybe just shifting gears to profitability for a second. I think the operating margin guide for fiscal 2021 is going up slightly. And I believe that too is consolidating the Expanse cost base. Maybe the first part of the question, my thinking about that right. And then secondly, more strategically, longer term on that cloud and AI business, who do you sort of benchmark yourself against in terms of where that profitability can go long-term?
Nikesh Arora: Yes, to your first question, yes, margin is off slightly year-over-year. So yes, we are raising our guidance on margin, so you are right. And you are also right our fiscal year margin is impacted by Expanse, which we basically offset all of that. Right. So we factored that in and we covered the cost and even though – even despite of that we’re going on. And yes, we're benchmarking ourselves against the best you have in the market, right. And we want to get towards those margins as well. And we think it's very reasonable to do that as we gain scale and as we deliver the savings that we talked just a few minutes ago, right. Some of the savings that we are working with Lee’s team, Lee and his team, and some of the savings that we think we can get just as we gain more scale. So that should clearly improve. But that's kind of where we're going. Now think about some of the best-in-class companies out there. And that's where we're benchmarking against to deliver.
Luis Visoso: Yes, Saket just to add to that and this is not a reporting question. Part of the reason we wanted to make sure you understand this split and the difference in the two businesses is you want to reinforce that our firewall business is as good as any other firewall business out there in the industry because I got calls about, hey, you are seeing an overall decline in gross margins that because your firewall was under pressure. No it’s not.  I think the other part I want to make sure that you see is that it's kind of like maybe we do and we're looking, but it's very hard to build a $735 million [indiscernible] business from scratch in 18 months. I want to show you that we're building that business in parallel to continuing to focus on the firewall business. And to an extent, the overall gross margin, operating margin are somewhat not fully in our control as management. And we want to show you the reason that we're investing in the right hand side is because we can drive that ARR growth at very high double digit for a longer period of time. For that we need to continue to invest. And we're just showing in the run we invest. You'll see the – you will see the transparency where we're investing, where we're not investing, where we're leveraging and showing your expansion where we're continuing to invest. We're investing in both, obviously not to the same levels. Prisma SASE is a brand new product category for us in our firewall business. And to be honest, I will tell you this in two years from now when you look back, you'll say, yes you guys did a great job, transforming your business to hardware, to software because there's a high probability the industry starts to slow down on hardware because people realize they are moving faster to network transformation, cloud transformation. And when that happens, you need two years of prep work together.
Saket Kalia: Very helpful. Thanks guys.
Luis Visoso: Cool. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Colville from Deutsche Bank.
Patrick Colville: Hey there, thanks again for the new disclosure. It's going to echo to others. I mean, absolutely awesome to see that. So I just want to circle back to Fatima's question about enterprise agreements. So can you just help us understand, I guess at Palo Alto Networks what you define as an enterprise agreement versus just a kind of regular, multiproduct deal. And the reason I asked is because we know in our conversations with resellers we're hearing Palo Alto and enterprise agreement a lot more. So I guess – and I guess the second part of my question is, is there any disclosure you can give us around what proportion of billings are from enterprise agreements? Thank you.
Luis Visoso: Thanks Patrick. Thank you for the congratulations. And first of all, I'm looking at Lee just to confirm what I'm going to say, is that we have no enterprise agreements wherever we blend Cloud AI and network security.
Lee Klarich: Correct? We don't. 
Luis Visoso: So first and foremost, any of the cloud and AI stuff does not get bundled with our hardware deals or does not get bundled with software deals. We probably have no enterprise agreements where we blend all of our Prisma SASE and hardware and software firewalls. We don't. So Prisma SASE deals and also independent of that. So most of our enterprise agreements are still firewall plus subscription agreements, whether they are hardware and software and a subscription, they are still the agreements that have continued in Palo Alto Networks for the last 15 years. None of the new stuff is included in enterprise agreements because we don't believe that we have to create cross-product discounting to try and encourage customers to use them. We want our new products to stand on their own, and be sold on their own and be able to – be on a consumption model, which is much more transparent and much easier to manage if they're not part of it, large bundle discount deal. So that's answer number one. Our enterprise deals refer to hardware plus subscription updates. So in that context, any customer who wants to do an enterprise agreement with us is probably an existing hardware customer with subscriptions, where they are going to buy more subscriptions and promise to buy more hardware from us over the next three years. And that's why you do an enterprise agreement, saying hey, I'm going to go from a 100 firewalls to 200 firewalls if I paid you so much money for all your subscriptions in the next three years, can I have a deal where I don't have to keep being every time I buy a new firewall for subscription. So most of our enterprise deals take on the form of if you commit to a large amount of hardware purchase, you can get a bundled price for subscriptions, which you don't have to pay incrementally for. That's the nature of our deals. Hence, our EAs are pretty much dependent on our hardware business. And as I said to a question earlier that most of our EAs are based on renewal deals because nobody walks in front saying, I want to buy the state of thousand firewalls tomorrow sign me up. It's typically I've got 200 more I'm going to get 200 because I'm through a transformation of Palo Alto Networks, can I just hurry up and get a renewal of a larger number if I commit to more hardware because I love your product.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Hedberg from RBC.
Matthew Hedberg: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. And I'll offer my congrats again. Disclosures are really, really helpful. I guess I have a question for Lee. In a post-COVID distributed world, I have to think DLP takes on a new level of importance. Can you talk a little bit more granular about how you guys differ in your approach to cloud DLP versus others? And how much of that is a new business i.e., as a result of distributed work or increased cloud migration, or how much of it is legacy DLP replacement?
Lee Klarich: Yes. Thanks for the question, Matthew. When you look at the DLP market, it's been around for a long time. It hasn't changed a whole lot during that time. And it was therefore sort of designed and architected for a very on-prem world. It largely assumes that employees all show up to the office, applications are all in the data center and everything is sort of well contained. As you look at today's world, users are – employees are working from anywhere, applications are increasingly running into cloud and the legacy DLP on-prem architecture does not work as well anymore. And so what we've done is built a DLP service that runs in the cloud and then can connect into all the different enforcement points that are needed, whether that's one of our hardware devices in the data center, prem whether that's Prisma Access, whether that's Prisma Cloud for cloud workload and storage security. And so we can take that single DOP cloud engine and integrate it with all of those enforcement points, really designed for this new way in which networks are deployed, applications are deployed. And so we think that's a very more appropriate architecture and we're getting it's early, but we're getting very positive feedback from our customers and interest in that approach.
Matthew Hedberg: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Owens from Piper Sandler.
Rob Owens: Good morning. And thank you for taking my question. Given you are the first to report in October quarter on this really early Monday morning, I was curious if you can give us kind of a broader read in terms of what's going on internationally looked like domestic was strong, but rest of the world growth rates ticked down a little bit versus where they were in the back half, or even the quarter from a linearity standpoint, given your dates, billings outstanding, ticked up, I guess, on a year-over-year basis and went a little higher than it was previously. Thanks.
Lee Klarich: Well, there's a varied impact around the world, given where people are on this pandemic scale and degree of difficulty in terms of being able to execute in their own environments here, we still see that different parts of Asia are doing better than the others because they're going through their emotions of trying to deal with the pandemic. See similar behavior in Europe, we saw in early part of the quarter was normal in Europe. It's gotten subsequently harder because Europe has started to shut down. So we're seeing different impacts across the Board. But as you know, these deals don't happen in days. These deals happen in months. So there's already always work that's been going on for the last many months for these deals to culminate towards the end of the quarter. So generally speaking, as I said, you know, Europe is okay, it is scattered, the U.S. continues to be strong. I think as I said, we are going to get tested in the, and I don't mean COVID testing the COVID is going to test us. We do get tested pretty much, very often, but COVID is going to test all of us in the next three months, because I think the winter is coming. And we're hoping that all the work that the teams have been able to do in the last few months will bear through the winter. But yes, I think, international continues to be – look, there's two parts to it, one is native strand, the other is investment. So we are continuing to invest internationally because we were not as invested, I would say internationally two, two and a half years ago. We're making investments around the world. We're also investing in making sure our cloud and AI businesses are visible across various customer bases because in many cases, the hardware business, hadn't been able to be of much significance many countries around the world, but we're going back and re-investing in cloud and AI. So I think that counteracts some of the natural weakness based on the pandemic. But we'll see what happens the next few months.
Rob Owens: Alright, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho Securities.
Gregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thank you for taking the question. Nikesh, your next-gen security ARR and billing and growth for me is impressive. Especially now that you're lapping tough comps. What I'm wondering is what are the one or two NGS products that haven't yet contributed much, but that you think is only a matter of time before they move the needle on growth.
Nikesh Arora: That was, that was a, quite an impactful way to end the question. But the NGS products, it's kind of interesting as I parse them down, we include Prisma SASE and NGS. We continue to see tremendous amounts of traction in Prisma SASE. Prisma Access continues to go from strength to strength. As I mentioned, we think we four or five, 10 quarters ago, Prisma Access was GPCS, it didn't kind of have enough traction. Now we see tough comps being lapped with great numbers, partly driven by the pandemic response, partly driven by the fact that finally near standing at the top of the roof and claiming the proxy solution that don't fully work. If somebody is hearing him because people want a full-stack firewall and the firewall in the cloud. So a lot of success for Prisma Access front. We think that continues to sustain itself SD-WAN and SASE going forward for the next few years. Prisma Cloud is kind of a different story. It was kind of like, we'll see more benefits in the future because right now we're in expand mode, land mode and we're getting more and more customers, but really we are dependent on the customers’ ability to transform their existing infrastructure to the cloud. So we're getting in there, we're getting our modules in, we're trying to do upsells, get them to use more and more of our product. As they spend more – put more workloads in the cloud Prisma Cloud will see continued ARR growth in the future. On the Cortex XDR front, it's competitive with many XDR vendors out there. Again, we're seeing traction because we have a large install base of traps, which many of that is converting to XDR. We're also seeing new customers where we compete to the likes of Cylance, Crowdstrike and [indiscernible], et cetera. And there, XSOAR, we think is now way larger than any other automation product out there from a security automation perspective. And we think the combination of Expanse, and XDR and XSOAR holds tremendous promise. But I think that's more a next fiscal year thing. This fiscal year I expect Prisma Access, Prisma SASE, I expect the Prisma suite to do really well and XDR to really – XDR to do really well independently. I think we'll see more and Expanse expense plus XDR in the next fiscal year. That gives you a better sense. And of course, VMs continue to do great for us because people are finally realizing you can put a virtual firewall against your third instance and they need one.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tal Liani from BofA. Okay. I don't think we have Tal. So I'll move on to our last question and will come from Brent Thill from Jefferies. 
Brent Thill: Thank you. Nikesh just on the go-to-market this year can you speak to any changes that you're making in the go-to-market motion? Is it anything new this year largely unchanged from last year?
Nikesh Arora: Brent, thanks for the question. Look last year, the year before that, when I started, we had a large kicker to get our NGS jump-started and hopefully a billion dollars ARR by the end of this fiscal year, it tells you that we were able to jumpstart it, although that caused some consternation in our product business, as you guys are fully aware of. So we normalized that last year. So we did not create that much of a jump between NGS and a product and things have stabilized. I'll tell you that the one change we've made this year and you should see it in the left side and right inside, be sure you, we have focused our cloud AI team to believe, to build ACV and ARR, right? And our Network Security business is more TCV oriented. So if you were ever to see an impact or shrubs, the way what's going on your billings versus ARR, and that's why we started this disclosure today about showing you the left-hand side is very focused on revenue, operating margin, gross margin and billings, the right-hand side is a very much an ARR business because we believe the huge opportunity we have in front of us should be focused on ACV. And that's why, answering Patrick's question about what do we do with the EAs, I don't want to, bury next-generation regarding revenue products in the EAs because sometimes the EAs you get customers buying a lot of stuff then they choose what they want to use later. I'm focused on making sure every one of our cloud and AI product gets deployed the time to value is very high or short, the time to value short and value is very high. I want to make sure there's consumption increased, I want to make sure there are contracts in place will allow people to spend more as they consume more. So the big shift we made at this time of big or minor shift is we've made sure people focus both on the ARR side and the TCV side, in our business, our sales team. As you can imagine, we didn't have an ARR business. We can report ARR, but we didn't have any ARR focus on our firewall business. I hope that helps answer the question.
Brent Thill: Thank you.
Operator: That concludes the Q&A portion of our call. Thank you all for your questions. I'm going to turn it back to Nikesh for closing remarks.
Nikesh Arora: Well thank you, Karen. And thank you everyone for dialing in. And, I want to normally not what I would do in an earning’s call but I want to applaud the work of Luis and our finance teams. This was a tough, close to get done in 10 days before our user conference. At the same time, based on your feedback, we spent a lot of time with auditors and others to make sure that we were able to show the split because all of you wanted more transparency in our cloud AI business and network security business. I hope you see, by just disclosure, we are building two great businesses at Palo Alto Networks, and we are going to continue to focus on trying to build a share of our value across both these segments and we'll keep looking as to what's the best way to increase more transparency and see if it makes sense on the longer-term to be more regular about these updates. But hopefully you found that disclosure useful. I want to thank you again. I wish your families and you have very safe and happy Thanksgiving next week. We look forward to seeing many of you in our upcoming weeks at our investor conferences. I know I'll be talking to some of you shortly after. I also want to, once again, shout out to our Palo Alto Networks family, our employees, our customers, and our entire ecosystem thank you very much, everybody. And go Palo Alto Networks.

===== 2020 Q4  (2020-08-25 16:30:00) =====
David Niederman: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Palo Alto Networks' fiscal fourth-quarter and fiscal-year 2020 financial results. I'm David Niederman, Vice President, Investor Relations. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed on the Investors section of our website at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. With me on today's call are Nikesh Arora, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Luis Visoso, our Chief Financial Officer; and Lee Klarich, our Chief Product Officer.

We'd also like to inform you that we will be virtually participating in the Citi 2020 Global Technology Conference on September 8 and the Deutsche Bank's Technology Conference on September 14. And with that, I will turn the call over to Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you, David. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our fiscal fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 results. I hope you enjoyed the video we showed you before, our employees made that to celebrate how Palo Alto Networks has responded over the course of the year. I thought it would be a fitting start to everything we're talking about today. As you can probably tell, we're delighted with our results this quarter and extremely thankful for the resilience that the team at Palo Alto Networks has shown in navigating the current environment. I cannot appreciate their efforts enough. I also want to acknowledge the challenges that people are experiencing globally as a result of COVID-19. This is a difficult time and we need to pull our strengths and find empathy to get through it. Before we talk about the quarter, I wanted to go back and remind you of the journey over the last two years. Two years ago, and my first and subsequent earnings calls, I've shared my observations about the cybersecurity industry. I talked about the need for integrated platform, need for setting platform with industry leading solutions. I also talked about the need for us to become more relevant in emerging cloud security and the need to focus on AI, ML and automation. Two years later, we are well on our way to transforming from a single product category company to a three-platform company, a company that secures the network with Strata, secures the cloud with Prisma and a platform for AI/ML applications in automation with Cortex. We have been building products and acquiring new businesses to make progress toward our vision of providing integrated solutions. We are in early stages of our journey, but excited about the progress we've been able to achieve so far. The success of our transformation has strengthened our results to double down on the growth areas in cybersecurity and aspire to be the cybersecurity partner of choice; the partner, providing integrated, comprehensive and industry-leading solutions to our customers. We've had several conversations over the last two years around our M&A approach. As you have seen, successful M&A is an integral part of our approach. We have honed a disciplined framework to ensure that the companies require our productive investment and that they fit well within our long-term strategy. We look for industry-leading solutions that prepare us for tomorrow, and we focus on integration and retaining key talent, talent that has beat all odds and build solutions designed for tomorrow. We have been able to unlock value by activating our go-to-market and customer success machines with incremental technologies to accelerate the acquired businesses. When we analyze the performance of our acquired companies, we see that we are achieving our stated goal of increasing a given target company's internal business plan by 30% to 40% in the first 12 months of bringing them into the Palo Alto Networks family. We recently reviewed the M&A history of follow the networks with our Board. I'm delighted to report that the aggregate annual run rate of all businesses that we have acquired is 4 times what it was pre-acquisition. Just as important, we've also been able to retain the key talent that had helped build the acquired company. Let's look at some of the financial highlights from this quarter, starting with NGS. Two years ago, these collective offerings made up approximately 8% of our total billings. We closed FY 2020 with $928 million in NGS billings representing approximately 20% of the total. Additionally, NGS ARR was approximately $650 million in Q4 2020. Two years ago, we didn't have products that address the automation of cloud security markets. Today, we're doing multimillion-dollar deals in these areas, creating a strong foundation for our future growth. This is one of my favorite slides. NGS is growing faster than any of the single product newer public companies in the space. Let's take a deeper look in the piece parts of NGS. Turning to Cortex. We drove incredible innovation during 2020. We established a new category by transforming EDR to XDR, delivering detection and response across not just endpoints but also firewalls and cloud assets. In November, we introduced XDR 2.0, which featured a unified management UI, powerful new endpoint features and ingestion of third-party data and alerts. XDR is rapidly gaining transaction -- traction, sorry, and is the fastest-growing product within NGS 2 in 1,000 customers. We recently added Managed Threat Hunting, industry's first threat hunting service, operating across integrated endpoint network and cloud data. Cortex XDR's momentum continues to accelerate, including a seven-figure deal with a major energy company that chose Palo Alto Network as a key partner in their digital transformation journey. Cortex XDR helped them drive down the complexity of security operations by standardizing independent detection and response tools onto one superior platform. Through Cortex XDR, they were able to significantly reduce the number of alerts that needed to be triaged and investigated by their security analysts, all while gaining holistic visibility across the enterprise. As security products get more real time, it becomes more important to manage outcomes and respond rapidly. To aid our customers, we believe it is important to have a team of trained expert professionals to support them. To that end, we announced earlier today our intention to acquire The Crypsis Group, a fast-growing cyber consulting and incident response company. This acquisition allows us to serve current and new customers across a broad order set of their cybersecurity needs. Once the transaction closes, Crypsis will bring strong incident response, forensics and consulting capabilities to our XDR portfolio. They have served more than 1,700 organizations across the healthcare, financial services, retail, e-commerce and energy industries. In addition to being able to predict and prevent cyber attacks, Cortex will also now be able to mitigate the impact of any breach that our customers may face, thus strengthening Palo Alto Networks' position as a cybersecurity partner of choice for its customers. The Crypsis team, including the CEO, will join the Cortex speedboat. Let's turn to Cortex XSOAR. XSOAR is the industry's first extended SOAR platform with native threat intelligence management. XSOAR more than doubled their customers and billings over the last year, making it one of two leading solutions in the market. With the most recent launch of the XSOAR Marketplace, we are opening up the platform to both our partners and customers to enable automation for their security solutions. One of the key wins I'm most proud to highlight for Q4 was an eight-figure Cortex XSOAR deal, with a United States government agency. Cortex XSOAR was chosen as the cornerstone of their global SOC transformation initiative, resulting in a 75% reduction in their mean time to respond by automating key security processes across the organization. COVID further put XSOAR's real-time elaboration capability into focus, allowing the agency to rapidly shift their security operations to an entirely remote model, enabling them to defend the organization without any on-site personnel. Let's shift gears to Prisma. Prisma Cloud has come a long way this past year. We started with cloud security posture management and expanded our capabilities into cloud workload protection with container security and serverless security. Prisma Cloud, has by now acquired over 1,800 customers and boast 14% of the Global 2000 list. Our integrated platform approach in cloud security is working. We signed a seven-figure deal with a Fortune 10 company who will be using Prisma Cloud for both cloud security posture management and cloud workload protection. Several Prisma Cloud customers are consolidating multiple solutions with our unified cloud security platform. Today, a third of our customers are using both these modules. We will shortly launch new cloud security modules in data security, network security and IAM security. These modules will allow us to continue to execute on our vision of creating a fully integrated cloud security platform. Prisma Cloud continues to benefit from the overall global shift to cloud computing and the customer preference for platforms. We intend to work with our customers to continue to evolve this platform to serve their cloud security needs. Let's talk about Prisma Access. Prisma Access has been through an amazing journey in the last year. Combined with our recent CloudGenix acquisition, this is the most comprehensive SASE solution in the market. Prisma Access has been a powerful security tool as our customers go through a network transformation and create robust solutions for work from home for the long term. This is showing up in our numbers, with the combination of Prisma Access and CloudGenix nearly doubling their customer accounts over the past two years and achieving $90 million in billings in our fiscal fourth quarter. We are very excited to sign a nearly eight-figure deal with a major healthcare provider for Prisma Access in the fourth quarter, winning against a competitor by providing clear evidence that our solution provides the most effective security for their needs. Additionally, we saw very strong conversion of Prisma Access trials that were launched in response to COVID and work from home. A notable example is a major enterprise that called us on the first Friday of COVID lockdown because their data center lacked sufficient bandwidth for all of their remote employees. By Monday, they had 1,000 users up and running. And by Wednesday, they have shifted enough users as pressure on data center relieved. This quickly became their secure work-from-home solution, and they are now looking to extend Prisma Access out to all branch offices replacing their existing provider. We have many more similar examples of customers converting from Prisma Access trials, and we're delighted to have been able to help companies and the people remaining productive during this challenging time. While NGS is an important part of our go-forward strategy, we are equally proud of our progress and success of our firewall business. Recognized as an eight-time Gartner Magic Quadrant leader, we continue to relentlessly innovate to stay ahead of the pack. We continue to believe that firewall capability is essential and needs to evolve to deliver capability across all customer needs. Hence, we've been offering a consistent approach in our hardware, software and now containerized firewalls, and are also able to deliver them in the cloud with Prisma Access. We introduced our new PAN-OS 10.0 that features the industry's first machine learning-based powered next-generation firewall with advanced telemetry capabilities, the ability to secure containers, simplified decryption and many more groundbreaking features. To truly enable the firewall platform, we have worked on services that work seamlessly apart of our platform. The launch of IoT security subscription is our most recent example. In the last 18 months, we have doubled our subscription offerings from four to eight. DNS Security, which was launched in Q3 2019, has been our fastest-growing subscription with over 15% attach rate and now over 3,000 customers. Our software and next-generation firewalls continue to shine. VM-Series continues to capture new customers at a rapid rate with over 9,000 customers now using VM-Series, many of which are consumed through cloud marketplaces. And with the introduction of CN-Series, we can now apply next-generation firewall capabilities to containerize environments on-prem or in the cloud with consistent security and policy. Turning to the topic of COVID-19 and its impact on both the global economy and our business. When we met with you to review our fiscal Q3 results in May, the pandemic was still in early stages. As we speak with our customers, we hear and see a range of impact and feedback. Many companies are becoming more cost and cash conscious. Companies are also adapting to the new environment by accelerating investment in technologies to ensure the more dispersed work is secured. I believe that we are in the very early stages of this acceleration and that the next several years present significant opportunities for cybersecurity as an industry and Palo Alto Networks in particular. For our own old employees, the second half of our fiscal 2020 was indelibly marked by COVID-19. We responded quickly, taking rapid action to ensure the safety of our employees by establishing protocols and tools to work from home. We quickly gather our early efforts and named it FLEXWORK, recognizing that we were in the early stages. Today, I'm delighted to announce that we're launching the next phase of FLEXWORK to help our employees maintain health while being in productivity during COVID-19. The FLEXWORK program includes a broad range of initiatives, including FLEXbenefits and FLEXlearn. These initiatives will ensure that our people can choose benefits that make most sense for their working family environments and follow personalized learning paths designed to help them do their jobs and manage team remotely. We plan to give our employees an additional allowance of $1,000, the choice of various flexible benefits, and over time, we intend to individualize benefits, making them an employee choice. Even with all the challenges presented by COVID, the Palo Alto Networks teams have been able to adapt and maintain focus, allowing us to post some great results. I know we cannot sit on the progress achieved so far and need to focus on what is ahead. As I mentioned, we are pleased with our progress so far. Yet, we have a lot of work ahead of us. The macro environment, while better than we anticipated, is still uncertain. Here's what you can expect from us in 2021. We will continue to invest in our next-generation security and security subscriptions, both through organic and inorganic means to continue our transformation journey. We will do so in a financially prudent manner as we have been able to demonstrate. You can expect us to manage our organic operating margin in line with what was achieved this year. The work-from-home transition has created a challenge in the industry around hardware, and we expect this trend to continue. We have been shifting our customers to software delivered security and we plan to continue to do so. We expect most of our growth to come from software and services. While there are some cost savings due to COVID, we are planning to reinvest those savings toward our employees. We'll be more generous over the coming years to drive this transition to a FLEXWORK environment. In the words of my friend, Mark Benioff, we will be responsive to and support all of our stakeholders, not just our shareholders, because we believe that is how true value is created in the long term. I want to thank our amazing employees and partners for their contributions. Our success is only possible through our combined efforts. Now I want to take the opportunity to welcome Luis to Palo Alto Networks. Luis joined us almost two months ago from Amazon's AWS division and has been rapidly learning all things cybersecurity. We're extremely fortunate to have an executive Luis' caliber to lead our CFO organization. With that, I will turn the call over to Luis.
Luis Visoso: Thank you, Nikesh, for a warm welcome. When I wasn't here for the first two years of the transformation, I can clearly see that it is working, and we're only getting started. I'm encouraged by the value that Palo Alto Networks can create going forward. And I look forward meeting you in the upcoming events. Moving on to our results. I'd like to note that except for revenue and billings, our financial figures are non-GAAP and growth rates are compared to the prior-year periods unless stated otherwise. As Nikesh indicated, we had an extremely strong finish to our fiscal year, with fiscal Q4 billings of $1.39 billion, an increase of 32% year over year. Our Next-Generation Security business is performing strongly, with NGN billings of $357 million, which grew 86% year over year. Firewall as a Platform billings, which includes physical firewalls, VM, Prisma Access and CloudGenix grew 19%. In the fourth quarter, we beat our guidance across all guided metrics. Total revenue grew 18% to $950.4 million. For the fiscal year, we reported total revenue of $3.4 billion, an 18% increase year over year. Looking at growth by geography, Q4 revenue in the Americas grew 18%, EMEA grew 20% and APAC grew 16%. Q4 product revenue of $305.6 million was flat compared to the prior year. Q4 subscription revenue of $389.8 million increased 33%. Support revenue of $255 million increased 23%. In total, subscriptions and support revenue of $644.8 million increased 29% and accounted for 68% of total revenue. Turning to billings. Q4 total billings of $1.39 billion, net of acquired deferred revenue, increased 32%, driven by strong execution across the company, work-from-home tailwinds and continued success in Next-Generation Security. The dollar-weighted contract duration for new subscriptions and support billings in the quarter remained at approximately three years, flat year over year. We closed five additional Palo Alto Networks Financial Services deal, enabling our business by offering greater flexibility to customers. Our fiscal 2020 total billings were $4.3 billion, up 23% year over year. Product billing's were $1.07 billion, a decrease of 3% year over year and represent 25% of total billings. Support billings were $1.21 billion, up 28% and represented 28% of total billings. And subscription support -- sorry, and subscription billings were $2.02 billion, an increase of 40% year over year and represented 47% of total billings. Total deferred revenue at the end of Q4 was $3.8 billion, an increase of 32% year over year. In the fourth quarter, we continued to add new customers at a healthy clip, adding approximately 2,400 new customers in the quarter. We also continue to increase our share of wallet of existing customers. Our top 25 customers, all of which made a purchase this quarter, spent a minimum of $55.3 million in lifetime value through the end of fiscal Q4 2020, a 35% increase over the $40.9 million in the comparable prior-year period. Q4 gross margin was 74.3%, which was down 320 basis points compared to last year, as some of our fastest-growing products are still gaining the scale required to have the right cost structure and higher freight costs associated with COVID. We expect these headwinds to continue into fiscal-year 2021. Q4 operating margin was 19.8%, a decline of 180 basis points year over year and includes the impact of approximately $14 million of net expense associated with our recent acquisitions. For full fiscal-year 2020, operating margin was 17.6%, a decrease of 440 basis points year over year, compared to fiscal-year 2019 operating margin of 22%, and includes the impact of approximately $23 million of net expense associated with our recent acquisitions. We ended the fourth quarter with 8,014 employees. On a GAAP basis, for the fourth quarter, net loss increased 182% year over year to $58.9 million or $0.61 per basic and diluted share. For the full fiscal-year 2020, GAAP net loss increased 226% year over year to $267 million or $2.76 per basic and diluted share. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter decreased 1% year over year to $144.9 million or $1.48 per diluted share. For the full fiscal-year 2020, non-GAAP net income decreased 10% year over year to $484.6 million or $4.88 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for Q4 was 22%. Turning to cash flow and balance sheet items. We finished July with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $4.3 billion. This includes net cash of approximately $2 billion raised through the June 2020 offering of convertible senior notes due in 2025. Q4 cash flow from operations of $333.7 million increased by 44% year over year. Free cash flow was $301.9 million, up 69% at a margin of 31.8%. Capital expenditure in the quarter was $31.8 million. DSO was 81 days, an increase 26 days from the prior-year period, reflecting strong billings at the end of the quarter that will be collected in 2021. Lastly, in fiscal Q4, we completed a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction announced in February, where we retired a total of 5.2 million shares. For the first fiscal quarter of 2021, we expect billings to be in the range of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion, an increase of 15% to 17% year over year. We expect revenue to be in the range of $915 million to $925 million, an increase of 19% to 20% year over year. We expect noncash EPS in the range of $1.32 to $1.35 using 99 million to 101 million shares. We do not expect Crypsis to have a material impact to Q1 results. Additionally, I would like to provide some additional modeling points. We expect non-GAAP effective tax rate to remain at 22%. Capex will be approximately $35 million to $40 million. Turning to the full fiscal-year 2021, I would like to provide a few markers on how we expect to perform. We expect billings to grow in the mid-teens and revenue to grow the high teens, with product revenue flat to slightly down year over year. As Nikesh mentioned, we expect flat organic operating margins as we continue to invest in NGS and our employees during COVID times. EPS is expected to grow in the low to mid-teens as we face headwinds from lower interest income. Lastly, we expect our annual free cash flow margin to be consistent with 2020 margins. To note, we expect Q1 free cash flow margin to be higher than the year due to strong Q4 '20 billings. With that, I'd like to open the call for questions. David, please poll for questions.
A - David Niederman: Thanks, Luis. [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Saket Kalia from Barclays. And our second question will come from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.
Saket Kalia: OK. Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question here. And welcome, Luis. Look forward to working with you. Nikesh, a lot to talk about on the next-gen security side. But maybe just to get it out of the way and touch on the core firewall business, can you just talk about what you saw this quarter in terms of customers' appetite for appliances? And which attached subscriptions perhaps maybe surprised you to the upside?
Nikesh Arora: Well, Saket, thank you very much for your question. Look, as we've been talking about the macro environment for a while now, and a lot of customers are not in their offices. When customers are not in their office, it's very hard for hardware to be delivered or POCs to happen. So we are calling that hardware is going to continue to be a tough business in the next 12 months. We saw appetite from existing customers who are expanding their state who are getting more firewalls because they need more capacity. You don't see as much new firewall business out there or new hardware business out there. So we have to be very careful and cautious around it, but we are seeing that being supplemented by a lot more software-based solutions. So you saw the success and strength in Prisma Access. You all success in our VMs. So we are seeing people step up and solve that problem using our software solutions more and more. And in cases where they need more capacity for more VPNs or more remote users, they are expanding capacity of firewalls or if they are going to a cycle where there are some firewalls getting end of life, they are doing a refresh in those cases. But in terms of subscriptions, I have to say, as I highlighted, DNS, which we launched in Q3 2019, has hit 3,000 customers mark. We are in the process of allowing subscription capability in the future on software firewall format. So you will see us continue to drive the subscription thing with early priority, but we have a lot of expectation of IoT because we believe that's an important need from the enterprise perspective. So we have launched B1 with our most recent MLR firewall, and we hope to be able to add more enhancements to IoT and make a success of that as well. This is hardware, I can see myself. I'm used to doing this on the earnings call.
David Niederman: Great. Our next question comes from Keith from Morgan Stanley.
Keith Weiss: Thank you, guys, for taking the question. And a very nice quarter. Really impressive overall billings, as well as those next-gen security billings really sustaining a ton of momentum. I wanted to tack on to Saket's question. And better understand, when we think about the kind of the overall firewall platform billings growing 19%, that's a very impressive number. Is there a substitution effect going on? And is there any way that you could quantify that in terms of people taking Prisma Cloud versus taking firewalls and maybe some substitution of dollars going from one side of the equation to the other versus product revenues?
Nikesh Arora: Yeah. Thanks, Keith, for the question. I think yeah, there is substitution going on. If you look at the example I highlighted in the call, where one of our customers was running out of capacity in their data center to be able to remote secure access and we went and deployed Prisma Access. They got 1,000 people live and -- over the weekend. They got more people live by the end next -- the following week, and now they're going to go put Prisma Access is across the entire state, across all their offices, and that would have been a box sale. Two years ago, that will mean more boxes in data center running VPN. So there's clear substitution going on. Prisma Access is substituting hardware. Now I like it because: A, it's a software form factor, which means we can update and upgrade that software on a more regular basis in hardware. So the customer has to do the updates and upgrades, and which is where the security risk comes in. So for us, having software form factors out there is a long-term amazing total cost of ownership benefit, not just for us, but our customers, allow us to keep updating security as we go on. So yes, the substitution is happening. It's happening from the hardware format to the software format in the case of Prisma Access. Or take the case when a customer says, as we at Palo Alto Networks, we have significantly shrunk our data center capacity. We basically shifted all of our own compute to Google Cloud or to AWS. And when that happens, we're not deploying more hardware in our data centers, we're actually buying more cloud from the public cloud providers. And to protect ourselves in those situations, we're putting our VM-Series firewalls or our CN-Series firewalls in the future against our cloud incident. So that's, again, because we're moving to the cloud, we're substituting our own hardware purchases or our own hardware deployment with what is a containerized or a VM firewall. So in both cases, you're seeing the substitution happen. That's why we've been talking about this Firewall as a Platform number for the last year and a half, saying, look, pay attention to that number because when these substitutions happen, some vendors or some partners or some industry players have some of those solutions, not all of them. And the virtue of us having all three form factors, whether a cloud-based firewall or a firewall that can operate in the hardware form factor or to Prisma Access or against the public cloud instance that allows us consistency and allows us to pitch the right firewall for the right situation.
David Niederman: Our next question will come from Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo. Then we'll have Walt Pritchard from Citigroup.
Phil Winslow: Great. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a strong quarter. Wanted to focus in on just the go-to-market effort. Wondering if you can give us an update heading into this fiscal year, how do you feel about sales productivity, sales capacity and also just the incentive structure? And anything that you're changing this year, any priority focuses for fiscal '21?
Nikesh Arora: Well, we're going to make sure that we don't do what we did two years ago, that's your question. I don't want to use the word unprecedented because I think it's been used too often. But launching it -- right now, we're going through our sales kickoff. We've gone from a three-day event, which used to be physical last year in Vegas, and I'm not missing Vegas, but is turning to a six-week learning journey, and we're instrumented everything online, where people have to go through the learning process, and they're going to upload their video pitches up into a platform and each of them are going to rate each other and critic other. So we are all learning with the times in terms of how to go sort of initialize a sales force and new fiscal year. And I think our teams are doing a really good job of making that happen. So from that perspective, I am not concerned about our ability to go out there and create the opportunities from our sales teams. I think the real question going into next year is how do we continue to maintain the momentum. And as I've said, we intend to keep investing in our transformation that we've done so far with next generation security. We're all very pleased. If you'd asked me at the Analyst Day two years ago, what did -- one year ago, what did I think were the biggest risk was? My biggest risk was can we get to $805 million of billings for Next-Generation Security because they're all sort of somewhat fledgling businesses we bought, we were going to integrate them. We're going to go and convince customers that this is the right way to go buy cybersecurity. And $928 million of billings, just was a welcome surprise also for us in a good way. Our teams love the products. Our customers are loving the product. So we're just going to try and keep that momentum going into next year. All of our sales tweaks or commission tweaks or go-to-market weeks that we make are going to be aligned toward meeting the objectives that we set out to ourselves. So we're hoping not to make any major shifts yet keep doing and investing in the direction that the teams have shown success in so far.
Phil Winslow: Great. Thanks, Nikesh. And should we expect Nir to drop an electronic flute this coming fiscal year?
Nikesh Arora: You know what? That video was sent to me by an employee two days ago, and it was very sort of amazing that they put it together, we thought it was a worthwhile thing to show. And I don't even know where or when Nir was caught playing the electric flute. My son trying to jump on my back while working on, so -- David?
Phil Winslow: Awesome. Well, thanks, guys.
David Niederman: Great. Can we go to Walt from Citigroup, please? Walt?
Walt Pritchard: Hi. Thanks. Yes. I'm here. So just a question on margins. I guess you took on pretty significant margin dilution in fiscal 2020. Could you help us understand the puts and takes around margins as we head into '21? And especially, you've seen that revenue on those acquisitions, it sounds like ramp quite a bit and take care of some of that dilution. Can you help us understand where the incremental investments are going relative to keeping those margins flat?
Nikesh Arora: Yeah. Well, I think if you think about the success in NGS, so what we did was we deployed a speedboat model, which was we created a dedicated sales team that was helping us sell Prisma Cloud and helping us sell Cortex and Cortex XSOAR. And now what we're doing is we're trying to, a, keep that momentum. You saw that we grew that number 105%. And that requires us to make sure we continue to invest in the sales team, which can actually go compete with some of the other players in the market. And go into hand-to-hand combat for some of the larger deals. What we've also done is we're deploying that capability across our entire core sales team, what they are able to take the products and done with it. So we track very carefully how people are spending time and how much of our new products they're able to sell. So we're glad that the proportion of our sales teams that are able to sell Next-Generation Security continues to rise, which is a good thing. But we continue to hope to make investments in that direction. The other part, which Luis alluded to, is that as we see ramp-up in next-generation security because there's a significant amount of deployment expense and consulting expense, which is a one-time expense that happens early in the life cycle of us deploying this product, you see that we have some compression in the first year of the margin, both on the gross margin, the operating margin both sides when we deploy the services. So it's really -- you're seeing the margin impact of the significant ramp-up of our growth in Next-Generation Security. Luis, do you want to add something?
Luis Visoso: No. I think you covered it well, Nikesh. Nothing to add.
Walt Pritchard: Thank you.
David Niederman: Great. Our next question will come from Fatima Boolani from UBS and following Fatima, we'll have Sterling Auty from JP Morgan.
Fatima Boolani: Great. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Either for Nikesh or Luis, nice to meet you. I wanted to drill into your fiscal '21 outlook, appreciate sort of the high level trajectory of the key metrics in the business. But as I triangulate between a near triple-digit growth in your NGS portfolio, which is now a fifth of the mix. As I think about the software business contribution accelerating and even substituting hardware, I'm wondering what's may be underpinning some of your conservatism on a mid-teens outlook. Would love to get some of your puts and takes and your thought process behind that outlook relative to the 32% you did this quarter?
Luis Visoso: Yeah. Thank you for the question, and nice to meet you. I think there -- we should take to account two factors. One is the strong performance of Palo Alto Networks, right? So we're performing very strongly, and you see that in our Q4 results, and you see that in our guidance. But we -- there is still a lot of uncertainty out there, and we want to be prudent as we give guidance for the year or as we set our framework for the full year. So we just want to be prudent as we think about it, just given the uncertainty.
David Niederman: Great. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty from J.P. Morgan.
Sterling Auty: Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. So I want to drill into the acquisition of Crypsis. So we're watching FireEye actually separate their product business from their services business. And I just want to make sure, is there an intention with this acquisition to have the incident response actually drive follow through purchasing of products. Is that what you're looking to accomplish with it? Or is it a different strategy in terms of the acquisition?
Nikesh Arora: Sterling, that's a great question, and I would not comment on FireEye. But we have noticed when it comes to XDR, the customers are both excited about having a managed capability around it, as well as we've noticed that in the case of incident response, typically, if you have a good set of products, and those products help you protect in that or help you diagnose during that incident, the customers are reasonably keen on deploying those products on a larger scale. We've experienced that with XDR even without having incident response team. We've been called in by many of our large customers in certain cases where we've gone on sort of -- on a partnership basis, gone and help them in the case of an incident or in the case of a breach. And almost all times, invariably, the customers have actually embraced XDR and deployed it in large numbers. So we've noticed that, and we believe that if we had a team that was being sort of canvassed and asked to come in and do -- help in this case, Crypsis has done 1,700 such responses from an incident perspective, we think the upsell or cross-sell possibility for XDR, if it's the right product, in that instance, is huge. So we think -- I think this will significantly allow us to amplify our success in XDR in the future.
David Niederman: Our next question will come from Catharine Trebnick from Colliers, and then we'll have Patrick Colville from Deutsche Bank.
Catharine Trebnick: All right. Nice quarter, gentlemen, and thank you for taking my question. During the quarter, several of the IT executives they spoke to, attacked a lot about Microsoft and the native firewall. Could you drill down for us on your capabilities versus theirs of where you think they are in achieving growth through their native firewall? Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: Well, thank you for asking the question. And I was hoping that there'll be a question whether I can point to Lee because he is wearing his nice cream shirt today. So Lee?
Lee Klarich: Thank you, Nikesh. Good question, Catharine. What we have seen relative to the cloud providers is they -- it's very important to them to have a set of security capabilities that helps remove certain obstacles for getting customers to consume more and more cloud, but not necessarily going to the level of true enterprise class. And I think that's the underpinning of our success with VM-Series and just recently released CN-Series, Prisma Cloud as well. We're really focused on bringing the enterprise-class capabilities that our customers expect in a much more tightly integrated fashion, and being able to then take those capabilities and go multi-cloud, as well as hybrid cloud. And so one of the key differences in our approach is our ability to support our larger customers as they have multi-cloud strategies, whereas the cloud providers themselves are almost by definition, going to be single cloud in their solutions.
David Niederman: Great. Now we'll have Patrick Colville from Deutsche Bank.
Patrick Colville: Thank you for taking my question, and congrats on a great quarter. Can we just talk about the products, fiscal '21 kind of color you gave. I appreciate the world is changing. We're going to more software-driven world, nonetheless hardware. But the guidance you gave is suggestive of kind of market share bleed to Fortinet and Check Point. And so just any thoughts around does that matter? Are you guys now more focused on the kind of software components? Just help us, I guess, get your thinking around the hardware side and what used to be the core business.
Nikesh Arora: Yeah. I think, Patrick, thank you for the question. I don't get to the same conclusion. So the way we think about the firewall platform, as you see, we consider a situation where we sell Prisma Access could have been a hardware situation. And if you sold Prisma Access with CloudGenix and SD-WAN solution, we think that's a like-for-like deal where we're not losing market share. And the reason we've been talking about Firewall as a Platform last half and a year or so is when we look at market share from the firewall perspective and say, am I selling more firewalling capability than the industry growth rate. I think the industry growth of firewalls is in the low single-digit range. And if we can deliver Firewall as a Platform growth rates in the high teens, that's a good outcome for us. So we grew Firewall as a Platform at 19% industry probably grew 3%, 4%. We think we took share. I took share with software, which I think is in the long term, much better outcome for us, that could allows us to leave our customers in a better situation. And also, it's not a hardware dependent business where there's more risk. So we don't -- you don't get to the same conclusion on loss of market share. As long as I'm growing Firewall as a Platform in the ranges that we have, I think, we're taking share. We may be shifting share, to the earlier question, from hardware to software, but we don't have an intention of losing any share to anybody in the market. Hopefully, we intend to gain share in the market. And I think you have to look at it more holistically across what Zscaler is doing, what Check Point is doing, what Microsoft firewalls are doing, what our firewalls are doing. If you look at that as a total firewall market, we want to be growing that share of that pie. And even the current environment, as I've said, it's very hard to go deploy hardware or sell hardware customers because many of them are not there in the office to take delivery and do proof of concept even. So we're delighted that we have software form factors to be able to sell them in this environment and deploy them remotely because that's what the customers are looking for right now.
Patrick Colville: Thanks for the color.
David Niederman: Our next question comes from Rob Owens from Piper Sandler, and then we'll Brian Essex from Goldman Sachs.
Rob Owens: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to drill down a little bit more into Prisma Cloud and some of the newer offerings that you guys discussed relative to data security, network security and IAM. Are those products going to be from Palo Alto exclusively? Would we expect you to partner with some of the other vendors in the market? Any incremental color in terms of timing or functionality be appreciated. Thanks.
Nikesh Arora: So I'm going to give you a perspective, and I'm going to ask Lee to jump in and talk about the margin. Look, one of the points of view we have taken as we deploy our next-generation of products, whether it's cloud security or Cortex, we have tried to make sure that we give the customers the best-of-breed integrated solution for cloud security. So when we bought RedLock, we bought Twistlock and PureSec and Aporeto, we made sure they were integrated into one platform. The way we sell it is we go to a customer and say, buy credits. Our customers buy credits to use our products. And we keep introducing these new modules within our product and as the customers experience their product, they start exploring these new modules and start using them, which keeps decrementing credit. So we're trying to create scale from a go-to-market perspective and provide them the best capabilities. So toward that end, the 1,800 customers we have for Prisma Cloud, these customers barring on-prem versus cloud versions, they will have the opportunity of experiencing every one of our modules without having to come out and buy it from us. They would already have it as part of the product. And if they choose to use it, they will decrement their credits faster. So that's our strategy. And toward that end, we believe that the true benefit for the security solution of the customer, as well as for us economically is if we don't have to go do a sort of a sales role every time that we are launching a new module because we believe cloud security is not fully developed as a platform. So we will have seven modules sometime later today, and I'll let Lee talk about the future functionality.
Lee Klarich: Yeah. So one of the very strong points of feedback we're hearing from our customers with Prisma Cloud is our ability to give them both breadth of capability, as well as depth in those capabilities is really resonating. They like the strategy of an integrated platform, delivering increasingly comprehensive set of cloud security capabilities that they need. So with that in mind, these three new modules that will be coming out, we expect this fiscal quarter are really exciting. The first one is data security. So this is effectively applying both DOP, as well as malware scanning to cloud storage. Cloud storage -- basically, data breaches is one of the big challenges a lot of customers deal with. And this module will aim to address and fix that. Second is a module focused on web application and API security. So this will play in the sort of the WAF and RASP market categories. And fully integrated, leveraging the exact same agent that our customers have already deployed when using us to do container and serverless security. And then IAM security, which is focused on the cloud credentials that customers have and a really big challenge around overprovisioning and permissioning of those credentials. And so this will give visibility, as well as security around how to lock those down with the right security policy and then tying this back to what cash as these new modules are available, our Prisma Cloud customers will simply be able to start using them, and decrementing the capacity they've already purchased from, is making the -- turning on and using these new modules super simple.
Rob Owens: Thanks.
David Niederman: Next question is from Brian Essex from Goldman Sachs.
Brian Essex: Great. Thank you. Thank you for taking the question. Nikesh, I just had a quick question on OS 10 and saw that you released it a few weeks ago. And I was wondering how meaningful that cycle should be relative to other releases. Is that something that customers are going to get automatically with their subscription? And how might we expect this to be rolled out throughout your installed base?
Nikesh Arora: So the -- obviously, super excited about the release and all of the capabilities, the ML powered next-gen firewall really just infusing machine learning into the core of the product. I'd say to begin with any of our customers who have a hardware device or a software form factor able to use it. However, they need to be on some of the newer hardware platforms. So this will incent some customers who are still on older generation of hardware to want to upgrade in order to get these capabilities. Second, this is the release that will unlock some of the newer subscriptions we talked about, including IoT security. And so there will be added incentive for our customers to get to 10.0 in order to take advantage of those new subscriptions.
Brian Essex: Great. Thank you very much.
David Niederman: Our next question will come from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Following Brent, we'll have Jonathan Ho from William Blair.
Brent Thill: Great. Nikesh, over the last year, you're now approximating well north of $800 million in M&A. We appreciate the payback that you gave us, but kind of just maybe give us a sense, do you expect this pace to continue? Or do you feel like you need to digest what you have now and you've got the core pieces to achieve would you like go forward at this point?
Nikesh Arora: Brent, as we highlighted in the prepared remarks, we have followed a very disciplined approach. We look at -- we're constantly looking at new cybersecurity capabilities in the industry. As you know that as soon as Antidote is found toward a cyber breach tactic, the hackers start working the next way to try and figure out how to hack the customers. So we have to be constantly on the lookout. And we've taken a very, very proactive point of view that we don't want our customers have to go integrate these solutions themselves, which is what causes the chaos in cybersecurity. So we've stepped up and said, we're going to become more and more comprehensive player in areas where we believe we can add value. So we're not going to -- we don't see value in going after old red oceans where there's enough players in the market. And we're not trying to create a place to get everything. We're trying to get to a place where the product that we deliver or the platform we deliver has all comprehensive capability. And as I've said, cloud security is not fully evolved because we are all moving to the cloud and discovering across the entire process. And our customers are having to integrate some solutions. That's why we've chosen to acquire some companies but also build these next few modules that Lee highlighted internally organically because we believe the cost of integration will be higher than doing organic development ourselves. So we're just -- we're constantly on the lookout to make sure that we are solving the problem with the customer. We will continue to stay on the lookout, Brent. And all we're trying to highlight is that we're not -- we're very thoughtful when we do M&A. We look at it both from an economic and a product perspective. And so far, our track record has shown that we are able to significantly accelerate the capabilities once we acquire these companies, both from a go-to-market perspective or a product perspective, and we're going to continue looking at the market from that lens.
David Niederman: Jonathan Ho, William Blair.
Jonathan Ho: Great. Just with Strata, can you talk a little bit about whether -- where you're seeing the fastest growth in terms of that product set? And digital transformation maybe create a second wave of security investment around the CN-Series and some of the other products in Strata?
Lee Klarich: Jonathan, so to your first question, where we're seeing the fastest growth. I mean I think, obviously, as you've seen, we're seeing great growth across the platform. [Indiscernible] Firewall as a Platform and inclusive of Prisma Access and the newly integrate CloudGenix, Prisma Cloud, certainly with the recent acceleration of the shift to cloud, Prisma Cloud has been a fantastic cloud security platform available for our customers to help them in that shift. And Cortex is really gaining traction both around XSOAR and XDR.
David Niederman: Great. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick, Credit Suisse. And this will be our final question.
Brad Zelnick: Thanks so much for fitting me in, and congratulations on the momentum into Q4, very impressive. I got an easy one for you guys. I just wanted to ask about the spike in DSOs. So it's completely natural to understand why this quarter you would see the month of July being so heavily back-end weighted. But if you were to normalize and assume a more normal linearity to this Q4, how much of this is because of extending payment terms, if at all? And what are you seeing with customers and their need to spread out payments? Thank you.
Luis Visoso: Yeah. That's an easy question, as you said. No, we do not expect any -- from any structural changes. We do expect to get back to a normal level in Q1. [Indiscernible] this is how our billings came in Q4, but we don't expect this to be an issue going forward.
David Niederman: That concludes the Q&A portion of our call. Thank you for all your questions. Back to Nikesh for closing remarks.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you, again, everyone, for joining us today. Palo Alto Networks remains committed to helping our employees, partners and customers navigate the challenges posed by global pandemic in every way we can. We're striving to empathize with those suffering from the worst impacts and then help in our communities and networks where possible. I'm encouraged by the positive attitude and teamwork I see on display from our committed employees, and this helps fuel our drive to continue our mission of making each day safer and more secure than ever before. We look forward to connect virtually with all of you at one of the many upcoming investor calls. Be safe and stay healthy. Thank you again for joining our call. Have a great evening.
David Niederman: You can now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-05-21 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello. Welcome to the Q3 Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Call for Palo Alto Networks. This call is being recorded and will be accessible on the Palo Alto Networks Investor Relations website. Now, I'd like to turn it over to David Niederman, Vice President of Investor Relations.

And with that, I will turn the call over to Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you, David. Good afternoon. Thank you to everyone joining our first video earnings call. I appreciate you being patient as we experiment with a Zoom earnings call. Before I comment on our results, I'd like to thank our employees, our partners, suppliers for the tremendous dedication and commitment they've shown over the last few months. I couldn't be prouder of our teams who’ve worked tirelessly to ensure the security needs of our customers were met in this uncertain environment. It is important to note, our last month of this quarter saw a majority of the world under lockdown. And to be able to deliver these results in these times is a testament to the strength of our teams and our partner ecosystem. As a company, we responded quickly, we've made the transition to nearly 100% remote workforce without a hitch. Focus on the well-being of our employees, we moved to work from home in early March, ahead of local ordinances. With the global team whose mission is enabling our customers to work securely, no matter where they are, we were well-equipped with the tools, technologies and security to work safely from home. Our teams have been hard at work in recent months, helping our customers adjust to entire organizations working from home. This change has prompted companies to rethink how they manage data and applications no longer protected by hardened corporate network parameters. As always, Palo Alto Networks has served as a trusted partner to our customers. Our teams rallied to help customers secure remote workers and provide expanded infrastructure security quickly, encompassing thousands of workers across multiple locations. We have over 1,500 customers just in the past six weeks, using our free trials for remote secure access, which we enabled in the middle of March. The feedback we have received from customers has been gratifying. And we look forward to the opportunity to continue to serve them, potentially across even more areas of our platform. Additionally, we have offered extended payment terms and financing options to some of our customers that have been financially impacted by COVID-19. In the same vein, we launched Palo Alto Networks Financial Services, LLC, or as we will call it PANFS, a financing company within Palo Alto Networks created to offer flexible financial solutions for our products and services, supporting enterprise customers looking for large, multi-year engagements. We closed our first ever financing transaction at the end of the quarter, with a large multinational customer, providing the customer with flexible payment terms. Given the current environment and the fundamental changes that are occurring around us, I feel it's important to articulate our view of the path forward. I've elaborated those views and how we are preparing ourselves as a company, in a letter to our stockholders, we published today, and is available on our Investor Relations website. Let me touch on a few highlights over here. We expect this pandemic shock to last 12 to 18 months, before our customers return to a new normal. And we expect the enterprise and cybersecurity industry will have a bumpy ride over the next few nine months. As strategies for reopening the economy start to emerge, some likely to be more successful than the others. Given our outlook over the next 12 to 18 months, we're announcing FLEXWORK, a new way of working for Palo Alto Networks. With FLEXWORK a few essential employees will be encouraged to come into our office, while others will choose how many days they wish to spend in our offices. For employees choosing to work in the office, we will ensure social distancing and all local safety regulations are followed. The health and safety of our employees is our top priority. Let's focus on industry trends. These changes in consumer behavior will impact industry, and we will see winners and losers. We believe the largest companies with strong balance sheets are poised to become even larger. In all the industries, those companies supporting a mobile and cloud-based consumer workforce will surely benefit. We will certainly see new businesses emerge, which we have not yet envisioned. To ensure their future success, we expect businesses to accelerate their technology investments. A recent survey by Fortune magazine showed that three-fourths of Fortune 500 CEOs believe the crisis will force their companies to accelerate their technological transformation. Businesses that have relied upon physical presence will focus on automation and technology transitions. The cloud transformation should accelerate and remote work infrastructures will become more robust, necessary across most organizations. As a consequence, networking architecture will need to change to support the transformation to the cloud. Let's talk about the outlook for cybersecurity. The accelerated move to the cloud is attracting the attention of cyber criminals. Data breaches in cloud delivered services will accelerate as many InfoSec and DevOps organizations in their rush to the cloud, have not yet brought their cloud security posture to the level of their traditional data centers. This will drive the need for increased cloud security investment, especially in technologies that secure multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud environments. Moving away from relying primarily in physical offices and physical data centers to emphasizing remote work, and the cloud will also prompt the redesign of wide area networks. This provides an opportunity to finally realize the long held vision of networking and network security coming together, as detailed recently by Gartner, in their new SASE, or Secure Access Service Edge framework. The infrastructure changes that are needed to provide effective cybersecurity in this new reality, provide an opportunity for organizations to significantly reduce the numbers of point product solution and vendors, by moving to platforms, implemented consistent security across the entire infrastructure, physical, virtual and cloud delivered, as well as across network endpoint of cloud, moving security from physical to software as a service, securing the cloud with a single platform and automating their security operations.  As the largest enterprise security company in the world, our security proposition offering more integrated and automated solutions to secure data regardless where it is, should position us well for the transformation we anticipate. Our goal is to leverage our advantage and come through this unprecedented event, even stronger and more resilient than before. Let's turn to our Q3 '20 results. As I think about our results in the context of this pandemic, I'm extremely pleased with our performance. Fiscal Q3 was the second highest quarter in the company's history, with billings of $1.02 billion, an increase of 24% year-over-year. Given that half the quarter was impacted by the COVID-19-related shutdowns, this result is even more exciting. I'd like to share a few key deals in the quarter that illustrate the power of our comprehensive approach to security, as well as a strength in our installed base. A Fortune 10 company demonstrated their commitment to Palo Alto Networks, by expanding with 8 figure deal and a multi-year enterprise support agreement. We're also working with this customer on an extensive proof-of-concept for cloud security. We continue to solidify our role as a strategic security partner of this U.S. retailer that we highlighted in fiscal Q1 and Q2. This quarter, we won another seven figure deal as a part of their continuous large-scale transformation project, where they purchased enterprise agreements for VM-Series, additional Cortex XSOAR licenses, again validating their selection of XSOAR for the security operation center. We won a seven figure deal with a major New York healthcare provider, who expanded with Palo Alto Networks by purchasing Prisma Access, VM-Series, Prisma Cloud, Cortex Data Lake and adding new line cards to existing next generation firewall chassis. Let's now look at the three pillars of our security offerings, starting with Strata. We made good progress on the product challenges that we faced in the first six months of our fiscal year. We now believe those challenges are behind us. We saw an improvement in our firewall as a platform billings, which grew 13% year-over-year. We expect our firewall as a platform growth to exceed the growth of the market, which we believe is 6% to 8%. So we're delighted with a return to above industry average growth. A good example of our success in Strata this quarter was a seven figure deal we won, that brought together three different ministries, of a European government agency to migrate both the state network and the education network to Palo Alto Networks next generation firewall. In this COVID-19 environment, we saw some of our customers enable remote access, by turning on our GlobalProtect solution, and it adds subscription to firewall. In this quarter we added more than 1,000 customers to our remote work GlobalProtect subscription. As an example of this solution, a leading clinical research hospital was able to scale their environment to provide remote access securely for their entire user community within 48 hours. The robustness and simplicity of solution enabled them to make this transition quickly, and even more importantly, seamlessly. We continue to innovate in this category. Coming in mid-June, we will launch new features and functionality for our firewall operating system, including some industry first features that will further differentiate us from the competition, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and a new subscription around IoT. Moving now to Prisma, as you saw in the commercial that we played at the top of this call, we're helping all types of organizations quickly scale and secure remote workers, in some cases in a matter of weeks or days. Prisma Access, which provides cloud delivered security for remote workers had a record quarter in terms of billings, number of deals closed and custom evals. In the last few months prison, Prisma Access effortlessly scaled over three times the aggregate capacity, helping our global enterprise customers enable their remote workforces overnight. As an example, a large oil and gas company went from a 25,000 remote user base to 80,000 users working remotely, very quickly, again made possible by Prisma Access. In April, we completed the acquisition of CloudGenix, a strategic decision to provide the industry's most comprehensive SASE platform, SASE, the convergence of network and security capabilities in the cloud delivered as a service. Before our acquisition of CloudGenix, they were a technology partner of Palo Alto Networks. CloudGenix integrated with Prisma Access will prove to be a valuable solution for our customers. After listening to our combined customer installed base, we believe that bringing the two platforms together is the right approach to deliver the best possible end-to-end SASE solution. We will further enhance our SASE platform by integrating the CloudGenix SD-WAN product with Prisma Access, expediting the intelligent onboarding of remote branches, remote retail stores and providing a seamless end-to-end solution to our customers. This combination will accelerate the enterprise shift towards the SASE model. We believe in giving our customers choices, so we will continue to enhance both the existing CloudGenix SD-WAN product, as well as our own next generation firewall based SD-WAN product that we launched in late 2019. Our two-pronged strategy for SD-WAN will provide our customers with the flexibility to implement SD-WAN on premise or in the cloud with a thin branch where security is delivered from the cloud or heavy branch where security is in the branch. Therefore, we will be able to support whichever SD-WAN architecture, our customers believe is right for them. We've begun the first phase of integration which focuses on simplification of the user experience, we expect to deliver a fully integrated solution towards the end of this calendar year. The acquisition positions Prisma Access as the best-in-class SASE offering, extending its ability to address network and security transformation requirements. We expect the combined billings for Prisma Access and CloudGenix to total approximately $300 million over the next 12 months. Not to be out done, Prisma Cloud had another record setting quarter and exceeded their plan. We have now acquired more than 1,500 Prisma Cloud customers, representing 10% of the global 2,000 and 43% of the Fortune 100. In this quarter alone, we won Prisma Cloud deals with two of the Fortune 10, two of the top 10 U.S. telcos and two of the top 10 global CPG companies. Our most recent release of Prisma Cloud extend security across the DevOps lifecycle any cloud or any stack. As enterprises continue to embrace modern tools for software development, we offer capabilities to protect their applications, data and infrastructure. Gartner recognizes our vision as cloud workload protection platforms and cloud security posture management converge, highlighting Prisma Cloud four times in a recent report than the most of any vendor. We will continue to innovate and add functionality to Prisma Cloud, including the micro segmentation capabilities, we acquired with Aporeto and application security, data security, and IM security soon to follow. And finally Cortex, as our company made the transition to remote workforce, we also transitioned our security operations center or SOC to remote model. We leveraged Cortex XSOAR for automation, case management real time collaboration, allowing us to run our security operations remotely, without sacrificing the level of security. Enabling the remote workforce has never been more important, and we've been hearing from our existing XSOAR customers that their transition to remote SOC has been seamless. As an example, a remote -- a European bank deployed Cortex XSOAR in the summer to automate routine SecOps tasks, in order to focus on higher level alerts. When the pandemic began affecting the region, they leveraged Cortex XSOAR to automate more advanced functions including escalations, from their fraud prevention systems to ensure the remote teams executives and analysts have the information needed to respond and combat critical fraud alerts. In terms of Cortex XDR, we continue to gain industry recognition. The independent security testing group, MITRE, conducted their second round evaluation recently, and we are proud to announce that no vendor, no vendor achieved higher attack technique coverage than Cortex XDR. We have come a long way in here with Cortex XDR. A little more than a year ago, we launched the industry's first holistic detection response platform spanning endpoint network and cloud. Gartner has now included XDR as one of the top cybersecurity trends of 2020. Six months ago, we engineered our endpoint security offering traps and merged it with the Cortex XDR offering, creating a unified customer experience from endpoint security through extended detection and response. We have now successfully upgraded all traps customer to Cortex XDR, continuing to offer them the strong prevention capabilities they've come to expect, managed from unified Cortex XDR console for a superior user experience. As a part of our ongoing efforts on comprehensive security, today we are proud to announce the upcoming GA of our managed threat hunting service. Through this service, our customers will not only have the most powerful and comprehensive detection response platform in the industry, but they will also have the supervision of some of the best threat hunters from our Unit 42 research team, hunting down threats, using the customer's XDR platform to provide additional peace of mind. I'm excited. We have made great progress in these newer areas of our business, collectively referred to as Next Generation Security or NGS. An year and a half ago, these collective offerings made up approximately 7% of our total billings. Today our NGS billings are on track to end the year at over $800 million, representing approximately 20% of total billing. Additionally, the NGS ARR or annual recurring revenue was approximately $550 million in Q3, '20. While we're pleased with our Q3 performance, the final quarter of this fiscal year will likely be a truer test of how this crisis will impact our business. The tailwinds we experienced in Q3 '20 should continue to some degree in Q4. But it will remains to be seen how sustainable these benefits will be. In many industries budgets have been cut, spending has slowed. It is difficult to imagine a scenario where many of our customers are facing severe financial impact, to not have that trickle down in some way shape or form into IT spending, including security spending as important as it is. We did see a few deals in the quarter push out and we monitor them closely, but as you know, the environment is going to evolve on a daily basis. Kathy will speak to our fourth quarter guidance in a moment. But considering the environment, we're very pleased to raise our full year fiscal 2020 guidance, driven both by our performance this quarter and our anticipated strong performance in upcoming Q4. Regarding the three year guidance we shared during our Analyst Day this past September, we feel it prudent to withdraw that outlook and revisit the subject when the longer-term impact of this crisis is more clear. In summary, we quickly executed the transition to working from home, doing the right thing for employees. We are seeing new business related to remote working and with CloudGenix we feel we are well-positioned to be an industry leader in Prisma SASE. Our cloud security strategy is working with validation from a number of the world's largest customers. With the upcoming IoT launch, we expect to see continued momentum for our security services. We expect an accelerated transition of the cloud to be a net benefit to our business. But we do expect a bumpy ride over the next few quarters, as economies and businesses seek to recover from the COVID-19 crisis. We have, however, prepared ourselves in a financially prudent manner. We are cautiously optimistic and continue to invest wisely. Our goal continues to be to come out as a stronger and cement our position as a global cybersecurity leader. Once again, I want to extend thanks to our partners, employees for their hard work and dedication, and to our customers who are placing their trust in us. We will get through this as a company, as a nation and globally. We have the opportunity to improve ourselves and strengthen our bonds through hard work and compassion. I'm honored to have the opportunity to lead the amazing people at Palo Alto Networks. With that, I will turn the call over to Kathy.
Kathy Bonanno: Thank you, Nikesh. Before I start, I want to echo Nikesh's sentiments and thank our employees, partners and suppliers for their dedication and the incredible work done to support our customers during this global pandemic. A special call out to our operations team for managing through the global supply chain challenges associated with COVID-19. Our team and our manufacturing partner FLEX did a terrific job, working with our suppliers around the globe to ensure that we could meet the security needs of our customers during this time. Moving on to our results, I'd like to note that except for revenue and billings, all financial figures are non-GAAP, and growth rates are compared to the prior year periods unless stated otherwise. As Nikesh indicated we had a great third quarter, even in the wake of COVID-19. In the third quarter, we continue to add new customers at a healthy clip. We saw improvement in our product revenue, and our next-gen security sales continued to be strong. In Q3, total revenue grew 20% to $869.4 million. Looking at growth by geography, the Americas grew 19%, EMEA grew 24% and APAC grew 15%. Q3 product revenue of $280.9 million increased 1% compared to the prior year. Q3 SaaS based subscription revenue of $354.3 million increased 37%. Support revenue of $234.2 million increased 24%. In total, subscription and support revenue of $588.5 million increased 31%, and accounted for 68% of total revenue. Turning to billings, Q3 total billings of $1.015 billion net of acquired deferred revenue, increased 24%, the dollar weighted contract duration for new subscription and support billings in the quarter, remained at approximately three years, flat year-over-year. At the margin, we are seeing certain customers sign up for annual billing terms, given the dynamics of the COVID environment. Total deferred revenue at the end of Q3 was $3.4 billion an increase of 28% year-over-year. In addition to adding approximately 2,500 new customers in the quarter, we continue to increase our wallet share with existing customers. Our top 25 customers, all of which made a purchase this quarter spent a minimum of $47.1 million in lifetime value, through the end of fiscal Q3, 2020, a 21% increase over the $38.7 million in the comparable prior year period. Q3 gross margin was 75.2%, which was down 130 basis points compared to last year. Q3 operating margin was 16.4%, a decline of 450 basis points year-over-year, and includes a headwind of approximately $3 million of net expense associated with our recent acquisitions. We ended the third quarter with 8,049 employees. On a GAAP basis for the third quarter, net loss increased to $74.8 million or $0.77 per basic and diluted share. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter declined 12% to $114.6 million, or $1.17 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for Q3 was 22%. Turning to cash flows and balance sheet items, we finished April with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $2.2 billion. Q3 cash flow from our operations of $169.9 million declined by 43% year-over-year. Free cash flow was $83.6 million, down 70% at a margin of 9.6%. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $187.4 million, representing a margin of 21.6% and excludes cash charges associated with our headquarters in Santa Clara. In particular, $51.7 million related to real estate purchase to accommodate future expansion, and $50 million associated with a litigation related settlement. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $86.3 million, of which $51.7 million was associated with the real estate purchase mentioned earlier. DSO was 63 days, an increase of 12 days from the prior year period. Turning now to guidance and modeling points, for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020, based upon our current deal pipeline and assuming a similar economic environment to Q3, and no further supply chain interruptions, we expect billings to be in the range of $1.190 billion to $1.210 billion, an increase of 13% to 14% year-over-year. We expect revenue to be in the range of $915 million to $925 million an increase of 14% to 15% year-over-year. We expect Q4, '20 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.37 to $1.40, which incorporates approximately $8 million of net expenses, or $0.06 per share related to the CloudGenix acquisition using 96 to 98 million shares. For the full fiscal year 2020 we are raising our guidance. We expect billings to be in the range of $4.102 billion to $4.122 billion, an increase of 18% year-over-year. We expect revenue to be in the range of $3.373 billion to $3.383 billion, an increase of 16% to 17% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $4.78 to $4.81, using approximately 98 to 100 million shares. Regarding free cash flow for the full year, we expect an adjusted free cash flow margin of approximately 27% to 28%, which incorporates the impact of the CloudGenix acquisition, and those deals expected to close via Palo Alto Networks Financial Services. Our adjusted free cash flow for fiscal 2020 will exclude costs of $146 million associated with the free cash flow adjustments, I mentioned earlier. Before I conclude, I'd like to provide some additional modeling points. We expect our Q4 non-GAAP effective tax rate to remain at 22%, CapEx in Q4 will be approximately $25 million to $35 million. We continue to expect our next-gen security billings to be in the range of $810 million to $820 million for the full fiscal year 2020. With that, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator, please poll for questions.
Operator: Our first question is from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.
Keith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys. I hope everyone is well on your side of the fence. Nikesh, I was thinking can you give us a little bit more color into both in terms of the results that you guys saw in Q3, which were ahead of our expectation, I think ahead of most people's expectations. Can you help us parse out what of that came from better execution on your side of the equation? You had talked about a lot of initiatives that you guys put into place to get sort of the sales force more focused on selling firewalls, building up that pipeline. So how much of that was kind of better execution? How much came from perhaps a pull forward of spending or crisis spending, if you will, of people setting themselves up for work from home environments? And then secondarily, can you give us a little of a sense of what you've been seeing so far in May? You talked about difficult macro ahead. Has the positive trends -- how well have the positive trends you saw in Q3, how well is that actually sustained into May thus far?
Nikesh Arora: Thanks Keith. Thanks for the question. I think it's fair to say as the pandemic hit, we saw a spurt of activity in the first few weeks, where customers wanted to rush and create more capacity to be able to support their remote workers; so people asking for more firewalls or chassis cards to expand capacity, people doing our GlobalProtect trials to see if they can fill in the remote work capability by using our free option that we've offered, because we want to support our customers.  Some people accelerated their Prisma Access trials into full purchase orders, because they wanted to get it deployed quickly and we put in teams to go deploy. So definitely there was an early surge in the first few weeks. I'd say on the margin in the quarter, there were puts and takes. There were things that got slowed down because customers are not in the office, the federal government can't have half their people go in. So all those things cause puts and takes. So I'd say the puts and takes probably gave us a slight bump, but not a substantial bump in the last quarter. And to be fair, I think some of these trends are going to be here to stay. I suspect that most companies want to maintain their remote secure access capabilities coming out of the pandemic, we announced today a policy called FLEXWORK. We're allowing our employees to come into work as many times a week as they want when things open. We're not dictating everybody has to come to the office, which means we have to maintain a remote secure capacity across our entire employee base, because now they will split their time between our office as well as their homes. And I think that's going to be true for many companies. If you see the last week, multiple companies have announced that they don't expect all their employees to come back to work. So I think that extra remote secure capacity has to be created. I don't think every company has actually scaled up to that. I think that's going to be a sustainable trend for the next three, four quarters. So I don't think that's a onetime support, that's going to be systemic. In the industry, I think the cloud transformations are real, I think those are getting accelerated. I think it's just going to be the puts and takes in terms of people who can get business done in the next three months or not, versus people who are accelerating their spending.
Keith Weiss: Got it. Thanks a lot. And then the trends that you've seen so far in May?
Nikesh Arora: Well, we have no reason to believe so far, as what we've seen in May, that our guidance is not achievable. Otherwise we would not have guided. I think that's the best answer I can give you.
Keith Weiss: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.
Walter Pritchard: Hi, thanks. And thanks for doing the call this way. Two questions. Just first on, Kathy, you mentioned the financing program. Could you just walk us through, is there any difference in how we see sales through that program hit the financial statements? And maybe some sense as to how widespread the uptake was on the using that? And what you expect over time?
Kathy Bonanno: Sure, Walter. The Palo Alto Networks Financial Services arm that we've -- the entity that we created this quarter is designed to allow us to offer some financial flexibility to our customers for larger deals, particularly in this time, when so many of our customers have been financially impacted.  The goal for us is to help smooth the deal process and accelerate the timing of deals, getting to closure, offering some assistance to our customers. And then of course, ultimately, hopefully improving our margins by getting into the deal economics early enough to understand when they need financing. And so we do hope that this will be a win-win for both our customers and for us. The entity is very small. We've done one deal. We're not expecting this to be a significant portion of our billings. It should in fact, be pretty immaterial. And therefore the entity itself will not be broken out. The results will be combined in total on the financials.
Walter Pritchard: And then just on hiring. I think you talked about on the call that you did CloudGenix and you were slowing your hiring to some degree. And you've taken away the long-term guidance. So maybe it'd be helpful which is proven it seems. But it would be helpful to understand how you're thinking about spending through this environment. If we do see some incremental weakness on the topline, do you expect to continue to be cautious on the OpEx? Or do you think you'll spend through to just drive the investment you'd planned on before?
Nikesh Arora: So Walter, let me take that one. We announced as soon as we got out of the gate of the pandemic that we're not going to have any COVID-related layoffs. Because it's very important for our employee base to feel secure and comfortable during these times, as people having to work from home.  We have been pretty ahead of the curve in making sure we had enough resources to cover our base on revenue and support our sales team. There are ample resources, both in acquisition and in our hiring processes to make sure that our product teams have enough runway to go build products. I think, it's only been two months, as we power through the pandemic, as we start seeing signs of economic recovery, you will see us continue to ramp up hiring again. At this point in time, we've just been prudent, and we're hiring very, very critical roles, which we believe are needed to continue to keep momentum on our projects, both on the go-to-market side, as well as our product side.  So we're not anticipating any impact of our slowing down of hiring in our ability to produce results. We're just being cautious in these times to make sure we align that with how the market unfolds. So yes. In terms of -- the other part is your expense question. Look, I think people haven't realized the expense categories that have shifted when nobody travels, you don't have any face-to-face conferences, you don't have people in the office, a lot of certain spending goes away. You have to shift that spend to provide capability for employees. So as we announced this morning, our FLEXWORK program, we increased allowance for employees to be able to make their homes more comfortable, so that they can actually work more effectively and productively from home. And there's a longer note, which is in our blog post, you can go and take a look at it. But we expect when we come back out of this pandemic, the way people work is going to change. We've introduced this concept called FLEXWORK, where people we think will in the long-term work partly from home and partly from the office, which will eventually require us to rethink our workplaces. I've seen other companies offer people to move out of the state, or the city. I've seen other companies say don't come back to work ever again. We don't think it's going to be as extreme, but we do believe there'll be a shift in the way we think about employees. We think about travel, we think about meetings, and that is going to create a different cost structure.
Walter Pritchard: Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Sterling Auty with JP Morgan.
Sterling Auty: Thanks. Hi, guys. And I echo, I like this format a lot. So I guess my question is, you mentioned the next six to nine months are going to be a bumpy ride for cybersecurity. I'm just wondering how that's going to manifest itself in your product revenue versus the rest of the subscription revenue?
Nikesh Arora: Sterling, I think it's fair to say we're all very focused on how our Q3 happened and how we plan our Q4. And we're all sort of digging deep to understand what this means over the following 12 months. We have visibility into Q4, we obviously have some visibility in Q1. As we progress through Q4, we haven't really put our heads down in terms of what this actually translates into, which we will talk about more, at the end of Q4. All I'm talking about the bumpy ride is the macroeconomic environment is not coming back as most people expect. And we were experimenting one day in the office and it feels weird, having to wear a mask as you walk around, having to rub my hands six times in an hour, and the softest hands I've ever had. And all these things are going to take time for us to adapt to as our employees. They're cautious about coming back to work. I think that's going to have ripple-through impact to our customers and our capabilities. The good news is I think the worst is over. I think now we're slowly building back to an economic recovery, which means our customers are more relaxed and are more interesting to see how they create these technological transformations that need to happen in their business. So I feel that that's going to happen. All I'm saying is it may not fall neatly into quarters like it used to fall neatly into quarters. That's kind of the only way -- takeaway from my comment.
Sterling Auty: That makes sense. And then one follow-up, how does SD-WAN demand get impacted positively or negatively from increased work from home?
Nikesh Arora: I think it's going to be huge. But since Lee Klarich is here, and I feel like he has to answer the question, and this is a perfect question for me to give my friend Lee.
Lee Klarich: Thank you, Nikesh. Look, I think we're not only seeing greater work from home, but we're seeing greater work from remote locations, branch offices, even retail environments will come back. And as that happens, in conjunction with a accelerated shift of applications to the cloud, SD-WAN becomes increasingly important. So it will obviously play out overtime. But I believe that we're going to see an acceleration of these network transformation projects, as a result of the shift to cloud, as a result of working from home. And SD-WAN in a cloud deliver format will be central in that.
Sterling Auty: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Fatima Boolani with UBS.
Fatima Boolani: Thank you, for taking the questions. I hope you guys are doing okay. I appreciate this format as well. Maybe just to start, as I think about the adoption levels in the portfolio of NGS solutions, that seems to be seeing a continued healthy take up. So I'm wondering, if you can kind of talk through the concept of ELAs or EAAs and to what extent this type of transaction structuring is becoming more frequent in your sales engagements? And then I have a follow-up for Kathy.
Nikesh Arora: Yes. Fatima, thank you for the question. I don't think we've seen much, we've changed much in our EAA and ELA activity. I think what's primarily happened is that, we've seen a healthy balance between new logos and existing customers buying into some of these products. Like Prisma Cloud has opened up a whole new set of customers to us, who are more cloud centric, cloud transformation focused, maybe cloud-only companies. And getting to 1,500 customers in any business from a standing start or 18 to 24 months is amazing for us. We're very excited about the progress our sales teams have made on the Prisma Cloud side. Take Cortex XDR, it used to be a product called Traps. Again, getting to the top of the charts, great execution by our product and sales teams to get us to be leading contender against some of the industry leaders. So I think what's happened over the last 18 to 24 months, our concerted efforts around both go-to-market, as well as product have led us to really target the market focus on acquiring customers. We've established these speed boats two years ago or 18 months ago when I came in, and the whole purpose was to go accelerate and not get bogged down by a lot of cross collaborative efforts, until we establish clear propositions, clear leadership. So probably in the next phase, we'll worry more about putting stuff together. Having said that, there are some cases customers who bought everything from us, as the retailer we mentioned has over time and established our platform across every category within their infrastructure, because they believe the integration across our platforms and products is key. So, I’d say this is less driven by EAA ELA activities, more driven by product excellence and go-to-market excellence in those categories. And as time evolves, as we get more robust and as we start cross-selling more and more into our existing customer base, hopefully that becomes an accelerator for EAAs and ELAs in the future.
Fatima Boolani: That makes sense. I appreciate that. And Kathy for you, just with the conversation around FLEXWORK and potentially some structural changes with respect to the 8,000 employees at Palo Alto and how they work. Can you talk a little bit about the implications for CapEx here? I mean, there's been a huge effort to build out the headquarter footprint. So to what extent does that change or is reevaluated? And that's it for me. Thank you.
Kathy Bonanno: Hi. Fatima, thanks for the question. Yes, obviously the CapEx investments that we've made around headquarters were made in a pre-COVID environment, and we're going to have to wait and see how long this work from home phenomenon lasts, and to the extent with which our employees choose to work from home. We made a land purchase, which we talked about on the call. And that purchase, we've not yet started to develop. However, our plans were to start developing that somewhat quickly. In this current environment that will probably be pushed out a bit, but ultimately the land here is very valuable. The real estate here is very tight typically. And so we still think that that's going to present us with a good opportunity in the future.
Fatima Boolani: Sounds good. Thank you. And nice to see you guys.
Operator: Our next question is from Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Essex: Hi, thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. I guess, Nikesh I want to dig into product revenue if I could. Maybe could you give us a little bit of color in terms of how much visibility you had into improvement of sales force productivity, given the adjustment and incentives that you had? And maybe how much was from expansion with existing customers versus new logo wins? And how durable do you think the growth there will be?
Nikesh Arora: Thanks Brian. Thanks for the question. As you know, the conversation last quarter was around our product revenues. And we had offered our insight that we had seen a slowing down of customer evaluation, across evals and POCs and there was a discussion on execution of our sales team. And we're in the high-single negative digits in product growth last quarter. So, our teams really rallied. Our team is really focused on the product issue, built tremendous execution. So I'm very proud of what they've been able to achieve going into Q3, especially as you see people having to work from home, get deals done from home, customers are at home, getting through their purchasing departments and being able to target a number and meet and beat the number is nontrivial in such environment. Not to mention, the incredible amount of supply chain effort it takes. I know many companies have slipped on supply chain this quarter. And our supply chain team did a phenomenal job working with our sales and go-to-market team. So I think the execution has been spectacular. I do believe there's probably a few 100 basis points off tailwind as Keith asked in the beginning from that. So maybe without COVID we'd been one or two percentage points lower. But there are some companies in our industry whose entire growth is that number in the COVID environment. So I think the teams did a great job. And don't forget, the reason I actually, I understand product is important because it's instant gratification. It flows through revenue and EPS. But going back, firewall as a platform, 13% growth, industry growing to 6% to 8%. We once again started taking share from people, because remember, I can sell a firewall with GlobalProtect to a customer, or I can sell Prisma Access delivered to the cloud. Now the beauty is PrismaAccess, the customer calls and says, I want to go from 25,000 to 80,000 remote secure workers now. I don't have to do anything. I just have to increase capacity, reconfigure things from remotely and allow them the capacity. On firewalls, I got to ship a firewall, I got to deploy the firewall, they’re going to enhance their subscription. So it's a lot higher friction in physical box firewall sales to remote secure access than it is to provide a cloud delivered firewall to our customer. So whilst I understand it's very important for financial modeling, how much revenue and cash flow Palo Alto drops in the same year from firewall, my team and I really look at the firewall as a platform number and watching that get back to double digit, high industry growth is more gratifying than just seeing the product number go up. So once again, kudos to the team out there. I am just delighted the way they stepped up with the challenge.
Brian Essex: Great. Thank you for that. And maybe, Kathy to follow-up. Thank you, for ARR commentary, by the way that's very helpful. Maybe if I could ask, I get a lot of questions from investors around how to think about balancing the core appliance based business with a growth in next-gen. How should we think about how you manage those two businesses? One is the installed base and the core business still growing. It's generating obviously a lot of cash flow, we can see that in maintenance revenue. And then two, is next-gen generating cash flow or profitability? Is one funding the other? Is it self-funding? If we kind of split those businesses and think about those in a strategy to grow and leverage your installed base and cash flow to grow those businesses, what's the best way to frame that out?
Kathy Bonanno: Yes, it's a good question, Brian. And obviously, we're very focused on driving the newer products in our portfolio. Lots of times you see companies who make acquisitions or try to develop internally, and you just don't ever see the kind of momentum that you saw with their original core product. And so, we're really pleased. And Nikesh has done a great job building out these speedboats and driving the discipline and focus around allowing us to build out those businesses, so that they can be successful. Initially, they take investment, like all new businesses. And so it is kind of a company now with a multi-product strategy. We have a core product that's been very successful for us that we continue to innovate in. And we're adding new subscriptions. You've seen us add recently three, fourth to come soon, and still more to follow. So we're still investing in the core. We're still releasing a lot of new great technology there. But additionally, as Nikesh mentioned, we have lots of different options now for firewalls we have. The cloud delivered firewall, we have cloud version of the firewall, a software version of the firewall. So we can serve a much different breadth of product offerings to our customers today. And so really, you're just going to have to think about the lifecycle of the different stages of growth that our portfolio is in, which is why we've separated out next-gen security to give you some markers and show you that we are making progress in this group as a whole, that is our newest set of offerings, that granted is less mature, therefore the margin profile is not as strong. But overtime, we're definitely committed to profitability and improving overall operating margin performance, as we've said in the past.
Brian Essex: Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: And with consideration for time, our final question is from Jonathan Ho with William Blair.
Jonathan Ho: Hi. Can you hear me okay?
Operator: Yes, we can hear you.
Jonathan Ho: Fantastic. Can you talk a little bit about maybe what you're seeing with the trends around SASE and firewall as a service, and maybe the trajectory that you're seeing in terms of a shift away from the more traditional infrastructures over and the cloud?
Nikesh Arora: Yes. Jonathan, thank you for the question. And as Lee mentioned, we are seeing customers evaluate the remote secure access posture even more aggressively now, of course, because of COVID. I think that's been an accelerator. I think people want capacity for all their employees to be able to do this remotely. Given the choice of adding more hardware into their datacenters and infrastructure they prefer the software solution. We can offer both. We see a predilection for people to go after the software use case more than the hardware use case. Unless you already have a lot of quality firewalls in there. I think as we see the cloud transformation accelerate, people will realize that they don't need to bring all the traffic back to the datacenter incur MPLS costs. So that will drive more and more of SD-WAN use case. And I think if you look at what's happened in the last even six months, Gartner coined the term, if you go search for SASE on Google, favorite search engine, you'll find every vendor now has converted their offering to SASE. Now SASE requires you to have SD-WAN capability and security capability in one UI, one cloud managed capability. So we think this is the new trend. We think this trend is going to be around for the next few years, as customers kind of rearchitect their network infrastructures. So we think there's going to be solid tailwind in that category. In terms of trajectory it really depends on customer's ability to execute in this environment whether or not in the office.
Operator: That concludes the Q&A portion of our call. Thank you for all your questions. I'm going to turn it back to Nikesh for closing remarks.
Nikesh Arora: As I close, I actually want to thank every one of you for joining us today. And thank you, everyone for your encouraging comments to do this again in a Zoom format. Although, Kathy and I had a big debate about this and somehow we feel we have radio voices as opposed to video voices. So we'll figure it out. But sorry, jokes apart, thank you again for joining us. I do once again want to call out our employees across the company, across different functions, our sales teams for working on the execution to get us out of the challenges we had in the past quarter, our supply chain teams, our product teams, our go-to-market teams, our IT teams. There's not a single person at Palo Alto Networks, who has not put their heart and soul over the last few months in really getting us through this quarter, while we settle into new normal. So I want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart. My heart also goes out for the people who are impacted by the pandemic. And I hope they stay safe and healthy. I want to thank our customers, our partners, everyone around the world. So I think the hard work and dedication that I see in these times gives me hope that we will all come out stronger from this pandemic. And I look forward to seeing you guys in the next earnings call. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes the Palo Alto Networks earnings call. Thank you.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-02-24 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Palo Alto Networks Fiscal Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, I’d like to turn things over to Mr. David Niederman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
David Niederman: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today’s conference call to discuss Palo Alto Networks fiscal second quarter 2020 financial results. This call is being broadcast live over the Web and can be accessed on the Investors section of our website at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. With me on today’s call are Nikesh Arora, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Kathy Bonanno, our Chief Financial Officer; and Lee Klarich, our Chief Product Officer. This afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our results for the fiscal second quarter ended January 31, 2020. If you’d like a copy of the release, you can access it online on our website. We would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our financial guidance and modeling points for the fiscal third quarter, full fiscal year 2020 and our next three years, our competitive position, our proposed accelerated share repurchase and the demand in marketing opportunity for our products and subscriptions, benefits and timing of new products and subscription offerings, and trends in certain financial results and operating metrics. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today. You should not rely on them as representing our views in the future, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. For a more detailed description of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our annual report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 26, 2019, and our earnings release posted a few minutes ago on our website and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. For historical periods, we have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in the supplemental financial information that can be found in the Investors section of our website located at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. And finally, once we have completed our formal remarks, we will be posting them to our Investor Relations website under the Quarterly Results section. We’d also like to inform you that we will be attending the Morgan Stanley TMT conference in San Francisco on March 5th. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you, David. Good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call. I talked with our President, Amit Singh earlier today. He just finished a two-day review of our sales teams around the world. He was excited more than I've ever seen him excited since he started Palo Alto Networks. He was excited that we are most strategic conversations than ever around the world. And our strategy around cloud security, securing the stock and adding capability to our firewalls is resonating with customers. They were launching more integrated capability than ever before, and our customers are responding well to our efforts. And in the present of all that enthusiasm, our billings are up 17% year-over-year, including strong performance from our next-generation security offerings which grew 101% in Q2. I was thinking about this earnings call. It's definitely a contrast. We are executing well on our transformation, but becoming more relevant to our customers and building a second and third leg to our security business which is the hardest thing to do. But I do know that you all want to talk about products. So let's cut to the chase. Am I disappointed with what happened with our product revenues? Yes. We talked about the impact of sales incentive changes last year, which had impacted our sales team's focus on product towards the Next-Generation Security. We of course corrected that and balance their focus. We knew that the problem will take some time to correct as we discussed last quarter. In all fairness, we were expecting improvement this quarter, which hasn't arrived. Product performance did improve partly, because the sales incentive change is going to take longer than expected. And partly, because we were too optimistic about some of the deals closing in the quarter. Upon deep inspection, I feel that the softness will take a little more time. So what are we going to do about this and what gives us comfort that performance will improve? First, we are following up with the success of our Prisma and Cortex speedboats and have created a new speedboat firewalls to drive entrepreneurial energy and momentum. The leadership for this people is now in place. We've hired Andy Elder who joined us from Riverbed and Alan Boswell who joined us from Cisco who will be leading this speedboat. Secondly, we recently launched SD-WAN across our entire power state. And when combined with Prisma Access, we believe this is a great SASE solution. We're still in early stages, but we have closed some deals and are seeing heightened interest from our customers and positive feedback on the vision and simplicity volition solution. Along with our technology partners, we have the capability to bring a full branch architecture solution and feel good about our ability to compete. Finally, we're seeing signs and early indicators that we track across our business where we are likely to see some product growth resumed in the fiscal fourth quarter. So let me revisit that in terms of what it means to our outlook going forward on product and its impact to Palo Alto Networks. We expect product growth to improve in the second half of fiscal 2020 and turned positive in fiscal Q4. However, products will still be below our internal expectations. We expect that product will return to market growth next year in fiscal 2021. We have put cost-containment measures into place to match our investment trajectory with our profitability expectations. And Kathy will give you more details around this versus our EPS forecast. Lower product growth will of course impact our Firewall as a Platform metric in a double-digit growth this year. The management team and I have revisited our three-year guidance that we gave at Analyst Day. Only two quarters in to that guidance upon deep inspection is still the confidence in our long-term outlook for fiscal 2022. Now that we've talked about the product issue and the impact of financials, let's talk about what's working. I met line and I have seen over 100 customers this quarter. Our strategy is resonating. Organizations everywhere are undergoing a profound digital transformation. Finally, reshaping the way they operate, innovate and connect with the people they serve. These transformations are helping drive the need for Prisma and Cortex. I'd like to share a few key details in the quarter. In fiscal Q2, another customer will illustrate the power of our comprehensive approach to security including, a large U.S. retailer who expanded the Palo Alto Network's footprint this quarter with an eight-figure deal spanning each of our three pillars including Prisma Cloud, Prisma Access and SaaS Cortex and our next-generation Firewall. This is one of our largest deals in recent times and a true cost platform by Prisma Cortex and Firewall. The multinational travel management company expanded the next-generation Firewalls and Prisma Access following the purchase of Demisto last fiscal quarter. It's a great example of how one of our next-generation security services opened the door with a major account for future firewall purchases. I also love this example because the client was pursuing the goal of building a network that will support a significant number of employees and also transition away for NPL. Our solution not only provides significant flexibility and increased visibility, we also -- our customers also drive substantial savings compared to prior architectures. We got a deal with a large German automotive company who purchased Prisma Cloud Compute formerly known as Prisma. Prisma will be a critical pillar of the customers move to 100% cloud force architecture and shift less security model. These wins are excellent examples of our success in articulating our vision of security and being able to demonstrate our value proposition to customers. As a final indication of our momentum in the first half of fiscal 2020, we closed two of our top 20 largest deals in the company's history. Additionally, Prisma Cloud had another record-setting quarter and closed an eight-figure deal with the U.S. retailer I highlighted earlier, the largest deal in the history of Prisma Cloud. During the quarter, we also continued to drive innovation across our products, this time their firewall. In December, we launched the SD-WAN for our next-generation firewalls. Customers are currently getting this offering and feedback is positive as they appreciate our vision and solution. We will continue to add new firewall subscription in 2020, including IoT labels here. Earlier today, we announced Cortex XSOAR, an extended security orchestration automation response platform that natively integrates threat intelligence management. Cortex XSOAR the significant evolution of the Demisto platform and we believe it will redefine the SOAR category by making tech intelligence much more actionable at scale. In Prisma cloud, we have launched the first version of our integrated product where SaaS customers of Prisma Cloud who are using it for workload security and seamlessly leverage the capacity -- capability to deploy container secured. A short base is launched we have seen 10% of our customers take up both modules. This is exciting because we are hard at work to develop integrated and deployed, four modules over the course of this year including the integration of Aporeto. Turning to our marketing efforts, if you will be attending RSA, you will likely notice that a fresh look and feel of the new Palo Alto Network branding. Additionally, we have launched a stand-alone brand for our firewall business Strata. Over the past several months, we have launched and built two of the premier brands in cybersecurity, Prisma and Cortex. When we took a step back and do read our position, it became clear that the firewall needed their own brand. All three brands were up to the Palo Alto Network, which also supports a new updated local. On the people front, we are continuing to prioritize our culture and workplace environment. We're highly focused on making Palo Alto Networks a place where everyone feels inspired to do their best work. We're extremely pleased to in our perfect score of the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2020 Corporate Equality Index and also the designation of a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ equality. We are very, very proud of this achievement. Finally, I want to highlight our proposed accelerated share repurchase transaction or ASR that we announced earlier today in our earnings press release. The proposed ASR was the amount of $1 billion is expected to occur in our fiscal third quarter and represents the capital allocation strategy that we believe returns value to shareholders, while still allowing us sufficient flexibility to achieve our goal. The proposed ASR is in addition to the $1 billion repurchase authorization that we announced in February 2019. As of today, approximately $800 million remain available for future share purchases under the February authorization. In closing, we continue to chart new territory cybersecurity with our three-platform strategies taking shape. We have a lot of work to do, but it's heartening to see our customers partnering with us in a more strategic manner. We are the largest cybersecurity company providing industry-leading growth, while transforming our business to protect our customers as they go through this transition. The new data center will be the Cloud and we will be there for our customers in Prisma, a new frontier in AI and ML and Cortex with our customers need security automation. Last, but not -- definitely not the least, Firewall technology will continue to press our customers in their data centers or in the cloud and we will be there beside of the startup. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kathy.
Kathy Bonanno: Thank you, Nikesh. Before I start, I'd like to note that except for revenue and billings figures, all financial figures are non-GAAP and growth rates are compared to the prior year period unless stated otherwise. As Nikesh indicated, we believe our overall business remains healthy despite our Q2 product revenue performance. In the second quarter, we continued to add new customers at a healthy clip and sales of our next-gen security offerings continue to be strong. In Q2, total revenue grew 15% to $816.7 million. Looking at growth by geography, the Americas grew 15%, EMEA grew 12% and APAC grew 20%. Q2 product revenue of $246.5 million declined 9% compared to the prior year. Q2 SaaS-based subscription revenue of $342.6 million increased 37%. Support revenue of $227.6 million increased 20%. In total, subscription and support revenue of $570.2 million increased 30% and accounted for a 70% share of total revenue. Turning to billings; Q2 total billings of $998.9 million net of acquired deferred revenue increased 17%. The dollar-weighted contract duration for new subscription and support billings in the quarter remained at approximately three years, up by approximately one month year-over-year. For the first half of fiscal 2020 billings of $1.9 billion increased 18% year-over-year. Product billings were $479.8 million, down 7% and accounted for 25% of total billings. Subscription billings were $868.9 million, up 34%. Support billings were $547.6 million, up 22%. Total deferred revenue at the end of Q2 was $3.2 billion, an increase of 27% year-over-year. In addition to adding over 2500 new customers in the quarter, we continued to increase our wallet share with existing customers. Our top 25 customers, 24 of which made a purchase this quarter spent a minimum of $46.2 million in lifetime value through the end of Q2 2020. This is a 30% increase over the $35.6 million in the comparable prior year period. Q2 gross margin was 76.4%, which was up 10 basis points compared to last year. Q2 operating margin was 17.9%, a decline of 670 basis points year-over-year and includes a headwind of approximately $9 million of net expense associated with our recent acquisitions. We ended the second quarter with 7,643 employees. On a GAAP basis for the second quarter, net loss increased to $73.7 million or $0.75 per basic and diluted share. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter declined 18% to $120.3 million or $1.19 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for Q2 was 22%. Turning to cash flows and balance sheet items. We finished January with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $3.5 billion. Q2 cash flow from operations of $306.9 million increased by 11% year-over-year. Free cash flow was $257.8 million, up 2% at a margin of 31.6%. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $275.6 million, representing a margin of 33.7%, excluding cash charges associated with our headquarters in Santa Clara. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $49.1 million, of which $17.8 million was associated with our headquarters in Santa Clara. DSO was 57 days, an increase of seven days from the prior year period. Turning now to guidance and modeling points. As Nikesh noted earlier, we anticipate that product revenue growth will improve in the second half of fiscal 2020, but will remain below our initial expectations. As such, we are modifying our guidance for the full fiscal year. Please note that, our guidance does not reflect any potential disruptions in our global supply chain that could result from the coronavirus, which we are carefully monitoring. For the third fiscal quarter of 2020, we expect revenue to be in the range of $835 million to $850 million, an increase of 15% to 17% year-over-year. We expect billings to be in the range of $980 million to $1 billion, an increase of 19% to 22% year-over-year. We expect Q3 2020 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.96 to $0.98 using approximately 99.5 million to 101.5 million shares. For the full fiscal year, we expect revenue to be in the range of $3.350 billion to $3.390 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 16% to 17%. Billings to be in the range of $4.075 billion to $4.125 billion, representing growth of 17% to 18% year-over-year. Next-Gen Security billings to be in the range of $810 million to $820 million, representing year-over-year growth of 79% to 82%. We expect fiscal 2020 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $4.55 to $4.65 using approximately 99 million to 101 million shares. Finally, turning to free cash flow. For the full year, we expect an adjusted free cash flow margin of approximately 28%. Before I conclude, I'd like to provide some additional modeling points. We expect our Q3 and fiscal 2020 non-GAAP effective tax rate to remain at 22%. CapEx in Q3 will be approximately $85 million to $90 million with approximately $50 million related to real estate purchased to accommodate future expansion of our headquarters in Santa Clara. As a result, we are increasing our expected full year CapEx to approximately $220 million to $230 million with approximately $100 million related to our headquarters. Finally, our adjusted free cash flow in Q3 and fiscal 2020 will exclude costs associated with the expansion of our headquarters, including the real estate purchase I just described as well as a $50 million cash payment for litigation-related settlement. With that, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator, please poll for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll hear first today from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.
Hams Fodderwala: This is Hamza Fodderwala in for Keith Weiss. Thank you for taking my questions. Just a couple of ones for me. First on the product revenue side, Nikesh is there anything else that you're seeing in terms of any unforeseen challenges within the Firewall business? Has there been any change to the competitive landscape at all? You mentioned launching SD-WAN. Obviously, there's another vendor that's had some pretty strong traction there. So any more color would be really helpful.
Nikesh Arora: Thanks for the question. Yes. Look as we highlighted in the prior quarter, we made changes in our sales incentives last year to drive Prisma and Cortex because honestly trying -- there's very few examples when I came to enterprise security of companies building a second or third product line to first product line. We spent a lot of effort of the team trying to figure out how can we build where the opportunities were related on cloud, related on automation and machine learning and we made some significant bets both in terms of acquisitions and resources in driving Prisma and Cortex. That changed and trying to get salespeople to learn, appreciate, understand and sell these things caused them to pivot hard, because they're going to make a lot of money selling Prisma and Cortex and they did. What they did was because they're focused on this is only finite resources, they didn't go and knock on enough doors to create Firewall demand. And as you know there's a cycle from demand to closure which has its own motion takes us on time. And we discovered that much later in the year, while we're delighted with the success of Prisma and Cortex in Q4, we realized that we have been systematically rolling the opportunity to have a large pipeline going into Q1, which is why you saw our Q1 results. We were optimistic that we would be able to accelerate that effort and try and get deals closed sooner. But unfortunately, it was hard to fight the tape there is a cycle, there is a motion and our customers are used to it and that's what is in front of us. Hence, we had to revise our product efforts. In terms of what's going on in the market, yes SD-WAN is a trend as you see it. There are other people out there who are doing well with SD-WAN. There are SD-WAN companies out there dealing with SD-WAN. We have SD-WAN partners. Every time we go sell Prisma Access as part of our SaaS-based solution, either we now use our own SD-WAN or customers choose other SD-WAN package. Definitely, SD-WAN is a trend. And we think as people go to the cloud, as network architectures change, MPLS starts to get pulled off of and the internet becomes a new network, we will see people leverage more SD-WAN capabilities. So it is an area of focus. It continues to remain a focus. And we're excited by the progress we've made since December in terms of getting customer interest in our solution. Other than that, honestly I think this is an execution issue. I don't see that the market is changing. So we've got to take our medicine and going to go ahead and skip.
Hams Fodderwala: Just to ask one follow-up question on the next-gen side. On Cortex, it seems like there's been some really strong traction there. I was curious to know the announcement that you made earlier today on that product. How do you expect that to translate to further pipeline into the second half of this year? And what are some of the early trends that you're seeing there? And that's it for me.
Nikesh Arora: Yes. So as you know on Cortex we have two products in the larger category of security automation applying AI and machine learning. We have a product of Cortex XDR, which in the simplest form competes in the XDR category, which is the next-generation of the EDR category where some of the newest sort of endpoint vendors have migrated. And there we keep adding more data sources into our injection capability. So XDR is doing well. Our primary customers have come mostly from Palo Alto customers without our firewall and some new customers who want our endpoint capabilities from the XDR perspective. And that business is doing well. What we announced this morning was the Cortex XSOAR, which is the next evolution of what was Demisto. In the past, we sold Demisto to our customers. And the constant feedback we got it will be amazing to track in terms of management will be part of this capability and we would have to go stitch it on top of our capabilities to automate and our playbooks on. So, the rest the team has valued and merged management in the capability that was Demisto and hence we defined the XSOAR. The industry analysts have been calling for this. They've been calling for this trend. So we are first in launching that capability. Purely from a mechanical perspective, every customer who is a customer of Demisto should want an upgrade to this capability. Additionally, it should open up a larger market for us with Demisto Intel market which is we think probably the same size of the SOAR market, so very excited about it.
Hams Fodderwala: Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: But thank you for asking a Cortex question. I was thinking that question wouldn't come towards until the end of the call.
Operator: We'll hear next from Walter Pritchard with Citi.
Walter Pritchard: Thanks. Nikesh, a cash question for you just on the -- if we're thinking about this now from a sales incentive perspective and what behavior you're driving, but just from a customer demand perspective, how do you think about I guess, we all understand I think that Firewall demand is not what it was two, three years ago. But certainly, I think we hear in the industry that customers spend on Firewall is flat or maybe slightly up. And I'm wondering, as it relates to your customer base with Firewall revenue down two quarters here now. Are customers -- did they buy last year and they're holding off their purchases? Or they're holding their purchases in the future? I'm just wondering how we think about it from the buyer perspective. I think we well understand everything you've done from the sales incentive side from the sort of supply side.
Nikesh Arora: Yes thanks Walter, I think that’s a good question. Look, from a buyer perspective, every customer is on a different life cycle in terms of both where their infrastructure is today and where they're trying to go tomorrow, whether they're adding more data centers or going to the cloud or trying to replace their sort of traffic coming back home and trying to build some sort of a hybrid cloud plus data center infrastructure. So, the trend as I highlighted and the last answer is that, we are seeing SD-WAN being asked for. We are seeing buyers looking for SD-WAN solutions with security. In some cases that involves a box solution. In some cases involves a software solution. In our case, we have the opportunity now with SD-WAN from the time to deliver both. We can give you a box that gives you the SD-WAN capability. We can give you Prisma Access that allows you to deploy SD-WAN into the cloud. So from that perspective, there's definitely activity on the net. So, re-architecting the network and trying to get more sort of evolution underway. Customers who have large data centers that go through their own refresh cycle. So we're not seeing anything big that would give us a reason to believe that things are shifting. On the margin, our solutions given by cloud versus boxes would have caused some difference probably, but nothing we see at this point in time.
Walter Pritchard: Great. And then Kathy, just on the long term goals, I know you're not revisiting those here. But as we think about the three-year CAGR you talked about, I mean can you help us understand maybe what level of firewall or product sales you were anticipating in there? And sort of I don't know any color you can provide around sensitivity of that overall growth number given the performance you've seen here on the product side near term?
Kathy Bonanno: Yes Walter, thanks for that question. We did obviously not guide explicitly on products. But I think for the most part, the analysts were projecting less growth than we have seen historically on the product line which was appropriate and reflected in our guidance. And so obviously that changed a little bit and we've had to adjust our guidance this quarter but we still feel -- we still feel really great about the longer-term view, especially given the performance of our next-gen security. And we definitely think as Nikesh mentioned that we believe that what we have is an execution issue and that we know how to compete in firewall sales and that we'll be able to correct the situation and improve that growth as well.
Walter Pritchard: Okay. Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: And from JPMorgan, we'll move next to Sterling Auty.
Unidentified Corporate Participant: Hi, guys. This is Matt on for Sterling. Thanks for taking my question. If we're looking at product revenue, assuming that product revenue is just flat from here on out. How long do you guys think it would take to get the next-gen security to parity with that revenue run rate? Thanks.
Nikesh Arora: I'm going to let Kathy answer the parity question but I won't tell you from our product revenue forecast, we've looked at the pipeline and looked at the early indicators we think that in Q3 its going to continue to be tough but we should be able to get to positive growth by Q4. And our teams are hard at work to make sure that we reverse these trends and that next year we're back to that market or above-market growth in the firewall space. In terms of how long it takes for parity for NGS, I think that's a math problem. If you look at our forecast we've given you for NGS and you look at our firewall forecast you should be able to derive that answer. I'm going to let Kathy answer that question in case.
Kathy Bonanno: And I really don't have much more to add. That was a great answer.
Unidentified Corporate Participant: Great, great. Thanks. And then just one follow-up. Geographically, it looks like there are some issues in the year. Are there any macro impacts or anything that you guys can point to geographically?
Nikesh Arora: No again, I think on a geographic basis, there is no trend thing. As you know that Europe and Asia generally have lagged the cloud trend globally but they're slowly getting onboard. We're seeing companies in Europe also talk about hybrid cloud solutions, talk about thinking about changing network architectures. They generally lagged some of the U.S. companies in that context. So we're seeing traction in different parts of the world of varying degrees. So no, I think the market is only going to get bigger on an international basis. And as Kathy said, we're all watching the coranavirus I think you all look at the market today. I think whatever impact happens because that will happen across the industry will not be specific to any one company but we have some – we might have less exposure compared to others but I think that will be more of a global impact around that trend.
Unidentified Corporate Participant: Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate the color.
Operator: We'll move next to Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.
Karl Keirstead: Thanks, Kathy. I just wanted to make sure just given the attention on the product revenue side that I understand the outlook for the second half where you said the product revenue growth should improve. So just to be clear, the year-over-year decline you anticipate in 3Q would – there'd still be a decline but less than negative nine? So better than negative nine I should say. And then in the fourth quarter you think the year-over-year growth rate for product could move positive. Is that correct? I just want to be clear that you anticipate negative nine is being the floor let's say?
Kathy Bonanno: Yes that's correct Karl.
Karl Keirstead: Okay got it. And then maybe Nik my other one…
Kathy Bonanno: Not just one or two. We both. We both expect that.
Karl Keirstead: Okay. Great. And just so I'm clear the $50 million litigation-related settlement was related to what Kathy? 
Kathy Bonanno: Yeah. We – the details of the settlement are confidential, so we won't be describing a lot in our Q or on this call, but it was related to an IP settlement which is pretty common in the industry.
Karl Keirstead: Okay. Got it. Okay. Terrific. Thank you.
Operator: From Raymond James, we'll move to Michael Turits.
Michael Turits: Hey, guys. Good evening. So two competitive questions and then one on the incentives. So can you be more specific in cash about whether or not you're actually losing because you don't have any of the SD-WAN is just coming into play for you now? And what's going on in the market against Zscaler specifically for what's called cloud delivery Zscaler security competitively?
Nikesh Arora: All right. Well, let me start with the SD-WAN question, and I can try and give you some color on the network transformation architecture market. I generally prefer not to talk about other companies, because I don't understand their businesses as much as I understand ours. But on the SD-WAN front we are seeing customers require talk about SD-WAN. I remember the customers have a choice of taking best to read SD-WAN in the market which are independent players or taking that as part of an integrated firewall solution. And we've seen customers offer either depending on the complexity of their needs for SD-WAN, which you're going to deploy it to across 10,000 sites, 8,000 sites you go get a specialist SD-WAN vendor, because he has a whole bunch of stuff that you want to deploy, configure and set up, which is a much more complex product that is out available in the market. Sometimes customer's want to do a simpler architecture and just has the capability in their firewalls. And we're seeing a market for that too and that is the market we will be able to address with our evolution of our firewall capability and our – we end up this max of capability with the SD-WAN that we launched. So yes, we are seeing that need come in. Honestly, I've not seen many large deals in the market, where we've seen a competitive situation, where the customer says, I cannot solve this problem to the Palo Alto firewall. I'm going to go elsewhere. But clearly, other people are doing well. Now that maybe some of the market segment issue, I haven't seen that much in the large enterprise space. In terms of what it does to the network transformation market. Remember, let's say when I came to Palo Alto Networks, we had a product called GPCS which we deployed a lot of resources against and we worked really hard over the last 18 months. Lee and his team did a great job of launching Prisma Access and delivering it. We've had this product in the market almost only for three quarters. And in that three quarter time frame, we have made some huge inroads with the very large customers that deployed very large deals. I highlighted some of the deals earlier in my prepared remarks and that was a large Prisma Access confident with that deal. So a market where people weren't seeing us they probably had more share in a market where they see us and we get deals. Other people get less of that pie. It's one of our strongest pipelines in that space. We have a lot of expectations from that space. So expect us to continue to be aggressive in the Southeast space, because we believe there we have one of the most comprehensive solutions. Was there a third part to your question?
Michael Turits: Yes. That was off from the cash. My follow-up is did you make any additional incremental changes to the incentive structures as you saw that things are taking longer this quarter?
Nikesh Arora: Look, we have a very capable responsible intelligent sales team out there. And they understood the math when we did the math in the last year in terms of taking the multiples we gave them to go sell Prisma and Cortex and they did as we requested them to do. We have balanced those. We have a lot of scrutiny. We have a lot of inspections going on in the Firewall space, and our teams are responding. It's just -- honestly it takes time. Firewall cycle has a time element to it. And call it less judgment in the last quarter when we look at the deal pipeline. We're being too optimistic that we could close a lot more of them in this quarter than we have been able to. The deals haven't gone away. They're just going to take time. And we're just trying to make sure that we are no longer setting unrealistic expectations of closing deals in our pipeline and giving a reasonable forecast both to you and setting right -- the right expectations from our team.
Michael Turits: Okay. Thanks, Nikesh.
Operator: We'll move next to Brent Thill with Jefferies.
Howard Ma: Hi. This is Howard on for Brent. Thanks for taking the questions. Nikesh in your prepared remarks you mentioned you had gathered feedback from about 100 key customers. Could you share some -- any additional details around I guess customer requests for either more product functionality or flexibility or even on the pricing side. So for example, is there any demand for a subscription pricing model for on-prem firewalls? 
Nikesh Arora: Yes, thank you for the question. Look I'll tell you a funny story. When I did the customer tour when I started Palo Alto Networks, I got a lot of curiosity meetings because people wanted to know who's this new guy who's come into cybersecurity want to talk to me. And I went there and talked about firewalls and I told them about all of our subscriptions and many that are polite and listen to me nicely and bow their heads. But they've been buying firewalls for 15 years. And it might have been new and exciting for me. They've been buying it for a long time. And the CIs of CCS were interested, but this was on top of mind. What has changed in the last 18 months is that we talk about cloud transformation and how the cloud transformation has to be secured with Prisma Access and Prisma Cloud. We talk about their stock how their stock is getting too much data. And then in the expense of that data to be able to be more secure. So now we're having real conversations where they want to talk about this transformation. And slowly and steadily it's emerging that we're one of the few companies which have those products and are committing to developing them further with our customers than anybody else in the market. And I would challenge the industry to show us who else is out there talking about these topics with our customers. So the conversations are really, really good. They're actually meaningful. We are seeing a lot of conversation in our network transformation. We are seeing a lot of conversation with customers we want to be in multiple clouds. One year ago it was -- they were going to a single cloud. A year later, they found they have instances of different cloud infrastructure is being used by different parts of the organization. So they want a multi-cloud security solution. So the conversations are changing in terms of what people are talking about. In terms of what they want, I don't think you're going to see available on-prem firewalls anytime soon because there are many players in the space and customers have a motion and a way of buying these things and capitalizing them. So if somebody wants it, I'm sure we can construct a financial solution for them that allows them to buy that way. But honestly, we're not seeing demand for financial creativity to buy firewalls. I think there is going to be some conversations in the future about how these architectures over time need to be fungible that if I'm going to have a data center and a cloud install how do I make sure I can move things fungibly between them. And our teams are working hard or trying to understand that need and see if we need to make any forays in that direction.
Howard Ma: Okay. Thanks, Nikesh. That's really great color. I had a related follow-up for Kathy. It seems like subscription billings were very strong and that's driven a lot by the Cortex XDR. And so if we were to get -- product billings have performed in line with your expectations because the overall billings number was actually towards the high-end of your guidance. And despite the revenue -- the full year rev guide down, the billings is actually -- you guys only guided it down $20 million, $30 million. So if we -- product was in line with expectations would total billings have actually -- could we have seen a billings raise?
Nikesh Arora: Well, I think that's a very good question and I'm going to let Kathy respond in a second, but I think this is a point I tried to highlight in my beginning of the remarks that our teams are really excited. We're delivering the billing numbers we have on tap. We're just delivering them in the wrong box as per your expectations. So delivering them on Cortex and Prisma more aggressively than we expected and we're seeing a product mix. So, we're making it hold, which is interesting, which is a short-term financial impact, which changes our revenue and EPS in the very short term. But this is phenomenal news for the long term. We have deferred revenues rising better than it has in the past. So, I will let Kathy add more color to that.
Kathy Bonanno: Yes. We've obviously been really thrilled with the strong subscription performance, not just NGS, but also our cash subscriptions are growing nicely. And we've introduced some new subscriptions DNS and SDN which is just very new. And in addition, we've introduced a platinum support product as well. So, all of those are helping contribute to strong subscription growth which we feel really terrific about obviously. So, look we left our NGS full year guidance the same. We didn't move that this time. But we are feeling really terrific about all of those numbers. And the product decline is certainly the driver of all of the change to our revenue and billings guidance.
Howard Ma: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Moving on to Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group.
Nehal Chokshi: Yes. Thank you. I'd like to ask about the accelerated share repurchase timing? And also, what has been the thinking on why have you only repurchased $200 million to $1 billion original share purchase -- repurchase deployed so far?
Nikesh Arora: Yes, thanks for the question. Look, the -- we have a 10b5-1 plan filed which allow us to buy stock back out of $1 billion authorization at certain levels. And when we looked at the strength of our billings, we look at the growth trajectory of the company and our comfort in the management team and we look to the product thing. We anticipated that you would not take kindly to our product execution issue. We think this is a very good company in the long term. So, we feel the best thing we can do for our shareholders is to return capital by buying back shares because, we think they're very, very attractive at these levels.
Kathy Bonanno: And it will take place in Q3 -- in Q3.
Nikesh Arora: And if you look at that $3.5 billion of cash on balance sheet, so we've already outlined our M&A strategy which says we're going to be doing tuck-ins to our product strategy as opposed to try and go do any big M&A. So, from that perspective, we felt given that generate close to $1 billion of free cash flow every year, that gives us enough financial flexibility to be able to do this at this point in time.
Operator: We'll hear next from Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer.
Yi Lee: Thank you for taking my question. This is in Yi Lee for Shaul. We have two quick questions. First one for Nikesh. I think you talked about in the prepared remarks that certain key indicators tracking expecting positively on the firewall side. Nikesh, can you help us?
Kathy Bonanno: We're having a hard time hearing you. Sorry, can you speak up? We're having a hard time hearing you.
Yi Lee: Sorry, thank you for taking my question. This is Yi Lee [ph] for Shaul. Nikesh I think on your prepared remarks you talked about there are some key indicators that's tracking positively on the firewall side. Can you elaborate on what are some of the metrics you're looking at?
Nikesh Arora: Yes look as in any good sales organization, you have to look at your deals, you have to look at pipeline, you have to like your conversion capabilities, you have to look at the stages of deals that progress. You have to look at how many customers are evaluating your firewalls versus how many customers are up for refresh. So we track all those metrics. And we're seeing – seeing positive indications of those metrics that our pipeline is robust. And as I said, we are optimistic in this quarter that we have been able to close a lot more sooner than normal but we think they're going to take a normal time. But we are seeing those indicators trend up which gives us confidence about our Q3 and Q4 revival expectations from our product business. At least not as much as we had expected earlier but we still believe that as some of the earlier apps is minus 9% of trough, yes we believe it's a trough. And we believe by Q4 we'll have – we'll be in positive territory and hopefully revive back to market – market plus growth next year.
Yi Lee: Thank you for that Nikesh. And then a quick one for Kathy. On the geographic right now. I think you mentioned that the EMEA and APAC lagged for the quarter. Any chance you could give us the growth rate for the individual regions, U.S. EMEA and APAC? And maybe comment a little bit on the distribution pipeline going forward?
Kathy Bonanno: Yes. I'm sorry. I'm really struggling to hear you but I think you asked for our revenue growth by geography is that correct?
Yi Lee: Yes, that's correct, Kathy. Whether the traditional feedback now U.S. and EMEA as well as APAC. If we could get some color on the year-over-year growth rate. And maybe comment a little bit on the distribution channels going forward?
Kathy Bonanno: Yes. So our growth by theater was 15% in the Americas, EMEA's growth was 12% and APAC was 20%.
Yi Lee: Thanks Kathy and Nikesh.
Kathy Bonanno: Thank you.
Operator: And from Guggenheim Partners, we'll move next to Taz Koujalgi.
Imtiaz Koujalgi: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on your guidance revision. So Kathy If I do my math right here, you're guiding down revenues by about $90 million for the year but your billings are being guided down by only 35. So what's the offset given that you're guiding down park revenues up thing by $90 million? And you're not even raising your next-gen guide. So what is the offset for billings versus the decline in product revenues?
Kathy Bonanno: Yes. As I mentioned in the response to the last question, we are seeing strong subscription growth. Not just in our NGS subscriptions but also in our attached subscriptions including some of the newer subscriptions that we've launched which are contributing. And will launch yes in the future.
Imtiaz Koujalgi: Got it. And then one second question. Just to clarify you mentioned that part revenues would be positive in 4Q, right? Because if I do the math on your full year revenue guide and then assume typical seasonality on your support and subscription revenues, it still leads to negative product growth for obviously Q3 and also Q4. So can you just clarify Q4 should be – should we expect Q4 to be positive product growth?
Kathy Bonanno: Yes we are expecting positive growth in Q4 positive product year-over-year revenue growth.
Imtiaz Koujalgi: Got it. Thanks, Kathy.
Operator: And Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal has our next question.
Keith Bachman: Hi. Thank you very much. I have two questions I'm going to ask you currently. The first is Palo Alto had trouble establishing and then hitting targets. And so while on the subscription side things have gone quite well. The performance of products has been very different. So you're guiding to a lesser decline if you will in Q3 and then product growth in Q4. But what's the process that you think that you've either crewed upon or have more information because candidly haven't been very effective at hitting targets. So what's different now that gives you confidence in terms of a process or a higher discount rates so to speak on the targets that you established? And the corollary question is, I know you're saying this is more internal than external. But if you look at growth rate between Fortinet product growth that are double-digit revenue growth and you are down 9%. So it's a 20% spread on your product growth rates. It's just hard to believe that, there's not competitive activities there. There are lots that are causing meaningful share loss. So I just one of the corollary question is, what gives you the confidence that you're not actually losing share and this is more internal and external? And that's it for me. Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: All right. Well, thank you for your question. Yeah. Look I think – I will repeat some of what I said. Last year, when we did our forecast, we would be delighted with some of the Next-Generation Security growth and we expect product growth to continue. And majority of that happened. But in Q4, we saw product slowdown. And we saw Next-Generation Security take up, because our teams have been focusing on generating a lot of commissions for themselves. And we look to the number in absolute. And as for analysts indicated in absolute we are delivering the billings. We are still delivering industry-leading growth in cybersecurity. There's no other company of our scale and size delivering the numbers that we are. So I know you're very focused on the product piece that's but so are we let's focus on that. You talked about the competitive activity. I think it's unfair to look at spreads. These numbers are different. Fortinet has different revenue than we do. And absolutely, yes, there is still a spread. They operate in different segments we operate in different segments. They've been seeing strength in SD-WAN. They've been seeing strength in the low end market where the computer price. We've looked at the entire market. We inspect every deal and every deal where we're competing with other people now. So part of our competitive data is based on customer-by-customer understanding, who we're competing with and if they're not. So two things. One is – sorry – giving – 
Keith Bachman: Nikesh. Jump in though but in terms of the forecast the last two product forecast. Have you put a higher a bit more conservatism you think as we look out the next two quarters?
Nikesh Arora: Kathy, you want to say something?
Kathy Bonanno: Yeah. I just want to be sure that we haven't guided to product revenue. And I think, if you go back and look at our history of actually when we've missed, you really don't find there are many quarters where we missed. And probably, we do pretty well compared to those companies would be my guess.
Nikesh Arora: All right.
Kathy Bonanno: Okay. I would seek before. Thank you.
Operator: We'll hear now from Patrick Colville with Arete Research.
Patrick Colville: Hi, there. Thank you for taking the question. I just want to talk about SD-WAN because that was the big launch back in December last year. And just wondering if you could share any anecdotes on SD-WAN kind of early feedback? And I guess not to flog the dead horses product stuff. But is that a contributing factor? Or just any color there would be great.
Nikesh Arora: Yes, look as I mentioned, there is a lot of interest out of the market from an SD-WAN perspective. Because remember there is a very large installed base of MPLS. And as people are going down the cloud journey, they are looking at the fact why do I need to bring all my traffic back home to my data center? Why can't I just send it from my branches, my remote offices, my other data centers straight to the cloud. And that is causing the SD-WAN conversation to happen. It's pretty standard now that people will replace that MPLS solution with Interac as well SD-WAN, but then they need security. So with that as a background, since Lee is here on the call that I feel like he has to earn a fee on the call. Lee can you talk more about the SD-WAN market?
Lee Klarich: Sure, Nikesh. Happy to earn Keith. But Patrick as you mentioned SD-WAN was released in December. So it's still very early days, but we are seeing a lot of interest, a lot of very positive reaction from customers. We have dozens of customers already that are deployed. In the quarter, we had a multimillion dollar SD-WAN deployment, which gives us a lot of excitement to see the larger deals coming through as well. And I would say even perhaps more exciting is that, while these additional deals and deployments are more of the do-it-yourself kind of variety, which is how the SD-WAN market has operated in the past, what we're hearing from our customers is that they really like our ability to combine this with Prisma Access in a more of sassy kind of variety of solution. Where we're providing the network and the networking and the security from the cloud and lighter weight branch deployments to connect to that cloud. That's the promise is asking. We're getting a lot of very of very good feedback from customers about that is the future of how these architectures, these network transformation should happen.
Patrick Colville: Great. And can I talk about internal segmentation. Because I do a bit of work speaking to CISOs. And one of the trends that I've been picking up of late is the ransomware it's become increasingly prevalent threats. And the way to combat it has been increasing use of internal segmentation. So I was wondering if you've seen that as well? And what kind of boxes people are buying to segment their networks internally?
Lee Klarich: Yes. So I actually separate those two things. Ransomware is a generally a solvable problem. And we have a number of ways of preventing ransomware from getting into a customer's enterprise to begin with. Segmentation can be a backstop to that, but to me segmentation is a much broader initiative that's focused more on building Zero trust architectures, designed around increasingly mobile workforce, increased number of devices, locations and devices, increasing cloud deployments, public cloud and SaaS deployments, where customers as they have their enterprise architecture is transformed are looking to move to an increasingly zero trust architecture, which then leads down the path of needing to do better segmentation to have the right enforcement points in the right part of the network. We're very well suited for this because in that architecture, it's not just about a location device. It's about being able to build context oriented policy everywhere and consistently. And we are unique and have been unique for many years an ability to meet that requirement.
Patrick Colville: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And from Mizuho, we'll hear from Gregg Moskowitz.
Gregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thank you very much and good afternoon. So Nikesh, you mentioned earlier that product revenue would return to market growth in fiscal '21. But as I think we all know, for many years Palo Alto has been growing significantly above market rate. And I realize that you're taking out from the go-to-market issues. But can you shed some light on how you're thinking about your Firewall market share over a medium to longer-term basis? And then also, what do you think the Firewall market growth rate will look like over that period of time.
Nikesh Arora: I thought I had you by saying we're going to market growth or better because I didn't want to predict the firewall market. That's a very good question. Thank you. Look, the reason we're not expecting to grow faster than market from a share perspective because we believe we will be taking share. We will be taking share in the software form factor. Every solution that can solve -- that is sold by a box by some of our competitors, we sold by VM. We sold by a container VM. We sold by a Prisma Access delivered by the cloud solution. All these things do not classify as product revenue in the way we report. All these things end up in next-generation security. So, this is the trap, we fall into in terms of how you recognize box sales versus software sales and the transition companies like ours have to go so. So yes, we definitely expect to be taking market share from everybody else. We think that we'll be recommending software solutions to our customers with SD-WAN with VMs for the cloud, with container VMs s for containers. But they're not going to follow the product box. So, I believe I can sustain product growth at market levels? Yes, which means I have a lot of new share and the market on my boxes and I will take share with software form factors because most transitions are being discussed in software form factors and not as straightforward replace the box A and box B.
Gregg Moskowitz: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Nikesh. And then just a follow-up for Kathy. Can you comment just on how discounting rates were this quarter? And related to that, was there any pushback at all from customers or from the channel on the recent appliance price increases? Thank you.
Kathy Bonanno: Sorry what were the rates you asked me about?
Gregg Moskowitz: Sorry Kathy?
Kathy Bonanno: Sorry, you asked me about discount rates?
Gregg Moskowitz: Correct. And just if there's any pushback from customers on the recent appliance price increases?
Kathy Bonanno: Yes, we did see a small uptick in our discount rates this quarter. We feel like on the balance with the price -- the price increase that we took on product, we were still at least on par maybe a little bit better off with the price increase.
Gregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our final question today will be from Gray Powell with BTIG.
Gray Powell: Great. Thanks for marking me in. Yes, I just had a quick one. So, how should we think about the growth rate of attached subscriptions given what's going on in the product side? And then, what do you see as the key levers to drive that component of the business going forward? Thanks.
Kathy Bonanno: Yes. Well, attach subscriptions have obviously performed really well in the most recent quarter along with the NGS subscription growth as I've already talked about. The reality is, we've sold a number of enterprise agreements which customers buy our subscriptions in advance and then they tend to buy more product as time goes on that's sort of part of the agreement that we strike with them. And so, we are expecting subscription growth to continue to be strong with the new subscriptions that we're adding and with continued strong attach rates. And then as we return product growth to higher levels, obviously that will help with the general attached subscriptions as well.
Gray Powell: Got it. I guess what I was trying to get at would be with the new subscriptions coming online, should attach subscription be faster than maintenance?
Kathy Bonanno: Yes, definitely. Yes. And we've seen that historically. Yes for sure.
Gray Powell: Okay. Thank you.
Kathy Bonanno: Yes, you bet.
Operator: Anything further Mr. Powell?
Gray Powell: I'm sorry. I am good.
Operator: Thank you. And everyone, I'll turn the conference back to you all for closing remarks.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you. Before I close, I want to thank everybody again for joining us. We look forward to seeing many of you at RSA and an upcoming investor conferences. But I also would like to thank our customers, our partners and most importantly, our employees around the world who worked hard to deliver the quarter. Thank you everyone. Have a great evening.
Operator: Again that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for joining us.

===== 2020 Q1  (2019-11-25 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Please standby. Good day. And welcome to the Palo Alto Networks Fiscal First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I’d like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Niederman, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

We would also like to inform you that we will be attending two investor conferences next month, we will participate at the Wells Fargo TMT Summit in Las Vegas on December 3rd and at the Barclays Global Technology Media and Telecommunications Conference on December 11th in San Francisco. And with that, I will turn the call over to Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you, David. Good afternoon, and thank you everyone for joining our call. As most of you know, with this quarter, I am lapping my first Q1 at Palo Alto Networks. In my very first call, I talked about my observations on the industry and our goals of the company. About a year ago, we were great single product company focusing on integration and automation. We have made some early moves towards the aspirations of the cloud where we are beginning to build products with AI and ML, recognizing the evolving trends in technology. One year later, I couldn’t be happier with our achievements. We have made significant progress moving into a leading position in cloud security, making great strides in automation using AI and ML across our product portfolio. Our speedboats are working. We are delivering integration. This is bearing fruit and our customers seeing the benefit and betting more and more on Palo Alto Networks. A few months ago, we set out a three-year plan for the company and shared it with you during our Analyst Day in September. While I intend to share our progress during this quarter, I also want to provide a report card on how I feel we are progressing towards the longer term goals that we have set for ourselves. And perhaps, more importantly, I’d like to share where we are feeling more confident and also where we need more work. This is the first quarter we are marking ourselves against the target that we presented in September. We have published a slide that is available on our Investor Relations website that you can download to follow along with my comments. We will be targeting our progress against this plan. Let’s start with our overall billings targets and how they are tracking. We are delighted to have done better than our guidance. As I am learning the rhythm of our -- an enterprise business, I understand that enterprises put a lot of effort in driving good year end and then they have to kick-start new years. I was advised that sometimes there can be challenges sustaining momentum into new fiscal year, but our teams have delivered and we are off to the races. As I spoke with investors after Analyst Day, many asked me, what makes you confident that you can achieve billings of $800 plus million in next-generation security this year? I am delighted to report that after a great Q4, we have maintained the momentum and have been able to better our plans, delivering next-generation security billings of $170 million, which is 217% year-over-year. So sticking with my scorecard, I have more confidence in our ability to continue to deliver here. To show our growing confidence, we are increasing our guidance for next-generation security billings for the full year to $810 million to $820 million. The one area that we did not deliver to our expectation in the quarter is product, which weighed on the growth of the firewall as a platform category and grew only 11% year-over-year, the category firewall as a platform grew only 11% year-over-year. In fiscal 2019, we provided incentives to our teams to build our next-generation security business. By Q4, they showed us they could with very strong results. That momentum carried into the start of fiscal 2020, with strong next-generation security pipeline going into Q1. However, even though we have balanced our sales incentives this year, it looks like it’s going to take us a little more for that change to take effect. Despite our performance this quarter, we continue to have confidence in our ability to deliver a 23% CAGR over the next three years in the firewall as a platform category, with contributions from all three form factors hardware, virtual and as a service. To help our efforts in this area, we have established our third speedboat to coincide with our security enterprise pillar. This speedboat will be led by Andy Elder who was recently the Chief Revenue Officer of Riverbed. This gives Amit, our President, three speedboat leaders, along with our regional leaders. With that change, we have chosen not to replace the position of Head of Sales and on a flatter organization, allowing us to continue to be nimble in our transformation to a multi-product company. Back to our scorecard, our revenues remain on target. Now let’s travel down to our EPS, margins and cash flow. I did get to read many of the analyst’s report on this topic and I want to help you appreciate a point we made at our Analyst Day. This fiscal year is our year of investment in transformation. We are not looking to cut costs, we are looking to invest. However, we are holding our teams to a plan. Our plan asks us to deliver an EPS of $5.00 to $5.10 for this year and we intend to stick to it, without accounting, of course, the proposed acquisition of Aporeto, which I just announced. Our Q1 adjusted free cash flow margin was light compared to our annual target due to the timing of certain cash flows. However, we remain on track with our annual guidance. So with that, let’s now dive in the exciting product announcements we debuted at our Ignite Conference in Barcelona earlier this month. Many of our customers are taking integrated bets across our enterprise, cloud and the AI, ML products, while a year ago we were just talking about the ambition today, we see the three platforms emerging in our product strategy. As you know, we have branded our cloud solutions Prisma, and our application framework in AI and ML products Cortex that left our firewall business needing a brand. Today we are announcing Strata, a brand for our firewall and attach subscription. We are pleased with the innovations we are making to secure the enterprise. As some of you might be aware, we announced DLP and SD-WAN for Prisma Access at our Ignite event in Barcelona two weeks ago. We will extend SD-WAN capabilities to our next-generation firewalls with an attach subscription to be available shortly, and then IoT in 2020. In the span of 18 months, we will take our attach subscriptions from four to seven. These new subscriptions will be simultaneously available in a virtual firewall format. As a quick side note, DNS security now boasts over 1,000 customers and is our fastest growing attach subscription having launched just in February of this year. In this category, we continued to garner recognition for our technical leadership and were named as the leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Network Firewalls for the eighth consecutive time. We were also recognized as a leader by Forrester in their recent Zero Trust extended ecosystem platform providers Wave report. We feel good about the overall growth potential of firewall as a platforms and are excited about the ongoing innovation we have planned in this area. Moving to securing the cloud and access to the cloud, let me first talk about Prisma Access. We are very excited about the recent innovations we have announced, including SD-WAN and DLP services, a new cloud-based management UI and new SaaS service level agreement. Prisma Access is now the industry’s most comprehensive secure access service edge platform. This gives Prisma Access a potential to be a leader in a new market category defined by Gartner called SASE or secure access service edge. SASE is a convergence of network and cloud security that recognizes the new demands required to secure cloud and mobile work forces, while also delivering on integration and ease of management. Prisma Access is perfectly suited to be leader in this emerging category. We are incredibly excited to bring this announced product to our customers. Moving across to Prisma Cloud, one of the questions I often get asked is, are you deploying the string of pearls strategy? The answer is no. I want to point out, we are doing something different. We are integrating into three platforms. Our goal is to make life easier for our customers through integration. A prime example is Prisma Cloud. As soon as we acquired Redlock, we integrated it into the evident functionality in four months. This past week, we have announced the integration of Redlock, Twistlock and PureSec into one platform, yes, one platform, Prisma Cloud. Now for our SaaS version, you can only buy one product which is the integrated product. I am very proud of our Prisma team who have delivered this effort in a record time of five months since acquisition, and of course, we will continue to work on delivering more cross-product capability over the next year. Prisma Cloud allows organizations to obtain a full and unified view of their cloud security and compliance posture across any type of cloud workload, including containers, serverless and host environments under a single pane of glass. Prisma Cloud also integrates security in the software development workloads, allowing developers the ability to see vulnerability status every time they run a build without having to run a separate tool. I personally believe Prisma Cloud is fast becoming the essential multi-cloud, multi-technology platform, now with over 1,000 customers. Keeping to a theme of providing more capability, today we announced our intent to acquire Aporeto. After an extensive market scan and thinking through how we believe micro-segmentation can fundamentally be reinvented. We decided to accelerate our efforts to the proposed acquisition of Aporeto. Aporeto has unique machine identity based micro-segmentation capabilities that complement the existing cloud native security platform capabilities delivered by Prisma Cloud. We are incredibly excited to welcome the team to Palo Alto Networks. In addition to the Aporeto acquisition, our team continues to drive hard innovation on the Prisma Cloud platform. Now let’s turn to Cortex. I am also proud of this team. This team has outperformed their billings forecast for the first quarter by almost 20%. We introduced Cortex XDR 2.0 at Ignite. This is an integrated version with both endpoint protection and XDR capabilities. When we launched Cortex 1.0 about six months ago, we are the only vendor to take EDR and reinvented with network data to deliver XDR. It’s been gratifying to see several other vendors follow suit and offer their own XDR term products. We continue to stay on the bleeding edge in this category. We are extending Cortex XDR’s behavioral analytical capabilities to include data and logs collected from third-party firewalls, enabling detection across multi-vendor environments. We announced the inclusion of Check Point Firewall Data at Ignite. We also hope to be able to accept data from Fortinet and Cisco before the year is over. This is probably the only time you will hear me talk about our competitors in a neutral way. In the first nine months of Cortex XDR, we have enabled organizations to reduce alert volumes by up to 50x and speed investigation time by about 8x, filtering out the noise and allowing analysts to focus on those critical threats. Turning to Demisto, which is part of our Cortex brand, a couple of months ago, we enhanced our comprehensive security orchestration automation response platform, Demisto by adding a number of new capabilities. Demisto 5.0 redefines the limits of sore customizability, enabling users to visualize incident and indicator flows in a completely tailored manner, improving the clarity and speed of security operations. What’s even more exciting is what Lee talked about at our ignite event, our ability to collect telemetry data on how Demisto is being used. We are starting to get this data on customers. We will start to see the benefits, where we can give them more insights on how to get the most of this platform, including which playbooks are the most valuable and which integrations work the best. Finally, we are very pleased to announce a new high-end support offering called platinum support for our physical and virtual firewalls and our Panorama management system. This is a continuation of our goal to provide the highest level of service to our customers. Platinum supported the NaaS version of our premium support offering and will feature dedicated teams and best-in-class response times, and also several other new features designed to ensure our customers peace of mind knowing that Palo Alto Networks deep expertise in their quarter, whenever they need it. This is just an overview of all that we have introduced at Ignite and I encourage you to review the archive presentation from that event. As a continued measure of that confidence during the quarter, we repurchased nearly $200 million worth of our shares. To conclude, we had a great first quarter. I feel more confident in our ability to deliver the plan we set out for this year. Our product teams have rolled out exciting innovations and have us on the leading edge in multiple categories from firewalls to XDR to SOAR to SASE and cloud security. As I contemplate our road map for the next 12 months, I become even more excited to see the security category strengthening, knowing that our products will continue to mature and be deployed by our customers around the world. With that, I will turn the call over to Kathy.
Kathy Bonanno: Thank you, Nikesh. Before I start, I’d like to note that except for revenue and billings figures, all financial figures are non-GAAP and growth rates are compared to the prior year periods, unless stated otherwise. As Nikesh indicated, we had a good start to our fiscal year and are tracking well against the targets we had outlined during our Analyst Day in September. In the first quarter, we continued to add new customers at a healthy clip and sustained momentum in our next-gen security products. Let’s look at some key customer wins. We signed an eight-figure deal with a leading casino company, spanning each of our three pillars. This engagement was positioned with their entire IT leadership team from the director level, all the way to the CIO as a comprehensive outcome-based security transformation project. The large retail customer we highlighted last quarter expanded their Palo Alto Networks footprint this quarter with a seven-figure Cortex deal. This customer purchased Cortex XDR and Data Lake setting them up for comprehensive data analysis going forward. We beat Check Point and replaced Cisco to win a substantial deal with a major European toy manufacturer, who purchased next-gen firewalls Prisma Access and Traps. This customer has selected Palo Alto Networks as their strategic security partner and in the coming years, we expect them to replace their current firewall with next-generation firewall from Palo Alto Networks, their current VPN solution will be replaced by Prisma Access and endpoint protection will be covered by Traps. These wins are excellent examples of our success in articulating our vision of security and being able to demonstrate our value proposition to customers, and I am pleased to report that wins such as these help us deliver another strong quarter financially. In Q1, total revenue grew 18% to $771.9 million. Looking at growth by geography, the Americas grew 18%, EMEA grew 16%, and APAC grew 21%. Q1 product revenue of $231.2 million declined 4% compared to the prior year. Q1 SaaS-based subscription revenue of $318.6 million increased 38%. Support revenue of $222.1 million increased 21%. In total, subscription and support revenue of $540.7 million increased 30% and accounted for a 70% share of total revenue. Turning to billings, Q1 total billings of $897.4 million, net of acquired deferred revenue, increased 18%. The dollar-weighted contract duration for new subscription and support billings in the quarter remained at approximately three years, but declined by approximately three months year-over-year. Total deferred revenue at the end of Q1 was $3 billion, an increase of 26%. In addition to new customer acquisition, we continued to increase our wallet share with existing customers. Our top 25 customers, all of which made a purchase this quarter spend a minimum of $41.7 million in lifetime value through the end of fiscal Q1 2020, a 24% increase over the $33.6 million in the comparable prior year period. Q1 gross margin was 76.6%, which was down 10 basis points compared to last year. Q1 operating margin was 15.8%, a decline of 500 basis points year-over-year and includes a headwind of approximately $7 million of net expense associated with our recent acquisition. We ended the first quarter with 7,382 employees. On a GAAP basis for the first quarter, net loss increased by 56% to $59.6 million or $0.62 per basic and diluted share. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter declined 9% to $104.8 million or $1.05 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for Q1 was 22%. Turning to cash flow and balance sheet items, we finished October with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $3.3 billion. During the first quarter, we repurchased over 947,000 shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $209 per share, leaving a remaining repurchase authorization of approximately $800 million. Q1 cash flow from operations of $225.2 million, decreased by 11% year-over-year. Free cash flow was $178 million, down 18% at a margin of 23.1%. Adjusting for cash charges associated with our headquarters in Santa Clara, free cash flow in the quarter was $202.7 million, representing a margin of 26.3%. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $47.2 million, of which $22.7 million was associated with our headquarters in Santa Clara. DSO was 63 days, an increase of five days from the prior year period. Turning now to guidance and modeling points. For fiscal Q2 ‘20, we expect revenue to be in the range of $838 million to $848 million, an increase of 18% to 19% year-over-year. We expect billings to be in the range of $985 million to $1 billion, an increase of 16% to 17% year-over-year. We expect Q2 ‘20 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.11 to $1.13, which incorporates approximately $3 million of net expense or $0.02 per share related to the proposed acquisition of Aporeto using approximately 100 million shares to 102 million shares. For the full year fiscal 2020, we expect revenue to be in the range of $3.44 billion to $3.48 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 19% to 20%. We are increasing our prior billings guidance by $10 million to $4.105 billion to $4.165 billion, representing growth of 18% to 19% year-over-year. As Nikesh said earlier, we are also increasing prior guidance for next-gen security billings by $10 million to be in the range of $810 million to $820 million, representing year-over-year growth of 79% to 82%. We expect fiscal ‘20 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $4.90 to $5.00, which incorporates approximately $13 million of net expenses or $0.10 per share related to the proposed acquisition of Aporeto, using approximately 102 million shares to 104 million shares. Finally, turning to free cash flow, for the full year, we continue to expect an adjusted free cash flow margin of approximately 30%. This excludes approximately $20 million in net expenses and acquisition transaction costs attributable to the proposed acquisition of Aporeto. Including these net expenses, we would expect adjusted free cash flow margin of approximately 29%. As a reminder, the adjustments to free cash flow include CapEx associated with the completion of our headquarters in Santa Clara. You can review these adjustments to free cash flow in our supplemental financial information document, which is posted on our Investor Relations website. Before I conclude, I’d like to provide some additional modeling points. We expect our Q2 and fiscal ‘20 non-GAAP effective tax rate to remain at 22%. CapEx in Q2 will be approximately $50 million, with approximately $25 million related to our headquarters in Santa Clara. For the full year, we continue to expect CapEx to be approximately $170 million to $180 million, with approximately $50 million related to our headquarters. With that, I’d like to open the call for questions. Operator, please poll for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question today from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.
Keith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. Nikesh, I was hoping to drill down a little bit more into the firewall as a platform side of the equation, where it seems you guys are a little bit disappointed. It sounds like the incentives that you guys had in place last year, just sort of push more of like the new business activity or more of the pipeline building on to the next-gen cloud stuff and let you guys a little bit short on pipeline heading into the FY ‘20. One, am I thinking about that correctly in terms of kind of where you guys came up a little bit short? And two, how do you guys think when you are looking at sort of assessing the problem, how do you vet out what comes from sort of that kind of execution issue versus what might be more of a macro or competitive issue?
Nikesh Arora: Thanks, Keith, for your questions. You are thinking about it right. As you know, many of our next-generation security products are very early in their life cycle. So, literally, there’s stuff like Twistlock we acquired in July, there’s stuff like Demisto, all these things haven’t even lapped one year. So we put a lot of effort towards getting our core team to both, learn, understand, build pipeline and sell and in that process we set up some good incentives for them to focus on next-generation security, because pretty much the entire conversation for my first year here was, they love the fact that you are a great firewall company, how are you guys are going to keep transforming as the firewall market transitions. And we set out, our team and me, we set out to prove to ourselves that not only can we build the products in addition to firewall, but we can make this a multi-product company. So part of that is Lee’s team did a great job in getting the products in place and thinks on the integration work I talked about. The go-to-market team is starting to make sure they can prove -- that they can sell this stuff. And we are very excited that approximately 40% of our core salespeople sold Cortex this past quarter, approximately 25% of them sold Prisma. So we are tracking to the targets we set ourselves in terms of getting our core engaged. But because of the incentives, people made their decisions that they can make more money selling Cortex and Prisma in Q4 than selling firewalls. As a consequence, we saw a huge pipeline build and a lot of deals done in Q4, the momentum carried to Q1. We recognized this coming into the year. We have right-sized these incentives, but it takes a little bit longer for the pipeline till we get back into place. I don’t think there’s a systemic issue. I don’t think it’s a market share issue. I just think it’s taking the eye off the ball and we have already put stuff into place and we wouldn’t be saying we feel confident of delivering 23% long-term, if we didn’t believe that we could actually get the team to balance their focus both on Cortex, Prisma, as well as the firewall.
Keith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Next we will hear from Sterling Auty with JP Morgan.
Sterling Auty: Yeah. Thanks. Hi. Maybe just following on that last question, can you help us understand that, I think, the EPS guidance for the year includes the acquisition. The revenue guidance is unchanged. So just so we get a sense of what looks like lowering the organic revenue for the year. How -- maybe the order of magnitude, how much acquisition revenue are you kind of baking into the reiterated full year revenue number?
Nikesh Arora: Yeah. Look, we acquired this company called Aporeto. We are in the process of acquiring it. This is slightly earlier in the technology lifecycle of cloud security. This is a bet we are making in terms of how micro segmentation will need to be done in the future and with that bet, it’s going to take us a while to integrate this into our Prisma Cloud offering. So we are not anticipating much revenue uplift this year. So we are holding revenue flat from -- as a flat in line with guidance, without expecting any revenue impact this fiscal year from Aporeto. But we -- obviously we have to pay the cost for the company.
Sterling Auty: Okay. And then one follow-up on Prisma specifically, you talked on the other side, I think, at length through the prepared remarks. I think last quarter you talked about maybe some early Prisma wins. Can you give us just maybe a little bit more color on the traction that you saw in the quarter especially on the competitive dynamics with Prisma?
Nikesh Arora: Well, look, both on Prisma Cloud and Prisma Access and I am sure you all remember Nir’s emotional explanation on Analyst Day around Prisma Access, which is the product that competes in the secure access space. We are very excited. We are seeing -- we continue to see traction. We continue to see large seven-figure deals in that space. It’s a space where we are seeing the market is going. There is a cloud transformation happening. As you start transforming your applications to the cloud, you start thinking about how to transform your network and start creating more high bandwidth secure access to all of your users and your branches. So we see the market moving there. We see our product getting stronger and more mature. As we said, we announced the availability of SD-WAN and DLP in the product, where -- which makes it a comprehensive solution in the market. So we are seeing the traction. Those deals take the same time as firewall deals take to close because customers have to go through a strategic transformation of the network. So they are not as quick as Prisma Cloud deals. On the other side, as I said, we have, I think, in record time, gone past 1,000 pure cloud security customers across Redlock, Evident, Twistlock, PureSec, which, in our mind, is one of the fastest ramps in terms of our ability to get 1,000 customers to deploy our cloud security product. And this is when we were selling them individually and we just last week integrated all of them into one SKU. So we believe that gives us more traction. So we are very excited about the traction we are seeing in the Prisma product.
Sterling Auty: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Next we will hear from Fatima Boolani with UBS.
Fatima Boolani: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. I had one for Nikesh and one for Kathy. Nikesh for you just harkening back to the Analyst Day, we did talk about contract structuring as a mechanism to allow you to introduce new functionality into the installed base. So I am wondering with regard to the expansion in the unattached portfolio and even the attached portfolio of subscriptions, I was wondering if you could share some of the details of what has changed or what is different as you start this new fiscal year around some of the newer expanded capabilities in Prisma Cloud. And certainly, this new acquisition, as well as on the DNS and SD-WAN attached side and then I will have a follow-up for Kathy, please.
Nikesh Arora: Okay. Great. Thank you for the question, Fatima. I think as we discussed at the Analyst Day, we had said that we don’t want to have to sell every module of Prisma Cloud to our customers individually and we want to create a structure where they can actually buy once and use our products on a consumption basis. And effectively, this integrated platform we have rolled -- started rolling out last week, Prisma Cloud, where you have one SKU where all Redlock, Twistlock, PureSec functionalities available. If you bought Redlock SaaS version, you will be able to use container security without coming and signing a new deal. You will just use up some of your credits that you bought. If you bought Twistlock functionality, you would be able to do the same thing with Redlock or PureSec. So we have simplified our contracts and our ability to consume in this release of our product last week. We are in the process of rolling it out to all of our Prisma, sorry, all of our Twistlock and Redlock customers, which should be accomplished in the next few weeks, I hope. And those customers then will have the ability to consume the product without actually having to come and buy those individual products from us, which is -- takes away a lot of friction in the process. In terms of SD-WAN and DLP, they will be available integrated and part of Prisma Access, so you will not have to go buy different products and integrate them. This will come integrated out of the software box, if there’s some such thing, and you will be able to use it with a single cloud pane.
Fatima Boolani: Fair enough. That makes a ton of sense. Kathy, for you, I was wondering if you could give us an update on just some of the tariff escalation that’s happening and that’s -- sort of how that’s impacting or financially impacting your supply chain and how we should think about those costs rolling through the model. I know, historically, you quantified some of the negative financial impact on EPS. I am wondering if there is any sort of update there, given some of the whipsawing on the trade war and tariff-related escalations we have seen? Thanks a lot.
Kathy Bonanno: Sure. Thanks for the question. We do manufacture our products in the U.S. However, there are certain components that we -- as we have talked about in the past, that we source from China. That’s the only place where we are able to purchase these components. And we have seen that list of products expand as the tariff situation has expanded in the U.S., as it relates to China products. So, we have felt the impact of that and we have been talking for a while about the impact to EPS. However, just at the start of this new fiscal quarter -- fiscal Q2, we did increase pricing on our firewalls and that increase in pricing is intended to offset the tariff impact. So that’s why you don’t see us outlining a specific financial impact this quarter.
Fatima Boolani: That’s super clear. Thank you so much, Kathy.
Kathy Bonanno: Yeah.
Operator: We will now hear from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.
Phil Winslow: Hi. Thanks guys for taking my question. I just wanted to focus in on the next-gen firewall platform space. Kathy and Nikesh, you both have talked about the opportunity just to refresh the older models that you all sold in the past. I am wondering if you could provide us an update on -- sort of what you are seeing right now and thinking for this year relative to past years in terms of the contribution from just refresh of your base and then just one quick follow-up to that.
Kathy Bonanno: Yeah. Sure. We have been talking about refresh activity in a couple of different ways. One, in terms of what we see with our customers’ refreshing competitive boxes, and of course, that’s been a motion that we have been competitively trying to address since the start of the company. And as you know, there is rarely a company that we go into that doesn’t already have firewalls and so it’s always been a competitive displacement go-to-market approach for us. When we talk about our own internal refresh cycle, we continue to see our customers refreshing. However, in terms of driver of growth, we pointed out that in terms of just pure magnitude of customers, our new customer acquisition, as well as our customer expansion opportunity is a much bigger driver of our overall growth and less -- much less so refresh of our own boxes that we have sold to customers previously.
Phil Winslow: Got it. Great. And then, just a follow-up for Nikesh on the platform side of your Cortex obviously, you talked about the AI-based continuous operations platform, I think, is what you called it at the Analyst Day. What’s the feedback been from customers in terms of developing their own apps, their own functionality on top of this, as well as third parties, any sort of update there would be great.
Nikesh Arora: Yeah. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, this team outperformed the numbers by approximately 20%. So there we are seeing tremendous amount of tractions, both -- traction both on the XDR side and the Demisto side, Demisto is performing way ahead of our acquisition plan. We haven’t opened up the capability for customers to write their own applications on our platform just yet. We have some apps in the old version of the application framework. But right now we focus more on providing integration out of the box with third-party vendors, so customers don’t have to try and take that and normalize the data, which has been a bit of a shift in our strategy, but we are seeing huge traction. I think it’s fair to say that one of the times when Lee announced the ingestion of checkpoint firewall data into our product was when he got a standing ovation. It’s hard to get a standing ovation from a bunch of engineers at a conference. So they must have liked that and we are going to do the same thing with Cisco and Fortinet firewall data. So that way when a customer is trying to look at alerts across firewall and endpoint data, we can ingest any firewall data, as well as match it up with our endpoints. So we are seeing traction in Cortex across both product categories, but we have not opened up the ability for people to write their own apps just yet.
Phil Winslow: All right. Thanks guys.
Operator: Next we will hear from Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.
Karl Keirstead: Thank you. Maybe I will direct both to Nikesh. So Nikesh, the product revenue disappointment is coming relatively soon after a series of sales leadership changes at Palo Alto over the last six, nine months. I am just wondering if you believe that those changes might have contributed to the product performance, and in that spirit, do you mind just repeating your rationale for not replacing the Head of Sales. So first part of the question is on the sales leadership, and then I will ask my second. Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: Sure. I think we are taking two random points, and try and draw a straight line. I personally don’t think there’s any correlation between the changes and our challenge on the product this quarter. If there was a challenge we would have [inaudible] across the Board, across every category, not just our firewalls. So, the fact that our teams have gone out and that’s the billings targets for Q4 and Q1, and we have had a mix shift in terms of what we have been able to sell, validate at least the period we are putting our or for the facts we are putting out around the fact the incentives contributed to it as opposed to our leadership changes. On the leadership change front, we have very strong leaders in our regions. We promoted Rick Congdon, who has been around for many years at Palo Alto Networks. He is doing a phenomenal job in Q4 to run our Americas business. We have Christian Hansen in Europe we have talked about in past earnings calls, as well as we have promoted Simon Green to one of JPAC business to manage the Pacific for us. So between those three, we feel we have strong leadership in the regions. And both our Prisma and Cortex leaders are doing really well, given the performance we have seen NGS. And we felt that we were not -- we don’t have a laser-focused leader on the firewall as a platform category. So we were able to hire Andy Elder, who is an amazing sales leader from Riverbed, who is going to run that part of our business in terms of focusing and making sure that as we deploy new products like Prisma Access or virtual firewalls, or going from four to seven subscriptions that there is a same go-to-market focus that we have had on Prisma and Cortex. And with that, sort of 3x3 matrix, we feel, I might need to say engaged in that transformation with these teams and putting another layer between him and these six people would be detrimental to our ability to go and execute. So we have decided not to replace the Head of Sales position.
Karl Keirstead: Got it. Okay. That’s helpful. And then, again in the spirit of just trying to unpack what might be going on. This too might be drawing an incorrect conclusion. But is it possible Nikesh that you guys saw an accelerated hardware to software form factor shift that might have cut you a little bit by surprise and contributed to that product number, but it would obviously show up in super strong VM series billings numbers?
Nikesh Arora: I wish that was the case that we have been caught unaware. So I really like to be surprised by phenomenal growth in any product category. Unfortunately, it’s just the fact that our teams had only so many dollars they could sell in Q4 and they sold a lot of them. But they sold them in the category, which was going to make them a lot of money, which is a good thing. You want your sales teams be motivated by the incentives -- realizing incentives are not working. But we have fixed the focus to make sure they have focused on both categories. So we think it’s nothing systemic. We think it happened in this quarter. And to be honest, if you look at the numbers, another $20 million of deals would have gotten us to a number, which would have made all of you happy and made us happy. But we -- that’s kind of the quantum of the change on an $897 million worth of billings. So $20 million showed up in more next-generation securities then showed up in product, which is why we are all getting unhappy about this. But hopefully, we can fix that in upcoming quarters and we can deliver to the long-term guidance of 25% CAGR.
Karl Keirstead: Got it. I am sure you will. Thank you very much, Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you.
Operator: Jonathan Ho with William Blair has our next question.
Jonathan Ho: Hi. Good afternoon. I just wanted to start out with maybe the Aporeto acquisition and could you maybe give us a little bit of a sense of what this adds to your overall solution set, as well as the role that micro segmentation plays in the cloud?
Nikesh Arora: Sure. Look, as we said in the past is that there are tons and tons of people selling the transition to the public cloud across the various large cloud providers around the world, whether it’s Alibaba cloud sales or Oracle, Amazon or GCP or Azure, they are all trying to convince us to move to cloud. We personally have thought to having moved to the cloud for that reason, because we think that’s the right outcome of the long-term. But we don’t believe that a lot of the cloud security products exists to be able to deliver the amount and quality and capability of cyber security that exist in today’s enterprise world. And as you make that transition, as we start putting more and more mission-critical applications onto the cloud, it is going to be important to reinvent the way cyber security is delivered, made for the cloud, by the cloud, what’s the third part of that? Never mind. [Inaudible] is weaker than it should be. But anyway, so as we go down that path, we believe only 50% of the cloud security products have been invented so far. And instead of sit down and try and build them all ourselves, we have acquired Redlock and Evident, in the first instance, secure workloads, the market moved swiftly to containers. We acquired Twistlock, the market was heading to serverless. We acquired PureSec. We are also in the process of building our own modules in addition to those, which we will, obviously, as part of our product road map. And we look to the world of micro segmentation and said, micro segmentation is deployed today and the data center is not the way it needs to be deployed in the cloud because micro segmentation relies on IP addressing in the data center, which is very good for the enterprise but not really how the cloud operates. And Aporeto has a really good way. They have been working at it for the last two and a half years, three years, perfecting an approach which they have deployed in two or three very large customers at scale. We looked at it and said, look, this would be a phenomenal set of capabilities to have in our cloud security platform. We talked to the company. We liked them. We looked to the whole market, and said, this is the way we want to do this in the future. As a consequence, we acquired them and this will become part of our Prisma Cloud platform. So we don’t intend this to be a separate SKU, we expect it to be part of integrated capability as part of our Prisma Cloud platform and we hope the underlying capability they bring will allow us to create more features in the future using their backlog.
Jonathan Ho: Thank you. And then just as a follow up, can you talk a little bit about maybe what you are seeing in terms of your customers from a budgeting activity standpoint for 2020 specific to Prisma Cloud and what types of trends are you seeing around that? Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: Look, I haven’t been in this industry very long. But I am told by my colleagues and the way we watch this, it’s very rare to start a cybersecurity company or a product and start closing seven-figure deals in short order, and it’s fair to say, we are seeing a healthy amount of seven-figure deals in Prisma Cloud, which tells us that there is a need out there for this product, as a product market fit. And it kind of makes sense if you think about average customers are spending tens of millions of dollars in their cloud transition moving to the public cloud providers, and I have said, this in the past, if we can get 2% to 5% of that spend for cloud security, we will be in a good place. And I think we are tracking to that as we go to customers and we see them, they are spending $30 million, $50 million a year in the public cloud. We are tracking to the 2% to 5% number for those customers. And there’s a possibility that, that goes up a little bit, because there’s a whole bunch of capabilities that doesn’t exist yet. But we have not run into budget constraints in our customers, who are moving to the cloud, and saying, well, I am moving to cloud, but I don’t have the money to do cloud security.
Operator: Thank you. We will now hear from Saket Kalia with Barclays.
Saket Kalia: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions here. First, maybe for you, Nikesh, just to go back to an earlier question on SD-WAN, I think, we understand the integration of that into Prisma Access. But can you just talk about your thoughts on SD-WAN as part of the firewall appliance and whether that’s something you feel is driving some customer purchase decisions right now?
Nikesh Arora: It seems to have become a consideration in the purchase decision. But let’s remember there’s over 40 SD-WAN providers out there in the world and customers also choose whether they want a separate SD-WAN with more capability or an integrated SD-WAN in the firewall. But given that has become a consideration, we have launched or announced SD-WAN as part of Prisma Access and you can logically expect us to be able to deliver that across every form factor in the near future.
Saket Kalia: Got it. That’s helpful.
Nikesh Arora: That’s where you were going, Saket.
Saket Kalia: Yeah. Absolutely. That was where I was going. But maybe for -- maybe for you, Kathy, just as a quick follow-up. Can you just talk about the gross margins on the recurring revenue part of the business. So much of that is that nice higher margin attached subscription and maintenance, but of course there is a nice growing piece from next-gen as well. As the latter grows, can you just talk about how that affects the gross margin profile, if at all?
Kathy Bonanno: Yeah. Sure. The gross margin range that we have provided in the past that we expect to operate within is 75% to 78% gross margins and we have continue to operate within that range for many, many quarters now. The services margin in particular, which we -- which you will see in our financials has been at the higher end of that range as you rightly point out. And it’s in fact actually come down a little bit over the last couple of years and that’s as a result of us building out the next-gen security products. Many of them which have hosting and data management costs and those costs are higher than the typical software type margins that you have seen on our attach subscriptions in the past. So, slightly different profile, but still operating overall service margins at the high end of that range.
Saket Kalia: Got it. Thank you.
Kathy Bonanno: Yeah.
Operator: Walter Pritchard with Citi has our next question.
Walter Pritchard: Hi. A question for Nikesh and then one for Kathy, so on Prisma Cloud, you talked about integrating those products probably faster than most were expecting. I am wondering how you are thinking about integrating the backend management of the Prisma Cloud products, as well as other products into Panorama? What the time line looks for that and are there some customers that are waiting for that unified management to make bigger commitments to those products?
Nikesh Arora: Walter, what we have noticed is that people want integration of the SD-WAN capability or DLP capability into the Prisma Access pane. So it can be integrated solution as they go deploy this in their branches and as they deploy for remote users. We are not seeing a lot of -- we don’t believe that’s the right thing to merge our cloud security pane into our firewall pane. Our cloud security pane is self-standing independent pane, which you believe is more relevant to DevSecOps than the CIO teams, then it is to the network security team. So, which is what we said we just announced the integrated -- sort of deploying the integrated platform across RedLock, Twistlock, PureSec, Evident last week and we believe that’s going to become the mainstay of the cloud security front-end. And Lee, do you want to add something?
Lee Klarich: Yeah. So just maybe continuing where Nikesh left off. So for Prisma Cloud, we do have a single unified UI for all different Prisma Cloud offerings. So for customers that are securing their applications in the cloud, they would go to one UI for that. Within Prisma Access, as we deliver additional integrated services, we have an ability to do that within Panorama to be able to, we call, plug-ins that can expand Panorama to include the additional capabilities as they come out. So, again, customer can go to one unified UI to see all those different pieces in one place.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks, Lee. And then, Kathy, on the acquisition, I guess, just looking up on LinkedIn, looks like the company, Aporeto, had about 65 employees. I guess, as we think about smaller kind of tuck-in M&A like this, I guess, maybe some of us would have expected, given you had a couple of hundred employees kind of organically every quarter you could kind of do this under your organic hiring plans. How should we think about that going into the future? Do we need to worry about kind of margins coming down with tuck-ins?
Kathy Bonanno: Well, we have talked about the impact, which is pretty modest impact $0.02 on the earnings per share for the quarter and we are investing in order to ensure that we can integrate these products and make sure that we are successful in our go-to-market efforts and so there is real expense associated with those. So the framework that we have given you is an organic framework and when we do M&A we will point out any incremental financial impact to that.
Walter Pritchard: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Gur Talpaz with Stifel.
Chris Speros: Hi, guys. This is actually Chris Speros on for Gur. For Nikesh, you noted earlier that Demisto was performing ahead of plan. Can you talk about the dynamics behind what’s driving this outperformance?
Nikesh Arora: Yeah. Look, I think, the whole automation use case is resonating with our customers, where they are building Data Lakes, they are looking at their SIMs, but they are realizing they are getting a huge barrage of alerts as they deploy more and more cybersecurity solutions into either the enterprise and the cloud. And Demisto is turning out to be the versatile automation tool with the number of indications it has of all security vendors out there. So we are seeing traction. Our core team is able to explain it, sell it across the Board. As I mentioned, that approximately 30-plus percent of our core sales team is selling Cortex, which includes Demisto. So it’s really the expanded go-to-market, the expanded capabilities that the new Demisto product has. It’s really driving that, and of course, the good product market fit out there.
Chris Speros: Great. That’s awesome and one for, Kathy, if I may. With more large Prisma deal starting to close, can you walk us through the relative economics of a Prisma deal versus a traditional appliance deal?
Kathy Bonanno: Yeah. Prisma Access and the functionality that it provides is typically slightly higher -- somewhat higher price than a typical firewall sales that we would see. Of course, depending upon the firewall and the number of attach subscriptions over time over a five-year period, which is the typical life cycle of a firewall, we would expect to see more revenue from the Prisma Access deal.
Chris Speros: Great. Thank you guys.
Kathy Bonanno: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question will come from Patrick Colville with Arete Research.
Patrick Colville: Thank you for taking my question. Kathy, you mentioned earlier on the call that DSOs had risen five days year-on-year. I mean is the product issue anything related to the change in DSOs. I mean are those things correlated or they separate?
Kathy Bonanno: No. There’s really no correlation there.
Patrick Colville: Okay. Understood. And then, can I just switch over to SD-WAN, because that’s an area that we are getting a lot of incoming on both from investors and CISOs. So you have mentioned that Palo is going to release appliances with SD-WAN functionality built in. So If I understand correctly, right now the devices don’t have SD-WAN, but that’s in the roadmap, is that correct?
Nikesh Arora: Yeah. That’s correct.
Patrick Colville: And I mean, can you give us a rough timeline for that or at this early stage?
Nikesh Arora: Yeah. So a couple of weeks ago at our EMEA Ignite Conference, we announced SD-WAN and we plan to deliver SD-WAN across all three form factors, so hardware, virtual and Prisma Access around the mid-December time frame, so next month.
Patrick Colville: Good. Thank you for answering the questions.
Operator: Our next question will come from Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Essex: Great. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe a couple for Nikesh, I guess, one would be, as you target products for the developer environment. To what extent are your customers already integrated development with security and is that an evolution that still has to come?
Nikesh Arora: I am going to let Lee answer that question since he’s been sitting here with not a whole lot to, he is doing the stuff.
Lee Klarich: Can you repeat the question?
Nikesh Arora: Oh! You were listening. How many of the customers have integrated security into DevOps?
Lee Klarich: Oh! Look, in the cloud, there’s a whole movement towards call shift left, which is really focused on integrating the security process and functionality and posture as close to the point of development as possible. So that by the time an application is running in production in the cloud, all of the security is already there and was developed as part of the application. This was something that Twistlock and container security was very focused on.
Brian Essex: Right.
Lee Klarich: It’s a very common practice within container development to have the shift left mentality and as we look to this going forward, we see it becoming a bigger part of cloud security practice.
Brian Essex: Got it. That’s helpful. And maybe just a follow-up -- jump on this one who whoever wants to kind of grab it, but you have done quite a bit of M&A over the past couple of years, what percentage of your sales force would you say is fully ramped on selling the entire suite or is there still some progress that needs to happen there in terms of getting everyone kind of up to speed and fully productive?
Nikesh Arora: Yeah. And as I mentioned earlier, approximately 39% of our core sales team is selling Cortex, our Cortex suite of product and approximately 25% is selling our Prisma suite of products. Of course, there is a lot of room for us to go from 40% to more and more of our sales team being able to sell these products. But having said that, many of these products have been in play only for about six months, so we have --
Brian Essex: Right.
Nikesh Arora: -- a few thousand people out there in the field and it takes a while to get them all comfortable, up to speed, being able to sell it. Not only that, we have lots of partners out there, and part of our efforts are not just to motivate and create our team, but also to make sure our partners fully understand our capabilities and are able to sell. So, yes, we can make more progress, but, again, very excited about the progress we have made so far with the new product categories.
Brian Essex: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our final question will come from Michael Turits with Raymond James.
Michael Turits: Hey, guys. Thanks. I will squeeze two in quickly. One, Nikesh, in Prisma Access, are you seeing primarily Zscaler or is it a wider field, including people like maybe Fortinet with carriers, Netskope, iboss, et cetera? And then, Kathy, how fast do you expect that you can get the product growth back to the kind of levels that we are expecting it to trend at?
Nikesh Arora: So in terms of your first part of the question, Prisma Access we will be seeing out there. Prisma Access is part of a network transformation decision that the customer makes and depending on how their current network operates and what they want to make it look like going into the cloud, there can be hardware-based solutions or software based solutions. And depending on whether it’s a smaller footprint of larger data centers versus a larger footprint of smaller branches or remote users, the architectures can vary. So you can solve this problem with different architects and different products. But we -- from our stand, I can tell you that, our software-based solution, our software-based approach and our security-first approach is resonating with them because as it goes to cloud, the security is getting distributed and they want to make sure that as they start accessing mission-critical applications straight into the cloud or back to the data centers, that security is a priority. So we are seeing traction in that space. I am sure there are many other vendors out there who have different solutions, which are adapted to their product portfolio.
Kathy Bonanno: And in terms of product growth, we don’t guide product specifically, but you can tell from the guidance that we have given both for Q2 and for the full year looking at typical trends that we have seen in the past in terms of product as a percent of the total. You can -- I am sure back into what we are expecting for product are pretty closely.
Michael Turits: Thanks, guys.
Nikesh Arora: Yeah. So before I close, I want to thank everybody again for joining us today, and I wish you and your families a very safe and Happy Thanksgiving. And we look forward to seeing many of you in the upcoming weeks at some of our investor conferences. I also want to thank our customers, our partners and employees around the world. Have a wonderful evening.
Operator: That will conclude today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2019-09-05 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Please welcome, Vice President of Investor Relations, David Niederman.
David Niederman: Hello. Thanks for coming, we really appreciate it. Good afternoon, I am David Niederman Vice President of Investor Relations at Palo Alto Networks. Thanks for joining us today to discuss our Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Results. This meeting is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed on our Investor Relations section of our website at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. Earlier this afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our results for our fiscal fourth quarter and full year ended July 31, 2019. We also provided a script of certain fiscal fourth quarter and full-year 2019 financial results and operating metrics along with applicable reconciliations as exhibits to a current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC earlier this afternoon. Copies of these materials can also be found on the Investors section of our website. I'd like to remind you that management will be making forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our near and long-term financial guidance and strategy as well as modeling points for Q1'20 and full year fiscal 2020. Please kindly take a moment to review the Safe Harbor language provided with the meeting materials, also please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis, and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. For historical periods, we provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in the supplemental financial information that can be found at the end of the presentation and the investor section of our website located at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. On stage with us today will be Nikesh Arora, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Kathy Bonanno, our Chief Financial Officer; Lee Klarich, our Chief Product Officer; and Nir Zuk, our Chief Technology Officer. We will have a Q&A forum at the end of the financial presentation. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kathy.
Kathy Bonanno: Hi everyone, thank you so much for coming today, oh look! a splattering of applause, how nice, I appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you all very, very much for coming today, we appreciate your interest in Palo Alto Networks. We have a lot to cover today, and so I'm just going to get right into it. I'm going to start by providing a quick overview of our fiscal Q4 results for the fiscal year 2019 and full year results. Nikesh will then come up and he'll walk you through our strategy and our operating framework for the next three years, and then Lee Klarich and Nir Zuk will take you through our product strategy and I'll return to cover forward-looking guidance at the end. So let's turn now to fiscal fourth quarter 2019 which capped-off another great year for Palo Alto Networks. In the quarter, we grew revenue 22% year-over-year to approximately $806 million. Quarterly billings crossed the billion-dollar mark, a first in the Company's history. And our performance in Prisma and Cortex or as we refer to them collectively as next-gen security was especially strong. Our next-gen security billings were approximately $192 million in the quarter, this represents a $768 million annual run-rate to approximately -- and accelerated our growth to approximately 180% year-over-year. For the full fiscal year, we also delivered strong top line results and full-year free cash flow was approximately $924 million. If we adjust for the cash charges associated with our headquarters in Santa Clara and the retirement of our 2019 convertible debt free cash flow for the year was $1.1 billion at a margin of 36.7%. So let's turn now to some of the product highlights for the quarter. In Q4, we completed the acquisitions of Twistlock and PureSec, and we are actively integrating them into our Prisma cloud offering. We also released significant updates to Prisma access including providing over 100 network on-boarding locations around the globe and providing clean pipe for service providers, along with several other unique capabilities in that release. In addition, we released Traps 6.1, which included expanded support for Mac OS and Linux, further strengthening our endpoint and XDR offerings. And we received FedRAMP certification for WildFire cloud, a huge milestone towards shifting government wildfire usage towards the cloud. And as you probably just saw earlier this afternoon, we announced our intent to acquire Zingbox, an enterprise IoT security company. As Nikesh will discuss a bit later, this acquisition is yet another example of our ongoing strategy to consolidate new technologies into our next generation firewall platform, making it easier for customers to protect their complex enterprise environment. In addition to product releases, we had several notable wins during the quarter. We displaced Symantec and Zscaler at a Fortune 50 U.S. retailer to secure their data center and network of more than 2000 retail outlets. We displaced Zscaler and beat Fortinet at a major European national healthcare provider in their digital transformation project. They're securing their hundreds of hospitals, along with all of their patients and employees. It was a great win for us in the quarter. We beat CrowdStrike and displaced Symantec with our Prisma and Cortex platforms at a global insurance company with more than 25 million policyholders and we beat Fortinet and displaced Cisco to become the standard security platform for the government of one of the most populist regions in Asia Pacific. In summary, there was a lot of great news in the quarter. We continue to have high win rates against our competition and add thousands of new customers every quarter. In Q4, we added nearly 3,000 new customers and are now privileged to have won nearly 65,000 customers. We're looking forward to another great year in fiscal 2020, and we'll now move on to the rest of the presentation. Please welcome, our CEO, Nikesh Arora.
Nikesh Arora: Good afternoon. Thank you very much for joining us, and thank you, Kathy. Normally when I get up on stage, I usually ask the audience, what can I answer that you leave here happy. Now many of you are so kind you've written me very long notes about what you want me to tell you, which are going to make you happy. It's very helpful. It’s like I have my marching orders, you've given me the script. So Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley, yes, we will talk about product evolution, M&A. Keith Bachman talks about depth and duration of depressed cash flow, sounds very depressing, but we'll talk about that, they're not depressed. We will go down to the details of our next generation security business and explain the financial models around you, they don't get spooked by duration issues. And yes, Brad, no hardware company of this size have made a transition like this, but hopefully we just need to keep growing and not make the transition. You do notice that we're displacing your favorite company Zscaler in many situations. So, but I'm scared today, we had changes or recommendations, something is going to happen to the rest of you guys. So for now, and I'm happy with Brad where he is?  So it's about 12 plus months, I've been at Palo Alto Networks and I know you guys have been asking for us to come about and explain how we're thinking about this Company going forward. So, hopefully in the next 75-80 minutes me, Nir, Lee and many of my management colleagues will share our plan for the next three years with you, in terms of where we want to take this Company. Before I go there, I thought I would do is quickly walk you through what I've learned over the last 12 months. Now unfortunately there is going to be no earth-shattering secrets. And what I'm going to tell you in the first section -- but hopefully, you'll get a sense that I’ve been studying this industry for a while and the problems are obvious, right, this is $140 billion industry, and we have too many vendors. I've gone to over 300 customers in the last one year. The winner so far is 212 cyber security vendors deployed under one customer. That's a lot. What that happens is when you have 212 cybersecurity vendors and cybersecurity is only 8% to 10% of your spend, it's way too many vendors for the amount of spend you do on IT compared to the rest of the vendors we have. What that results in, is people are deploying too many tools, one of these customers, not the 212 vendor customer, has nine endpoints deployed. You are going to have nine CRM systems, you’re going to have nine HR systems, have nine endpoints in one financial services organization. We think that model is broken, it's wrong, it cannot be the path of securing that enterprise for the future. If you think what we do in the industry is we give you the tools, and say now, you can write policy against it, you can spin-up a bunch of alerts and we'll give you all the alerts and you can figure out what to do with them. So we have tremendous amounts of alerts being generated in many of our customers and Lee and Nir will talk more about this. On average a customer can get 175,000 alerts a week, it's a lot of alerts. And then you spent a lot of time and effort manually going through your issues in investigating which can take anywhere from 4 to 57 days. We have an industry where we have too many vendors, too many tools, too many alerts, and too much manual labor. We think at the same time while we are busy complicating the industry, our friends -- the adversaries have gotten more and more sophisticated. The days of malicious software, the days of key loggers are gone. Now we're talking about AI based bots, ML based attacks and people are really addressing your entire enterprise infrastructure, trying to figure out how to get it. The amount of breaches have actually gone up. Last year is about 3,800 breaches and mostly the breaches were automated attacks. So it's got an interesting situation in the industry. We have a situation where people are spending more and more money on cybersecurity and they're feeling less secure. This is a problem. This problem needs to be fixed. So we believe we need a new paradigm for security and much of what we're going to talk about is what that new paradigm is going to be or needs to be. We believe we need to go towards lesser number of vendors. We believe you need to go towards more comprehensive security. We believe this has to be more of an automated industry as opposed to an industry that is full of -- lot of manual labor. So a lot of what Lee and Nir are going to talk about is going to be how our products are going to enable that going forward and we will talk specifically about some of the things we're working on which will be unveiled over the course of next few quarters and years, and how we intend to make this happen. At the same time we are at an inflection point in the industry, in my travels over the last 12 months, and my time at Google, I haven’t met a customer who is not thinking about going to the cloud. Almost every customer I met, approximately 300 of them is in some way, shape or form on their journey to the cloud, some of them are evaluating the cloud, some of them are sort of deployed some application in the cloud, some of them are in a hybrid cloud environments -- going to go to multiple clouds, but there is not a customer who is not talking about the cloud. Interestingly, we don't believe that cloud security has matured as fast as the cloud platforms have. So the best security, you can get is some cloud data security offered by an individual platform provider, but you actually don't have comprehensive cloud security that allows you to make that journey to the cloud in a more comfortable and happy fashion. So our belief is, as we see this cloud market go to potentially $1 trillion over the next five years, there is a huge opportunity for cloud security to play a relevant role in allowing these customers to make that cloud journey over the next three to five years. It's a big opportunity and the big opportunity we have here is to make sure we don't make the same mistakes we've made in enterprise security. We need to get cloud security, right. We anticipate in cloud security, there is an opportunity for us to become a platform of choice and customers not have to deal with the problem of too many tools, too many vendors, too many alerts and too much manual labor. I won't talk more about that when Lee and Nir come and talk about what we've been doing in the last 12 months for cloud security. So before I walk, before I have them come up on stage and talk about the opportunity ahead of us, I want to make sure I give you a sense of what we're doing for the last 12 months and you guys have been writing all these notes, I'm trying to figure out what we love to, as a company. Let's take a look at where we've come from. 12 months ago when I came to Palo Alto Networks, we had a phenomenal Company, the Company that has built an amazing firewall had a great brand, tremendous amounts of trust with our customers in all 50,000 customers in the market. There is a lag between when click this when this slide shows up. This is Palo Alto Networks. We were -- are primarily a firewall company. We've made a few acquisitions and we had done a bunch of projects in the side. But despite the way we had implemented and we have managed to get 8% of our billings from not at our services outside of our firewall business. The worrying thing was though, I noticed we would acquire companies and decouple them and merge them into our hardware-based business. So that's a bad thing if you start taking the software businesses and start making the workload hardware businesses. Hardware has a certain [indiscernible], cycle has certain deployment cycle, software as a slightly different cycle. It's very important for us to make sure we were going to get this right. We spent the last 12 months, focusing. Now I may not know enough about cybersecurity, but having spent as many of you know I spent 10 years at Google, the one thing I did learn at Google is the first and foremost, you have to get your product strategy right. So poor Lee Klarich, our Head of Product; Nir, our CTO, and many of our product colleagues has spent many a nice sitting with me, writing and rewriting product plans, looking at competition, looking at our strategy, looking at whether we are set up to win or not. And literally re-architecting many of our products and our strategy is to make -- we set ourselves up to win. Please spend -- ours there are written documents and probably on their 15th the durations, we went through every product categories in that, why do you make this acquisition? What is the way to win in this category? How are you going to -- when do we have enough resource to deploy it against that? And once we get the product right, do we have the go-to-market capability, to go make this happen in the market. It wasn't simple. It wasn't easy, but some of it is also very exciting. In our firewall business, we had been selling subscriptions, four subscriptions against our firewalls. I mean, sat and talk about why cannot the firewall become a platform? Why cannot we take or we have the firewall and instead of having 20 different network appliances in a customer's infrastructure like on our firewall become the platform of the future for enterprise security. So as Lee and Nir will talk about, we are going to go from four to potentially 10, maybe more subscriptions over time, because we believe once our customers trust us to be part of their enterprise infrastructure, we have the ability to go and deploy more and more capability into that infrastructure. And we will talk about our latest acquisition of Zingbox, the whole intent is to make that another subscription on firewall. We believe our customers will deploy that firewall, just the way, they've deployed DNS security, which we launched a few months ago. So on our firewall side, we have built, we have continued to build the next generation firewall into a faster, better firewall. But really when we went back to the drawing board we sat back and said, Nir if you were starting a company and building firewalls so that we wanted to. Although some of you believe the firewalls are not going to be interesting. We'll talk about why they're going to continue to be interesting. We sat down and thought, how would you re-architect the firewall business and how do you build it going forward. So what you will see as part of our enterprise strategy firewalls is our expectations of how this market is going to evolve and how do we need to be in the top right of that Magic Quadrant continue to go further in that direction as opposed to not continue the innovation. Not only that, on our cloud front, we had one acquisition called Evident, we've made 12 months ago. Over the last 12 months, we've examined the cloud security space very, very carefully. We believe there needs to be a comprehensive multi-cloud, multi-technology platform available for cloud security. We have made two acquisitions in that space with Twistlock and PureSec and we hope to be able to integrate them very swiftly, hopefully before the end of this calendar year and be able to provide the best cloud security platform to our customers. Prisma cloud, I'm not confusing this would VMs or any other product, has over 1,000 customers already. We do not believe there is any cloud security company in the world today with over 1,000 customers securing the public cloud, none. And we've been able to achieve that over the last 12 months. Not only that, we looked at our products called GPCS, which is effectively Prisma access, which is, I shouldn't talk about competition just yet. So it's a product with real security that helps you secure cloud native architectures, unlike some of the things in the market. I think is a popular -- today's Lexicon. So we took Prisma access, we resource that we moved to Google Cloud we on-boarded 200 plus locations and you saw the results. We had the biggest quarter over Prisma access in Q4 than we ever had in the Company. We have our first over $10 million deal for Prisma access where as we highlighted we've displaced Zscaler. So feel very confident in our ability to keep building Prisma access as one of the future architecture for securing the cloud. On securing the future, we looked hard at the SOC industry. And Lee and Nir will talk about it. We weren't comfortable with the way the industry is going. We're not comfortable where the solution needs to be that you take all the data, put it in a very large data repository, run a bunch of analytics against and spin-up more alerts. These alerts get them to the SOCs analyst thing that you had 174,000, I've got another 100 really good alerts for you take a look at. That's not the right answer. We looked at the market, we acquired Demisto, Demisto has done really well for us, and we believe the future of SOCs is going to be more towards automation and Lee and Nir will talk about more about what we're able to do in that space. We also took what was our [indiscernible] acquisition and our like severance IVR acquisitions and looked heart of the EDR space and said, where is the endpoint industry going to evolve to, how are we're going to win. We launched XDR four months ago, we've had our first full quarter of XDR and we're delighted with the fact that 250 customers have already been acquired by the XDR team. Now this wasn't done without our ability to run, not just the product focus, but also a focus in our go-to-market capability. Over the last 12 months, we have taken our Prisma and Cortex teams from 500 people 1,500 people. We did that by hiring new people and acquisitions and effectively redeploying resources from what would have been part of our core business into our new business, which is what has allowed us to accelerate our Prisma and Cortex growth rate from approximately 70% odd to 180% as Kathy highlighted. But we feel very confident that is a number or set of numbers we can really focus on and drive further and we'll talk more about where we expect those numbers to go over the next three years. So what does it, was it look like today? We've been able to grow our billings from our next generation security services to $452 million, approximately 13% of our total billings in FY'19. And we feel very, very confident that we have our product portfolio cleared up and we believe we are actually in the process of delivering and deploying three different platforms in the market, one around our firewall, one around our cloud security and one around securing the future where both the firewalls and our cloud security capabilities come together in the slot. We believe our opportunity in the enterprise is to be able to simplify enterprise security and reduce the number of vendors, and that alliance our customers have with vendors. And it's fascinating as Kathy highlighted one of our very large retail customers we acquired in Q4 has gone to a single vendor solution. A single vendor across all forms of firewalls, firewalls and the data center, virtual firewall against our cloud instances and Prisma access against their network security needs. So we are noticing customers re-architecting the security as I think about going to the cloud, that rethinking to the need multiple vendors to secure them across these various form factors across these various technologies and many of the smarter ones of course I'm going to say that are making the choice towards consolidating into a single vendor platform. Not only that, on the cloud front we've had customers off we acquired Twistlock and RedLock, who are in evaluation mode have signed multi-million dollar multi-year deals with us, because now they believe where Twistlock and RedLock and PureSec with Palo Alto Networks, we are going to keep building and investing in these products and continue to grow them further and they're delighted with our vision in terms of how we plan to deliver cloud security to them. We believe we have an opportunity to keep being ahead of the curve of cloud security and it was funny. When we acquired RedLock, the RedLock team kind of means that we're going to go, build continues security for you. That just sounds wonderful. I came to New York and I went to about 10 to 15 customers in the financial services and said, look you're using our Prisma cloud security, we're going to build the container security in nine months. So like, we don't have time. We're going to take what's out there, the best of you continue to secure, we're going to use it. It's interesting, our customers want best of breed, but they don't want to wait for integrated platform to appear and be available across multiple technologies. So we have been able to take RedLock and Twistlock and PureSec and put them together and offer best-of-breed across container serverless and public cloud to our customers as a platform. We believe our opportunity is to stay ahead in that space and deliver comprehensive multi-cloud, multi-platform integrated security solution for a cloud. Last but not the least, in the future, we believe we have the opportunity of taking good data as opposed to all data. Taking that and applying analytics to it and being able to provide tremendous amounts of automation to allow our customers to be able to secure the future. So I had an option of standing up here and regaling you with my product capability and my product knowledge, but I figured one of the highlights of today, it could be for you guys to hear from our Founder, who is promised to give you an unfiltered version of what he thinks about the industry and how things need to go from there. And then we'll have Lee [indiscernible] and moderate him to make sure he doesn't go off the rails. But before I invite them, I'm delighted to say, last time, we had an Analyst Day, we pointed you to a Palo Alto Networks stands at about $19 billion. We believe with all the product investment and product capability have developed, we now have the opportunity of addressing those, close to 70 people in dollar term in FY '22. The magic of FY '22 is you will notice when I come back after Lee and Nir have talked about our product investments, I'm going to give you guidance for the next three years in terms of what we expect our billings to be and what we expect our next generation security capabilities to get to our cash flows and our operating margins. So hold your breath, don't hold your breath, just hang in there. With that, let me welcome Lee and Nir up on stage.
Lee Klarich: Good afternoon.
Nikesh Arora: Good afternoon.
Lee Klarich: I've been working with Nir for a very, very long time almost 10 years. And I think this is the first time that he and I are actually sharing a stage together. So here we go, and that should be fine. I guess there should be fine. So what we'd like to do a share with you our product strategy and how we think about things. And we will fit that into the contracts that Nikesh has walked through in terms of the three pillars, securing the enterprise, securing the cloud and securing the future. Now I've been in the security industry for a very long time. I've been in Palo Alto Networks for very long time and I can't definitively say that I've never been more excited and confident in our ability to deliver these platforms in a very unique and differentiated way. Now to kick us off, no better person than Nir to talk about securing the enterprise. Nir?
Nir Zuk: Thank you, Lee. So let's talk a little bit about securing the enterprise, specifically about network security. I know that some of you would like to believe that the firewall is going away, and there is no role for network security in the future. In reality, there are things that have to be done through the network -- through network security and there is just not a place to do them. And so things like looking for command and control connections. Things like combining access control, user identity and authorization systems. And most importantly, more than half of the devices that enterprise use today cannot be protected by running something on the device itself, have to be protected from the network. Mobile phones, we've locked down operating systems or limited battery life, routers, switches, printers, network-attached scanners and all other kind of IoTs like IP phones and things like that. The only way to protect them is through the network because you can't run anything on it. So network security is here to stay, it's always been the core of cybersecurity and will continue to be the core of cybersecurity, but changes have to be made, because over time applications have been moving from the corporate data center into the cloud with our SaaS or public cloud and users have been moving from corporate networks into smaller offices, branch offices they have been moving of the network completely in the form of being mobile users and network security has to follow them and network security has to follow them wherever they go because again there are things that network security is the only thing or there things that network security has to do, like so on cybersecurity functionality, like access control and supporting again devices that can only be done from the network. The challenge is how you do that, how do you follow the user when they're off the network, how do you follow the application when it's running in the public cloud, and more importantly, like Nikesh said, customers are asking us to consolidate more and more functionality that would deploy in the network separately from the firewall into the single next generation based platform that we have created. And to talk about that and the innovation around it, we'll go back to Lee.
Lee Klarich: So there is lots of innovation is going on in next-gen firewall. There is two areas in particular, I want to talk through with all of you today that are -- of particular importance. The first is sort of piggyback off when Nir was talking about the importance of form factors, okay. How do we take all the same capabilities and make sure that they can be deployed everywhere, the in-line security as needed. And this is something we started driving several years ago when we expanded from hardware appliance form factors to software form factors with the VM series. Since that time, VM series has turned into the leading virtual next-gen firewall in the market. And then from there and we're recently we expanded into delivering these capabilities as a service with Prisma access, which allows us to extend security out to mobile users branch offices, retail environment, et cetera. Now with particularly powerful about this, in addition to be able to provide consistent security everywhere, is the ability to have a single control plane to be able to manage this consistently as well. As Nikesh mentioned earlier, one of our very large customer acquisitions in the previous quarter was a customer who had been with us for a while with hardware and the data center. And in the quarter as they extended that using VM-series and Prisma access into a complete solution, and what was particularly exciting and relevant to them was the ability to get that consistent security consistent control plane, we can't get anywhere else. Now, going hand in hand with us, is the ability to use of firewall as a platform for delivering more and more capabilities. If you look -- if you think about the enterprise security market, it is actually insane. The number of different security vendors that customers have to deal with is crazy. We have a running tally of the most number of security vendors that customers deal with when they come to our -- or you'd to be see hear about what we can do for them. I think the latest record is now up well above 200 different security vendors for a single customer. They have to deal with and manage. Now we have been, from the very beginning, starting consolidate these through integrating best-in-class capabilities into our next-gen firewall. We did this with IPS, we did this with filtering and we really substantially change those markets. We took a bit of a hiatus but we're back. The DNS security launched earlier this year, our fifth subscription for the next-gen firewall and we intend to extend this more rapidly going forward to be able to integrate, what would otherwise be standalone capabilities and be able to consolidate those into our firewall platform. Importantly to do that across all form factors as well. Now, you saw the announcement earlier today, our Zingbox for IoT security, I'll talk about that a little bit more detail in a second. But just to give you some flavor for the security services, we're looking at. We're also actively working on and building SD-WAN, as an example, that we will be able to integrate across the different form factors, in order to be able to again both simplify as well as provide better capabilities to our customers across their network environments. Now, to talk about IoT the, this is becoming a very much a growing issue within the enterprise, as you can see from some of the things here, even fish tanks can be used to break into enterprises and move laterally. Hackers are using IoT devices as both initial insertion points as well as the ability to move laterally across networks. Now, why is this? IoT devices are -- have become very ubiquitous across the enterprise. By our estimation what we've observed in both our own environment as well as others for every employee, there is about three different IoT devices in the typical enterprise. In many cases IoT devices they're unpatched, they're unmanaged, they're connected by definition, there is a security risk. I believe that every single one of our 65,000 customers hasn't growing IoT security needs. And we will be unique in being able to deliver that as an integrated service to our next-gen firewall, obviating the need to deploy yet more hardware, in order to get a very relevant and important new security service. Without us the options are looking at a handful of small vendors and trying to figure out which one to invest in and which one you're going to take the operational burden of trying to deploy throughout your network. That's a very powerful approach that we are able to take by delivering necessary integrated service. And so with that combination of the evolving and expanding form factors, the ability to then deploy multiple and additional security services to those form factors, we see a great opportunity to address the network security TAM, as well as an opportunity to replace what today is often outsourced manual labor with product and automation. You'll see that theme as we talk about the different areas. This ability to look to leverage automation to replace outsource manual labor is one of the large opportunities we have in consolidating the products around us. So switching gears from enterprise to the cloud. Okay, now, when we talk about cloud, we're going to talk about two distinct aspects of the cloud. The first, just about every enterprise is on some journey of moving some of their applications to the cloud. Typically, multi-cloud they're often still keeping the data -- part of the data center for some of the applications. So it's hybrid that is one opportunity, very significant opportunities you saw before. The second is to leverage the cloud to deliver security to the end users, those are mobile branch office, et cetera. So let's start with securing the cloud. Now a concept that all of you have seen, probably a million times. But just an important concept is a shared responsibility model. Customers are responsible for the security of everything they deploy in the cloud. And as we've seen many of these applications that we deploy are mission critical, have incredibly sensitive data and they need the best security solution across multi-cloud and hybrid cloud. Now to put this in context, the world has moved beyond lift and shift to large extent and we'll continue to move toward more cloud native application architectures, which will require a cloud first approach to security. You cannot simply take on-prem data center capabilities and simply move them, you have to take into approach. What you're seeing here is a typical application that is multiple different components, which is very standard. Each of those components often running in a different technology stack. So how do you secure an application like that? All right, so it requires a lot of the same security functions wherever the application is, but those security functions have to then be applied across all the different technology stacks. For example, you need to vulnerability management of course and you need to apply that to VM's. The typical industry answer to this would be say, that's a product. The problem is you're going to get to that. Every line representing a different product. Now if you're an enterprise looking at that, -- that's a lot. We are at risk of repeating the sense of the past, if we let that happen. I firmly believe the Palo Alto Networks is the only Company in a position, and with the focus of preventing that from happening. With Prisma cloud, our intention and what we are delivering to our customers is the most comprehensive cloud security platform that they can get. Taking these different capabilities, applying them across the different technology stacks, multi-cloud and even hybrid cloud to help secure our customers journey to the cloud and to be clear, there is a lot that is yet to be done. I anticipate that there are a number of cloud security technologies that haven't been invented yet, but we will have to be thinking about. And we will continue to be very decisive and purposeful about building out this platform and continue to maintain its position as the most comprehensive solution. Now to talk about the other kind of cloud and for that Nir.
Nir Zuk: Thank you, Lee. Maybe before that I'm very excited about Prisma Cloud. When we started the company and Lee has been with me, since the beginning. When we started the company, we are going to build an acceleration firewall and we had a bunch of very large vendors that we have to go and displace which we've done. But we're today by far the largest network security vendor out there. It was a lot of work displacing them. I think that with cloud with public cloud security and generally with cloud security the market is open. There is the need, I don't see any other vendor in a position to do this. And I think that the numbers that you've seen and the numbers that you will see speak for themselves. Because to do this, you have to first have the firewall because there is no way to secure the cloud without a firewall, you have to look at the things that only the firewall can look and there are things that's running in the cloud, that you need a firewall, because you can't run endpoint security on them. And then on top of that, you need all the different technologies that we've been building and acquiring and integrating over the last few years, that I just don't see anyone out there that's even thinking about it nevertheless, someone that has the different components that are required in order to go after the cloud security market. So very excited about that, at least as much as much as we're excited when we started Palo Alto Networks and went after the enterprise security market. Now once applications start moving to the cloud, which they are, enterprise network architectures and access architectures are changing. And the reason for that -- oops we are missing a slide here. Sorry. Okay, yeah, so the reason for that is that traditionally the way users have been accessing enterprise applications, which were running in enterprise data centers was through remote access solutions like GlobalProtect for example and through MPLS, IPVPN MPLS links, and those links were offering guaranteed bandwidth and guaranteed performance that they were great way to access enterprise applications. Once applications start moving to the cloud whether it's SaaS or public cloud and once users are moving into smaller offices into branch offices and of course, become mobile, it doesn't make sense anymore to run all the traffic through the data center and then go out to the Internet. You want to have direct Internet access from wherever the user is, whether it's in the branch office or whether the user is mobile. Of course with the tradition of the cybersecurity industry, the way we're doing it or the way the industry is doing it is by offering more and more and more solutions to try to do it, try -- we have mTLS and then side to side VPNs. And then some traffic goes -- SaaS traffic has to go a CASB proxy, then we have a bunch of CASB companies. And of course our favorite topic, the cloud delivered security VI proxy. And maybe a side note here, and if I have seem a little bit angry then maybe because it is I am, because I feel like I'm playing a whack-a-mole game, because about 24 years ago, I had to kill the first generation of proxies with [indiscernible] inspection. If you remember, companies like Secure Computing anyone here cover them? You'll probably responsible for them having a higher market cap than checkpoint at the time. I'm not sure where they are today and companies like Raptor and others, and of course proxy is always had the issues with proxies, they are slow, they break applications, they break networking, they break network optimization, network routing and so on. So hard to kill them the first time. And then 12 years ago in 2007, when we started selling our products here, we had to kill the next generation of proxies, the Blue Coat and the Websense's of the world, which again didn't make any sense. Proxies have never made sense, they are slow, high latency, they break applications, you can't run everything to them, they break networking. And so on, which we have, we all know our Blue Coat is today right part of Broadcom and I'm not sure Websense is. And now it's measureful right, third time and other mole is popping, we have to deliver security from the cloud, how we're going to do it? Guess what, we're going to do it with a proxy. Now, why would you do it with a proxy and not with network security, because it is easy, it's very difficult to become a network security company, it's very difficult to build something that can go into the infrastructure, whether it's physical or virtual and provide the networking and security the pocket based security at the application level. So vendors are taking the easy way out, right, let's put a proxy, so we break applications, so we break the network who cares, customers are going to pay for it anyways, and they are trying to use proxies to solve the issue. So first I think proxy is the wrong way to -- and I'm not think, I'm sure proxies are boring. If I were here six months ago, I would say we're going to kill the proxy after what you've seen and what I've seen in the last two quarters, we have killed the proxy. But again -- but I really think that it's not just a proxy, it's this -- it's this mess that the industry suggesting in order to fix the access challenges that are associated with the move to the cloud. And of course there is a much better solution, and that by better solution is what Prisma access is about. The Prisma access takes mobile users, and it takes branch offices in a single cloud delivered firewall -- through firewall base our firewall-based solution, it provides access to SaaS applications with our CASB, to public cloud applications to on-premise applications and whatever comes next this platform is going to do. And the reason this platform has been so successful in the last couple of quarters and is going to continue to be so successful is because when customers see this versus the mess that today is called access, again a mess driven by the cloud, the choice is very, very clear. This is the way to do it. And if I look at our position in the market there are not many firewall vendors out there. There are probably four firewall vendors that sell today, the other three vendors are busy trying to figure out why they can't sell hardware against our hardware. I just don't see anyone else today in a position to go and capture this huge access to the cloud market. I really like our position, I really like where we are today and I certainly like where we are taking it into -- in the future. Sorry, I'll continue. So now that we've covered. [Video Presentation] Can you imagine trying to access X-ray data through a proxy, they tried, and they have to throw out the huge deployment of that proxy. So going back to TAM, we think that cloud security in 2020 represents a very large TAM, a very large opportunity. And like I said, I personally just don't see much competition over there and anyone that has the components to compete against us, in cloud security. And then if you look at the automation that's needed in order to drive that security automation that today is done by people, and we do that with software and analytics, the opportunity becomes even larger, okay. So now that we cover the first two pillars, let's move to secure the future. So let me cash that, both enterprise security and cloud security are here to stay with us for a long time. And we have to do both and we have to be good at both and we are going to be continuing doing both and be the market leaders in both. At some point, these two converge in the security operation system, because the security operation system needs to run both enterprise security and cloud security and it all comes to one place. And they are big issues in the security operations today that just aren't that basically make this security persons that are not prepared for the future. And we've decided a couple of years ago to go and fix that to prepare the security operation center for the future. So let's just talk about what's not working in the security operation center. Most security operation centers are based around a technology called SIEM, Security Incident and Event Management, by the way -- nothing to do with incident and event management, but whatever we'll call them that, that basically collect as much log as they can from network devices and endpoints and applications and servers and wherever they can get logs from and then to have a bunch of static rules and or manual labor looking at this data and guess what they do, they generate alerts based on the data. Now of course, the data that's coming in, already includes alerts, because if the firewall or the IPS or whatever found something bad or something bad was found, bad was found in the public cloud, and so on. On top of the alerts, that's the SIEM collects and displays with the user, the SIEM has rules, we call them correlation rules that generate even more alerts. Some theme have some filtering mechanism to filter out alerts, usually they filter out alerts that needed, going -- target why they had been alert, I told them about the breach and only looked at it nine months later. And then all of that leads to reactive investigation. And what the industry is trying to do to fix that, ask any customer, they will tell you that the SIEM is broken. Right now, the solution to the SIEM broken is we're going to switch to another broken SIEM, with the hope that, that out of broken SIEM is going to be better, and it's not. And the more advanced companies in the industry, I figured out that something has to be done. And what has to be done is you have to collect much more meaningful data from the network or from endpoints and so on, and provide much more meaningful processing using machines of that data, right. So the SIEM doesn't work. So why don't we create a new industry called EDR, we're going to ask customers to put yet another agent on the endpoint. We're going to collect a lot of data from the endpoint, we're going to process the data with whatever machine learning static accruals maybe we'll put some people on it. We're going to find that things generate even more alerts because there aren't enough alerts already, and maybe sometimes we're going to respond back to the endpoint. Now that's not enough. We have to do the same thing with the network. So there is a whole industry called NTA network traffic analysis that's doing that on the network stenting the collect deeper data from the network using separate into in other data lake process that with rules and whatever and machine learning and then maybe respond back usually they generate just more or less in the same thing happens for IoT is and the same thing happens for public cloud. And the same thing happens for South and I'm sure that with every new challenge. The industry is going to generate yet in other vertical that's going to collected another separate set of data and all of that because the doesn't do anything. Okay. We think that this doesn't make sense like specifically doesn't make sense like why would you limit yourself to collecting they’re the only from the endpoint process data just on the endpoint and respond back, to the endpoint. We think there has to be something much better than that and that's what Cortex is about, okay. Now maybe before that this is a survey that Demisto company we acquired which late year. Before we acquired them, you've heard it before an average enterprise has to do with $174,000 per weeks. Usually they have the capacity to handle may be 12,000 and even that gives them a few seconds for each alert. It doesn't make sense that leads to at least four days of investigating the alerts, so they figure out that they need to investigate and some alerts that just don't touch are the real alerts that they need to handle and we have to fix that and that what Cortex XDR is about. And to do that, I'll go to my product guy, tell you how we're --. So if we think about securing the future, we're really talking about collecting good data, [indiscernible] analytics against it, leveraging as much automation as we can, because manual work can be error-prone obviously it takes too much time et cetera. But ultimately, we're trying to get to a proactive outcome, trying to get away from the reactive something bad has happened, let me figure out how bad it was and when it happen and things like that to proactive, how do we actually prevent the bad things from happening. So using that as a framework, it all starts with good data. There is a massive amount of money that is being spent on collecting logs and alerts, but not on selecting good data. You have to collect good data in order to drive good analytics AI machine learning and things like that. Now, to get the good data we of course started with the best sources we know. Our next-gen firewall crops in the endpoint, so our cloud services, we know, because we can control those as sources. The kind of data, the rich detail we can get in order to drive analytics. So that is where we started. But now we are starting to extend that out to third-party sources as well. As far the start of -- starting point for that, it will be other network security devices. We're going to start with checkpoint and probably on the Cisco and other things like that. Because again in the enterprise, there is still a bit of a mess, there is lots of different things, and so while we try to move everyone to a better state we can help by at least taking in that data correlating et cetera. So we are starting to now pull in third -party data to augment our data sources to be able to drive good analytics. So what is good analytics look like? Well, good analytics, first and foremost, should be capable of detecting attack that otherwise can't be detected, Cortex XDR does that for sure. In addition to that though, analytics is very powerful in being able to reduce the amount of noise and alerts enterprises have to deal with. We have seen in certain environments up to 50x reduction of alerts by being able to just simply group them into incidents to be able to then investigate incidents as opposed to lots of alerts. We've also then seen the ability to reduce the amount of time significantly and how long it takes to investigate an incident by pre-stitching data together and showing the full view to the analyst it is much, much more powerful and easy for them to go through the investigation get to conclusion and ultimately provide automation. Our aspiration here is to get orders of magnitude improvement even from this, which by the way to the SOC, this is a massive improvement for they otherwise are. And we're going to keep focusing on driving these better outcomes. Now, good data to good analytics, ultimately two really good automation. Automation is where we can take a lot of the noise out of the system and really lead the SOC counts, with just what they need to be able to have to focus on. And again you can see the level of alert reduction by simply automating the investigation response that humans don't have to do the work. Improving the risk, the meantime to respond some environments well north of 90% improvement, and how long it takes to respond to incidents. That is massive benefit to an enterprise to the SOCs. And going forward we have a view that we can even make this automation predictive in nature. But based on everything that we see across this growing ecosystem, we can build the network effect, as we have done in many other areas. So that we actually will be able to tell customers, this is what you should do in order to achieve these outcomes. The security industry, the cybersecurity industry needs to get more opinionated about how to achieve the right outcomes as opposed to simply providing tools and that customer is kind of do what they want with them. Automation is a key area for this. Lastly, to bring this together, we are ultimately trying to get to a proactive response footprint where again instead of re-active or proactive. This is why traps on the endpoint is so important to have Cortex function. Not only does it provide really rich deep data in order to drive analytics and other things like that, but it can actually prevent attacks from happening in the first place. Every attack that is prevented upfront means fewer and fewer alerts that even have to be analyzed on the back end. Additionally, this is the footprint that allows us to when we do finish -- when customer does finish investigation, we can actually then automate the response back to an enforcement point to take action. So we prevent on the front end, provide rich data and then ultimately prevent on the back-end as well. So we can automate that entire sequence. So we bring this together, each one of these components is in itself best in class. But importantly, integrated together to form the foundation of a platform, they can solve a lot of the challenges that Nir talked about, that the SOCs currently deals with, and are growing. So let's hear from one of our customers as they talk about their adoption of Cortex and what would have meant to them. [Video Presentation] Always cools and you can secure a state. And, of course, all of this adds up to a large and growing town. The combination of endpoint protection, analytics, automation and, maybe most obvious, in this case, the ability then reduce the manual outsourcing and pull that into product automation analytics as well is the substantial opportunity we see it as well. And for that -- with that, like to invite Nikesh back up to talk about execution. Nikesh?
Nikesh Arora: Well, thank you, Lee and Nir. So, as I mentioned, we spend a lot of time making sure we get our product strategy right, and Lee and Nir, have highlighted where we plan to go. I hope you didn't miss the fact that Lee is committed publicly to deploying a lot of subscriptions in our firewalls and potentially applying SD-WAN across every form factor. I'm just trying to make sure he hears me, safe to use, so that I can make sure I can hold him too. And we also talked about ingesting third-party data into Cortex, which is an extension of our vision of our Application Framework from the past. But product is just part of our solution. Once you get product right, you've got to make sure you have the execution capability to put the product out in the market. And, as I've analyzed enterprise companies, it's very interesting, there is very few very large enterprise companies and many small enterprise companies. And it's interesting, if you look at them, there is a distribution engine that needs to be created just commensurate with your product capacity. Companies get started, they get into a very good state with one set of products and then either you have to keep innovating and adding more product to the portfolio with the salespeople or you have to acquire product and be able to ingest it in a way that your salespeople are going to sell it. There is only one way to double revenue, it's a double number of salespeople and make sure there is enough capacity in the market, or make sure you double the amount of product that a salesperson can sell and is able to sell to be able to do that. Our intent is to do a little bit of both. And what I wanted to highlight is, in addition to product capability, we've also been working on our execution capability and making sure we have the go-to-market. As Lee and Nir just highlighted, and I ended my last session with saying, we can address the $73 billion market. This is how that market breaks out, we think there is a $27 billion opportunity in network, approximately $8 billion in cloud, $13-odd billion in SOCs and endpoint protection, and about $25 billion in the automation, which needs to be deployed across all of those categories. It's a slightly different view than you will see in the industry. The industry still believe that it's going to be a very large services market. We, on the contrary, believe that the services market is important for the architectural pieces to get cybersecurity, right, but if you need a lot of people to be able to manage security for large enterprises on a long-term, that is not going to give you the automation and the right outcomes and it's going to require way too much time, while the adversaries are working on automating their ability redact you and get to your precious data. So, as you see, we have 65,000 customers and we have an amazing brand which people trust. Just to highlight, one of the first subscriptions we launched early this year, we've been able to deploy it to over 500 customers in a very short period of time. So our sales teams know how the moment when you deploy a subscription they're able to add it to our firewall capability and get deployed in the market. As Lee talked about our IoT capability, we want to make that available to every one of our enterprise firewall customers, and one of you asked me, why wouldn't to go acquire a more complex IoT company, there are some larger companies in the IoT space that solve complex used cases. I understand why as a start-up, you would go after a complex used case because that's probably where the large deals are. But the enterprise IoT is a need for every customer. Our salespeople know how to sell it. We know how to attack the store of firewall. And our aspiration is that, for every subscription that we deployed, we should be able to get to thousands of customers, if not, tens of thousands of customers in a two- to three-year timeframe, which allows us to keep expanding both TAM and our revenue in a leveragable way with our customer base. If you look at our current capabilities, we have 4,000 partners, we operate across 150 countries and we have 3,000 people out in the field, which makes us the largest pure play cybersecurity sales team out in the field. We want to turn that into a large distribution capability. We also believe that we have built the best execution team in cybersecurity. I know many of wrote in your notes about the management turnover at Palo Alto Networks. Palo Alto Networks have build a phenomenal company, which is firewall-centric, and we had done some stuff in the cloud and some stuff in the SOCs. It is very important as we go through this transition of building a multi-product, multi-platform cybersecurity business that our management team represents our capabilities which are required to be able to sell multiple platforms in the market. And what we have done over time is we've made sure that we are managing the transition and upgrading our skill set for our team to make sure that we can actually go sell cloud, we can go sell automation, we can go sell AIML, we can go sell firewalls. I joined Google when there were 450 people in Google Europe. We took that team from 450 people to 5,000 and we quintupled revenue in five years when I was there. I left Google. Google is now in its fourth generation of management today and they far surpassed the quintupling of revenue from the early days. There were 100,000 employees. So, as you go through evolution, you have to make sure you bring your management teams and locks them. And we're very comfortable that the transitions we are doing on the management front are the continuation of our desire to build the best execution. Rest assured, most of these management turnover you're seeing, they're all managed transitions, they're all towards the purpose of building this multi-capability cybersecurity sales team. And you can see that we did our first $1 billion billing this quarter in Q4, while we were going through these transitions, which tells you that it would be a very strong field sales force and they're all on-board with our desire and ambition to build the best cybersecurity player in the world. In the last year, we've hired over 2,000 cybersecurity professionals. We have expanded our hiring limit, we now hire from 19 cloud and next generation companies as opposed to purely enterprise hardware businesses, which had been a lot of our core sales team in the past. And we built technology, which allows us to cross train our teams in cloud and in automation techniques. This allowed us to train 3,000 people in a week to be able to sell cloud. Why this is interesting is, this is an important slide. This is what we anticipate in terms of how we are going to take this and build this into the larger enterprise security business. There we do it is, we ingest or innovate and build technology, we put them in speedboats. We have a speedboat for cloud, we have a speedboat for automation. We also started training our core sales team out in the field. And this gives you a sense of what proportion of our field sales force is able to sell our various products. So we've taken Prisma Access and 60% of our sales teams out in the field is now able to sell Prisma Access. This gives us huge amplification and leverage, Prisma Cloud is closing in on 30%, 35% of our sales force. And by the end of the year, we will have integrated Twistlock and PureSec, allowing it to be part of the Prisma Cloud platform, which will integrate seamlessly both from a contractual and from a usage perspective. So every Prisma Cloud customer will automagically have container and serverless capability and we believe that leverage is going to allow us to address 40% of our customer base. Our plan is to get our speedboat teams to be able to sell to 90% of our entire -- through 90% of our core sales force to our customer base, allowing us to leverage and the distribution we need to become the biggest player, both in cloud, as well as automation and SOC. No other player in our space has over 3,000 people in the field out there selling. Not just that, we want to make sure we do this while we continue to delight our customers. So we have been able to maintain the leadership position and customer happiness and customer success out of the market. Not only that, we are not going to rest on our laurels. We have just announced to our field team, we are introducing an industry first security incident assurance service, whereby, if any of our customers unfortunately is in a breach situation or any customer in the industry, we're going to be there available until their breach is resolved, irrespective of other what proportion of their products of Palo Alto products. So, we continue to want to be at the forefront of customer success and customer happiness in our ability to execute. So with that, I now -- yes, there has been other conversation about the channel. I think there was one meeting we had with the Channel Advisory Board, which I think every analyst has feedback on, anything for team, I have said that we've been tweaking our channel ball with just causing consternation. But this is just to give you comfort that 99% of our business still comes from the channel. And as you can see in Q3 and Q4, because we revamped our channel programs to create more capability, training and incentive for our channel, the channel sourced business that we're doing has never been greater than we've had in the last two quarters at Palo Alto Networks. So, any noise around the fact of channel and us are not together in this journey to building the best cybersecurity business is just noise. We believe the true signal is that, it's shown in the results. They're actually allowing us to amplify our capability and they're really excited about our newer acquisitions and the direction we're taking with the various platforms. Okay. All right. This is all [indiscernible]. Sorry, he has taken us a long to get here. But until we give you a context, it's very hard for us to take you to what do you're here for. So with that, as you know, we've had a long history of success. We have increased market share network security despite popular belief that we're not going to be able to grow our security business at twice the rate of the industry. The team and I spent a lot of time over the last three or four months, looking at do we need to go through our financial model transition at Palo Alto Networks and have -- many of your notes about the two these depression of cash flows duration what is Palo Alto going to do, vis-a-vis ARR versus the term license or perpetual license. We tested the market we talked to many of our customers. We talked to many of the customers -- many of the company is going through a transition and we're not going through any major financial transition. Our customers like the way we sell our products for them, our sales people understand how to sell products to themselves. We are going to be selling firewalls the way we've been selling them so far. We are not going to go to any term license model, we're going to stick with the perpetual license model. And some of our star perform factors with sale and replaced firewalls are going to be sold like firewall has sold. So based on all the analysis, [indiscernible] we will be building, a huge capability to sell our next-generation security, we feel very comfortable that we will be able to maintain the 20% billings growth rate over the next three years, as well as a 20% revenue growth rate over the next two years. I had the privilege over the last three weeks of looking at every one of your models. I read almost every one of your notes, and I can safely say, that this 20% guidance is above the average of most of the models out there on the Street, both in revenue and billings. But we stand behind the commitment that we believe we can grow our billings and revenue at roughly 20% growth rate going forward. An important part, I'd like to highlight one of the shifts we are seeing, I'm sure you guys pay attention to product revenues for the [indiscernible]. We are seeing a shift where we're replacing our competitors firewalls boxes with software form factors of Prisma access. So what we've done is we've taken our VM's, our Prisma access sales and our firewall sales and said, what would it look like if we consider them all as an upfront sale and how would our revenues or how would our billings look like in the firewall category. So this is a combination of VMs, Prisma Access and firewalls. We feel very comfortable that we will be able to grow the firewall as a category billings by 23% over the next two years. Which we believe is still 2.5 times the industry growth rate vis-a-vis our firewalls are sold, then we think about product. I will sure point you to the fact that because we anticipate a large proportion of future firewall sales to be in the software form factor. There will be a revenue recognition mix shift, which will come through. But we still believe the category will grow at 23% over the next three years. Talking about the part, that we're really excited about, really excited about our next generation security billings. We were able to achieve $452 million in billings in Prisma and Cortex. So, what we call next-generation security. We're guiding to $800 million to $810 million of billings for FY ' 20 and we believe we will get to $1.75 billion by FY '22, resulting in revenue of approximately over $1 billion for next generation security revenue by FY '22. This is the part it takes some spending to drive that fast revenue growth but FY '20 -- FY '19 we've been able to manage the acceleration of our Prisma and Cortex revenues by being able to reallocate from our core business. We believe that we need to invest between $100 million to $125 million next year to keep driving that revenue growth at the pace we're committing to. But we believe thereafter, we will be able to keep getting operating margin leverage by 150 basis points in '21 and '22 and we believe the long-term operating margin for our business should be 25%. I know you've been discussing cash flow a lot about us. We feel comfortable, despite these investments, despite the shift towards more services like software-based services and Prisma access and VMs as well as cortex. We believe we will safely be able to generate $4 billion of free cash flow over the next three years, guiding to a long-term free cash flow margin of 30%. So before I talk about how we think about this, I thought it would be important also to tell you how we intend to use the cash. What we've done on M&A, as you've seen, there was a fear when I came to a month ago that this guy comes from Google is going to spend a lot of money and buy a lot of big stuff. Let me highlight the key tenants of my M&A philosophy. First and foremost, I prefer avoiding overlapping products. Overlapping products are dangerous. We have products in most categories. I'm not interested in buying other endpoint company, I'm not interested in buying the firewall company, because that requires [indiscernible] basis, two sets of customers and is no leverage for me, it's much more interesting for us to create innovation in the category and displace those competitors as opposed to acquire them, and just create scale. We believe we have scale in most of our categories, hence we don't need to acquire customers of overlapping product categories. We prefer targeting Blue Oceans. We like areas where there is not enough people, we like areas where we can ingest technology and deployed through our large distribution base, as opposed to go and participate in valuations, where there is a lot of blood and not enough profitability. We seek technology that will integrate across our platforms. If you look, we acquired RedLock or emerging RedLock and Twistlock into a common platform. We acquired PureSec, which is serverless to be integrated as well. We would acquiring IoT which will be integrated into our firewall capabilities, we acquired Demisto and which is being integrated into Cortex. So we prefer acquiring technologies we believe fill an important gap and also provide leverage to our go-to-market engine, because if you acquired disparate products, then you have to go train your sales forces on different go-to-market capabilities and different USPs for our customers. We prefer acquiring product excellence versus revenue, because they have to be at large multiple for revenue, that rather not, rather acquire, somebody has built a great product and it has good early customers exhibiting product market fit. Every one of our companies that we've acquired and I will talk about the slide in a second. And last but not the least, we focus on large TAMs. We're not interested in small towns unless there can be subscriptions, which can be added to our firewalls, which allows us to consolidate the enterprise. So with that strategy in mind, our approach in the first nine months, we force our teams to right integrated product lens in fact Zingbox, and Asheem already started talking about what the product integration could look like, because our first and foremost intent was to make sure that integration is done ASAP. We see as soon as we acquire -- one of these good technology best of breed companies are able to improve their business plan by approximately 40%, which is what we've been able to do with the Demisto pure sectors -- RedLock and many of our acquisitions. And we let their teams run their plays in the market with go-to-market support from our speedboats. Beginning month 9 and 24, we start introducing them through our speedboats to our core business, allowing us to get more leverage and more scale across the acquisitions and we target doubling their plans. Because of that, past 24 months, they become multiple accretive to us as a business, that's a M&A philosophy, that should give you a good sense of how we intend to use some of that cash flow and as Lee and Nir have talked about, we are going to constantly make build versus buy decision, so we can deliver best of breed to our customers. And if you believe that we [indiscernible] not going to get there fast enough we'll make acquisitions, but the acquisition will be guided by the philosophy I just laid out, in terms of smart product teams. And what is delightful is, I was just sitting early, I'm trying to count. Of all the acquisitions -- we have over 12 founders working in our company in our product organization from 12 months ago and they are all committed to be here over the next two to three years as part of Palo Alto Networks, so we make that a condition of our position. So they're supposed to stay there and we actually let them run their products, because we believe the fact that they were able to go out against all odds and build the great product and build a great business, it is incumbent and imperative that we let them run that product for us at Palo Alto Networks and to create the right circumstances, the right capabilities for them to make that happen. So that's our plan in M&A. So I thought what I would do is -- I would do what you guys would do and see how do we compare against the industry. We believe we are already the largest cybersecurity company and we're growing faster than anybody else in our space. But this is only half interesting. I find us even more interesting. If you take Prisma and Cortex which is our next generation security business. In the last 12 months, we grew our billings by 89%. The next 12 months we're forecasting a 78% growth, which we believe makes us the largest next generation security company, compared to all the people out there who enjoy robust valuation. I will leave the word robust. If you look at our forecast for FY'22, we believe we'll be almost twice as big as any next generation security company in our Prisma and Cortex category, whilst we're able to maintain our firewall business generating huge amounts of cash flow. So, I like to call this a ServiceNow slide. I also reviewed many Analyst Day presentations, and ServiceNow is kind enough to build this slide and I understand this is where analysts geek out, where this is something called the Rule of 40. You add your cash, free cash flow margins and revenue growth and for some interesting reason, over 40% is good and below 40% is bad. The only problem is, ServiceNow left us out of this slide. Probably we're not the -- we're the old 40 [indiscernible] firewall company, we're not the next generation security company, but we decided to make our own version of the slide, so at least we feel happy only look at this. And we're delighted to see that we rank second from the left based on our last 12-month performance, and we hope to stay far above that median of 38% over the next three years. So with that, this is what we expect from our Company in FY'22. We expect a 20% CAGR for total billings and total revenue over the next three years. We expect to get to $6 billion in total billings and $5 billion in total revenue by FY'22. We expect that $1.75 billion of that total billings will come from our next generation security services and approximately $1 billion of that will be revenue in FY'22. We expect to get back to our current operating margins by FY'22 with a long-term target of 25%. And we expect to generate $4 billion of free cash flow by FY'22. So from here simple matter of execution. With that, let me call my friend, Kathy, who can give you more specific guidance for FY'20 and for Q1.
Kathy Bonanno: Okay. Thank you, Nikesh. All right. So that's a lot, talked a lot about fiscal 2022 and about what we see in the coming years. Let me just put a finer point on what we expect for fiscal 2020. So, am I moving these slides or somebody else? Okay. Since it's a lot of data and information on the screen and these slides will be made available to you, I'm going to focus primarily on talking about the year-over-year growth rates. We will make these slides available to you following the call. So for fiscal Q1 FY'20, we expect billings growth to be between 15% to 17% year-over-year. We expect revenue growth of 16% to 17% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.02 to $1.04, which incorporates net expenses related to acquisitions, including the Zingbox proposed acquisition, which we've just announced. For the full-year of fiscal 2020, we expect billings to increase between 17% to 19% year-over-year and we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 19% to 20% year-over-year. As Nikesh mentioned, next-gen security billings growth is expected to be in the range of 77% to 79% year-over-year. We expect fiscal 2020 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $5 to $5.10, which also includes net expenses related to our recent acquisitions. And finally, turning to free cash flow, we expect adjusted free cash flow margin of approximately 30% for fiscal 2020. In this slide presentation, you will also find some additional modeling points related to CapEx estimate, share count, tax rate, the impact of M&A on EPS. I'm not going to read them to you, but once again we'll make that available to you. So finally, we've summarized our fiscal 2022 guidance for you as well on the screen, Nikesh already covered this, but hopefully the format for fiscal 2022 will be easy for you to digest. And I don't think it's on the screen, so perhaps -- yeah, perhaps I should move it since I'm holding the clicker in my hands, sorry. So, while we are investing to capture significant market opportunity and we do see a gradual shift in durations, we expect it to be gradual associated with changing mix of our products towards more cloud and SaaS delivered products. As Nikesh mentioned, we're not anticipating a big bang event. And so, for the years beyond fiscal 2022, we're targeting our operating margins to be above 25% and free cash flow margins at least 30% or greater. So that hopefully will put some of your minds at ease. That concludes our prepared remarks. And now we'll turn up the lights and be happy to address any of your questions. Nikesh?
Nikesh Arora: Are you guys happy yet? Come on give her a round of applause. Tough crowd.
Kathy Bonanno: Okay. We have people running mics. So I see some questions.
A - David Niederman: Please state your name and your firm before you state your question, please.
Jonathan Ho: Thank you. This is Jonathan Ho from William Blair. One of the questions I had is regarding the next-generation growth, can you unpack for us a little bit of the components that you see from that next-gen side? And maybe how much that ties to the investments that you're making? Thanks.
Nikesh Arora: Yeah. Look, we're not going to break down the individual components just yet. But in terms of the investment, we -- as I mentioned, we've moved 1,000 people through acquisitions or through organic hiring. We've taken our Prisma and Cortex or next-generation security team to about 1,500 people out of 7,000 people, the highlights we ended FY'19 with. We anticipate adding more people into those categories, both for R&D and for sales. We feel reasonably comfortable that our core team is robust in the size. So we'll be making small additions to our core team but mostly we're focusing some of our newer hires into Prisma and Cortex. Some of that spending is also a full year impact of what we already invested going into Q3 and Q4 of this year. So some of it is a follow on from Q3 and Q4 investment, which we were able to manage with our budget for this year. But some of it is incremental hiring for Prisma and Cortex. In terms of across the board, I can give you color that Prisma Cloud is doing phenomenally well for us. It's really -- we need to be out there in front of our customers a lot more. There is over 20,000 -- 30,000 people selling public cloud between AWS, Azure, GCP and Alibaba. There's probably a few hundred cloud security salespeople in the world. So when we show up and customers and we show them a demo and saying, look, this is what you're not doing. They're, oh, yeah, I got to go cover my security needs and when I write applications, they're just not able secure themselves. So we're seeing really good traction for Prisma Cloud. I think Nir made it abundantly clear how excited we are about Prisma Access and how proxy style securing cloud-native architectures is not a good idea. So Prisma Access is the huge focus. Demisto has done well. Post acquisition it has followed the M&A slide I showed you in terms of expecting to double their business plan from where they are. So -- and XDR for us has done really well, because we got 250 customers in the first full quarter of operation and we continue to see more and more -- with the addition of third-party data ingestion. And the way we think about the ingestion, just to clarify, we just don't ingest data, we make sure analytics engine can ingest that data and provide analytics and suppress bad alerts and give you good signal and do data stitching. So, our ingestion philosophy is more a philosophy which works in building analytics around the data and then ingesting the data [indiscernible]. So I think across the board we anticipate robust growth, that's why we're comfortable guiding to an $800 million to $810 million number.
Kathy Bonanno: A lot of hands going up. Okay. Amber?
Ken Talanian: Hi, Ken Talanian, Evercore ISI. When I look at that $6 billion billings number, how much of that is from your existing product set? And what are your assumptions around kind of current acquisitions going into that and then maybe some of the future acquisition assumptions that build-up to that?
Nikesh Arora: Look, as Lee mentioned, that we believe many of the cloud security products are not fully built in the market from a maturity perspective. If you look at serverless, serverless we think is 50% built, we bought PureSec, they have a product roadmap, which is a robust product roadmap in front of them for six to nine months. So we believe there will be interesting cloud security based acquisitions we might have to do in the future, which will fall in the M&A philosophy we highlighted. So, some of those bolt-on technology, which haven't been developed or anticipated, and our desire to build a cloud platforms for the future. But there is no major plug in that number for us to go out and acquire revenue to reach that $6 billion number. We feel we should be able to get there with the majority of the products we have in place with small bolt-on acquisitions as we see the industry [indiscernible].
Shaul Eyal: Thank you. Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer. Nikesh, you have put many concerns to rest over the course of the past hour, so.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you.
Shaul Eyal: So, one question I had in mind is...
Nikesh Arora: But still have one. So go -- everything before the but is to be ignored. Yeah.
Shaul Eyal: As we think about your targets heading towards fiscal 2022 and above, have you taken into consideration any changes with respect to channel compensation, partners, anything with a go-to-market? Or pretty much from our perspective, we should be thinking about it mostly at a status quo going further?
Nikesh Arora: There are no major assumptions in there in changing any channel behavior in the process. We are seeing more activity in the channel by telcos and by SIs like the Accentures and the Deloittes of the world or AT&Ts of the world or Telefonica's of the world, they are becoming more active in cybersecurity. If you look at most of the landscape, every telco, every consulting organization is building very large cybersecurity practices because they're trying not only [indiscernible] they're building cloud practices. So if you go, this is the biggest fastest-growing segment of the SI and SP space. So, yes, we anticipate they will have a bigger role to play in how we are able to deploy some of our products in the future. But to us, that's just evolution of channel. If they end up doing more business, bring us to customers, we'll be there with them just the way we are with the [Optiv's] [ph] and WWT's of today.
Saket Kalia: Thanks. Saket Kalia from Barclays. Nikesh you talked about no transition to a term license model, for example, for the firewall business, which was good to hear. But you also even suggested that maybe some cloud products could be priced similarly to the firewall. I think we mentioned that quickly. Could you just give some examples of that and when that could actually start to happen?
Nikesh Arora: So what I -- sorry, thank you, first of all, for asking the question. I want to make sure I clarify. Sometimes our sales teams bundle our annual products into three-year deals and sell them like they would sell it upfront cash payment, which allows us to get the cash flow just the way we get the cash flow for our firewall products and roughly -- three years is roughly the term for our hardware business in terms of contract durations. So that's all I'm saying that, some of the cloud deal end up being three-year deals instead of annual deals. So we still get the benefit of the cash flow, so which is why Kathy alluded to the fact that we're not anticipating large duration declines over the next three years. We believe -- I haven't said this yet, but I'm going to say it, we believe that the duration decline will be approximately 10% over the next three years and hence, we believe we are able to deliver -- we will be able to deliver the $4 billion of cash flow over the next three years.
Imtiaz Koujalgi: Hi. It's Imtiaz Koujalgi from Guggenheim. Kathy, if I'm doing my math right, based on your billings guide for next year and your billings guide for the next-generation products if I back that out, it looks like you're guiding to the core business growing at about 8%, the firewall business, which is a big step down from the 24% product growth we had this year. Is that the right way to think about product growth next year in the high-20s?
Kathy Bonanno: Yeah. I think it's a little bit higher than that, but yes that's close. The reason that we are looking at this firewall technology as a group is because we're very excited about what we're seeing from our customers in terms of demand for both Prisma Access and our VM series. And so, that security category, which Nikesh showed up on the slide earlier, we are expecting to continue to grow at very rapid rates. Now, the mix may change a little bit in between there, but I think our forecast still holds regardless. And the firewall security itself, that in line security, that network security is still a very important component for all of our customers, but we are seeing great demand and great excitement about what Prisma Access can do by delivering that security in a cloud form factor really security-as-a-service. And so, we're very jazzed about our possibilities going forward in terms of being able to win deals that would have normally been one with firewalls, hardware with that particular product and we think that we're the only competitor that can really offer these various form factors to our customers. And so, we see a really terrific opportunity.
Nikesh Arora: Just to elaborate on that for a second. You saw two examples, one Lee alluded to a very large retailer and we had a video from another. In both cases we were competing with firewall boxes. And we went in with Prisma Access with a differentiated strategy. These are very large deals, as I've mentioned, one of them was over $10 million, the other one was close. But in both cases, we were able to displace the hardware form factor for competitors because competitors did not have a software form factor. The good news is, the software form factor deployment is a brief. If you try and deploy a box in 2,000 locations in a retailer, it takes them a year and a half or two years. The software, we can get there in three to five months. So, part of what we are trying to do is, we're trying to actually force that shift towards the software form factor because as Nir mentioned, we don't believe our competition has the capability to deliver the solution via the software form factor, which allows us both to be differentiated, reduce speed of deployment, allow it to run across hundred on-boarding points from -- for our customers. So that's part of the assumption, which you rightfully captured. We're actually trying to engineer that bigger shift and trying to drive our business more towards the software form factor.
Imtiaz Koujalgi: Thanks. So, one more follow-up, Kathy. On the long-term target, comparing what you gave us last time in 2017, you had free cash flow margins long-term below operating margins. This time you reversed it, your operating margins long-term are actually lower than your free cash flow margin targets. What is driving that reversal? Is it just more recurring revenues?
Kathy Bonanno: Yeah. Can I just clarify? When we're talking about long-term and I'm glad you asked this so I can get it out there for everyone to hear. We're talking four to five years, right? And the previous guidance that we had given, our long-term was much, much further out when we're sort of growing at the rate of the market is the way we described it. And at that point in time, we assumed that we'd be a much greater cash taxpayer. And so, that was the reason for the lower free cash flow margins. But we're talking right now long-term for us is about four to five years out. Okay? Thank you. And I said four to five, not 45. I need to be very clear and enunciate.
Nikesh Arora: 45 would be great guidance. All right. Somebody has the mic? There's question on this slide. David behind you.
Kathy Bonanno: And I saw a woman with her hand up. I want her to get a question, Fatima. Just don't ask us a hard one now. Just kidding.
Fatima Boolani: I'll go easy on you. I'm Fatima Boolani from UBS. Just a quick point of clarification on the mix shift dynamics you're seeing in the core firewall business, is that a displacement dynamic or are you seeing the mix shift within the refresh of your own installed base? I just want to clarify...
Nikesh Arora: It's more of a displacement dynamic. I give you one specific use case, but there are similar use cases in many places where -- whether it's a retailer, whether it's multi-branch situation or multiple mobile user situation. We have customers with 100,000 employees or more who want to go to a Prisma Access type solution for the mobile users. So, it's more -- it's mostly a displaced -- mostly a displacement of competition dynamic than it is a refresh of our data center firewall business.
Fatima Boolani: Understood. So my real question is...
Nikesh Arora: I know where you're going, don't worry.
Fatima Boolani: You talked about...
Nikesh Arora: I've spent three months pouring over every one of these numbers of Kathy, so I know exactly where you're going. Please go.
Fatima Boolani: You talked a lot about automation in each one of the pillars of your corporate strategy. And so, if I think about your top 25 or your 25th largest customer spending close to $40 million per annum with you. I mean, how should we think about that with the automation opportunity and the fact that you expect to double the size of your business in the next four to five years? I mean, what are some of the dynamics there if your 25th largest customers already spending $40 million with you?
Nikesh Arora: So, let me use Cortex XDR as a use case, right. We have thousands of customers who deployed Traps. The version of Traps four months ago was not collecting data, sending it to a central data lake, allowing us to do insights and analytics against it. We are able to go back to every one of those large customers and allow them to ingest data from there and give -- and upsell them to Cortex XDR. So this is a use case for us where we take their firewalls, we take their endpoints and say, why don't you collect the data across the board, we'll analyze it to you, we'll reduce the signal-to-noise ratio and we'll couple Demisto with it and be able to give you automation going forward. So, that's the use case, for example, we can take our firewall customers, our endpoint customers, add automation to this and that budget comes out of their SOC budgets, because every one of our customers is building SOC. SOC is the fastest-growing category with about 20%-plus growth year-over-year, where people are deploying more people and more data ingestion and more data logging spend.
Fatima Boolani: And do you foresee that more coming out of the wallets of traditional managed security services providers you sort of offer these Tier 1 type capabilities? And are those dollars coming from essentially?
Nikesh Arora: Those dollars are coming from both SOC dollars, if you will, there is such a category, but they are also coming from efficiencies we're able to drive for those SOC owners, we are saying, we can come in and instead of we put up some interesting numbers up there, you out 8 times and 50 times in terms of alert reduction. Traditional approach to alert reduction is hire more SOC analyst. If he can walk and say, I can reduce the number of alerts by 8 times and I can the reduce the number of alerts by 50 times, that's a huge amount of savings, which is coming out of the SOC analysts that people have to hire and very few of our customers are able to scale up their SOC to hire 300 SOC analysts because it's kind of very interesting. One thing I learnt, which I can talk about, very few customers delete policies. They are scare of deleting seven, eight of firewall policies because somebody wrote them with some wisdom in mind and the new guys says, oh, I'm not going to delete it. So there is the poor SOC analyst trying to interpret, why is that an alert? And the problem is, the alert keeps coming back because they have no ability to go out and remediate that and fixed that policy. So part of what Demisto is doing is, okay, we understand you don't like alerts, so let's automate this so you can start focusing on stuff that's important. That's why you end up with that 174,000 alerts and not that I'm a hacker or a bad guy, but if I understand how you prioritize the important alerts you should look at, I'll spend my time trying to figure out how to be under the radar. So part of our philosophy is, we want to look at every alert out there and the only way he can get there is through automation. Automation that works in the endpoint, automation that works in your firewall, automation that works in your SOC, so that's why if you notice, every one of our products has a large automation TAM because we believe we're going to take away from this services is the labor TAMs and put that into automation.
Fatima Boolani: Thank you so much.
Nikesh Arora: Amber, in the back.
Sterling Auty: Hi, Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. So, one question for Nikesh and Kathy, and if possible, can I throw a follow-up question to Nir, if he still has his microphone?
Nikesh Arora: Yeah. Our entire management team is here, of course.
Sterling Auty: All right. Fantastic. So Nikesh and Kathy, Nikesh you mentioned the 10% reduction in duration over the next three years, how much of that is actually going to be what you're managing that duration to versus what customers want? Because one of the positive feedback items that we received through the channel over the last quarter or so is, finally, Palo Alto being flexible on payment terms. And if God forbid, we do roll into some tougher macro economic times, I could see more and more customers perhaps wanting to only pay a year at a time instead of three years upfront.
Nikesh Arora: Kathy, you want to...
Kathy Bonanno: Yeah. We are going to be very thoughtful about those trade-offs in terms of what sort of financial incentives do we have to provide in order to have our customers commit to us for a longer period of time. We talked about last -- that issue last quarter, and we talked about the fact that we were paying very close attention to the economics of deals like that where our customers really wanted to only pay us a year at a time. And we're going to continue to do that. And if our customers demand more and more of that, obviously, we will adapt to what our customers are wanting. But we actually find that there are a lot of customers who are very comfortable with the way they pay us today very comfortable with our billing practices to date. And so, we're not seeing this huge surge of demand. It tends to be occasional request that we handle on a one-off basis. Potentially it could become larger in the future and, of course, we'll adapt to that over time. But the big shift that we've been talking about -- I'm sorry, Nikesh, is really driven more by the mix shift of the products and primarily the growth of Prisma Cloud, which we talked a little bit about last quarter having shorter contract durations, which we talked about.
Nikesh Arora: And sorry, just to add to that, I've discovered over the last 13 months, the industry has certain compensating mechanisms already in place. And there are customers who want to pay on an annual basis and the industry -- the channel wants to facilitate it. They figured it out with some sort of financing and they show up at our doorstep with the entire contract durations worth of cash flow. So, it's been around for a very long time, and there are many enterprise companies which have financing arms and all different kind of tactics to enable that cash flow generation. So we haven't assumed any of that stuff, we believe that life will go on as normal. But I have the inevitable Nir here, you wanted to question.
Sterling Auty: Exactly. The follow-up, Nir, when you were talking about proxies, you did Gen 1 kind of Gen 2, but when we're thinking about Prisma and the competition going forward, you didn't really kind of call out the name. So I want to be very specific in terms of understanding who you think...
Nikesh Arora: You think we didn't call out the name. Okay.
Sterling Auty: Nikesh, you touched upon. Who do you think is going to be the core competition in terms of Prisma Access moving forward? I mean, we all think probably Zscaler is going to be part of it. But what about the Akamai and the other companies that are in that space? And what do you think happens to kind of the traditional firewall vendors, do they all get squeezed out or do they come up with offerings as well? Thanks.
Nir Zuk: Yeah. I -- so I think the competition is Zscaler. However, I strongly believe that the right architecture and the right products at the end of the day win. And we've been told that may be multiple times, right? FireEye, for example, right? A long time ago, FireEye came out of the market and they had this idea of running sandboxes and signatures are dead and the entire world is going to ship to FireEye and some of you even bought that story, but it was the wrong technical solution. First, sandbox is not going to replace everything and second, from a technical perspective, a sandbox needs to do prevention, no detection. It has to be in line and it has to be across entire infrastructure, which means it needs to run off the firewall. And that's why they went their way, we went our way and we all know how it ended up for both of us. So, I think that we're facing the same situation right now. There is the right technical way of doing something and the right way to deliver a product to the market, then there is the wrong way. And proxies have always been the wrong way and firewalls have always been the right way, being in the network, part of the network, being a packet-based device, participating in routing, participating in network optimization, and being able to support all applications, not just few applications, not breaking applications. I don't know if you know, if Microsoft recommends that when you use Zscaler, you turn -- you don't use Zscaler when you go to Office 365. Why? Because it breaks Office 365. Because that's what proxies do. And it's their own technical solution and I strongly believe that the right technical solution will win. Now, if you look at what's involved in Access in the modern access into the cloud and back into the infrastructure -- into their corporate infrastructure for mobile users and branch offices, you need to do a lot of different things. And our competition today, different competitors do different things. I don't see a single competitor that does both the application security part of it, the firewall side of it, the CASB side of it, the SD-WAN part of it, they are back to corporate side of it, I just don't see anyone that has the complete portfolio to be able to do what we're talking about. Yes, there are the firewall vendors, the firewall vendors, like I said, are still busy figuring out why they can't sell their hardware against ours. While we've been spending the last several years building our virtual firewall and building our cloud-delivered firewall to a point where I just -- it's just -- they are three to five years behind at least, plus the amount of time they are behind our hardware firewall is, I just -- I don't see competition from them.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you, Nir.
Kathy Bonanno: I'm going to recall...
Nikesh Arora: What Nir means to say is, we respect our competition and we are glad that we're able to build amazingly large businesses and serve the customers' needs with cybersecurity. I think that's what he said.
Matt Hedberg: Matt Hedberg, RBC. It seems like every other question of investors is macro, you guys delivered strong results, obviously, some very large deals this quarter and the guidance on a multi-year view is very strong. I guess, Nikesh, when you're out talking to executives, what is the pulse of buying behavior out there right now? And then I have a quick product question for Nir as well.
Nikesh Arora: Yeah. What's interesting and maybe I'm going to ask our President, Amit Singh, who you have not seen in this context. He can talk more because he has been out there on the road grinding away. So you guys get to tell the good stories, I get to go out there in the field and grind. So, let's have you come up. So...
Kathy Bonanno: Oh boy.
Amit Singh: Hello, everyone. The climate for cybersecurity is quite strong, the acquisitions. It's driven by all the challenges you see in the papers and buying behavior is actually quite solid. The movement towards software and software-delivered is a real one, so -- and we are actually very, very excited about the products that we have, both on the product side, as well as the service delivery side of it, because these are cloud-delivered solutions, it's a backdrop that I come from. And interesting, when you look at any trend, whether it's how many software startups were funded, cybersecurity startups, all the way to the actual market spending, it's very, very solid. Your question was, I think, on the macro picture. We haven't seen any slowdown. We haven't seen slowdown, you saw some of that numbers we shared around pipeline, pipeline growth, partner generation pipeline and clearly, our Q4 performance is a measure testament of being able to hold the core business, while being also able to generate brand new businesses and scale them.
Matt Hedberg: And then maybe just a quick product question. Nir, when you think about consolidating security spend, what's sort of your view on identity? It's -- obviously, it's a hot category out there. What role is identity have in the Palo Alto platform?
Nir Zuk: Sure. So first, most of our customers integrate our network security with identity, because identity needs enforcement, and in most cases, the firewall is going to do a bit of thing that performs the enforcement. Actually, the only case where it's not the firewall is when you access SaaS applications. In all other cases, it's the firewall that enforcing the identity, sometimes the applications themselves as well. So that's the rough identity. Now, if you look at the market today, I think most of the market is focused on what's called hygiene, meaning who can connect and who cannot connect to an application, which is interesting but it's becoming commodity. I think the most interest -- the more interesting part of Identity is identity analytics. So being able to take identity events and figuring out attacks from the identity. So that's -- I think that's one area that's not being addressed today by the market and is an opportunity. I think that's the other side of identity that is still yet to be decided by the market is, how do you do machine-to-machine identity, especially in the cloud. And I think the jury is still out on that and that's -- that could be one day an interesting thing to look at.
Phil Winslow: Hi, Phil Winslow, Wells Fargo. Just wanted to focusing on the firewall platform billing slide and there you break out your firewall hardware versus Prisma and the VM series, we already -- so we talked a lot about Prisma Access here today, but wanted to focus my question on the VM series. One of the questions I get a lot from investors is attach rate of VM series and attach rate of firewall in the public cloud environment. And so, it's kind of question to the whole team here is that, one, how are you thinking about contribution VM series to the forward billings? But also, where are we in terms of increasing attach rates of VM series and call it your hybrid cloud, multi-cloud security?
Nikesh Arora: Quick clarifying question, what you mean the attach of the VM series?
Phil Winslow: The -- instead of call it like the out-of-the-box firewall that you got -- get from a cloud vendor, Azure, AWS attaching actually VM series to that workload and the like.
Nikesh Arora: So we're very pleased with the VM series and how it's done. The -- when it first came out, we were focused on the private cloud use case because at the time that was the first generation of cloud, and then it's evolved really well as more workloads have shifted into public cloud infrastructure. VM series today supports all of the major cloud vendors in US Azure, GCP, Alibaba. It's evolved in a number of ways that are very specific to cloud in terms of how we integrate it with different orchestration platforms, how would do automation. We're the only security vendor, for example, especially supported with Terraform, which is one of the main sort of multi-cloud automation orchestration tools out there. We are sellable to all the marketplaces. And we actually have a very nice business and growing business with VM series being consumed through the marketplaces. So, there is a lot of really good things that are happening there. The -- I'd say, the only sort of challenge that -- may not the only challenge, but big challenge relative to your question is, a lot of companies will first try to get by without real security. And the -- through various mechanisms and often is through unfortunate events where something bad happens to a company that triggers the people to actually really go back and pay attention. But that's the only challenge is sort of getting people over the hump of trying the thing that they think might be good enough before they realize that what they really need is best-in-class security and understand that we can do the cloud integration aspects that they also knew. Okay? A question here.
Karl Keirstead: Great. Karl Keirstead at Deutsche Bank. First of all, Nikesh for a guy who a year ago said that you no longer giving annual guidance only next quarter, thank you for the reversal.
Nikesh Arora: Appreciate it. I'll -- adaptive dynamic earn. Yes.
Karl Keirstead: I wanted to, let's say, stress test your confidence in 20% billings and revenue growth over the next three years. And, I guess, I'm saying this in the context of you having just put up a quarter where you grew both metrics by 22%. So you just put up 22% and you're saying you're going to grow 20% for the next three. At first that sounds a little bit optimistic, especially given that you're on stage as well talking about a hardware to software form factor shift, which if we look at firms like F5 and others that are going through this. It tends to be quite dilutive to your overall growth rate. So, is it that that form factor shift you expect only to be quite gradual and you can kind of skate around it? Or is it that you're emerging products are just growing so damn fast, but despite that you can still get to 20%? Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: First of all, thank you, Karl. If I'm allowed to clarify, I was not comfortable giving guidance when I walked in because I didn't understand the levers of the business. Nor did I understand the industry and nor did I understand the levers of the Company, and I hate to stand up on stage and comment on behalf of 7,000 people without having some degree of confidence and comfort in our ability to deliver. So, I appreciate you guys and during the last one year of our quarterly guidance, but I think hopefully we have given more guidance and put a large news around our necks. Now, we have to go out and deliver this stuff. So, thank you for reminding me of that. In terms of our comfort level, I want to parse your question into two or three parts. One part is, we are seeing unabated growth in cloud, generally and I alluded to the fact that there is not enough cloud security out there and there has not been enough people enumerating the need for cloud security. I will not take the name of the customer but there has been a recent breach, where it was a cloud breach. And I can tell you that got the phones ringing because people suddenly realized that you can have cloud breaches, even though you are using a public cloud provider, security cannot be used as an open source set of tools. You have to go find a security product to secure cloud instances as you start putting more and more important crown jewel data out there. So, we believe that that's going to drive more of the VM use case, we believe that's going to drive a lot of the Prisma cloud use case. We're also seeing -- as the question was asked and then Amit answered. We're also seeing a lot of re-architecting going on as people go through their re-architecting of enterprise. If you look at companies, right, there is no CIO out there who is not thinking about how do I go to the cloud. So this is very important. So if I'm going to the cloud what do I do with my enterprise IT, what do I do with my security? How do I rethink it? And as they're rethinking it, they're rethinking their branches. You go to a retailer, retailer needs to put a lot of bandwidths into their branches. In the past, there was little bandwidth, you needed your POS systems to work, all that's you needed. Today, they want AR and VR in the store. They want to move customer data back and forth, suddenly they need security in the store. So we believe there is some degree of new use cases being created, which is driving some of the confidence we have in some of our newer services. And we believe our core business continues to be strong. The underlying core business and the customer base continues to be strong. We fully realize that we are going roughly from, let's say, $3.5 billion number to a $6 billion number, which means we have to kind of double, as I've said, there's only one way to double, have more product or have twice as many salespeople, I hope that there is twice many customers out there that you can get. So we think the balance is right and we should be able to execute. We've done a lot of investing in FY'19 in Q3 and Q4 and ramping up both our core capability as of some of our speedboat capability, now we're stretching our team has got to deliver. We'll give it our best shot.
Pierre Ferragu: Pierre Ferragu, New Street. Nikesh, first of all --. Pierre Ferragu, New Street. Nikesh, first of all, thank you very much for not changing your business model. It took me a very long time to figure it out and I spent…
Nikesh Arora: It taken me 12 months to figure out, then I had to go figure out what the other guys…
Pierre Ferragu: What have done so far. That's great. And it gives me the opportunity to ask more of a product question to Nir. And so, you explained very well how you plan to completely crush all proxy-based competitors. And I was wondering, and you've defended it very well all the -- all what you have already in your development in the next-generation firewall and all what you've done from there. But I was wondering how you transfer that benefit to technologies you're acquiring. So, for instance, if we look at the components of Prisma Cloud, when they came in first day what did you do? How did you integrate their technologies with your existing technology? How did they benefit from that? And then your clients using it, how does it benefit from having a Palo Alto Networks firewall and having Prisma Cloud in the same environment?
Lee Klarich: Yeah. Thank you for the question. So, Nikesh mentioned a couple of the principles that we now apply more vigorously in terms of the incoming companies, level responsibility we give them, the expectations we put on the founding teams of these companies to continue to execute, as well as to build an integration plan. And it's interesting you asked about Prisma Cloud, that was formed out of the basis of two acquisitions, Evident.io and RedLock. The integration of those two together took us about four months. Four months to integrate two products into a single platform. It now forms the foundation where we'll be able to then further integrate Twistlock and PureSec into that platform continue to extend it out. Again, pulling the leadership teams of the companies into this together in order to make sure, and then building an execution plan that includes the integration that we all agree on very quickly after the acquisitions happen. And we're very much in the midst right now of executing on that with an expectation that by the end of this calendar year those will now be new modules in the Prisma Cloud platform. So, a lot of this is around giving the right people the right responsibility, the right accountability and then executing. And we're showing that we can do this a very good success. On the customer side then, what they're seeing is, very easy adoption of additional cloud security capabilities showing up in the same platform that they're already used to. They simply get to consume and deploy against our cloud workloads, which is a very powerful a go-to-market and adoption aspect that the products are enabling.
Nir Zuk: Yeah. Another example will be XDR. So we bought an EDR company, we bought in NTA company, right, Secdo and LightCyber and integrated both together. Nobody believed we can do that. Nobody believed we can take network data, take endpoint data, combine them together and generate meaningful analytics based on that. And we're the first one to do it, and like I said, EDR, NTA as their -- and they're don't make sense and now we're going to integrate -- we plan to integrate more and more things into it. Now, the other type of integration that we have, which I think we partly ask about is, when we buy someone like Zingbox, or we develop something like DNS security, it becomes a service that is attached to our firewall. And all the customer has to do to use it is to flip a switch. You flip a switch and you use the service, and you test it for a week, a month, whatever, you like it you buy it, you don't like it, you don't buy. And most customers, they're turning to and they see things that they just can't not buy the product. And the interesting thing is that, those services apply to all form factors. So if you have a physical firewall, you do that, if you bought Prisma Access, you turn in and you do that. If you went with a competitor, with a proxy competitor and you want to do IoT security in the branch, which you do, like you need to secure printers and you probably have IP phones and video cameras and other things connected to the network in the branch, what do you do? You have to go to an IoT security company, you have to the buy their product, you have to deploy it in the branch and you have to do deploy it in 2,000 branches, if you have 2,000 real points and somehow operationalize it. With Palo Alto Networks, if you are a Prisma Access customer already, you turn on a switch, immediately it applies to all your branches, you like it you buy it, you don't like it you don't buy it. It's that simple. Okay?
David Niederman: There are other question right next to the gentlemen.
Keith Bachman: Hi, it's Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Nikesh and Kathy for you, is M&A inclusive or exclusive of what you just put up on the board? And what I mean by that is, as we think about the revenue outlook and billing outlook, I assume that the context of that is mostly smaller deals probably don't move the M&A, but I just wanted to see if you could clarify. And it relates to you as well Kathy on the margins, this year you're suggesting that margins go lower but thereafter, they'll move higher. And so, is that again M&A neutral? So if you do some deals you might ask for forgiveness for the margin growth that you're suggesting in the outer years if in fact you do pursue M&A even some smaller deals that might pressure those margin. So, inclusive or exclusive is the shorter question of M&A?
Nikesh Arora: So to give you a framework, it's exclusive of any large M&A, which has a significant revenue acquisition component. So, if you go buy a company for $100 million of revenue, where -- that's not part of our plan, as I said to the gentleman earlier, there is no plug in these numbers that we're going to be acquiring $200 million, $300 million revenue growing at 50% right, that is not a bad stuff. We're not looking for M&A as a strategy. We're looking as platform as a strategy. Now, in the platform context, if you think about, are we better off going back and, for example, we built Cortex XDR from the acquisitions. We've put it -- we got the teams to integrate. We didn't sell it for six months. We got them to integrate and sold it after. They put it together. Twistlock, RedLock, PureSec, we integrated and we're deploying it across our platform. So if you find there is a product need and a product market fit that needs to be integrated across the platform that stuff will have to be acquired and we'll keep you posted as we acquire them, what the impacts of those are financially. We have not built any expectation saying we're going to be doing $500 million of acquisitions every year and it's going to have certainly EPS impact, we're going to take that and take into these numbers. These are raw numbers, organic, Kathy has told you FY'20 has a $45 million M&A for this year, after one year we roll that into our organic numbers. So FY'21, 2022 there's no -- there'll be unless we do something between now and then there is -- those will become organic numbers. One thing I think there was a clarification question which I want to announce publicly, somebody asked a question about the duration of 10%, is that every year or across three years? The answer is over three years, not every year. I'm trying to keep my friends out of jail, I heard that broadband is poor in Jail, so. And still on MPLS.
Michael Turits: Sounds good idea. My wife just watching the [indiscernible] black last night. So I don't want you there. Michael Turits from Raymond James. Question on -- for Nir and Lee, you guys talked about SD-WAN and SD-WAN is big and a big part of what Fortinet has been talking about for some time. So I'm trying to think about, first of all, how do you become an SD-WAN player? What are you going to do with it? Is it similar I think to what Fortinet is doing and saying, hey, we can do this too and function the SD-WAN? Or are you going to use it to help improve GlobalProtect cloud services networking component, because that's also a big place for Zscaler wins is by doing networking that they say salespeople money?
Nir Zuk: Yeah. Doing networking with a proxy, that's interesting, but...
Lee Klarich: He doesn't need any more encouragement.
Michael Turits: I just want to get him proud -- I have seen him perform for a while.
Nir Zuk: Yeah. So SD-WAN, SD-WAN -- so maybe 30 seconds on what SD-WAN is. So, just a word on same page. As applications move to the cloud and it stops making sense to the MPLS, you want to -- you start using regular Internet connection through IDSL, cable modems, whatever, D3s, E3s, whatever you can get. The challenge with that is that, they don't provide you the same reliability and performance guarantees that MPLS does. So, all of the sudden, you start relying on applications in the cloud like Office 365 and G Suite and Salesforce.com or your own applications in public cloud, but you cannot get the same guarantees. So SD-WAN is about taking multiple Internet connections like a DSL from one provider and a cable modem from another or 2DSL or a DSL and LTE or 5G, so on and so on, and somehow doing some kind of networking tricks on them such that with the tool or more links you can get to the same reliability and the same guarantees more or less that you get from MPLS, of course, at a much lower cost, much higher bandwidth, which is what those applications in the cloud need. Now, there are multiple ways of doing that, you can do it in the branch itself, meaning you can take the firewall that is in the branch and you can add SD-WAN to that firewall and do that -- those networking tricks to make those multiple Internet connections appear much more reliable. And we're doing that, meaning we are building that and that's going to become a subscription on top of the firewall, that's like Lee said, where if you deploy our firewalls in the branch, we do that and in that respect, it's somewhat similar to what other SD-WAN vendors are doing, of course, with a differentiation being much better security. Right? We always weigh in on security. The other option to do it -- and which we do today as well with SD-WAN partners and we'll continue to do is to use SD-WAN to bring the traffic to Prisma Access. Prisma Access, which is a bunch of firewall deployed in the cloud, need the traffic together. Now, you can do it with traditional IT sector or something like that, a much more efficient way to do it is with SD-WAN. So your program your SD-WAN your software-defined WAN to bring the traffic to Prisma Access and then you do all the security work in Prisma Access. The advantage of that is that you don't have to deploy a new security box in the branch every few years, because technology goes fail and you need to upgrade, which is kind of like painting the Golden Gate Bridge, right? You start, you deploy 2,000 branches, by the time you finish the 2,000, you have to start from the beginning, with Prisma Access you don't have to do it and that's what the real differentiation is. So doing SD-WAN in the cloud rather than doing SD-WAN in the branch and using SD-WAN just to bring the traffic to the cloud is the right way to do SD-WAN but for that you need to have something like Prisma Access, and you need to have a networking Prisma Access, not something that breaks the TCP connections and restarts them, which is not networking based. It's called a proxy.
Nikesh Arora: QED, yes.
Nir Zuk: Do I need to acquire? No like Lee said, we're building SD-WAN.
Nikesh Arora: Okay.
Erik Suppiger: Erik Suppiger, JMP. Couple of questions, one on the free cash flow margins. Is the primary cause for the decline this year duration or what should we think of as the primary hit on the margin front? I'll ask the second question after that.
Kathy Bonanno: Yeah. The primary reason for the decline is the same primary reason you see for our operating margin decline, and that's the investments that we're making, not only organically to drive the new areas of our business, but also the M&A investments that we've made.
Erik Suppiger: Okay. And then for...
Kathy Bonanno: Which is why we expect it to turn around.
Erik Suppiger: Okay. Then for Nir or Lee, XDR, is that product production-ready? How much of that -- how can we gauge the success of XDR from here? Because we've had Traps out there for a while. Is this something that's going to be a viable competitor to CrowdStrike at this point? Or how should we be thinking about that? And how much of that is getting sold outside of your installed base?
Lee Klarich: So, as we mentioned earlier, we're actually very happy with how XDR has done. Now, it's early. We announced it about -- and released about four and a half, five months ago. You saw the results for the first full quarter, number of customers we added. So, very excited about the initial market reception, customer reception to XDR. And the messages that we talked about here are things we're hearing from our customers. Very powerful -- the ability to integrate the -- and stitch the endpoint data with the network data. No one else can do that, no one else can give the end-to-end visibility, reducing the number of alerts, reducing the amount of time it takes them to actually investigate incidents. So all the things we said here are -- they're here because that's what we're hearing from our customers that have adopted XDR. Okay? The -- and the interesting aspect of this is, that is enabling us to really sort of change the conversation with our customers to one that is a very strategic conversation about the shift toward, not just endpoint protection, but the shift toward analytics and ultimately toward automation and tying that with Demisto. Okay?
Nikesh Arora: So going back to the theory…
Nir Zuk: Proxy, almost similar. No. This is another case where I think that the right technical solution will win. EDR doesn't make any sense. It really doesn't make any technical sense to limit yourself to collecting data just from endpoints, limiting yourself to processing data just from endpoints and then responding back to the endpoints, where we all know that the Traps happen across the entire infrastructure. They can start in the SaaS application and then take over an endpoint and then propagate through the network and end up in the public cloud, where your data is. It -- the right technical way of doing it is to collect data from multiple parts of the infrastructure into one place, use your analytics, all your people or whatever it is to go through the entire data, find the attacks-based information in the entire data and when you find an attack, it doesn't matter where the signal came from, you want to respond back to the entire infrastructure, which is kind of where Demisto comes in, responding back to the entire infrastructure. And I just don't see the competition doing that. I don't see the competition doing more than just basic endpoint data collection and response. So, assuming we get the right marketing and the right sales and marketing around it, go-to-market and there are some missing product features, I think that next time we'll be able to talk much more about where we are versus the competition.
Nikesh Arora: If I may elaborate on that from a market activity perspective, and given that we've only had 4.5 months worth of great experience with the product in the market against the competitor you mentioned, we -- remember 12 months ago, we didn't have a dedicated sales force that could compete in terms of on a point-by-point basis against some of these competitors because we had a core sales team, which was aren't as fully adaptive selling this product. Now that we have speedboat teams out there, it's fair to say, we saw CrowdStrike in between 25 and 30 deals, which were in our installed base, because that's why we went after first, and I think the number is we were able to beat them in 75% of the deals we saw them in our installed base. Again, it's one data point. But we're slowly getting our act together and getting better at this stuff. But six months ago, we didn't have a product. Traps would not compete against EDR because Traps endpoint protection did not do an XDR. We launched XDR, we've made Traps free. We have thousands of customers using Traps. Our first target is go to the customers who already have Traps, they already have a Firewalls, who better than them to make sure that they can buy an XDR and we're delighted that 75% of them were CrowdStrike [indiscernible] more deals than we do because they have a larger sales force, but we're delighted that we were able to beat in 25% -- 75% of those deals.
Shaul Eyal: Thank you. Shaul from Oppenheimer again. Maybe question for Amit or Kathy. European performance were as -- it has been quite stable over the course of the past probably two years now. I think this quarter and last quarter, not as strong as we have seen before. So, is it a macro issue? Maybe a UK-specific issue? Maybe tightening -- tying it to a former macro related question that was asked? Thank your.
Amit Singh: It's just a great opportunity. Really -- it really is. Europe strong adopter of -- cybersecurity is actually on the headlines and there is national legislation in countries to go fix it. And we're just investing in the team, giving them resources, we love the leadership team there. So it's actually a growth opportunity for us to do -- continue to do well and actually do better in EMEA.
David Niederman: All right. We got one in the front and then two in the back on the right.
Andy Nowinski: Thanks. Andy Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. So, the question with regard to Prisma Access. At the Gartner Security Conference, a few months ago Zscaler was on stage at the keynote and they had a few customers on stage as well, that said, they tried your GlobalProtect cloud service, which you're now calling Prisma Access and didn't get the performance that they were looking for. It wasn't scalable. I guess, can you just talk about how you've changed or fixed the performance in the architecture?
Lee Klarich: We -- it was a company, it was not existing customer. And they had actually selected said competitor. So we had an opportunity to get in one last chance and they told us the same thing. And we said, can you share with us the test that you're doing? And it was provided by the competitor and it was a flawed test. We were able to show them how it was a flawed test and after they readed the test to no longer be a flawed test, Prisma Access performed wonderfully. And that was before the most recent update to Prisma Access where we now have over 100 on-boarding locations around the world. So, we are very pleased with the performance of -- performance capabilities of Prisma Access as a globally deployed cloud solution.
Nikesh Arora: And as the video you saw, which talks about a million employees and hundreds of hospitals, they ran a full POC against the same competitors. So hopefully --. Sorry, which is already deployed. Yes. All right. Question in the back and we're coming to the end of our Q&A session. But we will take a few more questions some there and then, let's go to Brad first. I don't want to end on Brad.
Brad Zelnick: This is a fantastic presentation today. My question is actually really simple. Three months ago, if we listen to your remarks in your earnings call, you talked about a transition.
Nikesh Arora: Yeah.
Brad Zelnick: There is not much of a transition.
Nikesh Arora: Yes.
Brad Zelnick: Why?
Nikesh Arora: Good question. I'm glad you asked it. Four, five months ago we were going full speed ahead analyzing every which way we can make this transition to a fully ratable model. And when we sat down and looked at it from an accounting perspective, a legal perspective, a go-to-market perspective, we would have to impact the channel, our salespeople, we all step back and said, okay, why are we doing this. Our customers are buying billions of dollars of products from us. They have a motion. Our salespeople know how to record it. How to sell it. And we sat down and said, we're doing it because the industry likes our models, our software models. I personally like money upfront. Cash flow is a good thing. You go out and hunt, use some this year, rest of them you put in a cold store and use it in year two, and year three. Why do I have to go hunt every year if I'm going to go to analyze model? So, we just felt that we were trying to unnaturally change the Company's business model and transition to a place, which is more akin to a pure software SaaS ARR-based model and we are -- it's kind of a hybrid business. We have a firewall business very strong, and we're building the next-generation security business, which we believe is going to be very strong and some of the characteristics of this we really like. We like the upfront cash, we like the cash flow that this brings us. We like the fact that it gives you long-term deferred revenue, which allows you to be amortized. So we decided that we're better off going this way. So this is why we're here. And then we were comfortable that we've analyzed everything -- every Sunday. This Analyst Day has been in the making for six months. Right? We've been trying to look at what we want to come and tell you, what's important, what's not important. As I said, I probably will never read as many research notes that I've read in the last six months from all of you guys, apologies to you, but I have a day job. But I did read most of them, and I did read, but you guys have concerned about, and I understand why you like those models. But if you got to run the Company, you'll be the owner [ph] of the company and the way the customers want us to deliver the product. So that's why.
Srini Nandury: Srini Nandury, Summit Insights Group. Nikesh, recently VMware acquired Carbon Black and...
Nikesh Arora: Who?
Srini Nandury: VMware.
Nikesh Arora: Which Company?
Srini Nandury: Okay. VMware.
Nikesh Arora: Yeah, yeah. I know VMware very well.
Srini Nandury: Acquired Carbon Black.
Nikesh Arora: Yes, Carbon Black, yes.
Srini Nandury: Okay. So the question is this, we are trying to make sense of how the landscape is going to be evolving, It looks like VMware is going to be acquiring more companies in this space and what does this mean for the whole security landscape going forward?
Nikesh Arora: I can't comment on VMware strategy. There are lot of people who believe security is important, right? And they're all stepping up their acquisitions and security. And I think that's probably accurate. You will see a lot more acquisition in this space, because I don't think 2,500 vendors are going to survive. One of the questions early gentlemen asked was buying behavior. I firmly believe in the next five years, you will see more consolidated single vendor buys than you will see multi-vendor buys. 800 EBCs at Palo Alto Networks where customers show up and I haven't seen a customer who's actually espouses desire that he wants -- he or she wants multiple vendors to be able to secure their environment. They're looking for a solution which integrates across multiple solutions. So, if any company out there, whether it's VMware, or whether it's Microsoft, whether it's Broadcom can actually take products and integrate them. I think they're going to win. So, the question is not acquiring, we can all acquire companies. Acquisition is the easiest part. The question is, can you actually integrate them? Do you actually get leverage from integrating them into your platform? Acquiring a customer, putting them in an ELA and making them free or being part of your large, what is that, I hear that platform level. So there is a new term you will hear soon in the security space from ELAs to PLAs because people have disparate products security and consulting and chips and you could put them into a PLA now, it does not have to be an ELA anymore because it's more than an Es to P. But those are interesting parts. I think the true need of the customer is an integrated platform. So people can deliver integrated platform more part of them. Again, as Nir just articulated, you need firewalls and endpoint to be able to work together to be able to do next-generation security, similarly you need container serverless public cloud workloads to do it together. And I will tell you, the anecdotal and I apologize if it doesn't apply. When I worked at Google, one of the businesses we started to go after was display advertising, it has nothing to do with security. And Google had no horse in the race. They didn't want a display property. Microsoft had one, Yahoo had one. And they're both very good at selling their own display properties, but they were not good at cross market selling because typically they defaulted their own product. And my concern is when you start looking at cloud native players, like AWS or Azure or GCP or VMware with their own sort of hybrid solutions, you default to better integrations and better alignment with your core product and you don't do as good a job of across industry security solution, across industry products. So, our hope is we'll be the platform of choice across multiple platforms as opposed to platforms that integrate security and trying to bundle it when you buy their platform. So, if I don't want to deploy VMware, would I be deploying Carbon Black today? I would have. I may have. Tomorrow, I suspect the integration is going to be stronger. I'm not sure which strategy gets me more revenue, maybe gets me more revenue given the scale but I think the long-term outcome is that, you want a multi-platform solution, which is somewhat platform agnostic. So it can actually make it work better for you across multiple cloud platforms. All right. Last one or two questions. Wow, I want to make sure you guys don't leave here with questions and answers. Go ahead. Up front. I'm sure I read about it tomorrow or the next week, like why didn't they ask the question guys.
Nikesh Arora: We'll do that out in the field not here.
Nikesh Arora: So, I'll give you some data point and then I'll have our product leadership answer that. I went back and as part of preparing for the Analyst Day, I looked at the enterprise IT spend of the last seven years, right? Because it's typically the end-of-life for most IT infrastructure between seven to 10 depending on what it is and where you buy it. There is approximately $1 trillion, $1.2 trillion a year, that's been spent on enterprise IT. The reason I go to track that is because I think security is 3% to 8% of that number, right? In financial services, the government goes to 8% because they're very security conscious, others go to 3%. So if you think about it, there is approximately $12 trillion to $15 trillion of plant out there in enterprises, which is IT infrastructure plant. I just put a slide up there, which is a Gartner slide or Goldman Sachs slide, I don't remember those, Goldman Sachs, maybe it's from this morning, which talks about the cloud disruption opportunity of $1 trillion in 2023, right? So, either you're telling me that we're going to stop spending an enterprise IT and the IT entire is going to go down and all we're going to do is, we're spending in the cloud. Or are you telling me, people are still going to spend $1 trillion to it, growing at 3% and a lot of that is still going to go to enterprise IT. So, I suspect this transition is going to take longer than we think that people are still going to be spending enterprise IT. Now, not in the margin, it may be smaller number because people are shifting to the cloud and what it doing is two things, one, it's making people reevaluate as I'm going to make that shift to the cloud, what do I want to buy that allows me that transition, and that's why one of the large retail as we talked about, they're going to the cloud. They don't want to just buy hardware firewalls, they want to make sure they can get VM, so the cloud instances they can get a cloud-delivered architecture to Prisma Access. So the question is, we expect this transition to happen in the next five to seven years, a lot of it. Do you have products that satisfy the three use cases? So data center use case, the transition use case to the cloud and then the new architecture towards the cloud. So we think that's why the product strategy is aligned towards this transition. We think that shift is going to happen. It will happen on a customer-specific basis depending how ready they are. It will happen on a industry basis. So shows us on the moving parts, but we think firewalling is around for a while for the people who are still investing in data centers. But I'll let my product colleagues elaborate on the...
Lee Klarich: Sure. So from a product perspective, the firewalls get deployed in lots of different places, they get deployed in the datacenter, they get deployed at headquarter gateways, regional sites, branch offices, and the -- some of those use cases are more attractive to shift the form factor. So, for example, applications moving to public cloud, the form factor toward would be software for lots of different technical reasons that are mostly sort of straightforward to understand why you want to do that. For example, you can't shift a hardware device to Amazon and ask them to deploy into your AWS account. You have to use software form factors. As we talked about for branch offices, retail, mobile users, there is a shift that we are driving with Prisma Access that we believe is a very good shift, both in terms of the customer outcome, as well as what they need and want to be able to accomplish. But there is still -- as Nikesh was saying, this investment in the enterprise infrastructure over the last seven-plus years, there will continue to be a lot of investment in that infrastructure has to be protected. So, particularly in the larger central sites, regional sites and the world will be hybrid for a long time, meaning datacenters there will still be a lot of hardware that will need to be deployed against that. And one thing we didn't talk about today, but it is very important is, in a lot of those places that I just mentioned, the performance of hardware starts to become really important, right? If you think about a large headquarters with 10 gig connectivity growing, you want to do internal segmentation or do segment of IoT devices and things like that, which that would be 100 gig, some of the larger datacenters, hardware still has a very important role to play in a lot of those core use cases.
Nikesh Arora: All right. I think with that we'll call an end to the Q&A session. I want to say thank you to my management team here, who has been part of the journey and getting us here so far. I also want to use the opportunity to shout at our 7,000 employees around the world who worked hard to deliver the results that we are able to deliver and hopefully we'll keep working hard for the next three years to achieve the targets and beyond, to achieve the targets we've outlined. With that, it's my pleasure to invite you downstairs for some cocktails and some demos, instead -- in case you want to geek out in some of the products.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-05-29 16:30:00) =====

And with that, I will turn the call over to Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora: Thanks, David, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our fiscal third quarter 2019 results. I'm very excited to be here with you today. This call marks my fourth earnings call as CEO and brings me close to my 1 year anniversary with the company. We've accomplished a great deal this year, furthering our leadership in cybersecurity and also setting the foundation for our future growth. When I joined Palo Alto Networks, my primary impression was how cybersecurity was poised to increase in importance to organizations globally, and also how the cloud revolution was set to impact the industry. The key themes in my first call were integration, cloud and more automation. I am pleased to report that after nearly a year on the job, my confidence in these trends is stronger than ever. Moreover, I'm delighted that we have made progress across all these imperatives and will continue to do so. On today's call, I will briefly go through our financials and then provide an update on our 3 strategic focus areas, securing the enterprise, securing the cloud, which is where I will spend most of my time given our announcements in this area today; and finally, securing the future with Cortex. Starting with our financials. I'm pleased to report that as we continue our transformation, the team continues to deliver. We had yet another solid quarter. Fiscal Q3 revenues of $727 million represents year-over-year growth of 28%, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased by 26% to $1.31. Diving into the details of our three focus areas. Let's first talk about securing the enterprise. We continue to see success around the world with our next-generation firewall offerings. Network security remains a top priority for companies and c-servs, and we continue to outperform this aspect of the market. Our new products introduced last quarter are performing well, and we've had a number of significant wins this quarter. Here's a couple I'd like to highlight. We signed an 8 figure deal with a U.S. government agency. This is one of the 10 largest deals in the history of Palo Alto Networks, and contributed to our strength in product revenues this quarter. We expanded our footprint more than $5 million each with 10 existing customers, many of whom bought a combination of new use cases and also hardware refreshes. This includes deals with one of the best-known brands in the world, a Fortune 50 technology company and a Fortune 500 consumer finance company. And finally, we introduced DNS security service, a new attached subscription to our next-generation firewalls. DNS is already quickly gaining traction. And while it's early days to share metrics around this offering, I can safely say that if DNS were an independent start-up company, it would be getting a lot of attention. We're excited about its early success and optimistic for its future prospects. Our core business continues to be strong with customers becoming more security aware and looking for simplicity in their infrastructure. We continue to make it easier to deploy more services from our firewalls in the most secure way, and you should expect us to add more capability here. Now let's talk about securing the cloud. We continue to be highly focused on delivering technology that enables our customers in the cloud journey. We plan to enable this by delivering a comprehensive set of security capabilities across a broad set of clouds and cloud configurations. This focus and our speedboat approach has led to tremendous progress over the past year. With this, we are delighted to introduce Prisma. Prisma, announced this morning, brings our industry-leading cloud solutions within a single suite to help our customers in their cloud journey. Whether you want to connect your mobile users or branch offices to the cloud, protect your application and data in the public cloud, protect your SaaS applications, or are worried about upcoming trends in container security and service computing, Prisma has a solution. Prisma is our approach to deliver industry leading cloud security products in an integrated fashion. It will address SaaS, API-based, and inline cloud security across all vectors. We will continue to build on Prisma over the coming quarters and years to make it the industry leading platform for the journey to the cloud. We believe Prisma is already the number one suite of cloud security product in the world. This quarter, Prisma surpassed $0.25 billion billings run rate and has approximately 9,000 customers. The products that comprise Prisma are already industry-leading in their own right. Take the VM series, we believe we deliver the most VMs across the public cloud landscape, with more than 60 six figure or higher deals this last quarter alone. RedLock, which forms the basis of Prisma public cloud surpassed $100 million billings run rate this quarter. What is even more exciting is that we won more than 10 RedLock deals, each over $0.5 million, in the third quarter with over half of them in the Global 2000. This is a rare feat, to acquire a company, transform its revenue and its profile and trajectory in 6 months is unheard of. Additionally, we're very excited about the new enhancements for our GlobalProtect Cloud Service. The next version includes cloud onboarding and management interface, and will be available in the Google Cloud platform shortly. In this quarter, we continued our success on GPCS by securing 40,000 mobile users at the biggest car company in their category, 27,000 mobile users at a leading global consumer brand, and 25,000 mobile users at one of the largest high-tech companies in the world. The success of RedLock is a key factor in making us #1 in cloud security and gives us the confidence that our introduction of the Prisma suite will bolster our ability to keep winning in this space. In addition, today's announcement of our intent to acquire Twistlock, which is the best in its category for container security, will bring best-of-breed products into the Prisma suite. Containers are one of the fastest-growing segments of both private and public cloud workloads, and we're looking forward to offering container security to our customers. We also announced our intent to acquire PureSec, a leading provider of serverless security. These proposed acquisitions will further enhance our cloud security suite. Other examples of our ability to acquire companies and accelerate their performance is Demisto, which brings me to the third key focus area, securing the future with Cortex. We closed the acquisition of Demisto at the end of March, and in our first month operating together, I'm pleased to report that sales are already doing exceptionally well. Demisto's multi-vendor orchestration capability, analytics, and playbooks are unique. They help our customers further automate their security operations and allow them to focus on solving the most complex threat. This quarter was also notable for the introduction of Cortex XDR at the end of February. In its first quarter of availability, we closed over 50 deals, and the pipeline is strong. XDR is the successor of EDR. XDR enables teams to stop sophisticated attacks and adapt their defenses to prevent future threats by integrating network, endpoint and cloud data to reduce the signal to noise ratio plaguing security analysts. In fact, earlier today, MITRE released test results validating the capabilities of Traps and Cortex XDR. The result from MITRE's ATT&CK testing confirmed that Traps and Cortex XDR provides the broadest coverage against different attack techniques with the fewest missed attacks out of all 10 vendors recently evaluated. We also had some notable Cortex XDR wins this quarter, including a 7-figure deal with a U.S. health insurance care organization with over 26,000 employees; a win at a major Asia-based airline, and a win with one of the largest cities in the world. To wrap up, we had a solid quarter of enterprise execution with strong progress on the cloud and with the initial rollout of Cortex. We continue to see the opportunity to expand our market leadership to be one of the platforms for both today's security needs and to those tomorrow. As my first year comes to an end, I would like to make a few observations and reiterate a few things. One, we will continue to expand our leader - lead as the number one cybersecurity company in the world, one that provides simple, integrated, and leading products help our customers. The company I walked into had done a great job in building the world's best firewall and expanding their ability to secure the enterprise. Over the last year, in addition to strengthening our firewall business, we have made tremendous progress in areas, which will become equally, if not more important, the cloud and automation. My year here has convinced me that we have the right strategy and the right team, and we're making the right moves. Transitions take time. This one will also take time. But there is no team better prepared than us to make this happen. The new products and delivery mechanisms are more SaaS-based and have a different consumption model. In that, many cloud customers purchase annual subscriptions rather than multi-year deals. The brilliance of a SaaS model though is the annual recurring revenue stream. As we evolve our business, maximizing this recurring revenue stream will be our primary focus. While this may impact total billings, we would expect to see better margin performance. And most importantly, underlying this trend is a going demand for our products, which is what matters. Reading some of your notes, I know that you're watching the internal management moves we are making. You should know that any leadership moves that we're making are being made in a thoughtful manner and for the right reasons. Rest assured, while I might not have spent time in cybersecurity, I know how to build great teams. This is an area me and the team are extremely vigilant and focused on. I am confident that one year out, we are stronger, we are better focused, a more robust product roadmap, and our teams are poised to win. This is a time to believe in our plans and our ability to execute and our strategy to win the increasing addressable market in our industry and our quest to increase our lead as the number one enterprise security company in the world. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Kathy.
Kathleen Bonanno: Thank you, Nikesh. Before I start, I'd like to note that except for revenue and billings figures, all financial figures are non-GAAP, and growth rates are compared to the prior year period unless stated otherwise. All current and prior periods financials discussed are reflected under ASC 606 as we adopted the new standard as of August 1, 2018. In the third quarter, we continued to add new customers at a healthy clip and further expand our existing base. We did this while balancing investments in our recently acquired businesses and maintaining a focus on profitability. In Q3, total revenue grew 28% to a record $726.6 million. Looking at growth by geography. The Americas grew 28%, EMEA grew 26% and APAC grew 29%. Q3 product revenue of $278.4 million grew 28% compared to the prior year. Our SaaS-based subscription revenue of $258.8 million increased 35%. Support revenue of $189.4 million increased 20%. In total, subscription and support revenue of $448.2 million increased 28% and accounted for 62% share of total revenue. Turning to billings. Q3 total billings of $821.9 million increased 13%. Q3 current billings were $799.5 million net of acquired deferred revenue, up 25% year-over-year. The dollar weighted contract duration for new subscription and support billings in the quarter remains at approximately 3 years, but declined by 4 months year-over-year due to the strength of our cloud business and fewer multi-year deals. Total deferred revenue at the end of Q3 was $2.6 billion, an increase of 27%. In addition to robust new customer acquisition, we continue to increase our wallet share with existing customers. Our top 25 customers, all of which made a purchase this quarter, spent a minimum of $38.7 million in lifetime value in Q3, a 35% increase over the $28.7 million in Q3 of fiscal '18. Q3 gross margin was 76.5%, which was up 30 basis points compared to last year. Q3 operating margin was 20.9%, a decline of 50 basis points year-over-year and includes a headwind of approximately $7 million of net expense associated with our recent acquisitions. We ended the third quarter with 6,503 employees. On a GAAP basis for the third quarter, net loss declined by 50% to $20.2 million or $0.21 per basic and diluted share. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter grew 30% to $130.1 million or $1.31 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for Q3 was 22%. Turning to cash flows and balance sheet items. We finished April with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $3.7 billion. Q3 cash flow from operations of $296.4 million increased 23%. Free cash flow was $276.1 million, up 30% at a margin of 38%. Adjusting for cash charges associated with our headquarters in Santa Clara, free cash flow in the quarter was $279.8 million, up 27% at a margin of 38.5%. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $20.3 million. DSO was 51 days, a decline of 6 days during the prior year period. Turning now to guidance and modeling points. For fiscal Q4 '19, we expect revenue to be in the range of $795 million to $805 million, an increase of 21% to 22% year-over-year. We expect Q4 '19 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.41 to $1.42, which includes expenses related to the Demisto acquisition and the proposed acquisitions of Twistlock and PureSec using approximately 100 million to 102 million shares. Before I conclude, I'd like to provide some additional modeling points. We expect full year billings to grow approximately 21% year-over-year, which includes the impact of shorter contract lengths. Our Q4 non-GAAP EPS guidance includes approximately $15 million of net expense or $0.12 per share, attributable to a full quarter run rate of our Demisto acquisition and the proposed acquisitions of Twistlock and PureSec. Our Q4 EPS guidance also includes an expected $0.02 impact attributable to U.S. tariffs on Chinese origin goods. Excluding these acquisition and tariff expenses, we would expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.56. We expect our Q4 non-GAAP effective tax rate to remain at 22%. CapEx in Q4 will be approximately $35 million to $40 million with approximately $20 million related to our headquarters in Santa Clara. Finally, turning to free cash flow. For the full year, we continue to expect an adjusted free cash flow margin of approximately 36%. The adjustments include onetime items such as the expected settlement of our 2019 convertible debt and cash flow associated with the additional investment in our headquarters in Santa Clara. You can review these adjustments to free cash flow in our supplemental financial information document, which is posted on our Investor Relations website. With that, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator, please poll for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.
Keith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. And really solid quarter. Nikesh, I think you might be understating sort of operating well through transition with 27% product revenue growth against a really tough comp. That's a truly impressive number. I wanted to ask you one question and one to Kathy. The question for you is on the M&A strategy. One of the things I think investors have been looking for, for a while is somebody who could effectively consolidate demand within security. It sounds like the individual companies are doing - or individual solutions that you bought, like RedLock, are doing really well. Could you talk to us about the progress that you've made in sort of creating a suite or getting people to buy across the portfolio, and where the new acquisitions kind of fit into that suite and sort of how you expect to sort of catalyze that activity across the board? And then, for Kathy, in terms of the shorter duration, can you give us some kind of indications on sort of where that impacted? Was it across the board for both sort of new subscriptions as well as maintenance or is that just focused on kind of just the newer stuff?
Nikesh Arora: Thank you, Keith. Thank you for your comment, and thank you for the question. Let me start talking - answering your question around the acquisitions and the launch of Prisma today. As you know, about a year ago we started talking about how there is going to be a big move to the cloud, and we were getting ready for it. We owned Evident, Evident only worked in AWS. We felt we needed to complement that with more capabilities, so we acquired RedLock. RedLock had de minimis revenue 6 months ago. And just the sheer success of RedLock that we've seen the last 6 months where we've seen customers close deals within a week, I think that's unheard of in the cybersecurity space. You walk in. You show the customer a solution, and a week later you walk out with a purchase order. So that's emboldened us with this notion that there's not enough cloud security solutions being offered to customers who are making this journey to the cloud. And if you look at the customers 2 years ago, they were talking about public cloud. Today, they're talking about containers. And if you looked in the market, there are only 2 players, and Twistlock was by far the leader. And talking to customers, they still want to buy best of breed. So, our team made the decision that it's important for us to acquire Twistlock and integrate that with RedLock as soon as possible. So you will see us integrating both RedLock and Twistlock. And then, the next conversation people want to talk about is serverless, and we looked at the market, and PureSec, by far, is the leader in serverless computing. Serverless security have decided to acquire it at the same time. We intend to integrate this as soon as possible thereby offering a fully sort of integrated public cloud security suite where customers don't have to buy piece products on containers or private cloud, public cloud, on-prem, SaaS, or serverless. And that's where we see the consolidation from a cloud security perspective. We've also integrated pieces of [indiscernible] for a cloud service with Aperture so you can see in-line SaaS security as opposed just API, which Aperture offers. So we are driving hard and fast to try and keep trading integrations so customers don't have to buy a piece product and spend time integrating. The problem with the cybersecurity industry has been, for a $140 billion industry, with $80 billion in services and $60 billion in products. That $80 billion is spent integrating the $60 billion product, and we want to make sure that we don't make this mistake going into cloud and that's kind of what underpins our acquisition strategy as it relates to consolidating these products and as it relates to providing a platform for cloud security. Kathy?
Kathleen Bonanno: Yeah. And Keith, on the contract length question. As you mentioned, we did see a decline in contract length -- or as we mentioned, of 4 months year-over-year. And there are a couple of things driving that. One is that we had very strong performance in our cloud products. The mix of our Prisma public cloud this quarter was very strong. We saw terrific growth as Nikesh mentioned in his prepared remarks. So we're really excited about the trajectory of that business and the opportunity for us there. Additionally, we are focusing more on doing - making sure that we have good annual recurring revenue in our contracts, and that's our primary focus this year. And so some of it is customer preference. Some of it is us trying to structure deals to maximize that annual recurring revenue stream. And so both of those, the combination of those things are driving the average contract length down, and we think both of those things are really terrific for our business, and we're very pleased with the results.
Operator: We'll go next to Gur Talpaz with Stifel.
Gur Talpaz: Great, thanks for taking my question. I have a question here on Twistlock. And Nikesh, I was hoping you could expand a bit on the strategy. So what I want to understand is, do you view container ecosystems as a natural extension of existing networking environments, i.e., do you see this is as kind of a natural fit alongside what you already did from a policy management standpoint? And then taking it one step further, can you talk about how you plan to attack the DevSecOps environments where Twistlock currently plays?
Nikesh Arora: So Gur, I have always known that I should try and give only two, three sentence answer to your question, and then Lee jump in because I know you're going to throw it to me technically, otherwise. But I will tell you that the cloud world is different. In the cloud world, you have to shift left. We have to go DevSecOps and that's where Twistlock plays because it goes to the entire bill, run and deploy process. And that's why I think Twistlock is important. That’s why we think DevSecOps is important. Twistlock has an on-prem solution. RedLock has a SaaS solution. You can logically expect us to be present in both environments, because this allows us to look at both public cloud and private cloud. How am I doing so far, Gur? So far, so good?
Gur Talpaz: You're doing great. Yes. So far, so good.
Nikesh Arora: Now I'm going to take the high ground and hand it over to Lee.
Lee Klarich: I appreciate that. I think maybe the way to think about this is, with cloud applications, they're increasingly being architected with multiple different sort of cloud services underpinning them. And whether that's PaaS services, Infrastructure-as-a-Service, VMs, increasingly containers are a foundational component of these architectures. Serverless is emerging as one of the key elements. And being able to combine all of those together into a single cloud security suite integrated together that allows the customer to see from the shift left at the bill stage all the way to run time, the entirety of their application, how it's designed, architected and secured, is a very powerful capability that we're able to bring together with Twistlock as a core component of that, but also PureSec for serverless and, of course, RedLock from a cloud platform perspective.
Gur Talpaz: That's super helpful Lee. I appreciate it. Nice job Nikesh. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Walter Pritchard with Citi.
Walter Pritchard: Hi, thanks. Just a question for you, Nikesh. On the product side, I guess one concern that may arise here. You've done a lot of M&A, it feels like your cloud strategy is largely inorganic. How do you remain convinced and seat-building the culture of building products organically to either - should I keep these products going into the future? Or be able to address some of the new needs that come up down the road without having to spend this kind of money on M&A?
Nikesh Arora: I think, Walter, that's a fair question. But if you look at our core business of firewalls, we're doing really, really good in firewalls. Our teams are innovating. We had a DNS security as-a-service, as a subscription. We are working on some more interesting things. Hopefully, we shall be able to share more about them in upcoming quarters. But there is innovation going on for sure in our core business where our firewall capabilities and other capabilities around it are developing. That's where we have strength. We have hundreds of engineers, if not thousands, working on our core networking capability and firewall security capability. We also had bills capability around endpoint with Traps and Secdo, which as I mentioned, we are rated best in the number of unmissed attack vectors as far as MITRE's test was concerned. So clearly, we have that core capability. Cloud was an area where all of you are asking the question, how will Palo Alto networks make the transition to cloud? Do we have the core capability. I think it's fair to say we have used the RedLock contingent and the evident team to create the core for the cloud, but at the same time, we didn't want to wait. With Twistlock having ordered 250 customers who are using them for container security, we didn't want to wait. We also, at the same time, launching a vulnerability scanning capability in RedLock, which is the early steps towards containers. But our customers want the entire thing. They want the full capability for container security. They want best-of-breed. So it became incumbent and imperative that we create this combination of RedLock and Twistlock. And honestly, if you go back and think, the price we paid for RedLock versus the fact that it crossed $100 million run rate this quarter means we must have done a good deal because in two quarters, we're able to take that product and deploy it to our -- across our entire sales force. Yes, we have cloud capability. We have it in our sales force. We have it in our RedLock team. We have it in our Twistlock team. We should be able to put the RedLock, and Twistlock, and PureSec capability together, and use our core team and our cloud sales teams to be able to go and create more revenue in this product. Because I think right now, there is a TAM of over $2 billion in cloud security, which is unserved. There are not enough products. There are not enough salespeople going out and demonstrating the product of to those customers. So right now, it's really a question of sort of a land grab, going out there and demonstrating the product to the customer, being able to deploy in their enterprise, and being able to have people who understand these products well enough to be able to solve them.
Walter Pritchard: Great. And then, Kathy, maybe a follow-up just on the duration side. Is it as simple as sort of us thinking about the unattached products are going to kind of go to a 1 year duration over time versus the subscriptions that are attached to the firewalls are going to be 3 year? And as we kind of model out this to revenue streams, we would see the duration go as that mix goes?
Kathleen Bonanno: Yeah. Walter, I think you're correct that over time, as our business becomes more cloud-based and more SaaS subscription-based, we will see our customers wanting to buy the way they buy other SaaS products, and that tends to be more towards the 1 year duration. So over time, I do think that, that shift will happen. In this quarter, though, and this year, we've also been very focused on the rest of the business and just making sure that we're doing deals that preserve that annual recurring revenue stream, and Nikesh is raising his hand. He wants to jump in.
Nikesh Arora: I'm going to jump in, Walter. I think, look, I know you guys are all getting excited about the billings number. And trust me, we stated it left, right and center to make sure that we were not missing anything in the billings number. I will tell you the underlying fundamentals of our business continue to be strong. We like the customer interest, we like the fact that they want to buy more security services from us. The two effects that are happening, one is clearly the unattached product effect, which is we're seeing better-than-expected growth and you're seeing shorter duration that those. And then, second is, to be honest, we are trying to do more new business and less business of going to our existing customers and doing multi-year bundle deals with large discounts. We've told the sales force that we like them to go out and get new business. As a consequence, we're not doing that many - as many, not that many, as many long deals with large discounts that we used to do in the past. And I think I said that I can't be more explicit than saying, we expect, over time, that our margins should do better as a consequence of that. And it will have an impact in the way you look at -- as the way billings mechanically calculate themselves.
Operator: And we'll go next to Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.
Sterling Auty: Boy, I had a different question lined up, but after that answer, it really begs the question if everything does start to triangulate towards more of an annual contract versus a 3 year deal, shouldn't that just weigh on your cash flow growth until you succeed in kind of transitioning through that process?
Nikesh Arora: Look, if everything happened overnight, yes. I think there's going to be an orderly transition over time as the proportion of our non-attached business rises and as we continue to manage our long-term core business. So yes, will our cash flow profile change? Yes. Will it improve our margins? Yes. And that's how you transition from a business, which has been a very hardware-focused business, to a business that becomes a long-term subscription and SaaS-oriented business.
Kathleen Bonanno: But I'll just add that the reason we're focused on doing this is because that we believe it's ultimately better for us in the long run financially and will improve our cash flows.
Nikesh Arora: Sterling, every analyst I talked to in the last month - 9 months, has asked me this question saying, when will Palo Alto Networks become a ratable business? When will you become a SaaS business so you can enjoy the multiples that does SaaS businesses enjoy? Well SaaS businesses enjoy a multiple and have a certain financial profile. So you can't have your cake and eat it too. You want me to transition to that, it's going to involve a transition.
Sterling Auty: That's fair enough. One follow-up in terms of the business in the quarter. Looking at that support revenue growth, one question that pops to mind is, how was the linearity in the quarter? And was things just more back-end loaded and perhaps that caused a lower support revenue just on the timing and some of the product revenue that you were able to close?
Kathleen Bonanno: Well, support revenue growth, 20%, was pretty strong year-over-year. And one thing to just keep in mind about support is, well, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. One, it includes professional services, which can vary from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter. And then the other thing is that as we continue to grow our subscription business, which we've got a lot of our billings now coming from non-attached and revenue now coming from non-attached, those don't have the same concept of support attached to those offerings. So that's just another thing to keep in mind when you consider support.
Operator: And we'll go next to Ken Talanian from Evercore ISI.
Ken Talanian: Hi, thanks for taking the question. So we are happy to see you move to a more ratable business, but how should we think about the pace at which you move to more ratable sales over the next year or so, given the additional non-attached subscriptions you're getting from these acquisitions? And like how soon may we see subscription surpass 50% of your billings?
Nikesh Arora: Well, Ken, we're not going to give you forward guidance on those topics. But all I will tell you is you can see the way our cloud security business is beginning to perform. I think we said Prisma has already gone over a $250 million run rate billings run rate this quarter. And it's growing at very, very robust growth rates, way ahead of the company growth rate, as you can imagine. We hope that those growth rates continue, which overtime will create the mix shift that is required to make a higher proportion of our business more and more ratable, which will have the impact of shorter duration in terms of impacting billing, which will have the cash flow profile changes associated with it. But I don't expect this to happen in the short order. I think this is going to take us a reasonable amount of time. But hopefully, that time that we take happens at the growth rate that we're enjoying overall as a company. And clearly, if you're growing roughly 2.5 times the rate of the growth of the industry, you must be taking share from other people in this process.
Ken Talanian: Understood. And have you made any changes to the pricing, packaging, or the go-to-market for the cloud-focused products with the launch of the Prisma branding?
Nikesh Arora: Yes. Look, as I mentioned, we had, very early in this process, introduced this notion of speedboats. And the notion of speedboats was to have dedicated people across the organization and across functional basis to make sure that we have people focused on making our customer successful by having a dedicated customer success team, by having specialists who can go ahead and sell cloud and partner with our core sales team and accounts to make sure that the focus is not lost on our non-SaaS services, which is what has been paying dividends. We continue on that track. We have dedicated teams. We have now consolidated our GPCS and public cloud speedboats into the Prisma speedboat. We've learned from the last year that Prisma, as the customers who are going to make this journey to the cloud are looking at all these products as a combined suite of products. So we are driving the same degree of acceleration that we have on the public cloud speedboat on the rest of our Prisma products, and put them all into one speedboat, which is led by the same people who were at the public cloud speedboat. So yes, we have made changes on go-to-market side and from a focus perspective, because we don't want the smaller, faster, growing business to get lost in the large expense of our core business.
Ken Talanian: Understood. Thanks very much.
Operator: And we'll go next to Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray.
Andrew Nowinski: Great. Thank you for taking the question. So maybe from a geographic perspective, I know you made some sales leadership changes in the US, yet your growth in the US remained relatively unchanged. However, growth in EMEA did slow. So just wondering if you can provide any more color on the slowdown in EMEA as well as any changes the new sales leadership team in North America has made.
Nikesh Arora: Look, I think I was trying to figure out where the correlation you're going to draw was. We've made a change there, and nothing changed. We didn't make a change there, and things got worse. So I'm not sure what the implication is. Look, Europe had a seasonal third quarter like third quarters across the board seem to be challenged. There was a seasonal slowdown, vis-a-vis, EMEA. We -- the team there feels confident that they will continue marching towards their annual targets. So hopefully, they will make up for what they were not able to do this quarter in the upcoming quarter. In terms of the U.S., we have hired a lot more people in the last quarter, which we expect to ramp up in Q4 and next year because part of the opportunity we had was we felt that we were not knocking enough doors. And as I mentioned, the focus on more new business. The team is strong. The team is motivated. We don't think that the leadership change in the Americas has had much of an impact in terms of the performance of the team, except for the fact that they continue to be excited and motivated to keep delivering quarters.
Andrew Nowinski: I think - I guess I was just asking the changes you made obviously had a fairly positive effect in the U.S. I'm wondering is there any changes needed in EMEA? Or is there any abnormality in EMEA to their growth sector link?
Nikesh Arora: I hope our Head of Europe is listening to this call.
Kathleen Bonanno: No. Wow.
Nikesh Arora: We intend to make no changes in Europe. He's strong. He's going to make sure he delivers this quarter and retain his growth rate in the upcoming quarters.
Operator: We'll go next to Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.
Karl Keirstead: Thank you. I've got two questions for Kathy. Kathy, if billings, as Nikesh was just describing, might be a less useful measure of the fundamental health of Palo Alto Networks, do you think that your backlog or RPO number might have more value? And would you mind disclosing it? I think you disclosed it in your last couple of Qs.
Kathleen Bonanno: Yes. It's not a massive number for us, and it will be disclosed in our Q again this quarter. And you can do the math on the difference between deferred revenue and that number. The number that we provided on the earnings call is the current billings number, which grew nicely at 25% year-over-year. And that's a metric that I think most analysts have been monitoring for a number of years and have been asking us about over the years. And so I think that continuing to focus on that number is important, along with our revenue growth, obviously.
Karl Keirstead: Got it. Okay. Great. And then, just as a second question, Kathy. Just on the adjusted free cash flow margin guidance of 36% for the full year. I think through the first 9 months of this fiscal year, that adjusted free cash flow margin would average out to be close to 39%. So to end up at 36% for the full year, you would need your fourth quarter free cash flow margin to dip quite a bit, maybe even to below 30%. And I'm just wondering if you could touch on why that would be? Thanks.
Kathleen Bonanno: Yes. We did talk about the adjustments that we're making in the quarter. So the adjustments will be particular to the Q4 number. But additionally, we tend to have more expense in that quarter, more commissions expense in that quarter. And so we're comfortable with the full year guidance of 36%.
Operator: And we'll go next to Rob Owens with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Rob Owens: Great. And thanks for taking my question. If you look at the strength that you saw in product revenue yet again, can you kind of paint what the landscape looks like? I mean Q1 in general was a little weaker for most security vendors, and you continue to put up impressive results on the product side. So just curious in terms of sales cycles, what the demand landscape looks like, and also what kind of levels you're seeing of discounting out there? Thanks.
Kathleen Bonanno: Yeah. So we did see a really strong product growth number, and we're obviously very thrilled with that. The new products that we have introduced over time remain very competitive in the market. And our sales teams, as we mentioned, are doing a good job selling those products. We're seeing some improvement, as Nikesh said, in terms of sales cycles for the cloud products that we're selling. There seems to be a lot of demand for that, and it doesn't take a lot of convincing. But overall, I wouldn't say that there's been significant change in terms of our sales cycle for selling the vast majority of the products that we sell.
Rob Owens: Great, thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Saket Kalia with Barclays Capital.
Saket Kalia: Great, thanks for taking my questions here. Kathy, maybe for you on the product revenue number. We touched on some customer examples of refresh. And I think it's very clear that you're optimizing kind of the attached subscription. But can you just talk a little bit about the health of firewall refresh more broadly in the quarter, and how you're sort of thinking about that trend going forward?
Kathleen Bonanno: Yes. Well, when people talk about refresh, they tend to talk about it in 2 different ways. So I'll just talk about both. One is the just general market refresh, and that is going on all of the time, right? That's how we get most of our new firewall customers if somebody is refreshing their - on a firewall refresh, and they are replacing old firewalls with new firewalls. And that's how we go in and take market share and continue to land-and-expand, right? The other refresh that people talk about is our own internal refresh. So our own customers having sort of reached a 5, 7 year life as their firewalls, and they are replacing those firewalls. And that is a question that we get asked a lot about is that driving our growth in the quarter And certainly, it contributes every quarter, but as we've said for a number of quarters, we think that, that opportunity is more in front of us than behind us because the number of cohorts - the cohort sizes just get larger and larger over time. And we have a portion of refresh in our numbers in this quarter, a portion in last quarter, but it's not the primary driver of our growth. Yet we still are very focused on that opportunity. We think it's a great opportunity for us in the future. And we don't -- we're very encouraged and are focused on getting that refresh opportunity, both the general market refresh opportunity as we continue to take share and our own internal refresh opportunity.
Saket Kalia: Got it. Got it. Maybe a follow-up for you, Nikesh. I know in the beginning of the quarter, in early February, there were some changes in the channel program. I think some sort of adjustments or different models for RedLock and different models for partners that sort of sell the broader portfolio. Can you just talk a little bit about how, if at all, those sort of impacted in the quarter? And what's been the feedback from the channel as you wrapped up this April quarter?
Nikesh Arora: Look, I think we evaluated various possibilities of the channel, which is where there was a bit of noise, not this quarter, but it's the prior quarter. And where we landed is a happy place both to the channel and for us. If you understand these cloud products, these SaaS products actually end up having to be sold not just to our current channels but also through our future channels, which is basically the marketplaces of AWS, Azure and GCP because when customers go deploy public cloud capabilities. They go to the marketplaces off the public cloud providers to find other tools and accessories and products. And we have to be present there, which requires a different model from an activation and deployment and sales perspective. So we enabled that. We made room for our channel to be able to refer customers to that marketplace. As a result, they continued to get their economics and referral way as opposed to the way they've been used to be in the past, which is more hardware process. And I think things are stable, things are happy. We're selling product. The channel's making money. And customers are able to buy it, whichever way they want to consume it.
Operator: And we'll go next to Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.
Phil Winslow: Hey, guys thank for taking my question. Congrats on a strong start to the year, particularly on the product - sorry, particularly on the product side. Just wanted to focus on Cortex. We've spent a lot of time on product and Prisma, but wondering if you could give us an update on Cortex, particularly if you look at the Cortex hub, how you're feeling about the progression there of applications. And then also just usage and call it hydration of the data lake?
Nikesh Arora: Well, as I mentioned, look, right now, there are two very clear parts of Cortex. One is the Cortex XDR combination, which requires the data lake, which includes Traps as we -- last quarter we announced that we're going to make Traps an integral part of our XDR offering. We felt this, but it got validated this morning, coincidentally. We believe XDR is now the leading product in the market, and it beats any EDR product hands-down. So many of those you know have been displacing the traditional legacy vendors in the market, we believe we have not just a competitive product, but a better product. And we're seeing that in the pipeline growth, we're seeing that in the deals that we've done. We've done over 50 deals for our Cortex XDR in about 6 weeks since we announced it and deployed it in the market. We have a very healthy pipeline going to Q4. We are applying a speedboat concept to Cortex XDR, just so we did - the way we did to public cloud and Prisma. So we have lots of hopes from Cortex XDR and every Cortex XDR deal, every deal to deploy Traps requires the Cortex data lake, and the Cortex data lake is being deployed in those cases. In addition to that, Demisto is part of Cortex now because customers look at automation from a SOAR perspective, even though we only had Demisto in our numbers for only about a month this past quarter, it has surpassed any business plan they had prepared at their own end. Just by sheer fact that our core team is really excited about Demisto, and every one of our customers got excited about Demisto. And we expect that trend to continue going into Q4. So generally, on Cortex, we are bullish, both from a Cortex XDR, data lake, Cortex hub perspective as well as the Demisto perspective. Many of the Prisma integrated capabilities that we are launching this quarter actually use the Cortex hub to create the integrations between some of our products, whether it's VM and Aperture or some of the integrated reporting.
Phil Winslow: Great, thanks guys.
Operator: And we will go next to Michael Turits with Raymond James.
Michael Turits: Hey guys, good evening. Obviously, everything looks really strong from a top line revenue current billings product. But as we look into next year, what should we think of first on the EBIT margin side, since I would assume that we have a lot of dilution coming from these acquisitions? And then, what should we think of as the trajectory for cash flow margins declining before they begin to bottom?
Kathleen Bonanno: Well, look, we'll provide guidance at that point when we're ready to do so. We've provided guidance for the full year, which takes into account the contract length issue that we discussed earlier. So we're not ready to provide long-term guidance on either one of those metrics. But on the operating margin, you can see, this year, we've been operating within the framework. We've improved margins despite the fact that, well, on an organic basis, which is what our framework has been about. And so we're very focused on continuing to ensure that we're working towards bottom line profitability, at the same time, that we're focused on growing the top line. And I wouldn't expect that to change.
Michael Turits: And then, Nikesh, I wanted to ask about GlobalProtect Cloud Services, and to be fairly specific about it, competition with Zscaler. How do you see that competition? And do you feel that with them potentially moving to certain firewall applications, it's necessary, perhaps, for you to do more in the proxy area in order to make sure you're competing on an even basis?
Nikesh Arora: I'm going to defer this question to my friend, Lee, even though I'm sure I can butcher the answer, but I'd rather let him do it.
Lee Klarich: Yes. We - look, we've been very consistent, we talked about GlobalProtect Cloud Service, which is now Prisma Access. We believe that, fundamentally, you need to be able to secure all applications. And the way to do that is with a next-gen firewall foundation in the service, which is something that, clearly, we have a unique and distinct advantage of and is fundamental to how Prisma Access is architected and how it works. As we mentioned in the launch announcement today with Prisma, there are a couple of key enhancements coming to Prisma Access. Number one is we are going to be supporting GCP as a public cloud foundation in the near future. That will extend Prisma Access out to 100-plus locations around the world. So from a pure network latency performance perspective, we believe we'll be the best at the performance side of service. And second, we announced that we will soon have a cloud management service to go along with it, such that for customers who want the entire service to be done through the cloud, we'll be able to support that from onboarding, to configuration management to monitoring.
Michael Turits: Okay. Thanks everybody.
Operator: And we'll go next to John DiFucci with Jefferies.
John DiFucci: Thank you. My questions have largely been answered. I just had a follow-up for Kathy. Kathy, really appreciate your guidance that focus on current billings, which makes total sense to us and not to really worry about RPO a lot. Just trying to get ahead of any differences we might see going ahead. It seems to me that we might see a little more volatility in current billings because previously, long-term deferred revenue would have sort of smoothly flowed into current billings every quarter, whereas that might now be a little more lumpy upon annual renewals. And I don't want to get too cute about all this, but the current billings trend should remain the same as they would have been maybe just a little more lumpy and sort of smooths out over time, as more sales are billed annually. Does that at all make sense?
Kathleen Bonanno: Yeah. I think that, that makes sense. The changes in mix are happening gradually over time. We did see really great strength in our cloud products this quarter, which was a great thing for us, obviously. And so we're continue to expect strength there, and we've guided assuming that strength. But for the rest of it, I think you're absolutely right that it's not going to be an overnight transition. It'll happen gradually over time.
John DiFucci: Great, okay. Thank you very much.
Kathleen Bonanno: Yeah.
Operator: And we'll go next to Fatima Boolani with UBS.
Fatima Boolani: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Nikesh, I had a question for you regarding Prisma. It makes a ton of sense to amalgamate your four pillars on the cloud, the security front. But given each solution within the Prisma portfolio has different pricing models and potentially go-to-market models, I'm wondering if you can clarify if Prisma purchased a sort of an all or nothing. And to the extent that's sort of an all deal, how are you going about pricing the offering given the diversity of revenue models within that portfolio? And then I have a follow-up for Kathy.
Nikesh Arora: Thanks for the question, Fatima. Look, you're right that the cloud journey has different aspects, and there have been individual products that customers have gone and bought to enable different parts of the journey whether it's the GPCS competitors when it goes towards remote branches and new offices or whether it's the public cloud scenario or whether it's your CASB scenario. And part of our thesis is that you shouldn't have to have multiple products because there are interdependencies between these products, which creates security for yourself. Whilst we haven't alighted on the exact pricing because we're still - we just announced the acquisition of Twistlock and PureSec this morning, you can expect us to not distinguish in terms of how customers deploy their application, whether it's private cloud, public cloud, containers, serverless, public cloud because we think that there should be consistency, and it should be purely based on the amount of volume you transfer to the cloud as opposed to the different ways you do it. So you should expect to see some cohesity in pricing. Having said that, given the realities of the market, we will still make our products available in their individual forms to compete directly with people in the market because we believe our products are very competitive and better in most - in all cases. But obviously, the integrated product will have a lot more benefits than just buying the individual piece for us.
Fatima Boolani: Fair enough. And Kathy, for you, just two financial ones. We have an understanding of the OpEx impact from the recent acquisitions, but I'm wondering if you can speak to the totality of the revenue in billings contribution from recent acquisitions as well as the above seasonal jump in the sales and marketing expense this quarter. And that's it for me? Thank you.
Kathleen Bonanno: Yeah. We do have, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, increase in our expense associated with the acquisition and our guidance for EPS, and our guidance for revenue reflects both top line and bottom line impacts of those, although we haven't called them out explicitly. On the - sorry, what was the second part of your question?
Fatima Boolani: Higher than seasonal sales and marketing jump in the quarter…
Kathleen Bonanno: Yeah. Our sales and marketing teams, as Nikesh mentioned, I don't really think that it reflects any sort of big change in the business that we have been hiring sales in Americas in particular to drive more coverage. And so it takes a while for those expenses to actually result in top line revenue in particular, right? So as we see those reps ramp and as we cover the math and get more -- get that Americas number up even higher, hopefully, we'll see that change over time, again.
Fatima Boolani: Great, thank you.
Kathleen Bonanno: Yeah.
Operator: And our final question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.
Matt Hedberg: Hi, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. One for Nikesh. Your firewall momentum and results remained strong, clearly, versus peers. But as you continue to expand your cloud-based product portfolio, can you talk about some of the steps you're taking to over - to avoid over rotating sort of the general sales motion from that core firewall base?
Nikesh Arora: I'm sorry. Can you clarify what do you mean by over rotating away or...
Matt Hedberg: Well, yes, I guess, you've got a lot of exciting products on the cloud side. And I know there's a lot of overlay themes. But are there things that you can do to sort of maintain the momentum in core firewall despite sort of all the new shiny toys that I'm sure a lot of customers are probably yearning for?
Nikesh Arora: Look, whilst we're not going to disclose, but we added a lot of quota-carrying reps in the last quarter, purely for us to be able to drive more coverage and more, more -- cover more accounts in our core business. This is not for cloud. This is not for Prisma. This not for Cortex. This is to drive more coverage across our existing core business. As I think - I don't remember who said it, but one of you guys said that you have seen us show strong product growth across every quarter, 28% product growth this quarter. So clearly, we're not taking our eye off the ball. We understand what pays the bills. We understand where the money comes from. And we are seeing traction out in the market. It's not like people are not buying firewalls. The rumors of the firewalls being dead are overstated. So we think that is still continuing - still a continuing strong trend on the firewall. We continue to hire reps. We continue to try and penetrate more accounts from a firewall perspective. We also are working, as you know, to add more capability in our firewalls. So the average price per firewall goes up for us, for our customer, because they can do more things in the firewall not just less. So we understand that to maintain the growth rates we have in the industry, it's not going to happen just by adding more product and growing them rapidly. It requires us to maintain a solid growth rate in our core business, and we are focused on that.
Matt Hedberg: That's super helpful. And then maybe just one last one on XDR in particular. 50 deals in the quarter is great. Can you talk about where those deals are coming from? I assume a lot of them are maybe some of the legacy players. But are you able -- also able to take share from some of the next-gen EDR vendors?
Nikesh Arora: Look, what's happening is that customers understand -- the one good thing what has happened is that the EDR vendors have paved the way in the minds of the customers that endpoints need an evolution, and the evolution needs to come in the form of not just endpoint protection, but being able to do behavior analytics, non-signature-based capability at the endpoint itself in being able to process stuff in the cloud and being able to triage alarms between endpoints and network. So this is all about reducing the signal to noise ratio that comes out into your slot. And XDR takes it one level up and says, if you are bought into this vision of reducing the signal noise ration from an endpoint perspective, guess what, the next revolution has to being able to triage across your firewall [Technical Difficulty] Now the EDR vendors are paving the way for us in terms of opening the door and saying, hey, please, come on in Palo Alto Networks. Tell them about the virtues of not just EDR, but also how EDR networks work together. We have thousands of Traps customers. They are natural candidates for us to go to and say, look, you're already Traps customers. You're already firewall customers. You should be deploying XDR capability, which will make the life of your softs easier. I think we announced - we integrated our Cortex XDR APIs into Demisto very well this quarter. So even that is happening. So we are beginning to integrate more and more. So yes, we are -- the door is opening for us vis-à-vis existing EDR vendors, and you can expect us to put more acceleration and more focus in trying to compete with them in hand-to-hand combat.
Operator: At this time, I would like to hand the call back over to Nikesh Arora for any additional or closing comments.
Nikesh Arora: Well, all I want to do is say thank you very much for your time this afternoon. As a reminder, we will be hosting over 4,000 customers and partners next week at Ignite this year in Austin, Texas. I look forward to meeting more of you in the months ahead. I also want to give a shout-out to all of our employees who work really hard this quarter and say thank you for all your hard work. And let's keep going, we have Q4 to do. Thanks, everyone.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-02-26 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Palo Alto Network's Fiscal Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Jeff True. Please go ahead, sir.
Jeffrey True: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Palo Alto Networks' Fiscal Second Quarter 2019 Financial Results. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed on the Investors section of our website at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. With me on today's call are Nikesh Arora, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Kathy Bonanno, our Chief Financial Officer; and Lee Klarich, our Chief Product Officer. This afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our results for the fiscal second quarter ended January 31, 2019. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online on our website. We would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our financial guidance and modeling points for the fiscal third quarter and full fiscal year 2019; our competitive position and the demand and market opportunity for our products and subscriptions, benefits and timing of new products and subscription offerings; our ability to drive outsized growth rates; and trends in certain financial results, operating metrics, mixed shift and seasonality. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Some of which are beyond our control, and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future and we undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. For a more detailed description of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 30, 2018, and our earnings release posted a few minutes ago on our website and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. For historical periods, we have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in the supplemental financial information that can be found in the Investors Section of our website located at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. We would also like to inform you that we will be presenting at the Morgan Stanley Technology Media and Telecom Conference in San Francisco on Wednesday, February 27. And finally, once we have completed our formal remarks, we will be posting them to our Investor Relations website under Quarterly Results. And with that, I will turn the call over to Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you, Jeff, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon for our fiscal second quarter 2019 results. I'll go briefly through our financials, give you a progress update on our three focus areas of securing the enterprise, securing the cloud and securing through our Application Framework. And finally, I'll provide a little more color on the Demisto acquisition. Starting with our financials. I'm pleased to report that the team has delivered another outstanding quarter. Fiscal Q2 revenues of $711 million represents year-over-year growth of 30% and non-GAAP earnings per share increased by 44% to $0.151 - sorry, $1.51. There have been a number of big wins this quarter. There are a few I'd like to highlight. We continue to see success around the world in our next-generation firewall business. People are getting more security conscious, and want to deploy our firewall with the attached subscription. To note, during the quarter, we did a large deal with a data center in Europe at one of Europe's most prestigious car manufacturers, and had a significant expansion our hardware footprint, one of the largest online gaming companies in the world, as well as in one of the largest retailers in the world. We are beginning to see fruits of our speedboat strategy with our increased focus on GlobalProtect cloud services, we've had a few spectacular wins, one to secure 25,000 mobile users at a global financial services company and another to secure 80,000 mobile users for one of France's largest state-owned public services. We also won a very large VM-Series deal with several subsidiaries of one the largest broadcasting companies in the United States, and we won a deal to secure 47,000 endpoints at one of the largest university health care systems in the United States as well. Expanding more on our three strategy focus areas. First, let me talk about securing the enterprise. Over the last 11 plus years, we transformed the network security market with our next-generation firewall. We use the firewall as a platform to deliver tightly integrated security services. We've had great success with our attached subscriptions, the most successful ones having attach rates of about 90%. Earlier this month, we announced the release of PAN-OS version 9.0, which added over 60 new features, including the policy optimizer, which helps teams replace legacy rules with intuitive policies to provide better security and are easier to manage. I'm excited about our new DNS security subscription. This is our first new DaaS subscription since 2011. The subscription utilizes machine learning and predictive analytics to proactively block malicious domains and stop attacks in progress, the only service with level of capability to be integrated with the firewall. This continues our practice of reducing the number of disparate point products and making security better, easier and more effective. We are working hard to win future subscription with our software releases, providing our customers more integration on the cybersecurity solutions in enterprise. We believe the next-generation firewall will continue to serve as a platform for security services in the enterprise. We also have expanded our hardware family. Our new PA-7000 series features throughput capabilities at 2x the nearest competitor, and will be especially useful to customers with large data centers and high volumes of encrypted traffic. Additionally, we announced the availability of our K2-Series. As we discussed on last quarter's conference call, the service provider market has become a lot more interesting to us with the adoption of IoT and the advent of 5G, where security will be a primary concern. Our new K2 series aggressive this market, simplifying operations by offering unprecedented visibility, automation and consistent protection. And finally, we continue our investments in Advanced Endpoint Protection with Traps 6.0, which we announced earlier today, endpoint security just got a lot better. The new behavior threat prevention engine allows Traps to prevent attacks based on their behavior. Trap 6.0 also introduces container security protections, and this data collection predicts the arc, which I'll talk more about later. We're proud to serve close to 4,000 Traps customers, almost half of whom manage Traps from the cloud. Turning to our second focus are, the cloud. We continue to be laser focused on delivering technology that enables our customers in the cloud journey by delivering the broadest set of security capabilities across all clouds and cloud configurations. As of the second quarter, approximately 8,000 customers are using our cloud offering. The speedboat we created around cloud and the acquisition of RedLock last quarter is already showing positive results. We have exceeded the original forecast for our RedLock business by more than 50%. This is a great example of the power of combining a best-in-class product with Palo Alto Network's execution and distribution. Additionally, our in-line cloud security VM-Series was recently expanded to include support for the Oracle cloud and initial trials of the Alibaba cloud. They improved performance of the product by up to 2.5x and added many new and enhanced capabilities for operating in both public and private cloud environments. We're very pleased with our continued progress with the VM-Series and success we're seeing with customers. The third focus area of our strategy is harnessing the power of advanced AI and machine learning. We started this strategy with the announcement of Application Framework 18 months ago and are proud to announce Application Framework 2.0, which is now called Cortex. We believe this is how security will be managed in the future. Cortex is a significant evolution of the Application Framework. It is the industry's only open integrated AI-based continued security platform. Cortex has been deployed in the public cloud, allowing us to leverage its features and scale, rapidly deployed AI. We're also announcing the first application available for Cortex called Cortex XDR. Built to empower stock analysts, Cortex XDR enables teams to stop sophisticated attacks and adapt their defenses to prevent future threats. Cortex XDR goes far beyond traditional EDR than only works on endpoint data. It breaks down the silos created by legacy technologies to offer the first ever detection, investigation and response product that natively integrates network, endpoint and cloud data. It reduces the signal and noise ratio that is being plagued in security analyst. It accurately uncovers threats using machine learning, simplifies investigations automation and stops attacks before damage is done to drive integration with existing and portion points. Cortex XDR is being launched in conjunction with Trap 6.0, our new endpoint product that I mentioned before. Now Traps is enhanced is even better endpoint protection, using its behavioral threat protection engine, it stops advanced threats in real time by stitching together a chain of events to spot malicious activity. When combined with Cortex XDR, customers can use Traps to extend their prevention capabilities, to include detection and response across the entire digital infrastructure from a single agent. The more powerful Traps product, acts as the ultimate data collection center for Cortex as well as, collecting the most comprehensive data in this, in the industry. We're confident in the uniqueness of our approach, so to make sure our customers can take full advantage of Cortex XDR, we have decided today to include endpoint protection free of charge when they purchase Cortex XDR. Yes, we're declaring our new developed advanced Traps 6.0 product as free, if purchased with Cortex XDR. We believe that for true comprehensive investigational advanced attacks, the data is critical. Customers can now deploy one single endpoint agent that prevents, detects and responds to attacks across an entire digital infrastructure. And to help us roll out Cortex XDR, we're also announcing partnerships with five managed security service partners, partners who will deliver 24x7 threat monitoring detection and response services to our customers. We are excited about these partnerships with Pricewaterhouse, Critical Start, ON2IT, BDO and Trustwave. They will provide important service to our customers and demonstrate industry confidence in our Cortex platform. These are all exciting changes and I cannot thank our product team enough for stepping up to the challenge of integration and speed in solving our customers' problems. Lastly, I would like to provide more color on Demisto. Last week we announced the proposed acquisition of Demisto. Demisto is a leader in the evolving space called SOAR. We believe that Demisto's multivendor orchestration capabilities, and unique analytics and playbooks will help our customers further automate significant parts of their security operation and allow them to turn their attention to solving unique and complex threats. Demisto, already partner of Cortex, now will integrate even more tightly into our plans for AI and ML on Cortex. Demisto has an ambitious plan for 2019, with billings projections of approximately $50 million to $55 million. To facilitate and support achievement of this plan, we will have Demisto operate as a separate speedboat under the leadership of Slavik Markovitch, their CEO, leveraging the broader Palo Alto Networks distribution engine. At the same time, Slavik will work closely with Lee Klarich and me to facilitate the next step for customer solutions. As I mentioned on the call we had last week, with the addition of Demisto, we now have made a couple of acquisitions over the last six months. While we continue to evaluate companies, my primary focus is on making sure these acquisitions are successful, and we are delighted with both customer reaction in our initial results. In closing, as we approach RSA next week, we know there'll be a robust debate about whether the endpoint of the firewall is a center of security. In our mind, this debate is looking at security through too narrow a lens. We believe the future of security is about data. It's about data, it's about machine learning from that data and orchestrating and automating responses. And for customers who are struggling to manage too many disconnected security point products, we believe that our platform pros to security, with high levels of integration, analytics and automation is the answer for the future of security. We believe Cortex is the future. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Kathy.
Kathleen Bonanno: Thank you, Nikesh. Before I start, I'd like to note that except for revenue and billings figures, all financial figures are non-GAAP and growth rates are compared to the prior year period unless stated otherwise. All current and prior period financials discussed are reflected under ASC 606 as we adopted the new standard as of August 1, 2018. In the second quarter, we once again added new customers at a rapid pace while also driving robust expansion business. Our top 25 customers, all of which made a purchase in Q2, spent a minimum of $35.6 million in lifetime value, a 39% increase compared to the same period last year. In the second quarter, total revenue grew 30% to $711.2 million. By geography, Q2 revenue grew 27% in the Americas, 38% in EMEA, 35% in APAC. Q2 product revenue of $271.6 million grew 33% compared to the prior year. Q2 SaaS-based subscription revenue of $249.7 million increased 36%. Support revenue of $189.9 million increased 21%. In total, subscription and support revenue of $439.6 million increased 29% and accounted for 62% of total revenue. Our nonattached offerings continued to show strong momentum and we exited the second quarter with run rate billings of approximately $383 million, growing approximately 60% year-over-year. Q2 total billings of $852.5 million increased 27% year-over-year. The dollar-weighted contract duration for new subscription and support billings in the quarter was approximately three years. For the first half of fiscal 2019, billings of $1.6 billion increased 27% year-over-year. Product billings were $514.9 million, up 33% and accounted for 32% of total billings. Subscription billings were $646.7 million, up 30%. Support billings were $449.4 million, up 17%. Total deferred revenue at the end of Q2 was $2.5 billion, an increase of 32%. Q2 gross margin was 76.3%, an increase of 30 basis points compared to last year. Q2 operating expenses were $367.5 million or 51.7% of revenue, which represents a 220 basis point improvement year-over-year. Operating margin was 24.6%, an increase of 250 basis points. We ended the second quarter with 5,856 employees. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter grew 49% to $147 million or $1.51 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for Q2 was 22%. On a GAAP basis for the second quarter, net loss declined by 90% to $2.6 million or $0.03 per basic and diluted share. Turning to cash flows and balance sheet items. We finished January with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $3.6 billion. During the quarter, we completed our $1 billion share repurchase program, which was effective through December 31, 2018. We repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $178 per share. On February 22, our Board of Directors approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program. The new repurchase authorization will expire on December 31, 2020. Turning to cash flow. Q2 cash flow from operations of $275.4 million increased 13%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $251.9 million. This figure was impacted by approximately $15 million of imputed interest expense associated with redemption of a 2019 convertible debt. Adjusting for this and other cash charges, free cash flow in the quarter was $271.4 million, up 21% at a margin of 38.2%. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $23.5 million. DSO was 50 days, a decline of nine days from the prior year period. Turning now to guidance and modeling points. For fiscal Q3 '19, we expect revenue to be in the range of $697 million to $707 million, an increase of 23% to 25% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.23 to $1.25, which includes expenses related to the proposed Demisto acquisition using approximately 99 million to 101 million shares. Before I conclude, I'd like to provide some additional modeling points. Our Q3 non-GAAP EPS guidance includes a net increase in M&A expense of approximately $5 million or $0.04 per share attributable to the proposed Demisto acquisition. In the first 12 months following the acquisition, we expect Demisto billings of approximately $50 million to $55 million. Our EPS guidance also includes an expected $0.01 impact due to U.S. tariffs on Chinese origin goods. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to remain at 22%. CapEx will be approximately $20 million to $25 million. To help you model billings for the remainder of the year, we are comfortable with current consensus for the second half of the year. And for fiscal 2019, including acquisition-related operating expenses, we expect an adjusted free cash flow margin of approximately 36%. This fiscal 2019 number is adjusted for one-time items consisting of the previously communicated $97 million related to the settlement of 2019 convertible debt and between $35 million to $40 million of cash flow associated with our new headquarters in Santa Clara. With that, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator, please poll for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Walter Pritchard, Citi.
Walter Pritchard: Can you give us an update on service provider? It sounds like you're still pretty excited about that opportunity. I don't know if you're willing to express it as a percent of revenue or what not, but curious, just an update on that, and then had a product-related follow-up.
Nikesh Arora: Hi Walter, thanks for your question. Look, as I'd mentioned when we launched K2, and we talked about it last quarter, we believe the treats to the 5G opportunity is a unique opportunity and the whole focus in IoT, or you have been talking to a whole bunch of telcos and service providers out there. And there's a twinkle in their eye when we start talking about the B2B use case for 5G, where they would not have cared as much if well, I shouldn't say that for them but, they were not as focused on individual consumers and the ability to hack their phones or to provide security. But as it comes to be B2B use cases, providing bandwidth at the edge, they are very concerned of making sure that their B2B customers have a secure tunnel going from, all the way from their devices or their cars or whatever they choose to implement or health care devices are rigged, back to the cloud. And we believe our firewall is uniquely positioned to solve that problem for them in the K2 firewall space. So we're very happy with a lot of conversations we're having. We're beginning to start seeing requests for integrating that in some sort of testing with them. So all I can say is, early days, but we're happy with the direction the conversations are taking.
Walter Pritchard: And then, maybe for Kathy. On the endpoint side, I guess that's going to market where, you haven't really had a complete solution, arguably until now. Should we think about seeing a pretty significant ramp in that revenue here as you go into the second half of your fiscal year, given you have the complete product, you have some of those new relationships, and so forth? Or is that maybe too ambitious and we should think about that as more of a fiscal 2020 driver?
Kathleen Bonanno: Well, look, we're very excited about the new Trap 6.0 and of course, Cortex XDR, which will leverage Trap 6.0, we think that is going to be a very compelling solution for our customers. And so we obviously have a lot of confidence in our ability to drive acceptance of that product in the marketplace. In terms of what's going to drive our overall revenue performance, I'm really not going to start to get into those kinds of details. But we're very excited about Traps 6.0 and things that we, that it offers us great potential for the future.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Karl Keirstead, Deutsche Bank.
Karl Keirstead: Maybe one for Nikesh, one for Kathy. Nikesh, the product revenue growth acceleration to 33% I think was super impressive. I'm wondering if you could just comment on where you saw strength either by appliance family or vertical perhaps, maybe. Just give a little color on if there is any particular driver of that? And then, Kathy, the question for you is really on the margin out performance. I don't think anybody was modeling a 250 basis point margin improvement. I'm assuming that something occurred in the sales and marketing line. Maybe you could offer some color as to whether any expenses were deferred out of 2Q into 3Q, or if there's anything else unusual.
Nikesh Arora: Hey Karl, thanks for the question. Look, one thing I have to say that, there's no specific driver, but a general level of activity we're seeing out of the marketplace. As we've talked about this in the past, that every time something happens in a market where a customer gets breached or somebody gets beat, there's a heightened the sense of awareness in security. All I can tell you is that the conversations are getting more and more up leveled in terms of preparedness for organizations for security, and we are seeing more and more security consciousness. From a vertical perspective, we've always done better where people care more about security. Fed has been strong for us, the financial services have been strong for us, but we're seeing that peer down into other verticals. So I'd just say generally, this trends across the board, and that's probably what has driven the revenue and the product front this quarter.
Kathleen Bonanno: Yes. And I'll just address the margin comment by saying they're very related. The strong product mix that we saw in the quarter obviously drives higher revenue yield. So that obviously is helping our margins. But in addition, we have been driving leverage in the business. And in Q2, we saw operating expense as a percentage of revenue decline by 220 basis points, as I mentioned in my remarks. And you're right, that sales and marketing is driving that number and the leverage that we're seeing. And we've seen that for the last several quarters, good leverage in terms of sales and marketing expense overall.
Operator: Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani, UBS.
Fatima Boolani: One for Nikesh and one for Kathy. Nikesh, one of the things that you've talked about and have been focusing on is packaging your cloud solutions in a better way and also taking steps to ensure the entire portfolio, which has expanded quite dramatically over the last couple of years, making sure the entire portfolio sort of better integrated. So I wanted to understand sort of the mile markers and progress you've made on that front. And to what extent that has been influencing deal sizes, deal trends and especially that customer lifetime value metric that continues to grow apace? And then a follow-up for Kathy, if I may.
Nikesh Arora: Sure, Fatima, thanks for your question. Look, I think I'm very excited that in eight months we've been able to create real focus around the three areas I highlighted, the enterprise side and expanding your question a little bit more, on the enterprise side, as I said in our prepared remarks that I think this company had done a phenomenal job in building a firewall and putting subscriptions on top of firewalls. So basically, once you put a firewall at customer's infrastructure, which is a hard decision because you're introducing another piece in their infrastructure, which is now delivered to you by a cybersecurity vendor. It's incumbent upon us to provide more and more solutions so the customers that can be triggered off the firewall, and I think the product, it really rallied in the last eight months, and we've built our first nonattached - sorry, attached subscription after 2011 in our DNS security service. And the team is really charged about building more capability to our firewall, we have 60,000 customers of firewalls. So the ability to take that to our customers and say look, you don't need another appliance in your infrastructure, you don't need another solution, it all works off of Palo Alto Networks' pane, management pane and you - can give you a way - we give you more and more capability from the firewall that you deploy, and that's kind of, to me it's very exciting. So that's a point of integration and a mile marker like you called it, for integration for us on the enterprise side. On the cloud side, we're slowly and steadily working towards better integration, we're excited about our RedLock progress, we're excited of our GPCS progress as I highlighted, these are big wins for us and the team is getting more and more excited, we're deploying more people across the sort of regions, to make sure we have the capability and the ability to go compete with the people out there offering these solutions. You can expect us to provide more proof points of our integration in further quarters. We don't have anything to announce in the cloud side yet, and I think we just announced Cortex this morning, I think the marketing team has done a phenomenal job, the product team's done a phenomenal job in deploying Application Framework 2.0. It was a half last quarter, what will be the proof point of us being able to show true integration across multiple data points, and Cortex XDR is that. It is the only service in the industry, which you have a planned endpoint, cloud and network data as a point of integration. So we believe we are making tremendous progress towards our aspiration to acquire more integrated services, and you can expect us to do more and more of that.
Fatima Boolani: Kathy, may be a question for you on the gross margin. Certainly a little better than we were looking for. Just wanted to understand how you've been navigating some of the supply chain constraints as a consequence of the tariff. And how much longer should we expect that headwind to persist? And at the same time, as the cloud solution build-out and you probably have greater scale, how should we think about impacting - how we should think about those investment impacting gross margins as well? And that's it for me.
Kathleen Bonanno: Yes, sure. So in terms of our gross margin improvement during the quarter, yes, we've said that with the new products that we introduced now, almost two years ago, we've made a concerted effort to ensure that we're able to improve the margins on those products over time, and we've definitely been able to do that, and so we've seen some improvement in their product gross margins over time. We also have seen some improvement in terms of just memory pricing, which we talked about, memory pricing seems to be stabilizing now. We do still have some issues in terms of more commoditized parts being more expensive than they have been in the past. But overall, we've indicated an impact of $0.01 to $0.02 in this quarter due to the tariff. So it's kind of a mixed bag. We're seeing some improvements and we're also, we also have some negative influences. Overall, we did see an increase of about 30 basis points year-over-year, which obviously we're very pleased about, given the current environment. In terms of cloud investments and where we see that going, obviously the, you've also seen some declines in our services margin, as we have been investing in those businesses. We think that there's a lot of potential for us to build really big, nicely sized businesses in the cloud and there's a great opportunity for us. So we're definitely investing in those areas in order to ensure that we can capture the market opportunity.
Operator: The next question comes from John DiFucci, Jefferies.
John DiFucci: My first question is actually for Lee. So Lee, I think you mentioned, or it might have been Nikesh on the last call that the new telco class appliance you're coming out with, I assume that's the PA-7000. Just, I guess if you could just let us know that's right, or is that replacing other products? And I guess if it is, then another one is, should we expect further launches to address this market, a market you really haven't been in very much in the past?
Lee Klarich: Yes, good question. So let me just start by clarifying. The PA-7000 series and specifically the new modules that were introduced and launched as part of the 9.0 release earlier this month, that is the basis for the K2 series. But the K2 series is an optimized hardware platform targeted for service providers and specifically the mobile networks as we see those transitioning from 4G to 5G. And then with 5G, the advent of much broader IoT and in particular, high-value and sensitive IoT devices coming onto those that need security. So they're related but they are different offerings. Relative to service provider overall, we have been in this space and in this market, selling to service providers. We have seen success across different parts of the portfolio. The K2 series though is the first time we've designed and built a product specifically for that market, to really go capture the specialized opportunity that exists there.
John DiFucci: And we're still waiting on the K2 series, is it correct, or...
Lee Klarich: No. The K2 series is now available as of earlier this month.
John DiFucci: Okay, perfect. And Kathy, just a clarification. I mean the results are strong across the board, all revenue categories, but especially in the product area. So I just want to make sure we understand it correctly. I mean, is all the detached subscription something, I think both you and Nikesh talked about in your prepared remarks, is all of that in the subscription line? Or is there any of that in the license line due to ASC 606 in the way on-premise subscription's treated under that standard?
Kathleen Bonanno: Yes. A portion of the VM series, which we talked about and when we talked at the beginning of Q1, regarding ASC 606, the portion of our VM series is recognized upfront in that category.
John DiFucci: Okay. And so it's in that line item in the, on the income statement, in the license line?
Kathleen Bonanno: That's correct. That's correct.
John DiFucci: Okay, and was there any shift, like is there a continuing shift to more subscription, or more on, what would be that kind of revenue, on-premise subscription where you'd have more on the license line?
Kathleen Bonanno: No, no. I mean, In terms of what's driving the growth there, that's really not a driver of the growth, not a significant driver of the growth in any respect. It's obviously, we've made the adjustment, both in this year's recognition of VM series and last year's recognition of VM series. And while we're seeing growth there, obviously, it's not as big a portion of our business as the rest of our product revenues are. And so the real impact is what we're seeing in terms of the rest of the product category.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Gur Talpaz, Stifel.
Gur Talpaz: Congrats on the results. A few product-centric questions here. One, how should we think about the efforts around XDR and Cortex, in conjunction with your vision for Demisto and the app framework? And ultimately speaking, how intertwined are these initiatives?
Nikesh Arora: Let me give you an overview and then perhaps Lee can jump in with the real answers. Look, for us, Cortex is a big deal. We spent a lot of time in making sure we get the underlying platform right. We think by deploying it on the public cloud and using the features that become, where we can handle massive amounts of data and being able to leverage the, needing the eye tools, and that is very useful. I think XDR is very critical, I think XDR is a service, which there is a whole bunch of start-ups out there, trying to provide that kind of service. I think it's different when we deploy that service where you can leverage the data you collect from Palo Alto to firewalls, and from Traps and from our cloud security sensors, where you actually, there are many customers who deployed all 3 from us. So we have the option to go to them, as silica rehabs, and here a real tool that can help you near solve, deal with a whole bunch of stuff that will not be - that was not available in the past. I think Demisto was something that, I think you and I even talked about this, and we didn't talk much about it, because I wasn't going to talk to you about it until we'd figured out we want it. But I think when we went out to our customers, the customer's big challenge is I've got so many cybersecurity solutions, I'm getting 3x to 10x more alerts others than I was getting 2 to 5 years ago, and I'm going to have to hire more and more analysts to figure out how to solve the alert. So this cannot be a punitive damage. The more secure I want to feel, the more products I need to deploy, the more people I want to hire to solve the alerts that you guys send me. So we realized that there is a crescendo where people are saying, I need more help solving this alert, then going on generating, that I think Demisto fits squarely in that sore spot in the industry, no pun intended. And part of the opportunity we have is to be able to take that and leverage that across the entire Application Framework where you can leverage that across data from not just Palo Alto Networks, but other vendors and Demisto's already mastered that art.
Lee Klarich: Yes, and just to piggyback on top of what Nikesh said. I think one of the ways to think about this is, we do want to actually encourage customers to have more alerts, like more data is always a good thing, but only if for the majority of that, we can automatically deal with that, and that is where Demisto will fit in, is that, that automated playbooks and analytics to deal with sort of the large volume of alerts coming in. And then XDR provides that ability to stitch together data from different sources, really understand it and proactively present it to the soft analyst for the more sophisticated attacks, where you actually need an analyst to spend some time understanding it, investigating it and initiating responses. So they do work very sort of hand-in-hand in terms of how a soft analyst will think of the capabilities.
Gur Talpaz: Yes, that's actually really helpful. And then Nikesh, you talked about a strong customer response for Demisto. But I want to know if you've had a chance to talk with any integrated vendors yet. And if you've gotten any response yet from those that have worked directly with Demisto in the past and how they sort of viewed the integration and acquisition going forward?
Nikesh Arora: We have had an opportunity. I think it's fair to understand that the biggest role in this process belongs to the customer, because Demisto is deployed in a customer's infrastructure with their explicit permission, to be able to access the data from the customer and remediate it back into their infrastructure. And they built the product on the back of open connectors that are available from every vendor out there. So there's no proprietary connectivity that Demisto leverages, that is going to change by the acquisition, if that's where your question is headed. In addition, Demisto will also have access a lot of Palo Alto data, which is just impossible for us to deploy anywhere else but in Cortex.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gabriella Borges, Goldman Sachs.
Gabriela Borges: Nikesh, I was hoping you could expand a little bit on the monetization opportunities around XDR. We've talked about monetization with the Application Framework more broadly, maybe just specifically on XDR. And the decision to include Traps within the broader bundle, just some puts and takes on how you thought about that.
Nikesh Arora: Sure, thank you. Look, again, I'm going to give you a little overview and Lee will jump in, hopefully. From an XDR perspective, I think in our thesis, going into it was the thesis of integration, and that is something the company had already been working on for a while with the acquisitions of [indiscernible]. Maybe figured out how to take all this data and provide it consistently in one way as opposed to deploying more and more tools against the infrastructure. So XDR for us is very, very important because it is actually the first critical application from our end which integrates data from all the three sensors that I mentioned. So it's very important as we get into the soft business. And also, part of the observation we've had is that as more and more sophisticated tools get developed, it becomes impossible for customers to train their soft analysts across multiple tools. So if you notice, I mentioned this, but we want to highlight is that, we've actually partnered with five partners who are going to help us manage this, as it gets deployed in the soft, because we believe, the true leverage is from being able to fully utilize the product across all the data that we've collected, or will be collecting for XDR. In terms of the Traps decision, I think, if you look at the endpoint industry, and I stated it hard over the last eight months, there's a lot of vendors and there's a lot of vendors who used to do a certain set of features as new vendors do in turn have new features. And we've sat and thought about how we could make sure that Traps, over time, becomes the ubiquitous endpoint agent in the market. And we realized that endpoint production, in its most advanced form, should become table stakes, every customer should have it. But the endpoint agent has, in my mind, at least two major features, one is to provide protection at the endpoint, but more - as importantly, is to provide data to be able to go back into a cloud sort of cloud database, if you will, which allows them both to leverage it across other security solutions, but also be able to set behavior and turn data back to the endpoint. So we thought bundling Traps and XDR would be the right outcome. And because we want ubiquity on Traps, we want to make sure that's available free to our customers, they can deploy it. And as you probably know, customers have multiple endpoint agents running in their infrastructure, they're not required to replace anything, this is just a free product that they can deploy, which leverages - which allows us to leverage XDR more effectively for that customer. Lee thinks I've - he has coached me well, and he's giving me a thumbs up, which means he doesn't add anything.
Gabriela Borges: The follow-up is for Lee. I think he might know the answer to this. When you look at you customer base on next-gen's firewall, do you have a sense for to what extent your customers have standardized on Palo Alto deployment for the firewall, versus maybe you're still dual sourcing, or have multiple firewall vendors? Then, can some of the new policy rules in the features that you have in 9.0 help with that standardization effort?
Lee Klarich: Yes, great question. The high level answer is obviously going to be, it depends. It depends on a number of things such as how large the customer is when they initially become a customer of Palo Alto Networks and where they are in that journey. We see, certainly a lot of our customers, they often will initially purchase for a particular project, deploy, gain success out of that and then use that success to leverage across other parts of their infrastructure over time. Obviously, we try to accelerate that in capabilities like the policy optimizer, actually allow us to help accelerate that, by moving them more quickly into the kind of security policies we think and they think are better, both from a security perspective as well as an ease-of-operation perspective. The second aspect to that is, the more they are able to see the value and consume the value of additional subscription service on top of that, whether that's fire prevention subscription, WildFire, and the URL filtering, GlobalProtect or now with 9.0, the DNS security service, the more value they see out of using us as their primary firewall in their infrastructure, which also then often drives broader consumption and usage. And so it is a journey, but what we see both in terms of utilization as well as footprint does continue to expand.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sterling Auty, JPMorgan.
Sterling Auty: I'm curious how you guys think about the need for product growth moving forward within the overall growth of total revenue. You started as a razor and razorblade model, now you have a substantial amount of nonattached subscription. So how fast does product have to grow moving forward for you to deliver on your growth goals?
Nikesh Arora: That's a good question. I think, look, we like more and more customers to deploy our firewalls there. So in that perspective, yes, we'd like to see product growth. But we want to see both depth and breadth, and that's why we embarked on a rejuvenation on our subscription services, because we believe that a firewall can offer multiple subscriptions to our customers. And yes, we found good success and uptake every time we've deployed new subscription, we just want to increase the intensity of those subscriptions because today, there are still many point products that are being deployed in the infrastructure. So we see the firewall not just as, as I said, like as a, as an in-line firewall that protects you, but we also see that as a platform to be able to deploy more and more services where the customers don't need to plug more things, so. For our growth plan, it's important for us to get both depth and breadth on the product side.
Sterling Auty: Makes sense. And I have one follow-up. On Demisto, you gave us a sense of the aspirations on the billings front. But how does the contract structure look and how does - how do we think about the billings flowing into revenue?
Nikesh Arora: Kathy, did you want to not answer that?
Kathleen Bonanno: Well, Demisto operates with a ratable model, for the most part. And so we would expect a ratable revenue model with the Demisto acquisition. Does that answer your question, Sterling?
Sterling Auty: Well, sort of. So in other words, we should expect the revenue contribution initially to be small but for it to layer in. So in that four quarter look, the second half should be substantially bigger than the first half? Or is that the wrong way to look at it?
Kathleen Bonanno: Well, I think you're on the right track, that revenue does lag in terms of - the revenue does lag bookings in a ratable revenue model. So you've got that correct.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Wise, Morgan Stanley.
Hamza Fodderwala: This is Hamza Fodderwala, in for Keith Wise. Just a couple of quick questions from my end. Looking at the fiscal Q3 guidance and it implies a slight sequential down tick in revenue versus Q2, which is unlike what we've seen in the past. So to what extent is that caution related to the macro environment, whether it be tariffs or spillover effects from the federal government shutdown or just typical conservatism in your forward guidance?
Kathleen Bonanno: Yes. Look, I wouldn't read any sort of macro comment into our guidance. We're guiding a very respectable 23% to 25% year-over-year revenue growth range on a pretty tough compare last year. So we feel very comfortable with where we are in terms of our guidance.
Hamza Fodderwala: Got it. And just a follow-up question on the free cash flow margin. You mentioned a 36% of free cash flow margin roughly for the full year. Does that include the onetime payments or does that - does that exclude that?
Kathleen Bonanno: So the 36% full year free cash flow margin that we guided to includes the adjustments, that's an adjusted free cash margin.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shaul Eyal, Oppenheimer and Company.
Shaul Eyal: Nikesh or Kathy, I think this quarter has shown the strongest level of growth in EMEA, I think at around 38% year-over-year. What's driving this ongoing improvement? Is that the work you've been doing with the biggest distributors? Is that demand trends? Help us understand.
Nikesh Arora: I think generally speaking, that, as Palo Alto Networks as a company has grown and we've expanded globally, we spend a lot more time making sure we have robust teams in every country in Europe. We have very strong leadership there. I think it's just, in my mind, it's really getting out there in front of customers and presenting our solutions and penetrating the market. So it's just good execution on the part of our EMEA team and all I can say is, from prior experience, a U.S.-based company, is very focused in the U.S. where it starts over time, and tries expanding globally, and we have a lot more room, we think in our international markets, and we're going to be continuing to focus on execution, not just in the U.S. but in EMEA as we've shown, and various parts of Asia Pacific and Latin America.
Shaul Eyal: That's fair enough. And a follow-up, if I may. Linearity trends, if I'm looking at the past few quarters, I think you'd be slightly improving out of the back-end loaded as prior ones. Just looking for some color if possible on that specific point.
Kathleen Bonanno: Yes. Our linearity is, in terms of when our bookings come in, as - remains fairly consistent over time. We do see, depending on the quarter, for example, in the quarter just ended, December obviously is a year-end month. And so we see different linearity in that quarter than we do another quarters, but that's been very consistent over time. So yes, I wouldn't really call out anything particularly new or different there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Philip Winslow, Wells Fargo.
Philip Winslow: On the site with the launch this morning, you said you had 60,000 enterprise customers. And if I just look at that versus the end of the year, it's up about, call it 6,000, which is actually ahead of where you were through the first half of fiscal '18. So obviously you're going to add net new customers at a very healthy pace. When you start to think about sort of forward guidance, so like, even just medium-term planning, how are you thinking about sort of just prioritization of go-to-market between upsell, obviously, what is it, growing product portfolio in an existing install base versus continuing to land new customers.
Nikesh Arora: Well, I think part of the challenge given to this sales team is, we've got to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. So we'll have to - a bit of both. I think to be able to sustain the growth aspirations we have, you have to go out and expand in our existing base. We also have to be able to land new customers, because we have a lot of new products that we're trying to deploy, which will be deployed both in our existing customers and newer customers. So maybe more receptive to our new products, which we are deploying in the cloud space, in the Cortex space. So we really are trying to focus on both ends. The opportunity to go to existing customers and sell them new, existing product, new products is, of course, is great because they already have experienced our products, have deployed them and have the training and the experience on the products, but we're challenging our teams to try and do a bit of both.
Philip Winslow: Got it. And just to follow-up on that, in terms of just obviously the healthy net new customer adds. Any changes that you're seeing in those deals in terms of just win rates versus the competition, your pricing in those deals, et cetera, just any sort of color on that would be great.
Nikesh Arora: Our win rates haven't changed substantially over the last 12 months or last eight months at least, since I've been here. I think it's been pretty consistent across the board. We are seeing better traction obviously in some of our newer products, which we haven't seen in the past, hence the growth rates sustaining lower 60%, as Kathy mentioned. So we are seeing traction there, we are seeing our teams beginning to form around it. So we have expect - high expectations from the teams in that area. But generally across from a landscape perspective, one of you highlighted the success we're seeing more in EMEA. So clearly, that's more of a penetration strategy. So I think it's just steady execution across all fronts and wherever we feel that we need to go in step in and create more effort, we do by constantly inspecting our processes.
Operator: Our last question comes from Ken Talanian, Evercore.
Kenneth Talanian: Are you seeing most customers make enterprise-wide purchases, GlobalProtect cloud? Or most of the deals thus far more representative of a land-and-expand opportunity?
Nikesh Arora: Look, there are customers who already have policy network firewalls deployed and they're used to our panorama management pane, so they understand how to set up policies, how to make them work, and then GlobalProtect cloud's become an extension of their security posture. But we've also seen, as I highlighted the two wins we have had, we've also seen situations where we walked in, and a customer has deployed GlobalProtect cloud service because they believe it's a more secure product than the other product, which is competitor, which I cannot name, I forget.
Kenneth Talanian: Okay. And last question, have you made or do you plan to make any changes this year to sales force compensation or the compensation terms?
Nikesh Arora: We're constantly adapting our sales force's compensation to make sure it meets the objectives we set for ourselves. In the quarter, we also take feedback based on where our expectations were different from what has transpired in the market. But there's nothing substantive that we have changed or we plan to change during the course of our year, because so far, it seems to be working. As there are no more questions, I just want to thank all of you for attending our call. I also want to shout out, give a big shout out to the team at the company, they've done a phenomenal job. So thank you very much, and I look forward to meeting with many of you in the upcoming weeks and some of you at the Morgan Stanley conference. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference, you may now disconnect.

Lastly, once we have completed our formal remarks, we will be posting them to our Investor Relations Web site under Quarterly Results. With that, I'll turn the call over to Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you, Amber. Hello everyone and thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon for our fiscal first quarter 2019 results. As you know, it's been a busy few months for me at Palo Alto Networks, and I'm delighted to reports that we had another outstanding quarter. And once again, we have been able to go our top line significantly faster than the market. I'm also happy to say that my cyber security education is progressing nicely as I continue to meet more customers, partners and employees. Through this quarter, we held our first ever European Ignite, our user event in Amsterdam and our second annual Federal Ignite event in Washington, D.C. At these events for our customers and partners, we consistently heard from multinationals to governments, all the challenges that are associated with protecting data in a digital world. Mobility, the movement of data to the cloud, data analytics and machine learning are some of the trends that we believe are forcing companies to evaluate the security posture in a more comprehensive manner looking for high levels of integration and automation. In this way, we believe we are uniquely positioned to support our customers across all these three events; one, securing the enterprise; two, enabling them on their journey to the cloud; and three, helping with them with their desired display advanced AI and ML across their enterprise. So, let's discuss some current examples of how we're solving customer problems and what we have in store. Service provider is a segment where we have traditionally done not done as well as we would like. We're about to change that. We're excited to announce a new product for our service provider partners, and how we plan to focus on investing for future growth. Our service providers are facing a major mobile infrastructure transition from 4G to 5G. You want to be there with them to help them succeed. They're announcing a new super scale next generation firewall, the K2C that has been developed specifically for service providers for their high throughput need, taking into account their prices innovations, their upcoming 5G and IoT transition. We expect it will be available shortly in early 2019. And in segments where we've done well, the federal space, WildFire, our cloud delivered malware analysis service achieved fed ramp ready status during fiscal Q1. This extends our ability to provide Advanced Threat Prevention analysis capabilities to U.S. federal agencies. For our largest customers we introduced Panorama Interconnect. The new Panorama Interconnect plugin gives customers the ability to manage the configurations of over 30,000 next generation firewalls from a single Panorama console, and they can push configuration changes or manage devices from one single location. This continues our quest simplifying large scale security management for our customers. And lastly in cloud security, we closed our RedLock acquisitions this quarter. RedLock adds are already extensive set of could security offerings, which include Evident, Aperture, GlobalProtect cloud services and BMC. By combining the Evident RedLock technologies we provide customers with cloud visibility and compliance, cloud security analytics and advanced threat detection in a single offering to be released very early next year. Video offering will help security teams better understand their cloud deployments, detect or respond faster to the most critical threat and achieve automated remediation. I know there’s a lot of discussion around our philosophy and my philosophy on M&A. So I’d like to use the subject of RedLock to refine our point on the M&A philosophy. The technology required is best in class. We have a clear opportunity to be a leader in this space, and we believe that we can significantly enhance the value of the assets required. We invested a product focused team and technology that we believe we can integrate quickly and effectively into our infrastructure. I want to reiterate that as a shareholder and an investor my interests are aligned with yours to create long-term shareholder value. To give you some guidance, any activities related to M&A are going to be disciplined, they’re going to be guided by aspiration to; one, participate in large markets; two, become number one or number two in that market; and three, bring the vast execution capabilities on Palo Alto networks to any acquisition so that we can instantly enhance value. Moving forward, we will continue to stay strong in network security, adding capabilities to solve our customer problems. Additionally, we will lean forward into the trends of cloud, machine learning and AI in a big way. These import technologies stayed with our vision of simplifying security and providing a platform with consistent protection across an enterprise environment is resonating with customers. The application framework and XDR are the next steps in our evolution towards this goal. We’re making good progress under the leadership of our founder Nir Zuk. And while we’re still in the early days during Q1, seven partners launched applications of framework. The technologies of these partners bring to the framework, include analytics, MSSP, identity, threat intelligence, security for industrial control systems, IoT and network access control. Before I move on, I’d like to add a little bit more color on my first 180 days. As we all know, execution has been a key variable in our success as a company and will continue to be so in the future. During last earnings call, I mentioned launching speedboats with focused leadership accountable for results in our more nascent market opportunity. Once we have a great execution machine, we want to make sure our speedboats give us the flexibility to operate and execute effectively in some of the newer areas. Our first speedboat in cloud security has been launched and is also a good start. We have product and sales leaders jointly driving our cloud performance, and we expect this focus will allow us to execute as well in new areas as we have done historically. We'll likely launch traditional speedboat in the future and we’ll keep you posted on our progress. We have an excellent go-to-market engine that is running well and with our new president, Amit Singh, we have a leader in place who brings extensive experience, growing enterprise and small businesses to driving revenue scale. Amit joined us on the November 1st, and has been extremely busy in his first few weeks on the job. He’s finished over 50 account reviews, met as many customers already this quarter to both share our commitment to them and learn from our customers and how we can best partner over there. He’s running hard and then excited that we found such a capable leader to fill this important role. He joins a great team and together they will remain focused in executing against our significant market opportunity and momentum across the platform. In our fiscal Q1, team lived up to the reputation as we once again acquired new customers at a rapid rate and expand our wallet share with existing customers. Our top 25 customers each spend a minimum of $33.6 million in lifetime value, which is 45% increase or the $23.2 billion that is in Q1 of fiscal ’18. Examples of customer wins and competitive displacement in fiscal Q1 that demonstrate the progress we’re making across the network and point to cloud are; we landed top three airlines in the U.S. to secure their data centers; we also replaced the competitor in the data center and sold all of our cloud subscription at a U.S. based investment management company; our cloud firewall VM-Series was selected as a security standard, one of the world's largest networking telecom companies in the world; our cloud monitoring compliance offering Evident was selected to secure the public cloud infrastructure on one of the world's largest banks based in Europe. GlobalProtect cloud service was selected to secure remote factories, offices and stores, one of the world's leading manufacturers and marketers of quality skin care, makeup fragrance and hair care products. No points in guessing what that is. And our advanced endpoint protection offering Trap was selected to protect 10,000 devices at a leading healthcare provider in Australia. To round-out the news in the quarter, we were happy to be positioned as a leader for the seventh consecutive year in Gartner’s 2018 Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Network firewall. This positioning reflects our commitment to staying ahead of the landscape and providing our customers with best protection against the ever revolving credit cyber attack. I personally remain extremely excited about the opportunity ahead of us and plan to keep my head down and continue to execute with our leadership team. I'd like to thank our customer and our partners for their support and of course the team at Palo Alto Network for their dedication to our mission. I really enjoyed becoming more established at Palo Alto Networks and learning about cybersecurity and working with this great team. I wake up every day excited to be part of a great Company. With that, I am going to turn the call over to Kathy.
Kathy Bonanno: Thank you, Nikesh. Before I start, I'd like to note that except for revenue and billing, all financial figures are non-GAAP and growth rates are compared to the prior year periods unless stated otherwise. All current and prior period financial discussed are selected under ASC606 as we adopted the new standard as of August 1, 2018. As Nikesh indicated, we had a great start to our fiscal year. We continue to see healthy security spending and strong demand across our platform. In the first quarter, total revenue grew 31% to $656 million. By geography, Q1 revenue grew 29% in the Americas, 35% in EMEA and 35% in APAC. Q1 product revenue of $240.5 million grew 30% compared to the prior year. Q1 SaaS based subscription revenue of $231.3 million increased 37%. The support revenue of $184.2 million increased 24%. In total, subscription and support revenue of $415.5 million increased 31% year-over-year and accounted for 63% of total revenue. Q1 total billings of $758.5 million increased 27% year-over-year. The dollar weighted contract duration for new subscription and support billings in the quarter was approximately three years consistent with what we have stated in prior periods. Total deferred revenue at the end of Q1 was $2.4 billion, an increase of 34%. Q1 gross margin was 76.7%, relatively flat to last year. Q1 operating expenses were $366.5 million or 55.9% of revenue, which represents 140 basis point improvement year-over-year. Q1 operating margin was 20.8%, an increase of 150 basis points year-over-year. We ended the first quarter with 5,645 employees. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter grew 64% to $115.4 million or $1.17 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis for the first quarter, net loss decline 39% to $38.3 million or $0.41 per basic and diluted share. Turning to cash flow and balance sheet items, we finished October with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $3.8 billion. Q1 cash flow from operations of $252.3 million declined by 8%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $218 million. During the quarter, we redeemed $327 million of the $575 million 2019 converge. For GAAP accounting, $52.3 million of the amount redeemed is categorized as cash flow from operations. Adjusting for this and other cash charges, free cash flow in the quarter was $275.4 million, up 27% at a margin of 42%. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $34.3 million. DSO was 58 days, a decline of 12 days during the prior year period. Turning now to guidance and modeling points. For fiscal Q2 '19, we expect revenue to be in the range of $675 million to $685 million on an ASC 606 basis, an increase of 24% to 26% year-over-year. We expect second quarter non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.22 also under ASC 606 using approximately 99 million to 101 million shares. Before I conclude, I'd like to provide some additional modeling points. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance includes expense of $10 million to $15 million associated with our recent acquisition. Also included is our expectation of $0.01 to $0.02 impact associated with U.S. tariffs on Chinese origin of goods. As we continue to retire the 2019 convertible debt through maturity in July, we expect approximately $45 million of the remaining $248 million balance to be accounted for as cash flow from operations. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to remain at 22%. CapEx in Q2 '19 will be approximately $25 million to $30 million. With that, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator, please poll for questions.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'd like to open the floor for questions [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI.
Ken Talanian: So first off, could you give us a sense for what if any changes you have made to your go to market efforts on the firewall side, and I'm thinking of that inclusive of the channel?
Nikesh Arora: We haven't made any particularly major changes to our go to market on the firewall side that I think of, or including the channels and the efforts continue to be the same. Dave is there anything you…
Dave Peranich: Ken it’s really been business as normal on that front. The sales team is enthused and highly engaged. We’ve got the industry leading product. We’ve got great traction and great markets in front of us to grab and we feel great about that business.
Ken Talanian: And as a second question, could you give us an update on your traction with GlobalProtect cloud and how you characterize your win rates there?
Nikesh Arora: Ken, on the GlobalProtect cloud front we think we have a unique opportunity. As we see people trying to go ahead and automate and put security and some of the architecture for their remote branches and for the remote offices. We think GPCS is a unique product, which does really well. We’ve had some good successes with some very large players. We’ll share more about the success in our next quarterly call. But for now, again, it’s an interesting product, it’s unique in the way that allows our existing customers of Palo Alto Networks to be able to extend their network security which they already have in the data centers, all for their remote branches without having to change management control system, et cetera. So really exciting, we’re seeing a lot of traction and hopefully, we’ll tell you more about it next quarter.
Operator: Our next question will be from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.
Matt Hedberg: Nikesh, in your prepared remarks, you talked about an increased focus on the service provider segment, which is great to hear. It sounds like there’s a new product coming early next year. There’s obviously a lot of drivers here you mentioned a couple of them, including 5G. I guess, I’m wondering. Can you give us a little bit more detail on how this new product portfolio might accelerate the momentum there? And then is there anything else from a go-to-market perspective that needs to be also augmented?
Nikesh Arora: Let me give you a very high level point of view and then I have Lee jump in and give you some more insight into why we believe this product meets the needs for the future for our service provider customers. It’s a segment when I came here we realized we haven’t done as well as we’d like to do. And there’s structural reasons for it, there's reasons on the service provider side for it. But that’s not enough of an answer. So we sat down and looked at what we should be doing, what we can do. And the product team really rallied hard the last six months to be able to put this together, because we believe the only have the industry leading firewall from a security and networking perspective is that needed to make sure we were emphasizing some of the features that the service providers need in the future. So from that perspective, I think the team has done a phenomenal job in getting us ready. Now, remember the sales cycles will serve further along. So you’re not going to be hearing us blow the top off from a sales perspective in three months, but this is a prerequisite for us to be strong in that sector. We have a very dedicated go-to-market team in that space as one of our few spaces where we have a dedicated team around the world. And they’re very excited about this new product. And I'll let Lee jump in and talk about why this product development for 5G IoT and a next generation perspective for the service provider.
Lee Klarich: When we look at what’s happening in the transition from 4G to 5G, there’s some really significant changes that are taking place. The first is just the advent of IoT becoming really high scale on mobile networks with 5G offers. Second is a lot of that is going to be high value IoT, it's going to be in medical device use cases, it’s going to be connected cars, it’s going to be things are really important. And the third is more and more applications are moving into these mobile environments. So when we think about that, you can just imagine the need for the best security all the sudden become stay critical driver for this change from 4G to 5G. And so our timing of bringing out the new K2 series is aligned with the space shift in the SP space for this move to 5G.
Matt Hedberg: Maybe one other for Lee on the product side, obviously, RedLock seems like a great acquisition really complementary. I think you’ve done I think specifically what I can tell from Evident.io. Maybe a bit more color there. I guess it shares -- it's an API framework, so it seems like it's going to be a nice integration. But maybe just a little bit more detail on how that supplements what you guys have done there including continue to build out that side of the business?
Nikesh Arora: Matt, that’s a great question. I think as I walk around and talk to lot of customers, it was evident that no pun intended that everyone of our customers was undergoing some journey towards the cloud. And different shapes or forms, some people have a public cloud instance, some people are analyzing it, some people are trying to size. And many of them talk of a hybrid environment or a multi cloud environment, because none of them is quite yet sure where they want to land in the long-term. And as we went around understood that journey, we understood that they need a multi-cloud security platform that allows them to carry their security posture from their existing data centers, exiting infrastructure into the cloud. And as we look to that, we thought we had a product in this space called Evident, which was leading in its own way in its own category. But we looked to the market and said RedLock also was nipping at our heels that was also doing really well in adjacent parts of the same market but a good offering would be the integration of the two. And to the credit of our Evident RedLock team, they will integrate in the next month and be able to have integrated product in the market by the first week of January, which I think is phenomenal given the base of that market and given the opportunity in that market, we believe that’s the -- this is only product of its kind in the space. But Lee, I’ll let you talk more about.
Lee Klarich: So one of the things we have seen and when we talk to our customers in their journey of the cloud is; one, they are all going through this journey; but two, they almost 100% don’t fully understand everything they have in the cloud already and so the combination of the Evident and RedLock really gives us a great window into -- and our customers a window into everything they have so visibility, asset inventory based on that I think is the next step, which is how to provide security analytics for that ultimately detects threats and respond to those threats. And Evident brought a certain aspect to that, RedLock brought another component and as Nikesh said, we’ll be integrating those two quite shortly into a single integrated offering.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. 
Andrew Nowinski: You announced a new service provider product today, that’s definitely a market that you should be in. And you've also referred to your low hand in mid range firewalls. So I am wondering when can we expect to refresh of the large enterprise of 7000 series…
Nikesh Arora: I'll let Dave to answer that question.
Dave Peranich: We don’t talk about product futures on these calls and don’t make public announcements. The 7000 Series is extremely competitive in the marketplace right now, it's doing great with our customers and we’re very happy with the performance on that box.
Andrew Nowinski: And then a question for Kathy, in talking your sales team and your channel partners, do you feel like the enterprise buying cycle is more -- perhaps more backend loaded this year than it was last year as it relates to the calendar year end enterprise budget flush?
Kathy Bonanno: Well, our linearity has actually been pretty good the last couple of quarters. And so, I wouldn't say that we're really seeing more back end loaded nature of the business necessarily.
Andrew Nowinski: So not normal seasonality you're expecting this quarter?
Kathy Bonanno: In Q2, we've guided to what 24% to 26% year-over-year revenue growth, seasonality there was pretty in line with what we've seen historically.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Tom on for Keith Weiss. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to just dig into the security demand environment more broadly heading into 2019. It seems like we've had good strong refresh activity this quarter. Where do you think we are in terms of the -- we are in early innings still or middle innings, just want to get your thoughts on that?
Kathy Bonanno:  Yes, in terms of refresh opportunity, we've talked about the fact that it's an important variable for us as our cohort size increases every year over our history. It becomes a bigger and bigger opportunity for us as time goes on. While it's an important variable, it's not the most important driver of our growth. As you see we continue to add customers at a very high cliff every quarter and our expansion opportunity within our existing customer base is quite significant. So relative to the numbers in our customer cohort of five or six years ago, just the opportunity within our existing install base and the new customers that we're adding are really the primary driver of our growth.
Unidentified Analyst: And then just a follow-up question on that, so it seems like the RedLock acquisition was pretty good one for you, you've gotten some good feedback from the partner channel that we talked to you on that product. What other functionality GAAP you see from a cloud security standpoint that you still have to fill in? And do you think it could be addressed organically or you're looking at all options?
Nikesh Arora: Look, public cloud security is obviously very important and we're putting a lot of our weight behind that with VM-Series, which continues to do very well for in line security with Evident RedLock combination, which we believe is the leading solution for API based security and public cloud. And with some of the enhancements we made to Trap over the last many months to include support for Linux, which is obviously on our operating system behind application to run on the public cloud. And so that combination of in line security, API based security and host security, we believe is the right approach and we feel very good about being in a position where we have leading solutions and all three of those.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be from Michael Turits with Raymond James.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Keith on for Michael. Nikesh, you indicated several times at Palo Alto to be focused on utilizing security data. So does this mean that you want to enter the SIM market or -- and with the automation aspect what we call now the slow market? How should we think about that?
Nikesh Arora: So we have some very exciting products coming up early next year in XDR, which allows you to some degree of investigation, some degree of remediation. We are looking carefully at what this entails. Our application framework will allow for sync and source to run on top of it. So we believe that we will be able to provide a comprehensive solution to our end customers as long as we can deploy our firewalls and our endpoint agents more ubiquitously across our entire base.
Unidentified Analyst: So I mean just to piggyback on that, so without a major investment whether organically inorganically. Can you develop the intellectual capital and the culture around analytics and data science if you decide to go that way, needed to become a data focused company or?
Nikesh Arora: We have a significant effort around analytics with our product magnifier, which does a bunch of the analytics with some of the application framework. We have embedded ML people and almost every one of our product teams albeit the small but our intention is to keep beefing thing that up, because we believe machine learning is not just about taking a lot of data and trying to train it, machine learning is about making every product of yours, understanding the data that it gives you, understanding how you use that data to be able to create a better product to start with and then leverage the ubiquity of that product to improve the outcome for every customer. So we have many ML people across the board and across the company. We also have analytics apps on our platform. And as we see the deployment of the application framework, as we see the user's behaviors of customers we'll decide which way, which out of those needs we need to put mobile behind.
Operator: Our next question will be from Sterling Auty with JP Morgan.
Sterling Auty: Kathy, you mentioned I think $0.01 to $0.02 impact in terms of Chinese tariffs, has some discussion with [Technical Difficulty] some question as to if we see something go further in terms of trade war. Is there any earn about supply of products coming out of China if you have alternative sourcing if necessary?
Kathy Bonanno: Yes, it’s important for us to remind everyone that we do manufacture our products in the U.S. There are some components that we source that are only available in China. And we are looking at a number of options in terms of being able to mitigate the impact of tariffs or ensure that we have dual source opportunities. And so our supply chain management is always very aggressive in terms of ensuring that we have a number of options available to us and we’re doing the same in the current environment.
Sterling Auty: And then just one follow-up just strategically, how should we think about the subscription -- the product subscription growth throughout year or subscriptions that are not attached to a physical appliance? So whether that’s a virtual firewall, et cetera, moving forward. How should we think of the growth dynamic there versus some of the physical product sales as you talked about service provider and other strategies?
Kathy Bonanno: Well, we’ve talked historically about the non-attached business being at $274 million run rate as of Q4 '18 growing at 68% year-over-year. And so we are -- these are newer markets for us where we’re seeing very nice growth in that. And Nikesh mentioned launching speedboats that we believe will help us to execute very well in these newer markets where we think we have great products, particularly in the cloud space. We’ve talked about the Evident and RedLock combination. And so we’re very excited about the opportunity there. But obviously, the business of the firewall growth and the product growth and our attach subscription growth is extremely important as well and we continue to focus there and those areas are also growing very nicely for us, which is why we continue to be able to grow at rates above the rate of the market.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be from Saket Kalia with Barclays. 
Saket Kalia : First, maybe for you, Nikesh. You talked about some of the early partners on application framework. Can you just zoom out a little bit and can we talk about how customers are using Logging Service, and maybe some of the next couple milestones that you look forward to that can help drive the app Framework opportunity?
Nikesh Arora: Look I think part of the app Framework thesis has always been of trying to collect the data ones and use it many times across multiple applications, because today every cyber security solution that the customer sees require some degree of intrusive probes into their infrastructure, whether it’s the network, the endpoint, or even their cloud security in some cases. So the notion is let’s collect all the data ones and then use it multiple times throughout multiple apps. Towards that end, for example, our Traps product is probably going to collects close to 100 megabytes of data per user per model, which I think is probably 15 or 20 times higher than any other end point product in the market. So that’s what allows the customers to be able to collect that data ones and we can deploy multiple applications with the guest, because that’s probably going to be able to deploy XDR for them. And this is the reason why these customers need to have that data collection happened multiple times. There are some customers who are running six to eight end points at the same time, because each end point is taking a slither of data for the deployment lifecycle of that end point is anywhere from three months to 12 months depending on the complexity of the customer and the locations of their employee base. So in that context, we have seen good progress when we deployed Logging Service with Traps, or people who use Traps management services in the cloud to be able to manage their end points with other enterprises. We’re probably going to be able to leverage the same thing without an incremental end point deployment for the same customer with XDR, which is offer that as a service on top of the one service. Similarly, the products like Magnifier which use similar data to be able to deploy the application on top of data collection from firewalls and its future your endpoints. So we’re seeing the evolution of the application Framework as an integration point across multiple solutions. We’re starting with our own first. We want to make sure that our stuff works so there is proof in the putting. And for me the key milestones are, can we get multiple Palo Alto Networks apps to be useful without deploying multiple sensors into the customers' infrastructure and be able to turn them on extremely rapidly, because the speed of deployment is a key component in the future for the cyber security. So as long as we believe we’re headed down that track, I am excited. As long as we can see other partners coming out say this is interesting, we like the fact that you have all those data. We don’t have people who deploy multiple sensors across our customer base or your customer base. They can just sit on top of those data. And as long as there’s an economic model, which allows them to utilize that data and as customers can sent we're fine letting them use it.
Saket Kalia : Maybe my follow-up for you, Kathy, just a quick housekeeping question. Was there anything to note on the other income line, I guess this quarter and last? It feels just a little bit harder than we have seen historically. Just wondering if you could talk about some drivers there?
Kathy Bonanno: Well, there are probably a couple of drivers. Number one, interest rates have been increasing and then number two, we have a higher cash balance given the convert that we recently did.
Saket Kalia : But no other one time investment gains or anything like that?
Kathy Bonanno: No, nothing like that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company.
Gregg Moskowitz: First question is for Nikesh or Lee. How did Traps do this quarter and can you perhaps provide an update on the integration of Secdo as part of your XDR approach?
Dave Peranich: Traps continues to do well, we added a lot of new customers, of course. As Nikesh mentions, the Traps managed service which is cloud based service, the majority of these new customers are deploying using that service, which is great because that ties into logging service and application framework and sets us up for some of the features around things like XDR. And so on that topic, we continue to make good progress on the integration of Secdo. It would be as we've told you before we believe that EDR is not sufficient. So the idea of doing detection response based off of single data sources is not enough, we think that the endpoint data needs to be combined with network and cloud data as well. And so we are actively working on that, we have been -- and some the endpoint data, we're getting more. We have network data, we have cloud data and then in parallel to that, we're making good products in the XDR application around on top of that to use that data. And we're on track for early calendar 2019 to have that available.
Gregg Moskowitz: And then just for, Kathy, as you noted your operating margins were up about 150 basis points year-over-year. And so it seems that you're absorbing the incremental costs from Evident.io and Secdo quite well. And I know of course that you you're not providing fiscal '19 guidance. I'm just wondering though if there are any unusually high investments that you're targeting at this time over the balance of the year, whether it'd be the K2 launch or anything else.
Kathy Bonanno: We're providing guidance, obviously, one quarter at a time, as you mentioned. We did referenced that $10 million to $15 million investments in M&A in Q2 in our modeling point. And aside from that, there's really nothing significant for us to report at this time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be from Jonathan Ho with William Blair.
Jonathan Ho: I just wanted to start out with the reference that you made to the speedboats. Can you maybe give us a sense of what this entails and maybe contrast that with your traditional approach?
Nikesh Arora: What happens and we have very successful large team selling a large amount of revenue and you start a new product initiative. Typically, some of those efforts get burned across a very large team of functional organizations. So what we've done is we've taken all the people who are focused on some of our new product areas, put them in the same floor, taken them across functions and effectively created two leaders, one on the product side, one on the go to market side. And they have caught large to move as fast as they'd like to move within certain guide rails. And this has really increased our agility and our speed, both in terms of deployment of product but also decisions that they need to make on a customer by customer basis and from a go to market perspective. And the early results are promising on our cloud security space, is really helped us. For example, the cloud security team is run by Varun Badhwar who we brought on board as part of the RedLock acquisition. He is a CEO there. He's very excited. He's very motivated to keep driving the product strategy and Dean Darwin, who is a longstanding members of the Palo Alto Networks, go-to-market and business team they're both partnering really well. Dean brings the capability to be able to deploy that product across our very large sales forces as global distributed. Varun doesn’t have to worry about that, Varun has to worry about continuing to build a market leading product and going in partnership with Dean and making sure that some of our best customers sign up for the part. So that’s like the model behind it, it's working really well so far for one of the bulk areas. We’re working on carving out the next set of product areas. So we are almost on to our second. We'll be able to carve out a team, which is going to focused on GPCS and Aperture as our second speedboat and really excited about being able to do that, which will be driven by out of our product side and running our CMO, so just trying to create speed and agility on the speedboat front.
Jonathan Ho: Just wanted to also follow-up on some of the newer developments with AWS and maybe your early thoughts in terms of what outpost and some of the newer impacts could have on the business?
Nikesh Arora: The good thing is that what AWS and not just the AWS, GCP, VMware and other or Azure, all of them are trying to encourage customers to think hard about the cloud and get out of this model of let me control my destiny by my own data center. They're trying to convince people that we all need to go to cloud. Now as people are going to the cloud, they’re realizing that, yes, the cloud is a fantastic platform, it gives you low latency, allows the availability, allows you to go scale globally very rapidly. But it’s very hard to think about cyber security in that context. And there’s a whole set of organizations that come about by data integrity, how do I move my security posture from existing platforms to the future and that’s where we think none of these cloud transitions are going to happen in a meaningful way unless customers are able to think about as a secure transition. So our job is to make sure that we partner with our enterprise customers today and help them in the journey as they make this cloud journey and transition. And there's a debate whether people are going to use AWS native security or GCP native security, or is there room for something like us. And the answer is yes, there is, because there’s no -- there is very few that those never going to ask. But there’s very few dedicated single cloud only customers out there. Most customers are either hybrid customers, most customers are multi-cloud customers. In which case, you need an independent cloud security partner, who can help you across this new end of platforms with a very hard for one native cloud provider to produce a multi cloud hybrid and public cloud environments security environment. So we believe that it's a huge space. We believe as both us and AWS, and GCP, and Azure to partner in this journey, because it’s beneficial for them and beneficial for us. And honestly in the security the 2% or 2.5% spend across a cloud transition 83, so they’re not going to go try and compete with us in that 3% to 4% of spend. I know I went from 2.5 before but it does in the customer, I like it to be more but because of the customers. So we think there’s going to be -- there’s enough room for a partnership in this space.
Operator: Our next question will be from Patrick Colville with Arete. 
Patrick Colville: Can I ask about the core next generation firewall? What continues to differentiate you guys, because you guys are crushing it, and doing great job. And just from your perspective, what continues to differentiate Palo Alto versus the competition to produce these results?
Nikesh Arora: Look, in my six months that I’ve spent talking to customers and traveling around the world, trying to understand both why our customers buying us and what’s differentiating our product. I have to say at least the feedback I get from our customers is that there’s a very clear differentiation around security. Palo Also Networks' firewalls were built with security first in line and that’s why you heard us launch the service provider K2 series just now, because they balance both the throughput need to service providers as well as this high security requirement for 5G and IoT. So we are a security first firewall and that resonates with all of our customers. And it's the right time in the journey, because early cloud migrations, early data center migrations were a lot of about moving your data there. Now, it's a lot about opening up the internet. And more people started opening up ingress or egress to the Internet on a large scale basis, you open the door for cyber security attacks or cyber attacks across their infrastructure. At that point in time every CIO, every CSO is concerned about making sure that their environment is protected. So security is becoming a more and more relevant topic on the agenda of CSO, CEOs and CIOs. They turn around and say do we have the security or not, and that’s not a price sensitive conversation, it’s a security sensitive conversation. And from that perspective, I think -- and I can’t take credit for, this is the team here and the prior management. They did a phenomenal job in making sure we have people around the world, we have customers we have gone ahead and worked with these customers earlier. Some of the deals coming crucial now are deals teams that have been working on for 12 months, 18 months, or 24 months. So this is a journey that we've started a while ago. It is a security focused journey and it is the product that is clearly differentiated in the marketplace and we hope given the more sensitive around security, we will continue to take market share.
Patrick Colville: And can I ask -- and my follow-up, another high level question like that. So some investors are skeptical that appliance company can transition to be more of a software company at a time, because history and technology over the last 30 years shows us that that can be quite difficult. Clearly, the number you guys are putting out and on top subscriptions are very healthy with the growth and momentum being very strong. So the indicators for now are that this transition is happening very effectively. But what you gives confidence that that can continue and that you guys can continue for pivoting away from product and more towards subs?
Nikesh Arora: Look, I think whilst we look at it from an industry transition perspective, because some of us analyze the industry and look at it from afar. If you ask the customer, for them it is a continuous spectrum. They see it as a continuous journey and they want to be able to take their existing partner with them through the journey, because security is a thing where your customers have to believe and trust in you that you’re going to protect them. We have many instances, many, many incidents happen on daily basis where the customers we understand reaches they call us, we work with them, we show them how to protect themselves, we show them how to improve their security posture. So we built trust and reliability with over 50,000 customers around the world. And I think as we come out with new products, when customers either buy the next-generation product from a small startup with 40 people or would they rather have the capability of a team that’s been working with them for three to five years up in the security posture, we believe the latter. Look, I am sitting in the pit, working with the team for the last six months, 12 hour days, working hard on every product, every part of the transition. So I am convinced we can make the transition. And as far the skeptical investors is far us to know and for them to find out by the time they find out, it would be too late.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be from Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs. 
Gabriela Borges: I was hoping you could characterize for us the level of sophistication education that you're seeing around cloud security awareness from your customers. At this stage, how much of it is a push and Palo Alto where you're really need to educate around the virtual firewall and GlobalProtect and Aperture and some of the cloud products that you have versus customers may be reaching a consensus and realizing that in order to be secure in the cloud, they need more Palo Alto products. Thanks.
Nikesh Arora:
, :
Gabriela Borges: And the follow-up is not specifically on the 7,000 series refresh. But I do want to ask how you are thinking about the cadence of appliance introductions at a higher level. If I think back 2017, there are number of product instructions on the appliance side. So just maybe some high level thoughts and how you think about those instructions going forward and how much more Morris Law plays into that, if it all? Thanks.
Dave Peranich: I'm sorry, can you clarifying question appliance, what? 
Gabriela Borges: How are you thinking about this cadence of new appliance introductions at a high level?
Dave Peranich: Our desire as we build our hardware roadmaps and overall strategies, our large enterprise customers or search customers that in general they do not want to see hardware technology change too fast, because that necessitates need for them to then go through and do a whole bunch of work to swap out old hardware for new hardware and things like that. And on the flip side, of course, we want to stay very up to date on latest and greatest technology in order to be able to find the best products. So we're always balancing between those two aspects. And there's no single answer to it, it's just always looking for where the big technology inflections are on the hardware side and then looking at how we can swap those [Technical Difficult] into a development schedule that makes a lot of sense to both us and our customers. What you've seen us do over the last couple years is obviously introduce a number of new hardware platforms that have been very well received. And then where we need to go we'll continue that process of bringing to market new hardware technologies where we get a lot of banks for the buck and really help our customers.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be from Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities.
Erik Suppiger: Two questions. One, Nikesh, how do you feel your channel is currently prepared for moving into the cloud, what kind of evolution do you need to see from your channel partners? And then secondly, on the service provider front, one of your competitors does a lot of development with the hardware with ASICS. Is that something that you would consider in order to achieve the performance that you need and any service provider requirements are 5G?
Nikesh Arora: I think if you look, the channel [Technical Difficult]. Erik, from a channel perspective, channel is not one in one entity, channel is the very large set of partners where we have people who are very cloud savvy and very cloud ready. And we have people who are going through their own journey of transitioning to the cloud, because they’ve been very hardware centric. So they come in different shapes and sizes. So we’re very excited about the partners who are stepping up and creating the cloud education focus within their own teams to be able to part of this journey and there are some others who are called BICS, called born in the cloud. So they are people who are focused exclusively on the SaaS space and working with us and other players in the SaaS space. So there’s a transition going on in the channel as much as there’s a transition going on in our customer base. And the channel is getting ready to be able to provide these capabilities to our customers. So we see a very, very healthy partnership going forward with the channel, or they’re going to end up wanting a lot of services to our customers getting a lot of education awareness. As the question Gabriela asked about how do we create the awareness across 50,000 plus customers off the top of the cloud companies and get them to see our product. We can't do it alone with our smaller team on that scale we’re going to have to leverage a large distribution network, which is in place which is service provider network? So I think that’s the answer for the first part of your question. And as it relates to the ASICS and the throughput partner, we believe in the cadence of these products we are going to match the price performance of everybody else out there from a throughput perspective. And we believe we’re going to be industry leading in security. In fact, the only ones in the industry, who can deliver the security requirements for 5G and IoT. So we feel very comfortable with the new K2 product As I said very early, the sales cycle and SP are long but as we’ve announced this today, we’re going to be launching efforts toward our teams and our go-to-market teams to start approaching some of the largest service providers around the world, working with them to make sure they understand the capabilities of the effectively the next generation firewalls now. And make sure that they keep us in consideration as they go towards their own journey of going to 5G and IoT.
Operator: Our next question will be from Catharine Trebnick with Dougherty.
Catharine Trebnick: Did you provide the number of customers you added during the quarter? That’s my first question.
Kathy Bonanno: Yes, we didn’t talk about it in the prepared remarks, but we added over 2,500 customers this quarter.
Catharine Trebnick: And any particular service that stood out in driving your subscription services? Was there one that was stronger than the other during the quarter, and then any that underperformed? Thanks.
Kathy Bonanno: We had nice performance across our subscription portfolio and obviously, we’re very happy with the growth we saw there.
Catharine Trebnick: So none of them underperformed like Aperture, AutoFocus? I’m just trying to quantify…
Kathy Bonanno: No, we will break out -- we break out more details from time-to-time, but we haven’t provided details by product of how each one grow.
Operator: I’d now like to turn the call back over to Nikesh for closing remarks.
Nikesh Arora: Yes. Well, thank you, operator. Look, in closing, I’d like to thank all of you for interest in Palo Alto Networks. I also would like to thank once again our customers, our partners and our employees for the tremendous amount of effort they put into making sure that we're able to deliver our results. I have been reading many of your notes, and I know that some of you are still anxious to understand me. So before I wish you a happy holiday, I wanted to send out this invite to all of you who would like to come meet me. We’re going to try and schedule over the next three weeks for sales side analyst to come visit. If you reach out to Amber and our Investor Relations team, she could schedule it. That way hopefully next time around when I read your notes, you won’t be as anxious about me. I am anxious enough about myself. I don’t know need you to be more anxious about me. So with that, thank you again for your interest in Palo Alto Networks and good bye.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today’s teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Palo Alto Networks Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Amber Ossman, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Amber Ossman: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Palo Alto Networks fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 financial results. This call is being broadcast live over the Web and can be accessed on the Investors section of our Web site at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. With me on today's call are Nikesh Arora, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Kathy Bonanno, our Chief Financial Officer; Mark Anderson, our President; and Lee Klarich, our Chief Product Officer. This afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our results for the fiscal fourth quarter ended July 31, 2018. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online on our Web site. We would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our financial guidance and modeling points for the fiscal first quarter 2019, our competitive position and the demand and market opportunity for our products and subscriptions, benefits and timing of new products and subscription offerings. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. For a more detailed description of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on June 5, 2018, and our earnings release posted a few minutes ago on our Web site and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. For historical periods, we’ve provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in the supplemental financial information that can be found in the Investors section of our Web site located at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. And finally, once we have completed our formal remarks, we will be posting them to our Investor Relations Web site under Quarterly Results. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora: Thank you, Amber, and thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon for our fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 results. I spent the last 90 days talking to over 100 people in the industry, experts, customers, partners and our peers. It’s been a lot of fun learning and drinking from the cybersecurity fire hose. I’ve also spent some time reading what all of you have been wondering about and I realize you’re all very curious to understand what the future holds for Palo Alto Networks and how we’re likely to perform under new leadership. So before Kathy takes you through our strong Q4 results, which I think are a testament to the company’s great market opportunity and execution, I want to share five key observations and messages with you to give a little more insight into what to expect from me going forward. First, I think the security market is large and continues to grow. The security market size estimates are close to about $100 billion in 2018 and expected to grow at a CAGR of about 9% over the next five years. Despite being the leader in cybersecurity, we’re still a small percentage of the market and we have aspirations to be larger. Continuous spending on security is being driven by few notable technology trends. One, consumers and employees are walking around with very powerful computing devices which are constantly connected using increasing bandwidth. This is forcing a large scale upgrade in IT infrastructure globally. Two, the transition to the cloud is gathering steam. Every customer I have talked to is working a version of a cloud strategy and migrating either some or all of their business to SaaS and PaaS. Three, there’s a broad understanding of the value of data as a need for good usable data as a basis for applying AI and machine learning in the future. The increased complexity of managing these changing IT environments is creating significant challenges for enterprise security practitioners. We believe that the benefits organizations seek as they make these transitions cannot be fully realized unless security solutions transform with them. Digital transformation requires security transformation which gives me a lot of confidence in the continued growth in security spending. This leads me to my second observation and that is with the need for security transformation so apparent, we are well positioned to continue to succeed as Palo Alto Networks. Our strength lies in our platform approach to security which emphasizes best-in-class security with automation and integration to simplify security management. The company started with network security where the next generation firewall changed the industry. Network security remains extremely important to enterprises and we continue to innovate and take share in this space. In the past 15 months we have introduced updated versions of almost every next generation firewall we offer and have delivered new models which allow us to solve additional use cases to our customers. Our cloud delivered subscriptions are natively integrated into our firewalls and offer best-in-class network security protection as well as eliminate the need for our customers to deploy multiple point product solutions. As digital transformation accelerated and as mobility and cloud computing have grown, our innovation has kept pace. We’re also doing well in the nascent cloud security space. This is one area where I personally feel we could do a lot better. Our customers are facing new challenges and as we see the market embrace hybrid cloud and multi-cloud strategies, customers are asking for solutions that can integrate with their existing infrastructure. With over 54,000 customers worldwide, we have ringside seat to understand the challenges of both traditional network security as well as evolving needs of our customers in the cloud security space. Today with over 6,000 customers using our VM-Series, Aperture, Evident and GlobalProtect cloud service offerings, we have made great inroads into cloud security. In the endpoint market, which is extremely competitive and also in transition, I believe we’re on the right path with Traps and Secdo. With Traps, we now serve over 3,000 customers and protect over 5 million endpoints. With our recent acquisition of Secdo, we will add important EDR capabilities which will enable us to compete even more aggressively. My total observation is that I believe that our bet on the application framework is the right one and I’m pleased to report that it is progressing well. Coming from the outside I had no bias one way or the other. After spending a good deal of time talking with customers about the application and framework, three things came across loud and clear. One, customers are looking for greater integration. They continue to be concerned with the fragmentation of solutions in the market. As new attack vectors are exploited by cyber criminals, the response for many has been to add more point products and solutions. The results, however, have been challenging from a management and policy perspective and management of the overall security environment has become too cumbersome to be effective. Two, customers are looking for simplification in deployment. With the multitude of users and endpoints in a sprawling infrastructure to manage, customers are concerned with the time to deploy security solutions across enterprise. The longer it takes to deploy, the more exposed they feel. Three, the bad actors are more and more in the cutting edge of technology and customers are concerned with the level of sophistication both in their use of large scale computing resources and approach to data. The application framework is an attempt to resolve all of these and prepare for a world which is data rich. The application framework will provide simple yet flexible integration, fast speed of deployment and innovative security applications offering big data analytics and machine learning to stay ahead of the bad guys and solve the most challenging cybersecurity threat. In August, the application framework became generally available to third-party apps and we expect the first of those applications to be offered to customers in the near future. In R&D, the team is led by Lee Klarich who is on the call and attacking all of these challenges for our customers with tremendous innovations. Lee’s organization now includes more focused leadership across each of our product areas. The goal of this change is to launch product speedboats to help us innovate faster. I’m also delighted to say that Nir Zuk and Rajiv, our Co-Founders, have both reengaged, are in entrepreneurial mode helping to accelerate our development engine and ensure we stay ahead of the evolving threat landscape. Onto my fourth observation, I’ve recently read a number of analysts’ notes and I understand that my attitude towards M&A is a topic of interest. Well, you all know we have cash on our balance sheet which in the tech sector seems to be the norm. We don’t intend to spend it in a non-judicious manner. Not only as a shareholder but also as an investor, my interests are very aligned with yours to create long-term shareholder value. I understand that we cannot create value either by expensive acquisitions or without bringing significant value and execution to any acquisition we make. Any activities in this area are going to be guided by aspirations to solve our customers’ problems and bring value to our customers and shareholders, which leads me to my fifth and final message I’d like to leave you with today and that is our intent to run the business for the long term. Being a student of Warren Buffett, I’m going to be focused on generating long-term value, balancing investment in the business which will allow us to grow and succeed with the need to provide returns to our shareholders. And while I appreciate the value of guidance for analysts and investors, I’m all about creating long-term value for our shareholders and not just managing for the next six to nine months. Therefore, you will notice a shift in our approach this year as we provide guidance for only one quarter. But rest assured, I’m here for one reason and one reason only that is to build the best cybersecurity company in the world. In summary, I’m delighted to be here and believe that we have a significant opportunity ahead of us as long as we continue to grow fast, innovate and most importantly provide industry leading security for our customers around the globe. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Kathy.
Kathy Bonanno: Thank you, Nikesh. Before I start, I'd like to note that except for revenue and billings, all financial figures are non-GAAP and growth rates are compared to the prior year periods unless stated otherwise. As Nikesh indicated, we had a strong finish to our fiscal year. We continued to see healthy security spending and strong demand across our platform. With the addition of over 3,000 new customers during the quarter, we are privileged to now serve over 54,000 customers. We also continued to increase our wallet share with existing customers. Our top 25 customers, all of which made a purchase this quarter, spent a minimum of $31.7 million in lifetime value, a 45% increase over the $21.9 million spend in the same period a year ago. In the fourth quarter, total revenue grew 29% to $658.1 million. For the fiscal year, we reported total revenue of $2.3 billion, a 29% increase year-over-year. By geography, Q4 revenue grew 24% in the Americas, 43% in EMEA and 43% in APAC. Q4 product revenue of $267.6 million grew 26% compared to the prior year. Q4 SaaS-based subscription revenue of $214.5 million increased 38%. Support revenue of $176 million increased 25%. In total, subscription and support revenue of $390.5 million increased 32% year-over-year and accounted for 59% of total revenue. Q4 total billings of $868.1 million increased 29% year-over-year. The dollar weighted contract duration for new subscription and support billings in the quarter was approximately three years, consistent with what we have seen in prior periods. For fiscal 2018, total billings were $2.9 billion, up 25% year-over-year. Product billings were $871.5 million, an increase of 23% year-over-year and represented 30% of total billings. Support billings were $856.2 million, up 20% and represented 30% of total billings. And subscription billings were $1.13 billion, an increase of 31% year-over-year and represented 40% of total billings. We continue to drive a mix shift towards greater subscription services as we provide more of our offerings from the cloud. In addition to strong attached services revenue during the quarter, the momentum of our non-attached subscriptions continued. Our VM-Series, Traps, AutoFocus, Aperture, Magnifier, GlobalProtect cloud service, Logging Service and Evident offerings exited the fiscal year with run rate billings of approximately $274 million growing over 68% year-over-year. Total deferred revenue at the end of Q4 was $2.4 billion, an increase of 33%. The recently announced acquisitions were not material for revenue and billings in the quarter. Q4 gross margin was 76.2%, a decline of 110 basis points compared to last year due to continued pressure from new product introductions. Q4 operating expenses were $349.9 million or 53.2% of revenue, which represents a 40 basis point improvement year-over-year. Q4 operating margin was 23%, a reduction of 70 basis points year-over-year and includes approximately $13.4 million of operating expense related to acquisitions. For the full fiscal year 2018, operating margin was 20.8%, an increase of 70 basis points year-over-year compared to FY '17 operating margin of 20.1%. Included in the 70 basis point increase is approximately 140 basis points of organic operating margin expansion which adjusts for acquisition-related revenue and expenses. We ended the fourth quarter with 5,348 employees. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter grew 46% to $125 million or $1.28 per diluted share. For the full fiscal year 2018, non-GAAP net income grew 51% year-over-year to $381.4 million or $3.99 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis for the fourth quarter, net loss declined 94% to $2.3 million or $0.02 per basic and diluted share. For the full fiscal year 2018, GAAP net loss declined 32% year-over-year to $147.9 million or $1.61 per basic and diluted share. Turning to cash flow and balance sheet items. We finished July with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $4 billion. This includes net cash of approximately $1.5 billion raised through the July 2018 offering of convertible senior notes due in 2023. Q4 cash flow from operations of $277.9 million increased 16%. Free cash flow was $252.5 million, up 33% at a margin of 38.4%. These numbers include approximately $12.4 million of operating cash outflow related to our recent acquisitions. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $25.4 million. DSO was 57 days, a decline of 13 days from the prior year period. Turning now to guidance and modeling points. In addition to the usual reminder that this guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Amber referred to earlier, there are two important notes for guidance this quarter. First, we intend to revert to quarterly revenue and EPS guidance only, which was our practice prior to fiscal 2017. Second, we will adopt ASC 606 during Q1 fiscal 2019 and our guidance reflects the change in accounting rules. In our fiscal 2018 10-K and our Q4 '18 supplemental financial information, we will provide an overview of ASC 606 adjustments associated with select financial metrics. The impact on revenue and operating income is expected to be immaterial in Q1 '19. For fiscal Q1 '19, we expect revenue to be in the range of $625 million to $635 million on an ASC 606 basis, an increase of 25% to 27% year-over-year. We expect first quarter non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.04 to $1.06 also under ASC 606 using approximately 98 million to 100 million shares. Before I conclude, I’d like to provide some additional modeling points. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance includes the expense of $10 million to $15 million associated with our recent acquisitions. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to remain at 22% and CapEx in Q1 '19 will be approximately $35 million. With that, I’d like to open the call for questions. Operator, please poll for questions.
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.
Philip Winslow: Hi. Thanks, guys, and congrats on a great quarter. You saw another strong quarter of new customer additions but you also highlighted just continued upsell and just penetration inside of existing customers. So my question is as you look forward to Q1 and over the coming quarters here, how are you thinking about the balance between that new customer addition to land there but also kind of further gaining wallet share inside of existing customers? How do you kind of think about this coming fiscal year versus what we saw over this last year? Thanks.
Mark Anderson: Yes. Hi, Phil. It’s Mark Anderson here. I think we’re going to see more of the same. I think we have strong motions with partners and sales teams around the world with a really good coverage model focusing on growing their existing customers and expanding into new customers. I think the wind has probably never been more behind our sails than it is right now just in terms of our brand in the market and the reputation for driving better security outcomes. We’ve got I think a team that’s focused on doing both of these work streams as part of their day-to-day job.
Philip Winslow: Got it. And then a follow up for Nikesh. The app framework going live here, obviously it’s just kicking off here but what are the milestones or KPIs that you’re looking at to show the adoption of that? Is it customer go lives, is it partner go lives? How are you thinking about the milestones that you’re looking at that we should keep track of too?
Nikesh Arora: Hi. Thanks for your question. When I’ve talked to customers, as I mentioned, the challenge seems to be a lot of point solution in the industry. And from my perspective the app framework is definitely the long-term direction both for us and for the industry. The way we’re trying to think about it internally is to make sure that we get out big products to start working together much better. So I expect us to start making – see more and more integration between our firewall products and our endpoint products, like sort of in the XDR world as we’ve acquired Secdo and we’re busy working hard to make these things go live together. At the same time, obviously, we want the application framework to be useful for other third parties. So the more third party players we can get to adopt our model, the more we can get our products to work together and more we can provide customers the opportunity to be able to see how to look at their threat, how to look at their security posture across multiple parts of their infrastructure. For us, that is a win.
Mark Anderson: And if I can just add on top of that, Nikesh, I think we both feel when we talk to customers about it that they love the notion, they love the concept. They love the idea of being able to distil innovation into much more consumable form factors. And I think more importantly, prospects that we’re talking to we talk about the application framework as a future state for them and it gives them real sort of strong belief that picking Palo Alto Networks as their future provider is the right way to go.
Philip Winslow: Great. Thanks, guys.
Mark Anderson: Yes, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.
Matt Hedberg: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the results as well. The product refresh seems to be moving along nicely and clearly, Kath, you called out strong growth in SaaS and emerging products. I’m curious though if you could drill down a little bit more on both on pricing, both in the core firewall and also some of the newer products that are seeing quite a bit of growth as well?
Kathy Bonanno: Sure. Yes. Thanks, Matt. We’re definitely very excited about the opportunity that refresh presents to us. Obviously, it’s an important opportunity for us and we are definitely very focused on capturing that opportunity. But as we’ve already discussed, most of the opportunity for us comes from attracting new customers, winning new customers and expanding within our existing base. We’ve seen very consistent pricing throughout our history. Our deal size tends to remain in the sort of mid-five figures and we’re not really seeing a change to that. What we focus primarily on is expanding the lifetime value. And we’ve seen very nice continued expansion of lifetime value over time with our customers.
Matt Hedberg: That’s great. And then we continue to hear good things from Traps. You called out good growth with customer addition there. I’m curious though now with Secdo in the fold here, how do you look at that antivirus opportunity adding EDR capabilities? And maybe how do you think about the competitive landscape in that market? Thanks.
Lee Klarich: Yes. Thanks. This is Lee Klarich here. So we’re very pleased with the progress we’ve made with Traps. We’re very prevention focused in how we approach the endpoint security market. There’s a lot of opportunity there for us to take advantage of. With the acquisition of Secdo, it gives an opportunity to expand that footprint toward EDR. And as we’ve looked at that and we’ve made progress on it, our views have of course expanded to thinking about not just what we can do for endpoint data but what we can do with data collector across the entire platform. And the ability to do that is in large part enabled by position and execution we’re doing in the application framework that brings these different components together, it brings the data together in one place and enables us to build applications to take advantage of that.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll move to our next caller, Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research. Please go ahead, sir.
Pierre Ferragu: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Nikesh, you mentioned your objective is to become the best cybersecurity company in the world which is very exciting, and I was wondering can you – could you tell us a bit more that like five years from now what does Palo Alto Networks look like? Is that like a product company selling its own cybersecurity technology and appliances and products or more as an enabler helping other develop their own products? And then I’d love to hear your thoughts about what you see in the early build up of your developer community. So who is typically very excited about the opportunity to develop on your platform to-date typically? And also I’m really curious to hear whether you meet[indiscernible] any excitement, or some sort of resistance from people who might have to choose between collaborating with you or competing with you?
Nikesh Arora: Thank you for your question. I just want to remind you that this is day 90 on the job for me and my cybersecurity knowledge is only restricted to my ability to read everything in cybersecurity, meet industry players and constantly pepper Lee, Nir and Rajiv and the team with questions. So having said that, that’s a good question. Where do we see the company five years from now? It’s kind of very fascinating. As I go talking to customers, they’re obviously trying to protect things that they can as quickly and easily as they can. And if you think about the bad actors, they’re busy trying to attack the most vulnerable part of infrastructure which is the easiest thing they can crack. What’s important is they’re getting more and more sort of best-of-breed in terms of use of computing, use of data, use of technology and we need to be able to match them and do better than them in terms of our ability to understand data and be able to deploy large amounts of computing against it. So 5 to 10 years from now I think this is going to become a data game and an AI game and an ML game. It will be impossible for human beings to be able to protect companies with large enterprise infrastructures because the whole world is going to the cloud and there’s tons and tons of data being created every day. If you believe that, then to be able to apply good AI and ML is very important to get right data in; garbage in, garbage out, good stuff in we’re more likely to get a good outcome. So I think part of what Lee and Nir and the team have been working on is to make sure that we produce good data from the products we have. So a lot of the acquisitions that Palo Alto Networks has made have been very strategic in their ability to collect the right data. And that allows us to create the version of a Logging Service in the application framework that we are aspiring to create. So you can expect us to keep trying to put good data into our Logging Service, keep trying to encourage both our internal teams and partners to write applications against that Logging Service so it’s no longer a point solution that endpoint solves for endpoint, that firewall solves for firewalls and cloud security solves for cloud security. You see a threat once anywhere and you have the ability to figure out what to do with it across all parts of infrastructure. So that’s what we’d like to be, is being able to look at threats across any sort of ingress point, into infrastructure, any user and be able to give you a solution that fixes that at the other end. Now over time you want AI and ML to do this and it’s a journey from getting there from where we are. But given all the products we have in place, all the ingredients we have in place, I’m personally very excited that we have the skill set and the capability and the people and the resources to get there.
Pierre Ferragu: Thanks. It’s very clear. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Ho: Hi. I just wanted to I guess start with you Nikesh. Now that you’ve had some time as the CEO, what do you see – in particular you mentioned that in cloud security you saw maybe some room for improvement, but what you maybe see as the gaps or the opportunities just given your time so far?
Nikesh Arora: Look, I think it’s fair to say that Palo Alto Networks has grown at an amazing pace and as we grow at an amazing pace, there are things that you could have done better as we were growing. So part of the opportunity collectively is the management need to sit down and say, look, what have we been ignoring? What can we collectively put our efforts behind? Where can we improve our execution? And how do we compare with other players in the industry? What is our strategic vision? Where should we go from here? So I think generally that’s what me and the team have been doing for the last 90 days and the team has been very collaborative and open to rethinking certain things. Having said that, as I mentioned both in my due diligence before I got to Palo Alto Networks and in my last 90 days, there are no major obstacles to being able to achieve the vision that I laid out. And we have a collective opportunity as management to continue to hone our execution, continue to stay focused. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that one of the best things we’ve done in the last 90 days is sit down with Lee and the product team and say, look, to win in this space we have to be a product company first which is how we got here in the first place. So let’s make sure that our product teams are aligned towards the opportunities and we are being very honest with ourselves in terms of how do we get scale and how do we win in these areas. And we’ve taken the step towards streamlining our teams and getting more focused. And now the plan is to put more work behind those arrows and be able to compete effectively in all those places. So it’s sort of work as an entrepreneurial empowered team in each of our product areas to go ahead and solve the problem for our customers, at the same time keep the integrated fabric of our aspiration to have a common set of data coming from all of our products so we can actually solve the larger problem as we get smarter about applying AI and ML to these opportunities.
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And then just as a quick follow up, what’s been the initial I guess partner response with the application framework? Can you maybe talk a little bit about what’s exciting for them and some of the integrations that you’re performing with those third parties?
Nikesh Arora: Look, I think there’s two ways to look at it. I think from a customer perspective, there’s a resounding sort of yes, we would love something like that. On a philosophical and principal level where they’ll like to see the data sort of be co-mingled and be able to work together across our product, obviously they’ll like to see more data than just ours. And part of that opportunity is to understand what is good data and over time how that gets into the same place. I think from a partner perspective, our partners, the first 30 data partners that we have, are happy that they can get access to the data and start building their apps on top of it as opposed to having again to solve point by point with our products on an individualized basis. But I think this is a journey in both ends, both on the partner side and the customer side of getting more and more good stuff to the center. Mark, do you want to add something?
Mark Anderson: Yes, just with regards to channel partners, Jonathan, I think the value proposition for them is quite compelling. I think most of them tend to focus on four or five different vendors and apply the training necessary to enable their people to be trusted advisors for those four or five different companies. We now give them the opportunity to partner with many partners. We’re doing the integration work with the application framework and abstracting the complexity out of provisioning that innovation. So it’s really a compelling proposition for them. Most partners that I’ve talked to are busy looking at how they can build an application themselves, how they can take advantage of the application framework to deepen their ties with their customers.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We’ll take our next caller, Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead, sir.
Andrew Nowinski: Great. Thank you. And congrats on the strong quarter. So as it pertains to expanding within your installed base, we’re hearing that enterprises are increasingly leveraging micro-segmentation in the networks creating these separate enclaves of data. Is that one of the drivers of your new appliance growth or your product growth within your installed base?
Lee Klarich: This notion of sort of zero-touch architecture is not a new concept and international segmentation and micro-segmentation, these are all used cases that have been around actually for many years and it’s been something that we’ve been very strong for many years as well. And so while the new appliances with higher performance and higher capacity certainly are a very good fit for this used case, it’s part of a go-to-market motion that is not new to us and something we’re very good at.
Andrew Nowinski: Okay. And then the growth of your SaaS-based revenue continues to outpace the rest of your portfolio. Should we expect the three-year average contract duration to start coming down or are those deals also coming in at a three-year average?
Kathy Bonanno: Yes. This is Kathy. We’ve seen pretty consistent contract lengths or durations as I mentioned during my remarks. We haven’t really seen any change in that to speak of and we’ve been adding more and more of our revenue base from subscriptions as more and more of our new offerings tend to be in subscription format. So we’re getting customers to commit to us on average for about a three-year duration, which has been pretty consistent over time.
Nikesh Arora: Thanks, Andy.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Michael Turits: Hi, guys. Good evening. Two questions, both somewhat high level and I think both for Lee and Nikesh. First, both of you guys alluded to doing more with data and specifically around the application framework and the Logging Service. Does this shift what kind of native apps you might build around the app framework and Logging Service, is it moving more towards sim or towards what other types of applications might we be aiming?
Nikesh Arora: Hi, Michael. The first application for the application framework actually was Magnifier which does user behavior analytics and that’s a very sort of telling example of the kinds of applications that we can build with the right data brought to right place in a centralized fashion. It’s basically a way of applying machine learning to a very challenging kind of security capability that in the past often was very difficult to use, because it was heavily people oriented. And shifting that toward machine learning and automation is the kind of example for the applications that we’re going to be focused on. Now when you do bring data to the central location, there’s obviously a whole bunch of other options that present themselves, whether it has to do with intelligence, analytics, data visualization, automation, et cetera. And some of those will be things that we will take on ourselves and a lot of those will be things that third parties are able to build applications.
Michael Turits: And my follow-up question has to do with the cloud and there are a lot of different ways to approach cloud. One is thinking what you put in the cloud and then what you deliver from the cloud. So it’s the latter that I’m interested in. And Nikesh and Lee, do you think that there is a need to do more on the GP and the GlobalProtect direction of actually delivering from the cloud because that’s an area we’ve had less of a presence?
Nikesh Arora: I’ll give you my learnings of 90 days and Lee can jump in with more. I think the whole cloud space is a huge opportunity and I think it’s still early because people are just beginning to move their workloads and mass to the cloud and trying to understand what their internal operating infrastructure looks like. As that becomes to get more robust, they’re going to understand the need for having the same features and tools that they’ve had in their traditional infrastructure. And I think there are a lot of tools which need to be created which don’t exist and which are not going to come from your native cloud providers. So they’re going to be looking for third party like us or others to provide those capabilities. I think that’s why I said there’s an area we can do a lot better in. But we are focusing our speedboats towards that area and you’ll hear more from us in upcoming quarters about progress in those areas. But clearly as you’ve identified, GlobalProtect we believe is a unique product which has a lot of used cases and our opportunity and challenge is to be able to hone each of those used cases and really go aggressively in those categories and the different used cases to try and make sure customers understand the benefit and value of that product. Lee, if you want to add.
Lee Klarich: Yes. Look, if you think about what it takes to properly secure an enterprise and particularly mobile users, remote networks, branch offices, et cetera, our view and philosophy is you need to secure all applications, all traffic, all locations, all users with very consistent and sophisticated security capabilities. And we think we’re very uniquely positioned with GlobalProtect and GlobalProtect cloud service to be able to do that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Fatima Boolani with UBS. Please go ahead.
Fatima Boolani: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. Nikesh, in your prepared remarks you talked about giving Lee sort of more defined product related leadership. So maybe the question is for you, Lee, just what specific areas in terms of a priority sequence you’re focusing on within your product organization because you have a lot of irons in the fire and I’d just love to understand sort of where you’re focused on from an R&D perspective? And a follow up for Kathy.
Lee Klarich: Absolutely. So just to clarify what Nikesh said in prepared remarks, what I’ve done within my organization is create focus across the different product areas with leaders that have sort of the empowerment, the leadership, the ability to make decisions quickly and drive the product strategy and innovation. And that’s about me creating the structure within the team. What that then creates for me is the ability to then focus on the areas that we view as being the highest opportunity in the future; cloud, application framework, et cetera.
Fatima Boolani: That’s really helpful. And Kathy for you just at high level, can you give us any sense or a complexion of the product revenue trajectory as we think about next year or this year rather? And appreciate that the attached subscriptions are an important part of this story. I just wanted to get a better sense of how you’re thinking about that for next year? Thank you.
Kathy Bonanno: Yes, absolutely. We saw really nice product growth this year and this quarter as well, so we’re really pleased with the product trajectory. The new products that we’ve introduced are being very well accepted in the marketplace and we’re having a lot of success selling those new product offerings. So we’re really excited about them in the marketplace. Obviously we haven’t guided to product revenue in the future. And all I can really tell you about that is we feel good about our position in the market and we’ve seen and expect to see continued good performance of our products in the market.
Fatima Boolani: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll move next to Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Ken Talanian: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. As we look into next year, I was wondering if you could rank order the primary drivers of billings growth. And then among those, where do you see the greatest potential for variability?
Kathy Bonanno: Sure. In terms of billings growth, I would say the same thing that we’ve been talking about for some time. Our primary driver of growth continues to be expansion within our existing customer base and trying to drive that lifetime value higher. And we’ve had a lot of success with that as you know and that has worked out very well for us and continues to be the primary driver. We’re also seeing nice new customer acquisitions, which is very important for us as well. And those two movements really dwarf any other opportunities that we have. We’ve talked about refresh in the past. That’s a very important opportunity for us. So when we think about the magnitude and the numbers, it really comes primary from expansion and the new customer acquisitions.
Ken Talanian: Okay, great. And, Nikesh, as you think about the importance of data going forward, what types of changes to Palo Alto as an organization and from a technological standpoint are needed to really position it for success?
Nikesh Arora: I think part of what – as you saw some of the changes we’ve already made – I talked about, one is Lee’s really focused the team because what we want to understand is clearly how each of these product areas can go out and become big for us and win for us. We felt that we needed to put more sort of directed effort in the application framework and Nir himself has decided to jump in. And he’s leading the application framework team to keep moving them in line with our strategy of moving faster. So, one is clearly speed. I think second is we’re giving all those product leaders go-to-market partners who are basically focused with them to become more entrepreneurial and go faster. So part of what we’re trying to do is that this is an industry which has a lot of vendors, a lot of partners, a lot of players, an industry that’s moving really fast and we’re trying to figure out how we can leverage the benefits of being a large player in this space and being a cybersecurity leader, at the same time not give up the ability to move fast, move quickly, try, fail, try again, execute. So we’re trying to keep the entrepreneurial spirit reinvigorated and try and make this a company which actually can balance those two things, which is both an opportunity and our challenge going forward.
Ken Talanian: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Keith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and it’s a very nice quarter. Maybe just play devil’s advocate a little bit just your thoughts on the subject. You guys have $4 billion of cash on the balance sheet now and you took out sort of more of a credit facility. So it definitely seems like you’re building up a war chest. And you’re talking about customers’ need to consolidate and integrate solutions and buy from fewer vendors, which makes a ton of strategic sense. And I’ve heard this from CISOs for quite some time. But it also seems like CISO is saying that they want consolidation and they want to buy from fewer vendors, but in reality they keep buying point products. They keep sort of doing the same thing that they have been doing of buying sort of best-of-breed point solutions. What do you think is going to change that in the marketplace? Like what do you think is going to make consolidation the right answer that you guys could effectively consolidate multiple products and get customers to actually buy a broader swath of the products over time?
Nikesh Arora: Look, I’d like to make a very clear point here. You should not hear the word consolidation from us. You will hear the word integration from Palo Alto Networks, but never the word consolidation. And the distinction I make and I’ve made it internally and for you is that for us consolidation means then being able to buy from the same person. We’re not interested in that. We’re interested in solving multiple problems for the same customers ourselves. That’s actually the bigger effort. It requires a lot more thinking, a lot more work on our part to make two things work together. That’s why you see when we bought Secdo, it’s not that we started selling Secdo in addition to selling our firewalls. We basically took the product team inside. We’re reintegrating them into our architecture. We’re trying to make it work with our stuff so that when the customer comes in, look, I’ve just checked another box and get more capability across multiple pieces of infrastructure. The customer definitely wants that and they will buy it if you can actually prove that they don’t have to learn two different policy systems, two different management panes, two different ways of managing threat vectors. They want the ability to manage across their threat landscape from fewer tools and they want it to be as good as other products that they could’ve bought. So they want both. They want best-of-breed and they also want integration. So, you’re right. The reason they’re buying point solutions is because somebody comes and tells them this is best-of-breed. They go buy that best-of-breed. Nobody wants to be caught with a breach and say oh, my God, I bought something that was easier to buy than one that was better. So they definitely want best-of-breed, but they also want it to work together because they know when they have 140 vendors across their enterprise, they can’t sleep well at night.
Keith Weiss: Excellent. That makes a ton of sense. And perhaps a follow up for Kathy. Product gross margins have been sort of weighed down by sort of the new product introductions. But this quarter, we saw a sequential improvement and it looks like it’s starting to turn up a little bit. How should we think about product gross margins where they are today versus where they’ve been historically and the ability for them to sort of inch back up toward those historical levels?
Kathy Bonanno: Sure. We’re really comfortable with where our gross margins are right now. We’ve been operating within a gross margin range that we’ve talked about for some time now, 75% to 78%. And what the current gross margins reflect is the fact that we’ve introduced a lot of new products. And when we introduce new products, they tend to be lower margin. We expect those to increase over time. So the fact that we’re selling a lot of new products we’re very excited about, we would expect that those margins will improve over time but we’re always looking at a range of margins within the various products that we sell. And obviously we haven’t provided guidance for gross margins into the future, but we’re comfortable with where we are now given the fact that we’ve got so many new products in our mix right now. And we’re also continuing to invest, not on the product side, on the services side in the application framework and Logging Service, et cetera, which is also impacting our overall gross margin.
Nikesh Arora: Thanks, Keith.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll move now to Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Gregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thank you very much. I have a follow up to one of Michael’s questions on the application framework and this is probably for Lee. How are you thinking about the timetable of being able to take customer data from physical and virtual firewalls and endpoint and bring that into the data lake and use ML to run correlations against it? Any color on where this solution is today from a technical perspective and more importantly, where you think you could be in a year or two would be helpful?
Lee Klarich: Absolutely. A good question. First of all, we’re doing a lot of what you just said. We are taking data from much of the platform into Logging Service and being able to deploy machine learning to that with the Magnifier application. And we’re very pleased with the progress we’ve continued to make on that. And in the prepared remarks, we talked about just last week releasing the production-ready APIs that will enable third party applications to be delivered most likely later this month. So that’s where we’re at and we continue to make a lot of progress. From a future state perspective, and I think we’ve painted this vision many times over. We envision collecting more and more data from more and more customers and applying more and more of our own and third party applications against that. And the response that we’ve seen from customers has been tremendous. They buy into the vision. They understand how it solves important problems that they’ve been facing in very unique ways that others are not able to do.
Gregg Moskowitz: Terrific. And then just a follow up for Kathy if I could. You mentioned that the Q1 will have $10 million to $15 million of expenses from recent M&A. Are you able to give us a sense of approximately how long into fiscal '19 we should expect you to incur elevated investment levels from Evident and Secdo?
Kathy Bonanno: Yes, we’re not really providing any guidance beyond Q1 at this point.
Gregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thank you very much.
Kathy Bonanno: Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: Thanks, Gregg.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll now move to John DiFucci with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
John DiFucci: Thank you. My first question I think is for Lee and maybe Mark from a field perspective. We all know that Palo Alto Networks provides a broad platform of security offerings that are more or less integrated and the application framework enables the integration data from the different security solutions and vendors. But Nikesh noted that customers are really looking for even greater integration. What about the next level of integration, what’s sometimes called orchestration across other vendors’ established products that are even complementary to your offerings? Is that something that you can even do or does a truly neutral vendor need to fill that role? I don’t want to get ahead of it but --
Nikesh Arora: You can hear us all laughing. There’s a reason.
Lee Klarich: Yes, that’s an interesting question. When I think about automation, I think about it from a number of different ways. And actually I believe that the most valuable automation is the automation that no one even sees. And it’s the automation that we’re able to do natively within the platform where things just happen and the customers just benefit from it. So when you ask a question about orchestration, it’s like yes, it’s a necessary component, but often orchestration is used to make up for a lack of integration. And so yes, we will enable it. We have partners that do it. They do important things. But we’re going to always be looking to see in terms of the unique value that we can provide how do we more natively automate things in the back end and actually reduce the necessity to have external orchestration.
John DiFucci: Okay. That sounds – because I do have a second question, so maybe it is a big topic and we can talk further on that at some point, Lee. But my second question is really I think for Nikesh and Kathy. We certainly understand your desire to manage the business for the long term. But why does that goal coincide with the discontinuation of annual guidance? Because you’re going to end up having a wide disparity of expectations out there, which is fine, but I’m not sure that’s great.
Kathy Bonanno: Yes. So, look, I really view this as more of a returning to our practice prior to fiscal '17 when we had always provided quarterly revenue and EPS guidance. And in fiscal '17, we felt the need to provide additional metrics and more longer-term guidance given that we undertook a sales restructuring during that year. But we are beyond that. We’re very comfortable with your ability to model. We’re very comfortable with our ability to execute. So we feel like returning to that prior practice is appropriate at this time.
John DiFucci: Well, thanks for that vote of confidence, Kathy. Nice job.
Nikesh Arora: We want you to have the same confidence in us that we have in you.
John DiFucci: Okay, great. Well, nice job. Thank you.
Nikesh Arora: Thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll move now to Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please go ahead.
Walter Pritchard: Hi. Thanks. First question for Nikesh. On the cloud side, a lot has been talked about here, but one thing I think is a question out there is do the public cloud providers enable the third party vendors at this point to really provide the solutions customers need or do you need more access to APIs and network protocols and so forth to be able to insert yourself in the right position, and curious to hear your thoughts on that?
Nikesh Arora: Look, I personally had very encouraging discussions with the leaders of all the three public cloud providers out there over the last 90 days and the CEOs of their companies. So clearly they understand that there’s a shared responsibility between the customer and them. They don’t want to take the entire onus of security onto themselves. At the same time, even to somebody’s earlier question, in that case, nobody wants one vendor to provide the solution. And most solutions that customers are deploying are multi-cloud or hybrid cloud, in which case they want a third party to provide that capability. Yes, we do need some access to certain parts of the APIs, et cetera. We have to figure out the container stuff for them. So there’s stuff that we need to do. I’ll let Lee answer that because that’s past my 90-day expectation of understanding but Lee can jump in.
Lee Klarich: Yes. There’s a lot that they already do and work closely with engineering to engineering to enable the things that we need to secure our joint customers in the cloud. Now we’re also constantly working with them to expand and further enable that tight integration, which makes it easier for our customers to consume and leverage our security capabilities within these environments.
Walter Pritchard: Got it. And then just for Kathy, I think on the product side, the thing that I think is a bit of a challenge here is I think your original guidance you ended up about 17 percentage points ahead of your original product guidance for fiscal '18 in reported results. And I guess we’d love to hear from your perspective how much of what drove that substantial upside in fiscal '18 are sustainable trends you see going forward versus factors that may have been refresh or one-time or forecasting that was challenging, just trying to understand the – you had such big upside, I think it’s hard for us to even think about where product revenue might land next year given that?
Kathy Bonanno: Yes, I think that the important thing to note is that the biggest opportunities for us continue to be motions that we have executed on year-after-year-after-year. So continuing to expand within our existing base and continuing to attract and win new customers. And that remains the vast driver of our growth. And I would just say perhaps when we look at our product performance, we introduced new products during the last 15 months that have been very well received in the market, which is allowing us to solve new use cases, win new customers and definitely keep nice win rates against our competition. So we don’t feel like these are one-time benefits to our company. And refresh is certainly an important opportunity, but I’ve mentioned before the real opportunity comes from continued expansion and winning new customers.
Mark Anderson: Yes, and Walter if I can just underline that. Our customers are working with our sales teams and our partners to solve really important business problems for them and that inevitably leads them to buying into our security operating platform notion, which provides consistent security controls wherever they put their data and their applications and infrastructure employees. So I think buying into that architecture is a really big difference between what we do and what everybody else does. And I think that’s why we’re enjoying such tailwinds relative to the market.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you, everyone. That will conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Arora for any additional or closing remarks.
Nikesh Arora: Everyone, thank you very much for joining us for our earnings call, my maiden earnings call at Palo Alto Networks. In closing, I’d like to thank all the employees at the company, our customers and our partners for the amazing work they’ve done so far. This is really the beginning for us and for me and I’m excited to see what’s in store for us in the future. Thanks again for all of your time.
Operator: Again, that will conclude today’s conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.

And finally, once we have completed our formal remarks, we will be posting them to our Investor Relations website under Quarterly Results. And with that, I will turn the call over to Mark.
Mark McLaughlin: Thank you, Amber, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning for our fiscal third quarter 2018 results. Before getting to the results for the quarter, I'd like to start by welcoming Nikesh, who will succeed me as Chairman and CEO of the company this week. I've been working with the Board of Directors over the past several quarters on a succession plan after having had the incredible privilege of leading the team here for nearly 7 years.  I'm immensely proud of all the team has accomplished in that time, and the company is on very strong footing and well positioned for the future. In Nikesh, we found a leader who's ideally suited to take the company on the next leg of its journey of rapid market share gains with our security operating platform. His experience at Google as the Chief Business Officer as well as his experience as the President of SoftBank brings demonstrated abilities to scale at rapid rates and run very large and fast-growing global organizations.  I'll be working with Nikesh over the coming months to assist in the transition, and I'll remain with the company as Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors supporting Nikesh and the team with our mission of protecting our way of life in the digital age. Welcome to the team, Nikesh, and congratulations.
Nikesh Arora: Thanks, Mark. This is Day minus 2 for me on the job, so all I can talk about are my impressions. I've had the pleasure and privilege of getting to know the Palo Alto team, the board, and the company over the last few months. The more time I spend, the more excited I get about the space, about the company, and the people.  It is clear to me that we're still in the very early stages of the cloud revolution for enterprises. I was fortunate enough to see it early at Google and participate in the growth and scaling there. I think we have a very, very similar opportunity here. I think cybersecurity is one of the most exciting spaces out there. For me, even more exciting is to be able to see firsthand what Nir, you, and the team here have built. This company, for me, is truly unique. Your growth is testament of the quality of the offering, your customer centricity, as well as the execution capability that you have built over the last seven years. For me, great companies are built by collecting great people, motivating them towards a common mission with the right set of values, and it's evident to me that the members of the Palo Alto Networks team are those people. I couldn't be more excited and honored to become part of the Palo Alto Networks team and work with the leadership to continue to build on the good work that you have done and cement the company's position as a leader in the security space.
Mark McLaughlin: Thanks again, Nikesh. Welcome again. With that, let's turn to the quarter. I'm very pleased with the strong results we delivered on our third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, Q3 revenue grew 31% to $567.1 million. Billings were up 33% to $721 million. Non-GAAP operating margin was 20.3% and we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.99. We are seeing strong global demand for our security operating platform due to the ever-accelerating and rapidly evolving threat landscape and the resulting significant consequences to businesses that lose the trust of their customers.  As our results show, our competitive advantage is increasingly evident. The ecosystem leverage of our platform is growing rapidly, and we continue to capture market share at high rates and at very large scale. We had another strong quarter of new customer additions and are pleased to now serve approximately 51,000 customers around the world. In addition to robust new customer acquisition, we also continue to rapidly increase our wallet share in existing customers. Our top 25 customers, all of which made a purchase this quarter, spent a minimum of $28.7 million in lifetime value in Q3, a 43% increase over the $20.1 million in Q3 of fiscal 2017. Some examples of customer wins and competitive displacements in the quarter include beating Cisco to become the security standard in both a global leader in the hospitality and entertainment industry as well as a leading cloud-based provider of benefits and HR solutions; a Check Point replacement in the data center at one of EMEA's largest defense system manufacturers and a competitive win against both Check Point and Cisco to become the public cloud security standard for one of the largest U.S. health care providers; also competitive wins against Symantec to become the endpoint security vendor on tens of thousands of workstations to secure a U.S. statewide education system as well as Zscaler with our new GlobalProtect cloud service to secure more than 1,500 stores of a large U.S.-based retailer. Customer and prospect interest and engagement in our security operating platform is very high. We were pleased to host a record crowd of over 4,000 customers and partners recently at our annual Ignite User Conference in Anaheim. At Ignite, we showcased the continued strong momentum around our platform capabilities, including the third evolution, which is the Application Framework.  The Application Framework fundamentally changes the entire consumption model in security, and we were delighted to have over 30 companies, such as Microsoft, ServiceNow, and Proofpoint as well as leading, highly innovative startups like Phantom, which Splunk just acquired, previewed their applications.  The Application Framework marries security innovation and ease of consumption, which is a compelling value proposition for our customer base and is helping to drive purchases of the foundational elements of our security operating platform in the network, on endpoints and in the cloud. In the network, the introduction of PAN-OS 8.1, in addition to the new hardware delivered over the past 15 months, including the most recent PA-3200 series, the PA-5280 and the ruggedized PA-220, allows us to reach new customers while driving expansion sales and opening new use cases in existing customers.  These appliances offer customers increased SSL decryption capabilities, higher performance and capacity, and superior price performance, and they serve as critical sensors for log collection and enforcement points for the Application Framework. And on endpoints, we were pleased to announce the release of Traps version 5.0 in March, which brings a new level of functionality to our Advanced Endpoint Protection offering. Customers can now utilize our cloud-delivered management service, which allows for easier deployment and day-to-day management. Also, with the addition of Linux support, Traps now plays a major role in securing cloud applications. We continue to see strong momentum with Traps and are receiving market validation as a leading endpoint security vendor. In April NSS Labs' independent evaluation of Advanced Endpoint Protection offerings, Traps garnered a recommended rating. Their report evaluated 20 different vendors looking specifically at protection against a variety of malware, exploits, blended threats and evasions. Traps blocked 100% of evasions and exploits with zero false positives, and the report identified Traps as having the most favorable rating when weighing overall effectiveness and total cost of ownership. We also announced the acquisition of Secdo in April. Secdo brings leading endpoint detection response capabilities to Traps. Secdo's unique thread level approach to data collection and visualization goes beyond traditional EDR methods and will also feed into our Logging Service, giving applications running in the Application Framework greater precision to detect and stop cyberattacks across our entire platform. For cloud security, we have shown that you must protect all applications and all platforms through the combination of inline, host and API-based security, which we do through our VM-Series, Traps and Aperture offerings. And we're excited in the quarter to acquire Evident.io, a leader in public cloud infrastructure security. With Evident, we now provide continuous monitoring of public cloud deployments, cloud storage protection and compliance validation and reporting. Customers can now better understand how applications are being deployed and used in our cloud environments, produce detailed compliance reporting and achieve an overall superior security posture for cloud deployments. We will also be able to leverage the data collected from Evident's consistent monitoring to enhance the effectiveness of other applications in the Application Framework. We've seen very good traction already with Evident, both in terms of customer interest and pipeline. We are helping our customers solve their most pressing security needs and drive digital transformation through security transformation. As we head into the end of our fiscal 2018, we're excited about the significant and growing total addressable market for security, our leading position in the market and the growing competitive advantages we are driving through our security operating platform. I want to once again thank our team and partners for their ongoing hard work and dedication to our mission of protecting our way of life in the digital age and our customers who place their trust in us every day. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?
Kathy Bonanno: Thank you, Mark, and welcome, Nikesh. Before I start, I'd like to note that except for revenue and billing, all financial figures are non-GAAP and growth rates are compared to the prior year periods unless stated otherwise. In the third quarter, we drove robust top line growth with both new and existing customers adopting offerings across the full breadth of our security operating platform. We once again delivered market-leading revenue growth in combination with year-over-year operating margin expansion and earnings per share growth. I'm pleased with our results. And as we look to the remainder of fiscal '18, we are well positioned to deliver a strong finish to the year. In Q3 2018, total revenue grew 31% to $567.1 million. By geography, Q3 revenue grew 29% in the Americas, 35% in EMEA and 37% in APAC. Q3 product revenue of $215.2 million grew 31% compared to the prior year. Q3 SaaS-based subscription revenue of $192.5 million, increased 38%. Support revenue of $159.4 million increased 25%. In total, subscription and support revenue of $351.9 million increased 32% year-over-year and accounted for a 62% share of total revenue. Turning to billings, Q3 total billings of $721 million increased 33%. The recently announced acquisitions were not material for revenue and billings in the quarter. Total deferred revenue at the end of Q3 was $2.2 billion, an increase of 34%. Gross margin was 76.2%, a decline of 20 basis points compared to last year. Q3 operating expenses were $316.6 million or 55.9% of revenue, which is a 210 basis point improvement year-over-year driven primarily by ongoing increasing leverage in sales and marketing. Operating margin was 20.3%, an increase of 190 basis points year-over-year and includes approximately $3 million of operating expense related to M&A. We ended the third quarter at 5,121 employees. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter grew 67% to $95.1 million or $0.99 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis for the third quarter, net loss declined 23% to $46.7 million or $0.51 per basic and diluted share. This includes a loss of $23.8 million due to updated sublease estimates associated with the company's former headquarters and $13.3 million in acquisition-related expenses. Turning to cash flows and balance sheet items. We finished April with cash and cash equivalents and investments of $2.2 billion, which takes into account approximately $375 million of cash consideration for acquisitions during the quarter. Q3 cash flow from operations of $241.3 million increased 14%. Free cash flow was $212.5 million, up 31% at a margin of 37.5%. These numbers include approximately $10.6 million of operating cash outflow related to M&A for acquisition-related costs and ongoing operating expenses. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $28.8 million. DSO was 58 days, a decline of 20 days from the prior year period. Turning now to guidance and modeling points. Please remember, this guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Amber referred to earlier. For the fiscal Q4 2018, we expect revenue to be in the range of $625 million to $635 million, an increase of 23% to 25% year-over-year; product revenue to be in the range of $246 million to $249 million, an increase of 16% to 17% year-over-year; billings to be in the range of $815 million to $830 million, an increase of 22% to 24% year-over-year. We plan to invest between $10 million to $12 million or $0.08 to $0.10 per share related to our recent acquisitions. With this investment, we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.17 using approximately 97 million to 99 million shares. For the full year fiscal 2018, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.240 billion to $2.250 billion, representing growth of 27% to 28% year-over-year; product revenue to be in the range of $850 million to $853 million, representing growth of approximately 20% year-over-year; billings to be in the range of $2.807 billion to $2.822 billion, representing growth between 22% and 23% year-over-year; non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.86 to $3.89 using 95 million to 96 million shares, which includes our acquisition-related investments in the fourth quarter. And we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million. Before I conclude, I'd like to provide some additional modeling points. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance includes the impact of our recent acquisitions and assumes that we will be at the lower end of our gross margin range. Our Q4 non-GAAP effective tax rate will be 22%, and our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24%. And we expect fiscal year free cash flow margins to be in the range of 39% to 40%, which includes approximately $30 million of cash expenditures associated with acquisitions. Excluding the acquisitions, we expect full year fiscal 2018 free cash flow margin of between 40% to 41%. With that, I'd like to open the call for questions. Operator, please poll for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.
Keith Weiss: Excellent, thank you guys. Very nice quarter. Mark, it's been a pleasure working with you and sorry to see you go. But it does seem like you guys got a really solid replacement in Nikesh, and welcome onboard. I guess, a high-level question on the performance in the quarter. 31% product growth is something we haven't seen from Palo Alto in a while. But even more so, it's something we're not really seeing across the board in terms of your peers who seem to be struggling to sort of sustain any real type of growth in their core markets. Can you talk to us a little bit about sort of what's kind of creating that separation between you and your peers, and how durable you think that is on a going-forward basis, and to what degree the messaging around security operating platform is playing into that separation?
Mark McLaughlin: Sure. Thanks, Keith, and thanks for the kind words. I appreciate that. Well, as you can see, the product growth is very strong. Platform growth is very strong. And I think it's really important for us to understand inside the company, outside the company as well, the whole concept of security operating platform is resonating very well. As we've talked about before with the three evolutions, with the Application Framework being the third one right now, the customers that we speak with, the prospects we speak with almost unanimously across the board really resonate with that. It's an answer to a significant, significant problem about how do you get more automation and how do you get less complexity in their environments. They like it a lot. Now they realize as well that in order to do that or achieve the most value from that, it will become increasingly important that they, in essence, standardize on Palo Alto Networks in all the positions for data centers and enforcement points, which is in the network, on the endpoint and in the cloud. And of course, we need to every single day of the week be the very best at all those positions as well on a – I'll call them a stand-alone basis, which we're very confident. And you can see that from the release of the hardware, the operating system releases, the new version of Traps, the Evident acquisition, things we're doing at every one of the positions to make sure we win head to head across. But I would say that it seems that to me, and I think the team here who spends a lot of time with customers, the concept of the Application Framework, the third evolution and getting consistency across the entire platform is working very well and driving purchases of all the underlying aspects.
Keith Weiss: Got it. And if I could sneak in one follow-up. Nikesh, although definitely has a great background as a leader, not a traditional security pick. Maybe Mark, as your new position as Vice Chairman of the Board, if you could give us some visibility into how the – how the board got comfort in sort of having a nontraditional security leader be leading up what is still a very much a security-focused company.
Mark McLaughlin: Well, sure. And security will continue to be our focus, so let me be clear about that, and thanks for the question. Yes, as I was talking with the board over the last several quarters about succession planning – it's been amazing to run the company for the past seven years or so. I said we would want to make a change at the right time. There's no hurry for this. I was basically saying if we find the right person at the right time, we would do it. That had us thinking, of course, about what does the future look like. When we look at the company, we have 5,000-plus security professionals in the company. They're best in the world, starting with Nir and Lee and other folks in the team. We have some of the best operating executives in René and Mark Anderson and folks who are very committed to the company, which is fantastic. So security is something we know genetically and from a DNA perspective. So we start to think about where the company's going to look like in five years from today. I would garner to say that it's more of the security operating platform I just laid out. It’s got a lot to do with massive datasets with analytics, with the infrastructure required to support those, the cloud, SaaS. It’s very clear that security is heading in that direction and that we’re forcing it in that direction as a company. So that really informed our pick for the succession planning, which should be a great, accomplished business leader, somebody who’s a culturally great fit and somebody who also has experience ideally with large-scale platforms that have those kind of characteristics. There’s not a lot of those platforms in the world. There’s not a lot of people who have that kind of experience. We’re fortunate to find Nikesh and spend the last few months with him to make sure that we had alignment across all those variables I just laid out. So that was really the thought process, Keith.
Operator: Our next question will come from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.
Phil Winslow: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Mark, my congrats again for your move-up to Vice Chairman. I have known you since back at VeriSign. You not only been a super impressive executive, but a real gentleman. So it’s been fun, and congrats on your new role.
Mark McLaughlin: Thank you, Phil. I’ll try to continue to be a gentleman. Yes.
Phil Winslow: Pulled it off well. All right. Yes, just a question on the quarter. Obviously, you noted several competitive displacements and wins sort of across the portfolio. When you think about just the competitive environment out there, particularly from a pricing perspective, there’s been a lot of conversation about that, just sort of what have you seen out there? Any changes that you’d highlight sort of across the platform?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, sure. Let me take that first, and I think Mark probably have some good commentary as well. He spends a massive amount of time in the field with the customers. What we’re seeing from a pricing perspective is no change in the sense of it’s a very competitive market. The competition has always been competitive in pricing. I think they increasingly go to the price card out of desperation in a lot of cases. And what we’ve seen in our business is being able to sell value first, the security operating platform as being very unique. Nobody can match that. And the third, in doing that and perhaps interestingly, as we have done a very nice job discipline-wise by having discounting improve – quarter-over-quarter improved again sequentially and year-over-year. So in the face of all that strong competitive pricing pressure, we continue to sell the value of the platform. Mark do you have any comments?
Mark Anderson: Yes. Hey Phil, it’s Mark Anderson here. So with the last 18 months of product announcements, the hundreds of features that we brought into the platforms that we’ve – the hardware platforms that we’ve replaced, I think price performance-wise, we’ve got very compelling offers there. But I think most importantly, when customers get a sense for where we’re taking security with the third evolution, the Application Framework, I think the kind of future proof nature of us being able to help them distill security innovation into consumable form factors on the Palo Alto Networks kit, I think, is a very compelling value proposition. And I think that’s something that every customer I talk to takes into consideration when they’re making a decision for paying 2 or 3 times for Palo Alto Networks what our desperate competitors are charging for their stuff.
Phil Winslow: Got it. And just actually a follow-up on the App Framework for my next question here. Wondering if you could give us sort of, I guess, a grade of sort of where you stand so far in the development. And what milestone should we, from the outside looking in, point toward for sort of success there?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. It’s a great question, Phil. So first, let me start with where it is. The Application Framework is very real today. We announced it about a year ago, and over the course of the last year have made a lot of progress on a number of things. One is making sure that from an App Framework perspective, the third parties can create apps easily into the framework. The second thing was the development release, and so far very successful launch of the Logging Service, which allows all the data to be collected there. We just had Ignite User Conference last week, and we had over 4,000 folks there and there was 30 companies who were previewing their applications, which was fantastic right there in the demo floor. We really, really liked that the customers saw not only their applications, but also workflow between the applications as well. And we highlighted a number of them on stage just to give a sense of that. We also announced that the Application Framework could be production-ready in August. So very soon, we’ll be able to actually use that with customers, so lots of good traction. I would say and people have asked me this before, how do you think about it in the future, let’s say, the definitions of success in the Application Framework, which you’re driving towards, would be a lot of applications in that framework. And I think somebody said onetime that a real platform is successful when there’s more value driven across the top of the platform than the platform itself. So we would expect that over time, customers will get a lot of value from the applications running on top of the framework.
Operator: We’ll go next to Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.
Matt Hedberg: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. I’ll offer my congrats to you, Mark, as well. It’s certainly been great working with you over the years. And Nikesh, congratulations on the role, excited to see what you bring to the company. Maybe I’ll start with Nikesh. Obviously, you mentioned that it’s Day minus two. But your ability to scale businesses at Google was certainly impressive. You mentioned there are some similarities. I’m curious when you did your due diligence, what are some of those similarities you came away with? And any insights in how you think Palo Alto is well positioned to thrive in a public cloud environment?
Nikesh Arora: Thank you, Matt, for asking the question and thank you for your congratulations. As I said, it’s Day minus two, so anything I say is subject to change. So I think the early impressions are, I think there’s no question in anybody’s mind that we’re still early in the cloud revolution, and in the next few decades, we will see almost every company out there having to make that transition. And I think Palo Alto Networks’ mission on sort of preserving our digital life and keeping it safe is going to – in line with that cloud transition. As we go to that transition, huge amounts of datasets are going to be created, people are going to have to keep track a lot of data, we have to apply a lot of AI, machine learning. And just this notion that Mark talked about of sort of migrating or transitioning to an Application Framework where we can bring a best-of-breed and help people to sort of participate with Palo Alto Networks being sort of the one who brings this solution to the end customer is extremely empowering and extremely powerful. I think that’s sort of my early impression that being able to take the company along that path with the team that is working on those product areas is going to be fundamentally exciting.
Matt Hedberg: That’s great. And then maybe as a follow-up. We continue to hear good things about GlobalProtect. And Mark, you called it out in your prepared remarks, a nice win there. Could you talk a little bit more about the competitive landscape there? Are there some even – some legacy competitors that you’re seeing there? And I guess, just a better sense on pricing for GlobalProtect would be helpful. Thank you.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, sure. And Matt, we do – as you know, we have GlobalProtect – I mean, GlobalProtect cloud service as well, and it’s all part of the platform, of course. And over time, what you’ve seen us do is ensure that customers can use our security operating platform with the appropriate form factor for the appropriate use case, right? So we have hardware in some cases, big hardware, small hardware. We have agents on the endpoint. We have virtual machines in the cloud, API hooks for SaaS applications. And with GlobalProtect cloud service, you have the ability for what we would traditionally call network security to just point it at the cloud and have the full-on next-gen firewall capabilities as well. That’s important for branch offices, mobile users and places where you want to reduce your MPLS costs, and customers are reacting very well at that. From a pricing perspective, we’re competitive price-wise. As we are with everything in our platform, we can be because we think it’s best on a head-to-head basis. And also the value of it being consistent across the platform helps as well, and we’ve seen really good early success with GlobalProtect cloud service.
Operator: Our next question will come from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray.
Andrew Nowinski: All right, thanks. Congratulation, Nikesh, on your appointment. And Mark, it’s been a real pleasure working with you over the years. Just a question on – maybe on virtual firewalls. There’s always been a view in the market that the move to the cloud is somewhat bad for security. Can you just give us any color on the demand trends you’re seeing on the Virtual firewall side and how they’re maybe driving some larger deals?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, sure. It’s a really good question. And as Nikesh mentioned a little earlier, the move to the cloud is inevitable. When you look at the amount of IT spend and how much of it is in the cloud today, it’s actually pretty small. So I think we’re in the early innings of this. And we’ve seen in our business, again back to the right form factor for the right use case, that the VM-Series is going very well at the inline portion for protection and protecting offerings in the cloud. And that’s going very well. That’s been, we think, additive to the business so far. We’d expect that to be the case into the future because we see existing customers not only buying VM-Series, but most everything else in the platform along the way, which is fantastic. And we would expect that, that part of our business is going to continue to grow as people continue to – as well.
Andrew Nowinski: Okay, got it. And then I know it’s – the platform and automation, as you said, were driving a lot of the product revenue growth this quarter. But could you maybe give us just an update on where you think we’re at with regard to a refresh cycle given the new 3200 Series out in February and you had the 5200 last year? A lot of new appliances in the market, just wondering how much of that’s contributing just specifically from the refresh cycle. Thanks.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. Great question. As you can see from the about 51,000 customers we’re serving today, the size of the customer base continues to grow very nicely over time quarter-over-quarter, so the cohorts keep growing over time. As we’ve said in the past, as these cohorts get bigger and as in the latter years the refresh cycle becomes an increasingly large contributor to the business, we’d expect that would continue into the future. And by giving customers new capability sets not only in the hardware, but also the operating system, and reasons to refresh if they’re already a customer or come to us if they’re not are very important.  The drivers in the hardware side of our business, I think, really fall into three categories. The first and I think the most prevalent today is the expansion opportunity with so many customers who are – where you can see the lifetime value creation goes up very significantly, we think that’s the biggest driver. We also have net new customer acquisitions. It’s very high. As you can see again from the quarter, that certainly helps. And then the third is refresh, which is performing very well for us. We think that’s going to continue to be the case and will continue to grow as a contributor over time.
Andrew Nowinski: Great. Thanks Mark.
Mark McLaughlin: Thanks, Andrew.
Operator: We’ll go next to Jonathan Ho with William Blair.
Jonathan Ho: Let me echo my congratulations as well. I just wanted to start out with the Application Framework and maybe some of the commonalities that you’re seeing with some of the new customers that have signed up and maybe how you think about that from a revenue opportunity as well.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. Jonathan, great question. I described this since we started with the Application Framework as what we inevitably would see as a push-pull on the right. And the push aspect of it is going to be, over time, how much value these applications deliver over top of the Application Framework. And perhaps someday, we would monetize this. We don’t have a plan to do that right now. We think our main focus there should be just growing a very healthy ecosystem of developers, and then we’ll see how that transpires over time. The flip of it with the pull, I think, is very evident already for us, which is customers really resonate with the ability to reduce the complexity of their footprint in their – in all of the network, including cloud and also the simplicity of working with less vendors through a platform, right? And that is driving purchases of all the foundational aspects, which we view as not only fantastic security capabilities themselves, but also data collectors and enforcement positions. So that’s in the network, that’s on the cloud, it’s on the endpoint, and all those are growing very nicely for us.
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And then relative to Traps 5.0 and the Secdo acquisition, can you talk a little bit about what new capabilities you’re adding here and maybe what challenges you’re addressing with that acquisition?
Mark McLaughlin: Sure, yes. I think there’s two ways to think about that, Jonathan. The first and the most probably evident one is that Secdo brings EDR capabilities to Traps. That’s an important capability to customers, definitely, one. So our ability to have that is important. We believe that the way that Secdo does EDR is very unique with some very unique thread-level capabilities and visualizations. You’ll see that come back into Traps early in the calendar fiscal 2019 – I’m sorry, early calendar 2019, and that’s what we’re going to do with that capability. In addition to that, and I don’t know if you were at Ignite or had somebody there, but we also talked about taking the Secdo EDR capability and applying it across the entire platform, so not just endpoints, but also network and cloud as well. This concept we call XDR, meaning across the entire platform, so that you can get the best EDR capabilities everywhere from a security perspective not just on endpoints. We think that’s going to be an unmatched capability simply because of the size of the deployments we have in all the data locations.
Jonathan Ho: Thank you.
Mark McLaughlin: Thanks, Jonathan.
Operator: Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs has our next question.
Gabriela Borges: Good morning and thanks for taking the questions and congratulations to the team. Maybe for Mark Anderson and maybe Kathy as well. The last time we saw 30%-plus-type product growth were back in 2016, and that was subsequently followed by a little bit of a slowdown. So the question is how you’re thinking about managing through tougher comps at a high level going into next year. And a follow-up for Kathy. Just on the incremental investments that you discussed in the prepared remarks in the acquisitions, just a little more on what you’re investing in. Thank you.
Kathy Bonanno: Thanks for the question. Yes, we’re very excited about our product growth this quarter, obviously, very strong number. The platform, as Mark mentioned, is resonating with customers, and the security operating platform is experiencing a lot of interest from customers, both push and the pull side, as Mark mentioned. So we’re really happy with the performance of products. We think that we still have a lot of market share opportunity, and we’ve been growing into that share year after year after year. So we think there’s still a lot of opportunity for us to grow, and that growth can be sustainable for years to come. In terms of incremental investments that we’re making, we’re obviously integrating the newly acquired technology in the case of Secdo into our platform, so that’s coming off of the market. And we’re working on that integration now. For Evident and Secdo alike, we are working on operationalizing, making sure that we have a great go-to-market plan for both of those product offerings and just overall making sure that we have the right marketing messages, integration and operational plan for those services.
Mark Anderson: Gabriela, it's Mark Anderson. here. So I think a couple of things. Our field sales team is really quite disciplined in going after business, both with expansion opportunities with existing customers as well as propositions for new customers, especially ones that are embarking on their own digital transformation journey. I think we provide a consultative type of approach, but it's really a subject matter expert with regards to security in that journey. And it gives us the opportunity to show them how important being able to future proof their investments with, again, access to the Application Framework, like I mentioned earlier. I think also, just hardware cycles come and go. But I think by and large, customers are telling us that our approach to security to provide consistent security everywhere at the endpoint, in the cloud and on-prem in customers perimeters is really differentiated from what our competitors are doing, either by providing an architecture that is just unrivaled out there.
Gabriela Borges: That’s helpful color. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Saket Kalia with Barclays Capital.
Saket Kalia: Hi, thanks for taking question. And congrats to both of you on your new opportunities. Maybe for you, Mark, I believe several other parts of the Application Framework are going to be generally available here starting in August. Maybe related to Jonathan's questions, can you give us any broad brushes on how the pricing here might work and what you're seeing initially from customers on accepting that different consumption model?
Mark McLaughlin: Saket, that's very good question. And yes, probably the best thing to just clarify when we say the Application Framework is production-ready come April, what that means is that third-party applications will be available through the framework. From a pricing perspective, today, the relationship or – that is between the application provider – I'm sorry, I said April, I meant August. 10 people give me notes to correct that. In August, I'm sorry. The relationship from a pricing perspective will be through the customer right with the application provider themselves. So that's what it will look like on the beginning, meaning we don't have an intent right now to try to monetize that. From our perspective perhaps over time, like you said, when we're driving a lot of value, we'll be in the position to do that. What we're definitely seeing right now in the business, though, is the pull aspect, which is because of the compelling nature of the idea of being able to actually have a lot of innovation in the market but not have to deploy form factor after form factor to collect data to get one more feature, customers like that a lot. And I think they will standardize on Palo Alto Networks. I think they are standardizing on Palo Alto Networks, and the network increasing, the endpoints and the cloud as well, so that's a driver of our business. I think it's been a driver for the last year. There's lots of other drivers as well, but I think that's a driver that's happening, and I think we're going to see that continue into the future.
Saket Kalia: That's helpful. Maybe for my follow-up for you, Kathy. You talked to the impact of that Evident and Secdo we're having here from the EPS perspective in the fourth quarter. Can you give us any broad brushes on any billings or revenue impact it might have either in the quarter or maybe on an annual basis?
Kathy Bonanno: Yes. On the quarter, the billings and revenue impact was immaterial. Going forward, obviously, we're working on our plans and our go-to-market plans, and we're certainly hoping that we have good revenue and billings performance from both of them. We see a lot of opportunity with both of those products given the demand for cloud, security, and as well the EDR capabilities are going to be a great addition to our endpoint service offering.
Saket Kalia: That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI.
Ken Talanian: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Nikesh, I realized it's early, but could you provide some of your initial thoughts on M&A and general thoughts for the potential for consolidation within the security sector?
Nikesh Arora: Thank you, Kenneth for the question. I think it's inappropriate for me to have thoughts on M&A until I fully understand the entire product offering of Palo Alto Networks, which I do to some extent, but I'm going to spend a lot of time in the early part understanding the company, our priorities and make sure that we continue to execute on the rhythm and pace that Mark has set and what you guys have gotten used to because that's got like a stake on the table that I need to make sure I maintain. And then we'll hopefully, over the future quarters, have more substantive conversation with a lot of you about where we see the opportunity and if we need to do anything or not.
Ken Talanian: Great. And I guess, as a follow-up, just to circle back around GlobalProtect cloud. Is the primary use case there branch office applications? Or are you seeing broader interest in using the solutions instead of hardware?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. We’re seeing a few use cases, primarily, again, early on, one is branch, also second is mobile users as well. So I think both of those are drivers. We expect those to continue to be drivers in the future.
Ken Talanian: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator: We’ll go next to Walter Pritchard with Citi.
Walter Pritchard: Hi, thanks. Mark, as well congrats on finding a successor here that looks to fill your shoes at least mostly. On – a few questions for Kathy. One, just on – as we think about going into Q1, I know you’re not providing guidance for next year. But seasonality has been a bit moving around as the business has evolved. And I’m wondering what you could tell us about how you think about the shape of the year into next year with Q1. And then just had one follow-up question on the subscription side.
Kathy Bonanno: Sure. Thanks, Walter. Yes, we have definitely seen seasonality become a bigger factor in our business, and we are seeing pretty normal seasonality patterns with our strongest quarters sequentially in terms of sequential growth being Q2s and Q4s. And that continues to be the case, and I would expect that to continue into Q1.
Walter Pritchard: Great. And then on the subscription side, I’m wondering, you have two pieces there. One, I think is pretty easy for us to model with the – attaching to appliances. You’re seeing a continuation, it looks like, in three-year attach there. And then on the unattached side, you just have a number of new products, some acquired, some products you had for some time. Can you help us understand how the subscription side is splitting out and maybe relative growth rates between the attached and nonattached?
Kathy Bonanno: Sure. The nonattached business we mentioned at Analyst Day was on a $240 million run rate, growing very fast, growing at about 85% year-over-year. And so while it remains about – getting close to about 10% of our overall business, still a relatively small portion of our business, but growing much faster than the rest of the business because it’s newer and obviously a smaller portion of our business. And so just in terms of law of large numbers, growing much faster. We’re obviously adding more and more subscription offerings that are nonattached, and you’ll see that in the Application Framework as well. And so we do expect that the nonattached business will continue to become a bigger part of our business and will continue to grow very fast. The rest of the business is also growing very well. As you saw, our services billings growth rate was over 30% this quarter. And so the rest of the business continues to grow very fast. And the attached business, because it’s – nonattached business, because it’s a relatively small portion, doesn’t influence the overall growth rate to a significant degree at this point.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. If I could just make one other point. Kathy said at the end of Q2, we’ve given out the billings contribution run rate at about $240 million, growing very quickly. As you can see, that continues to go up over time. And I think probably the interesting thing about that is with that approaching 10% of the billings run rate, which is good, it’s against a very large base as well. And that base is continuing to grow very well. So if you think about the network security business and particularly the SaaS security services associated with it, that’s a large business growing very well in itself, right? So the level of contribution takes time for the nonattached to grow simply because it’s being matched against a large – very fast growing business as well.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer.
Shaul Eyal: Thank you. Good morning guys, congrats on the strong quarter and outlook. Nikesh, welcome onboard. Mark, we still have you onboard literally, so not saying goodbye here. One for Mark, one for Nikesh. Mark, on Europe, another strong quarter, up 35% year-over-year. Talk to us a little bit about the different dynamics you’re seeing in Europe than there was in the U.S., maybe how this GDPR in that context play into the equation.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, sure. So I’ll take the beginning. I’ll hand it over to Mark. He just came back from over there a little while ago. GDPR, this is a big picture, is driving a lot of interest in how do you use what we term state-of-the-art capabilities, particularly GDPR has a requirement – or avoiding liability that folks using state-of-the-art capabilities for cybersecurity. Of course, there's a definition to that, which is probably the right thing to do for regulators.  But it raises a lot of questions for customers, which are positive for us, which is how would you do that, that state-of-the-art capabilities. And we think everything that we provide, plus the platform, fits very uniquely here. Mark, can you just?
Mark Anderson: Yes. I think you nailed it, Mark. I think, for us, legislation like GDPR just heightens awareness of customers to do something different than what they've been doing for the last two decades. And I think I would highlight that and also highlight the fact that government over there, the EU as well as each of the individual countries in the EU, have never been more open to working with thought leaders like Palo Alto Networks to do things like share threat intelligence, have bilateral threat sharing agreements.  So I think our relevance in Europe, because of maybe a little more conservative group of countries, has really ramped in the last four or five quarters, and you've seen that in the performance. We get invited to the do a lot more.
Shaul Eyal: Nikesh, you're coming from SoftBank, invested heavily in security in recent years, I think the big $100 million check for cyber reason just about, I think, less than 18 months ago. Google appears to be eyeing security from afar, who knows what they might be doing down the road. It seems that security software requires a bit of a different DNA. I think Mark also – I think, phrased that point.  And second, before you plunge into the security software arena, if you could share with us your thoughts as to how security is being observed by the big tech company, the Google, the Amazon, the Microsoft. They haven't done a lot so much, so it could be a great opportunity on your end. So maybe just the second – the world is becoming crazy for you with Palo Alto. Just share with us maybe how the big tech behemoths view security.
Nikesh Arora: I think it's fair to say I had the privilege of working with the Google Enterprise team, which was a part, when I was at Google. And for the first time, as you see in the history of innovation, cloud came to the consumer first in a big way and is now slowly making it to the back of the enterprise. And Google's realized that, Microsoft's realized that, Amazon realized that. So they're all charging ahead with trying to address the cloud opportunity into the enterprises. I think that's great.  Having said that, given that they're all, to some degree, offering proprietary solutions to people where you can have one or the other, there's an important need for independent security team to look at it and see how we can take these massive amounts of data across multiple cloud offerings, provide a solution around it comprehensively to the end customer and have somebody who they can trust to be the arbiter between all these different offerings that they have.  So I think that's the big opportunity out there. Given that we're all going towards the cloud, given that these huge amounts of datasets are going to be created, we need to make sure we understand their aspirations and set our aspirations vis-à-vis them and provide the solution to the end customer. I think that's where the opportunity is.
Shaul Eyal: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from Michael Turits with Raymond James.
Michael Turits: Hey guys thank you very much. Mark, thanks for everything in many years. Nikesh, welcome. I'll come back to the M&A question and then I have a follow-up for Kathy.  On M&A, and let's just maybe say strategically products in general, Mark, there's still some very large areas of security that you're not in, email, DLT, identity. How are you thinking about those given the fact that you have done so much in terms of expanding in the last quarter or so?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. Great question, Michael. When we look at security, we think in terms of outcomes, meaning that if you're the CIO or the CISO for an enterprise, if you put technologies aside for a second, they have to solve for various outcomes. And in those – there might be eight or 10 of those depending on how broadly you define those, and they're not technical when you think about them.  The outcome that we're solving for customers is to stop all known threats and ideally stop all unknown threats or at least detect them very quickly and limit the damage, right? And that's a very, very large outcome statement and very important. That lives alongside other outcomes, like making sure you can withstand a massive denial of service attack, for example.  And we've been particularly focused over the years in ensuring that whatever outcomes we choose to solve for our customers, that we bring something unique to the table in a highly competitive way. Now those outcomes blend over time as well, and that's why we've done a lot of very strong partnerships in the identity space, for example, something you just mentioned; on the messaging security space with Proofpoint, something you just mentioned as well, so that we can make sure that the customer using the best capabilities from the vendors who are solving these outcomes doesn't have to be the back-end systems integrator themselves for that. And they really appreciate that. But bringing that holistic picture to the table and solving those outcomes for customers is very important.
Michael Turits: Great, thanks. And then for Kathy, thanks for detailing the impact on expenses and cash flow, the acquisitions in this quarter. How do those acquisitions – [and those have been particularly], again, very strong investment. How do those acquisitions impact margin expansion next year? You've talked in the framework about 150 to 250 basis points. Are we on track to that even with these acquisitions?
Kathleen Bonanno: Yes. We have talked about organic operating margin expansion of 150 basis points to 250 basis points. The Q4 guidance that we've given is that we plan to invest between $10 million to $12 million, and that equates to $0.08 to $0.10 per share on our recent acquisitions, outside of the organic operating margin expansion that we are working towards for the full fiscal year.
Michael Turits: Okay. No early thoughts on next year, though?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, it's pretty early.
Kathleen Bonanno: Yes. We're still working on our planning, obviously. But we have been obviously committed to that framework, and growth and profitability remain very important to the company.
Operator: Our final question will come from Rob Owens with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Rob Owens: Well, under the wire. Thanks guys for taking my question. With regard to products revenue and the five quarters of acceleration that you've seen – [indiscernible] suppose, I guess, where are your competitors are, and we've actually seen meaningful deceleration. Can you talk about your win rates and whether or not you think those are ticking up? Or is your success more a function of ASPs at this point? And then number two, Mark Anderson mentioned hardware cycles come and hardware cycles go, which begs the question, do we think one's coming? Or do we think we're going at this point? And were one to come, how could that possibly be reflected in customer acquisition and those numbers you're showing there? Thanks.
Mark McLaughlin: Maybe you can take them in reverse, and I'll do the cycle racing [ph].
Mark Anderson: Yes.
Mark McLaughlin: Everybody is saying Mark here [ph].
Mark Anderson: So I think on the cycle one, Rob, over time, if you take a snapshot back of 10, 15 years long period of time, you see the cycles in 4 or 7 years, it's a little hard to nail that down of buying patterns here. What I think what Mark was saying is that regardless of what cycle they're in, Palo Alto Networks continues to outperform everybody in the market. You can see that in all through the last 10 years as a matter of fact and including very recently the last four quarters as well. Our job, we think, is to make sure that we have the most competitive offering in the market, and we'll always be taking market share. And we're very confident we'll be able to do that.
Mark McLaughlin: Just big picture, Rob, we've got low double-digit market share or we prosecute low double-digit market share in about a $20 billion total addressable market. So I think both in terms of new customer opportunities, if customers want to -- if they're going to make a change for security, they're going to look to the thought leader. And for existing customer expansion, we're just starting to hit the veins of significant customer sizes from the cohorts that we saw big customer growth in the last 5 or 6 years. So I think both give us tremendous opportunities to grow the business, and I think that's what gives us the confidence that's embedded into our guide.
Rob Owens: Then the long competitive win rate lines.
Mark Anderson: Competitive win rates, like I said it earlier, I think I feel bad sometimes for our competitors because they're trying to sell either stitched together acquisitions that look like Frankenstein's monster or they're trying to sell point products against an architecture. And I think we've developed this platform over the last dozen years organically, primarily with some small technology tuck-ins that really drive the automation that's needed in the digital age.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. And we've seen win rates be very consistently high, Rob, against all competitors [ph].
Rob Owens: Great. Thanks guys and cheers, Mark.
Mark McLaughlin: Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Okay, I think that was our last question. So I'd like to close off, I want to thank everybody here, all the employees of Palo Alto Networks, our customers and our partners for the privilege of working with you. For me, it's been a really amazing experience. I want to thank everybody for their time this morning for the call. We look forward to seeing a lot of you in the upcoming future. Take care.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Mark McLaughlin: Thank you, Kelsey. And thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon for our fiscal second quarter 2018 results. I am pleased to report that we delivered a strong second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 revenue is $542 million, up 28%. Billings were $675 million, up 20%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 20.5% and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.97. In the quarter, we continued to see healthy security spending and strong demand for our next-generation security platform. With the addition of close to 3,000 new customers in the quarter, we are privileged to now serve approximately 48,000 customers around the world. In addition to robust new customer acquisition, we also continue to rapidly increase our wallet share and existing customers.  Our top 25 customers, all of which made a purchase in this quarter spent a minimum of $25.6 million in lifetime value in Q2, 54% increase over the $16.6 million in Q2 of fiscal 2017. Specific examples of customer wins and competitive split displacements in the quarter included a Cisco replacement to secure the global network of one of Europe's largest manufacturing companies with more than 150 branch offices and factories, a legacy AV replacement and competitive win against multiple standalone next-gen end point providers in a US-based hospital system on tens of thousands of endpoints, a checkpoint replacement to secure 2,000 gas stations with our VM series and a deal with a global oil company, a seven-figure on-premise deal with the global retailer that started with us as an Amazon Marketplace customer, and an expansion deal with one of the world's largest insurance companies to implement GlobalProtect Cloud Service to secure hundreds of branch offices and tens of thousands of mobile users. We continue to see customers adopt and expand the uses of our platform at rapid rates. The world is undergoing a digital transformation that is driving massive productivity gains. However, this digital transformation is also creating significant cyber risk that requires a corresponding security transformation. At Palo Alto Networks, we have been consistently delivering on the transformation of security through increasingly rapid technical evolutions to build on each other, reinforce each other, share the attributes of automation, leverage, consistency, and ease of use, and get more powerful and valuable through the ecosystem growth. A decade ago, we introduced the first evolution of security with the creation of the next-generation firewall and cloud-delivered network security services designed to improve security outcomes through integration and automation. And we continue to innovate on the foundational elements of the first evolution, most recently with last week's announcement a PAN-OS8.1, the PA3200 series with three models, the PA5280, the ruggedized PA220R and two new models of M-Series management appliances. Our new 8.1 software, it adds over 60 new features to our next generation firewall including more granular control SaaS applications, expanded SSL decryption capabilities, making it easier to secure encrypted traffic, many features to simplify the adoption of security best practices and much more. In addition, the new hardware appliances increase SSL decryption throughput, bringing higher performance and capacity for securing large data centers, and provide additional stability for managing large firewall deployments. We're very excited by these recent announcements that complement the hardware and software we introduced last year and further expand our technology leadership. And building on the first evolution, five years ago we drove the second evolution, which is extending the capabilities of our platform to consistently secure customers data, no matter where it resides from the network, to the end point, and throughout the cloud and SaaS applications. In Q2, we continued to innovate in second evolution. We enhanced our partnership with AWS, where we are now the only security vendor to achieve AWS networking competency status, which recognizes that we provide proven technology and deep expertise in helping customers adopt, develop, and deploy networks in AWS. This complements the AWS and security competency we achieved in 2016. And just a few weeks ago, we hosted a global cloud security event for over 15,000 attendees, where we announced additional second evolution advancements including Traps for Linux, provided insights into how customers can accelerate to move to the cloud, featured our cloud partnerships and announced new cloud capabilities.  These include enhanced features for Azure in AWS environment, simplified and centralized management for all major cloud platforms, automated integrations for frictionless workflows in multi cloud environments, and extending protection to the Google Cloud platform. The announcements were very well received by our customers and further established our leadership point in endpoint in cloud security. These first steps two evolutions are the building blocks required to make the third evolution in security, the application framework a reality. Customer reaction has been very enthusiastic as they see the superior security and agility that can be achieved by using innovative, security applications that leverage the data from their existing Palo Alto Networks platform deployments and providing increasing value for their investments with Palo Alto Networks. We will develop some of these applications ourselves, while others will be built by third parties. Earlier this month, we introduced our newest application, Magnifier, in the Application framework. Tightly integrated with our next generation security platform and a logging service, this cloud based behavioral analytics application which we acquired in LightCyber, enables highly accurate attack detection powered by scalable, cloud based machine learning. We are very excited about the application framework and look forward to the availability of framework's third-party applications in the coming months.  These evolutions have resulted in a large and quickly growing global -- global ecosystem of customers leveraging the automation, orchestration, consistency and ease of use achieved through our platform. Of our approximately 48,000 customers globally, approximately 42,000 are using threat prevention, approximately 35,000 are using URL filtering, approximately 23,000 are using WildFire and approximately 7,000 are using GlobalProtect. And our endpoint and cloud offerings are also experiencing significant growth and adoption. More than 2,200 customers using Traps with over 3 million endpoints under protection, while approximately 5,000 customers are using our cloud offerings, including over dozen who have already adopted our new GlobalProtect cloud service, which delivers our next-generation security capabilities in the cloud.  Endpoint and cloud, together with their application framework offerings of AutoFocus, Magnifier, and logging service are growing very quickly with the Q2 billings exit run rate of approximately $240 million growing over 85% year-over-year. And we are very excited about the future of these offerings.  With digital transformation, the threat landscape will constantly evolve which is why security transformation is critical. We will continue to focus on delivering technology evolutions that push the boundaries of today's capabilities and lead the way to the security paradigm of the future.  I want to thank our employees for their relentless dedication to our customers, our partners for their continued support and our customers for placing their trust in Palo Alto Networks.  And with that I'll turn the call over to Kathy.
Kathy Bonanno : Thanks Mar. Before I start I'd like to note that except for revenue and billings figures, all financial figures are non-GAAP and growth rates are compared to the prior year period unless stated otherwise. I am very pleased with our second quarter execution, as we continue to add new customers at a rapid pace while also driving robust expansion business. We are seeing a high degree of interest across our platform which further extends our leadership position. With a consistent results of us growing faster than our competitors at scale. In addition to market leading growth, in Q2 we again expanded non-GAAP operating margin, delivered record non-GAAP EPS and generated strong cash flow. In Q2, total revenue grew 28% to a record $542.4 million. Looking at the geographic growth of Q2 revenue, the Americas grew 26%, EMEA grew 35% and APAC grew 33%. Q2 product revenue of $202.2 million grew 20% compared to the prior year. Sales of the new hardware which we launched in fiscal Q3, 2017 continued to perform well with both new and existing customers. Q2 SaaS based subscription revenue of $183.3 million increased 36%. The support revenue of $156.9 million increased 31%. In total, subscription and support revenue of $340.2 million increased 34% accounted for a 63% share of total revenues. Turning to billing, Q2, total billings of $674.6 million increased 20%. The dollar-weighted contract duration for new subscription and support billings in the quarter was approximately three years essentially flat compared to the prior year period. For the first half of fiscal 2018. Billings of $1.3 billion increased 18% year-over-year. Product billings were $387.2 million, up16% and accounted for 30% of total billings.  Subscription billings were $492.6 million, up 24%. Support billings were $391.3 million, up 12%. Renewal rates for our SaaS subscription business are strong at more than 90% while renewal rates for support are approximately 100%. Total deferred revenue at the end of Q2 $2 billion, an increased 33%. Q2 gross margin with 75.9%, which was down 270 basis points compared to last year. The decline was primarily attributable to the very strong traction we continue to see with the new products introduced in the third quarter of last fiscal year. Q2 operating expenses were $300.1 million or 55.4% of revenue which is a 350 basis point improvement year-over-year driven primarily by ongoing increasing leverage in sales and marketing. Operating margin was 20.5%, an increase of 80 basis points. We ended the second quarter with 4,833 employees. Non- GAAP net income for the second quarter grew 54% to $91.5 million or $0.97 per diluted share, excluding the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, second quarter non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $80.9 million and $0.86 respectively. The Act lowered our Q2 non-GAAP effective tax rate to 22% from the previously guided rate of 31%. On a GAAP basis for the second quarter, net loss decreased 42% to $34.9 million, or $0.38 per basic and diluted share. Turning to cash flows and balance sheet items. We finished January with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $2.4 billion. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 863,000 shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $145 per share, leaving a balance of approximately $330 million available for ongoing repurchases through December 2018.  Turning to cash flow. Q2 cash flow from operations of $243.7 million increased 14%. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $25.6 million. Free cash flow with $218.1 million, up 29% at a margin of 40.2 %. DSO was 59 days, a decline of 19 days from the prior year period.  Turning now to guidance and modeling points. Please remember this guidance takes into account the type of forward-looking information that Kelsey referred to earlier. Our fiscal third quarter and fiscal year 2018 includes the company's updated non-GAAP effective tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The updated non- GAAP effective tax rate of 22% is a reduction from our previously guided non-GAAP effective tax rate of 31%. For fiscal Q3, 2018, we expect revenue to be in the range of $538 million to $548 million, an increase of 25% to 27% year-over-year. Products revenue to be in the range of $193 million to $196 million, an increase of 18% to 19% year-over-year. Billings to be in the range of $665 million to $680 million, an increase of to 22% to 25% year-over-year. Using the updated non-GAAP effective tax rate of 22%, we expect non- GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.94 to $96 using approximately 94.5 and 96.5 million shares. This EPS range includes a benefit of approximately $0.11 due to the new non- GAAP tax rate. And we expect capital expenditures for fiscal Q3, 2018 to be approximately $25 million. For the full year fiscal 2018, we are raising our guidance across all metrics and now expect revenue to be in the range of $2.190 billion to $2.220 billion, representing growth of to 24% to 26% percent year-over-year. Product revenues to be in the range of $810 million to $820 million, representing growth of 14% to 16% year-over-year. Billings to be in the range of $2.715 billion to $2.770 billion, representing growth of 18% to 21% year-over-year. We also expect a full-year weighted average non- GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 24% which includes fiscal Q1 at the prior tax rate of 31%, and the remainder of the year at the revised lower tax rate of 22%. Using this updated tax rate, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.84 to $3.91 using 94 to 96 million shares. This EPS guidance includes a benefit of approximately $0.36 from our new full-year non-GAAP tax rate.  And we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million dollars. Before I conclude, I'd like to provide some additional modeling points for the fiscal year. We continue to expect fiscal Q2 and fiscal Q4 to have the strongest sequential total revenue growth. As reflected in consensus heading into this call our non- GAAP EPS guidance continues to include approximately 150 basis points of organic operating margin expansion excluding first-half investments associated with the LightCyber acquisition. Our fiscal Q4 non-GAAP effective tax rate will be 22% and we expect fiscal year free cash flow margin to be in the range of to 39% to 40%. Before we turn the call over to the operator for questions, I'm happy to announce that [Jean Compo] formerly Senior Vice President Accounting and Corporate Controller has been appointed Chief Accounting Officer with ongoing responsibility for accounting and tax functions. Jean had joined us in 2012 has 20 years business experience having held senior accounting or corporate controller positions at various technology companies. Congratulations Jean.  Operator, please post the questions.
Operator: Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray.
Andrew Nowinski: Hi, great. Thanks for a nice corner and thanks for taking the question. I guess I want to ask about Pan OS8.1. You talked about some of the new SSL encryption capabilities in that platform. Are your customers seeing an increase in encrypted traffic coming into the data centers? And are the new features that address this problem, a free upgrade for customers and/or could that potentially drive a refresh cycle?
Mark McLaughlin : Andy, it is Mark. Good question, yes, we're seeing across the board an increase in encrypted traffic, that's been the case for quite some time actually, it's not uncommon for us to see in a customer environment north of 35% - 40% of all traffic being encrypted these days just simply because the bad guys know that the legacy technology is not going to be able to decrypt it or if it can, it can't do it fast enough to have traffic continue to be, in essence of the real-time aspect it has to be. So we've been continuously trying to improve the capabilities there. Every release we've done has improved SSL decryption throughput. The release of the new hardware has about 20 times your performance which is fantastic and the 8.1 software also has capabilities in it as well to help with throughput and performance. As you know, I think for our operating system we don't charge extra for that, so those are features and functionality that go into the software just to make us better and better and better all the time. So we hopefully will continue to be sticky. And then the last point of the question as far as upgrades and refresh capabilities, yes, anything that has an opportunity for us to speak with customers about new use cases is a great opportunity as well for refresh and upgrade and expansion.
Andrew Nowinski: Okay, thanks and then maybe just as a quick follow-up. I see you launched another service as part of the application framework. Can you just give us an update on the progress the third parties have made regarding the development of applications that could start to contribute revenue to your framework?
Mark McLaughlin : Yes, sure. Just briefly the one we launched is called magnifier, and that came to us through the LightCyber acquisition last year. So we're super happy to see that go live. Basically, LightCyber has a fantastic behavior analytics capability. It formerly would be something that you would have to plug in as another piece of hardware, it’s somewhere in your environment. So we've taken the algorithm out and made it the application. So it's a SaaS application in the application framework, and that's the theory behind the application framework in a lot of cases. Third party-wise working about 30 companies right now to get their applications live and we expect that to happen in the coming months here. We're excited about that and just stay tuned as we progress through there. In the Spring, you’ll hear more about that. 
Operator: Our four our next question we will go to Michael Turits with Raymond James.
Michael Turits: Hey, guys. Really strong quarter and again a really strong quarter on product. Last quarter you talked about some of the things that really drove hardware and product. Can you drill down a little bit on that this quarter and especially the extent to which some of that may be coming from a product refresh cycle?
Mark McLaughlin : Yes, Michael, yes, we had a good quarter across the board on the entire platform, it is really -- we’re really pleased to see the market coming to the platform for all three of the evolutions that we had driven and obviously product is performing very well indeed. So we are super happy to see that. As we said coming into the year that on the refresh side that's a net positive for the company, and we expect that to continue to be the case, but it wouldn't be the primary driver for hardware in the year, and that is still the case. So we're seeing the over performance being driven from new customer acquisition, you can see it's really high in expansion business as well. Refresh is going very well lately, but it’s still not the major driver for the business. So we think that's something that is in front of us which will be great.
Michael Turits: And just a follow up and maybe just more drill down, I think the service provider was really strong, high end chassis were strong last quarter, did that continue and was that a material part of the upside this time?
Mark McLaughlin : Yes. Our service provider business is doing very well for us. Last quarter, we had said that on the hardware side we had seen some over performance on hardware dollars associated specifically with what's called NBC cards, those are slot cards you put into the chassis and we saw more than usual. This quarter was nothing unique in that regard. So back to kind of normal run rates we see along that. So that's what we talked about last quarter for some of the hardware over performance, but the service provider business in general is doing well for us and continues to grow. We expect that to keep going as we said every time we do a release whether it’s hardware or software, we've been adding more features and functionalities to make us continually more attractive for service providers.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.
Matthew Hedberg: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats from me as well. Maybe for Mark the product refresh it seems to be moving along nicely and clearly you called out growth in SaaS and something emerging products was strong there. I'm curious if you could drill down a little bit on pricing both within kind of core firewall but also some of the newer products that are seeing quite a bit of growth?
Mark McLaughlin : Yes. That's a great question, Matt. We are absolutely selling the value proposition of the entire platform which has all those three evolutions go into an automation, orchestration and consistency and now entirely new consumption model with the application framework. And I mentioned that because that allows us from a pricing perspective to be on the one hand very competitive, but also on the other hand to be able to not have to sell two prices as many, many of our competitors continue to do. So is this example in this quarter that we saw a discounting improve again sequentially in year-over-year. We've seen that for number of quarters now which is fantastic. Our team I think is done a great job of selling to value and selling to the strategic nature of the platform.
Matthew Hedberg: It's great and then I'm not sure if Mark Anderson on the call but EMEA looked like it was particularly strong this quarter. A lot of us have been talking about GDPR as a potential driver this year. I'm curious is that showing up is just dialogue at this point or is it actually driving real deals as far as you can tell?
Mark Anderson: Yes, I am in. GDPR I think or any other phenomena that drives awareness for companies to build better security defenses. There's a good thing for us because it allows us to get in front of people that have budget and show how differentiated we are from our competitors. So I think we've got a good talk track on GDPR and more importantly it's backed up with the supreme, supremely better security. In terms of attaching it to deals I think, I think we've been I think considered in Europe the thought leader for security for a couple of years now. And I think more than anything else just the awareness that customers have about what we can do for them as ramped as we built out a very nice team and great partner covers there.
Operator: We'll go now to Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company.
Gregg Moskowitz: Okay, thank you very much and let my congratulations as well. Mark, more recently seen excessively widened the gap on those [Indiscernible], and I'm wondering if you are seeing any changes in the competitive landscape or in your view is this just a function of having fixtures go-to-marketing through this [Indiscernible] 
Mark McLaughlin : Yes, Gregg. Kind of broken up there I think the question was competitive differentiation is that summary? It is tough to hear you? 
Gregg Moskowitz: That's exactly right Mark. Just -- the widening gap that we've seen on growth versus your peers. Thanks.
Mark McLaughlin : Great, okay, thanks. Yes, well thanks for noticing. Yes, we continue to perform very well in the market we think and we are growing it outside rate relative to the competition and its scale a couple billion dollars. Its size right now so that's not insignificant and I think that's due to the fact that the platform approach we've taken is really resonating with customers. A lot of security vendors all sound and same when they talk about automation and integration and vendor reduction things along those lines, but what we found and we found it to be a competitive advantage for us is the architecture really matters, so we can sit with customer and say this is how we've done it over time . We have a very high degree of confidence because we primarily built most of ourselves that it actually works together, does drive that automation it, does drive their orchestration and increasingly at scale you can see the consistency from network to cloud endpoints as well. It's really resonating with the customers and I think that's showing through with the results.
Mark Anderson : And if I could just add I think you're comparing the just a vast amount of innovation that our engineering team is cranked out in the last year. If you just think about the new products, new services, new capabilities, the new features and the two new versions of operating system that come out, it really does separate us from anybody else.
Gregg Moskowitz: Okay, terrific and then for my follow-up, I'm curious since older appliances like the PA-2000 and PA-3000 can run on Pan OS8.X, is that driving some incremental refresh at this point or do you think that it will go in public? 
Mark McLaughlin : Not, doesn't appear to be the case now and yes I think anytime we have more different or new operating systems and new hardware that gives a great reason to talk to customers and hopefully get them to upgrade things along the lines, but those two things particularly I wouldn't call that, yes.
Operator: We will go next to Sterling Auty with JP Morgan.
Sterling Auty: Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Looking at the -- I think it's the Billings for a subscription support that grew 24%. I'm just curious any FX or duration type of impact that that would have prevented that from growing even faster and when you look at the first half over first half?
Mark McLaughlin : No, Sterling. There is a very minimal FX inside of here and then we priced in US dollars and then on the duration side duration has been very steady for about --it's very steadied about three years for quite some time now.
Sterling Auty: Okay and then the one follow-up. I think you called out the endpoint plus cloud bookings run rate like run 240. I think at the Analyst Day you talked about a 140 run rate. Can you kind of compare and contrast what was the timeframe for the 140 and is this just seeing a lot more customers moving into production and just buying a lot more expansion that's driving that growth?
Mark McLaughlin : Yes, sure. So at the Analyst Day we talked about a $140 million run rate now as the Q4 billing run rate and today we gave you the Q2 billings run rate. So we are trying to do the apples-to-apples along that. You can see it's growing very nicely. It starting contributing pretty well as close to getting to be like nine percentage or ten percentage of total Billings contribution overall, which is great. You can also considering if you strip it out the other portions growing it close to 20% in size of billings as well 9 times bigger. So I think the whole platform is selling very well and as far as which driving they're non-attached, a lot of the capabilities are very good in and of themselves. And I think customers are increasingly realizing the value of the consistency aspect of being able to have the same security outcomes and network cloud endpoints. And then just to make that even better we put the application framework on top of that, and said for all those things that you're deploying from top of the network so you've got consistency, we're going to drive even more value over the top for every dollar you spend with us down there.
Kathy Bonanno: And just a point of clarification there 140 was for our cloud and end point which we broke out separately in our Analyst Day presentation .And the number that we provided today included auto focus which was a separate category at Analyst Day. 
Mark McLaughlin : Which is what? Do you know it? 
Kathy Bonanno: Yes, 50, sorry, I am sorry $15 million.
Mark McLaughlin : Yes. $15 million, sorry at 90%, right. So you add those together, Sterling, so we had $140 million plus $15 million and at auto $155 million blended mix of somewhere between 85% and 90% and now we've put those together into $240 million growing it over 85%. 
Kathy Bonanno: There you go.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Catherine [Indiscernible] 
Unidentified Analyst : Thanks for taking my question, excellent quarter. Now could you dig a little bit more into the cloud and how differentiated you are from your competitors? It seems to be that's an area that you continue to wide the gap on and particularly what are the cylinders or products or services that are driving and widening that gap? Thank you. 
Mark McLaughlin : Sure. Thanks Catherine. We've been at cloud security now for over five years in the second evolution which I talked a lot about in the script which is making sure we have that consistency. So when we're talking about cloud security there's a number of aspects inside of there about delivering security from the cloud, using cloud as a third party infrastructure, as well and making sure we can secure that for folks and also making sure that we can provide the same seamless security and third party SaaS applications as well. You kind of think about the approach we've taken, we've been very native with third party providers like AWS and Azure. And now you may have noticed we just announced support for the Google Cloud platform which I talked about in the script as well. So we have all the major platforms covered and inside all this platforms, we think in a very native approach to not only protect I call the networking aspect so that would be M Series but also protecting the hosts we just announced Traps for Linux which is very Linux which is very important in cloud environments, and then also with on an API basis with Aperture for both SaaS and public cloud as well. So increasing things like visibility, compliance and storage security. So we're making a lot of progress at that. You may have also heard me talk about an addition having security competency with AWS, we are the only security of energy at networking competency as well which is kind of interesting because when some security vendors try to go to the cloud they want to just virtualize something. You can take into the cloud as opposed to working very natively with the cloud providers and really using their tools and capabilities as well so that we can do lots of creative things along with them like order scaling and load balancing that really take advantage of their network capabilities as well. So lots and lots going on there we think the cloud is super important. Customers are talking about the cloud for sure, some of them are moving rapidly in that direction and we're absolutely in front of all that we believe with it with the customer base and increasingly thought us thought leaders there and also the technology leaders as well.
Mark Anderson : I just add one thing there Catherine. It's Mark here. The go-to-market relationships that we have with all three of these large public cloud vendors is really strong, they're becoming very important distribution partners for us.
Operator: We will take next question from Ken Tulane Ian with ever core ISI.
Ken Talanian: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back on product. I was wondering if you could actually rank order the drivers of product growth in the quarter and how, if at all, you expect that to change in the back half of the year. 
Mark McLaughlin : Sure. Well, I don't think it's going to change much in the back half of they year, Ken. This is Mark by the way there's really three drivers in there, and I order in this direction the first is expansion opportunities in the customer base, that's simply a magnitude statement when you have this large customer bases we have, and they continue to buy from us along the way for their needs and use cases. That's going to drive a lot of business. And we have new customer acquisition as well. You can see we just put up another close another 3,000 net customers so that's very helpful as well. And then a third is the refresh opportunity which continues to grow over time. And of course adding more customers helps at in the long term. I don't see that changing the rest of the fiscal year there.
Ken Talanian: Okay. Great. And as a follow-up, you have another hardware release out there. I was wondering if you could tell us when gross margin might normalize. 
Mark McLaughlin : Yes. It's a great question. So on the gross -- on product gross margin side, there's really two dynamics at play here. So we have the product gross margins on the new hardware itself right, and then we have the mix of the new hardware in the total hardware mix. So the product gross margin declines we've seen for the last few quarters are due to the mix increase of the new hardware. So let me let me break that down for just a second for you. So when we launched new products last year, we're going to naturally start off with lower margins on them and then they're going to improve over time. Now we've seen along the way higher memory and component costs, but even with that dynamic in play we've continued to have modest improvements each quarter since we release the new hardware. And we expect that's going to continue, but at the same time that's kind of be an offset with the mix of the newer of all the hardware, still having more and more new hardware as well, so the mixes will drag down the product risk margins along the way. So we're sitting here at the mid-year with an increased product guide, another great set of new hardware, we just put on a market last week and some headwinds on component pricing so we're expecting that we're going to see the same this mix dynamics to continue throughout the at the end of the year, but we expect the total gross margins to be basically in a zip code where we are today and then of course as you can see we're continuing to manage the business that we didn't get continued operating leverage.
Operator: We'll go next to John DiFucci with Jefferies.
John DiFucci: Thank you can you can add, a lot of people do, no problem. Kathy, I want to ask you question on the numbers but the numbers are really clean and they look really good so may be go to Mark. Mark, these new products that you just came out with over the last I guess week or two. Do you see I just want to make sure because we try to model this -- do you see these more as evolutions or upgrades to existing products or these brand new offerings that sort of fill some holes in your current portfolio on the range of next generation around the range of firewalls?
Mark McLaughlin : Yes. I think of the kind of both ways John. So as we said in the past if you or the way we think about it with customers is customers are going to have various use cases that you're trying to solve for overtime and then these use cases have different price performance requirements, if you want to be competitive in the market right. So if I laid out all the hardware capabilities and Panorama M series, I should throw in there as well, so laid them out in the table where these kind of get left to right you know smaller form factors and throughput all the way up there really big ones, and then what we've been doing is filling it in every year right along the way of putting more and more capabilities in there or form factors in there at the right price performance or the use cases, and that of course then makes us more competitive. So the competitors can't come in over top or underneath us from a pricing perspective with throughout. So that's what we would expect that we continue to into the futures just make sure that we're always solving for that. Those don't stand still the SSL decryption needs for example, as those go up over time, that's going to drive up throughput, so we want to make sure we got the right throughput capabilities there.
John DiFucci: Okay, okay thanks in it and if I could I know you give some billings metrics but when we take a look at this and we kind of try to back into new product excluding refresh and new subscriptions excluding renewals, the new product numbers look stronger than the new subscription. And, first of all, I guess is that right I guess directionally and what is -- is that do I mean now if you're seeing some benefit from product refresh that would be one cause of that but just is that what's happening here?
Mark McLaughlin : I think well I'm not sure there's -- I am not sure exactly the questions. Let me try to answer what I think it is though but you know with when customers are purchasing from us or starting out with us right on purchases if you look at the lifetime value creation over time, it takes time to get maximum lifetime value creation which by the way is not standing still, right. So when you go into the mix of what customers are buying from us over time with hardware services with attached, non-attached services and then they're going to lap over, they're going to renew their support, they renew subscriptions because a chance to sell more stuff the lifetime value I think naturally grows over time with our customers. 
Operator: We will take our next question from Rob Owens with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Rob Owens: Great, good afternoon, everyone. I was curious on Traps and some of the big wins you saw. Are you the exclusive --are you exclusive to the endpoint at that point? Are you complementary to someone else? And in those bake-offs, who are you seeing typically?
Mark McLaughlin : Sure. Hey, Bob, it's Mark. I'll take those in reverse and as far as we see, we see everybody a lot primarily we're going to see -- we're going to see the legacy incumbent folks in there who are providing AV protection and our best and doing a good job in taking them out. And then we see a lot of next-gen folks and there as well next-gen import providers who are also trying to do the same thing. And in your first question, it's a mix. Sometimes we get to be the -- we get to be the only provider when we're done. Other times we may be run as a complement or sometime because you have to think of endpoints as suites as well because there's other capabilities endpoints that we don't have like the LP full-on TLPK capabilities for example so that we continue to run different endpoints providers, but not specifically for the security functions we've got.
Rob Owens: And second you mentioned that when your subscription support up front it's typically three years. What is look like on a renewal?
Mark McLaughlin : Renewals have been very consistent for quite some time on a steady range it's not really changed. So it's been pretty consistent the overall renewals as heard us say about three years. 
Rob Owens: That's three years as well okay thank you.
Mark McLaughlin : I am sorry Rob, just to be clear, the overall duration is about three years and inside of that for renewal durations those have been in a steady range for quite some time inside of that number, yes. 
Rob Owens: Okay.
Mark McLaughlin : Just want to clarify. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Fatima Boolani with UBS.
Fatima Boolani: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Mark, a question for you, you spoke about the first ruggedized appliance in your portfolio about last week. And I'm wondering how you think about this broader opportunity around protection of critical and industrial control systems? And maybe your perspective on why this particular area has kind of been habitually under invested and follow-up Kathy if I may.
Mark McLaughlin : Sure, great. Yes, so on the questions really about the PA820R which is the ruggedized version of PA820 which is a great opportunity for us. A lot of our customers which are in environments where it would we consider these not just IT capabilities but OT capabilities, ICS state environments, harsh environments, where the line is blurring between IT and OT, they want to have the same capabilities that Palo Alto Networks provides, but they want them in those harsh environments and number of folks asked us when you ruggedized 220 because that's a great form factor for oil rigs for example in different places it might be you know utility substations and things along those lines. So they actually should have been doing that kind of themselves with different contract manufacturers or ruggedized equipment for us. So we said well we can do that so that was the impetus to launch the PA820. Now what that does for us is with customers who already like our capabilities, it gives us whole new outlets of where to install this hardware because it can now go into those environments or require those ruggedized capabilities. Kathy, I'll let you take over the next part of it. 
Fatima Boolani: Thank you. That's really helpful. And Kathy is the portfolio expands and begins supporting with clouds services like GlobalProtect. And what are the implications for your CapEx profile, and how are you thinking about that this year and at a qualitative level for next year in the years out?
Kathy Bonanno: Yes, thanks. We are definitely investing in our application framework as we look to deliver more cloud delivered services. Obviously, that requires a bit of infrastructure investment. And so the $100 million CapEx number that we've provided as full-year guidance in fiscal 2018 definitely includes an investment in that infrastructure. And I think we would expect that to be ongoing and continue as we build out the application framework.
Mark McLaughlin : Yes, and logging service as well so some of the new services that were brought to market are a good amount of infrastructure and back end like logging for example that's not an expensive to do that.
Operator: For our next question, we'll go to the Jonathan Ho with William Blair. 
Jonathan Ho: Good afternoon and congratulations on the strong result. Just wanted to start out with the salesforce and in terms of the sales execution challenges that you guys saw last year. How should we be thinking about in sort of the room for productivity enhancements and maybe where we are in terms of correcting those challenges? 
Mark Anderson: Hey, Jonathan. Mark Anderson here. Thanks for the question. Yes, so I think on the salesforce rework that we started working about a year ago I think I got really compliment Dave Peranich for doing a terrific job of restructuring and getting the right butts and seats to focus on the right customers and clearly driving the right outcomes. From a productivity standpoint, very happy with the productivity improvements that we've seen. We talked about that in Analyst Day and we still see it will continued improvements there. I think with all the new services and the new products that we have we've got more arrows in the quiver for the sales reps and out there and I think we're optimistic in being able to see improvements there.
Mark McLaughlin : Yes. We are expecting in our guide we gave for the second half year as well that there will be continued productivity improvements.
Jonathan Ho: Got it and then and as we look at sort of the tax rate reduction, as well as the strong balance sheet that you have. How should we think about use of capital on going forward?
Mark McLaughlin : Yes. We take a very traditional approach that Jonathan, but really looking at three possible uses of capital. The first and most important in our opinion would be to invest back into business assuming we can get the right rate of returns on that. We invest very nicely into business as you can see involves continuing to drive leverage and capturing market share along the way to do that so we feel like that's working out for us. The second priority would be if we see technology capabilities in the market that we like that we think could help accelerate the evolutions that we've been driving for some time. We've demonstrated the ability to go to market and do some M&A to do that and could be the case in the future for us. And then the third is if we are not doing the first two, we've also demonstrated the ability to return by the shareholders primarily through stock repurchases while maintaining a good healthy balance sheet for any offerings. 
Operator: We'll go next to Anne Meisner with Susquehanna.
Anne Meisner: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. At Analyst Day, you talked about bifurcating AI tools along with your customer data to better implement some customer targeting program. Can you give us an update on that and what your strategies have resulted from that initiative? And then in particular, as it relates to that refresh cycle, whether you think its helping you optimize that opportunity?
Mark McLaughlin : Yes. And that's a great question, and really appreciate the fact that you took note that it Analyst Day because we're really a data driven company here. So lots of mathematicians running around and including in the marketing department as well as their CIO organization, which are using and harnessing the same kind of AI machine learning capabilities that you are coming through our product sets. So the number of the things that we talked about at Analyst Day that our tools for our sales team to use like things called quota crusher for example, and the deal doctor those are using AI capabilities to tell our sales rep what is the next thing you should do with this customer or recommend for example or if you want to maximize your earnings this is how do you how to do that. And those are being very heavily used by our team as well as our partners at the better and better effect. So as we continue to train those tools they get better so again going back to the last question that just came up in productivity, I would definitely put some of the productivity growth that we're seeing from the sales team in this bucket which has given them fantastic tools to use in order to grow the productivity.
Operator: We will next to Saket Kalia with Barclays.
Saket Kalia: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions here. First maybe for you Kathy just a quick accounting question on product. Could you just talk about how the accounting for VM series works? Meaning could we see any carve out of VM series in the product line as that business gets bigger or perhaps his accounting rules change. Just any color and how VM series could or could not impact a product line down the road?
Kathy Bonanno: Well, the VM series is really should not change the categorization of where we put revenue one way or the other.
Mark McLaughlin : Yes. Saket, you may have heard in the past you know we talked about the VM Series historically a long time ahead like the two flavors are perpetual, right and non-perpetual. And the perpetual piece would go into product that's pretty much going on like. It's just almost nothing there, so every time you here's talk about the VM-series it's going to go into a ratable line for us. 
Saket Kalia: Got it, that's super helpful. Maybe a follow up for you Mark. Kind of a follow up from last quarter actually but can you just talk about how the application framework is changing conversations with customers and maybe tying it to this quarter whether the application point frame is actually helping the core network security business at all?
Mark McLaughlin : Yes. It's -- I think it's definitely helping their overall business across the board. And as far as the conversation with customers a 100% of time and I'm not exaggerating on that I've briefed hundreds and hundreds of customers as Mark has well, we hear the same thing which is them saying we have this seemingly insurmountable challenge, which is how do we harness new innovation which we know has to come. We know no one company can do it but we can't operationalize it because we can't run one more thing right. So this application framework sounds like you figured out how to solve this problem substantially for us. So we  Hope you get this right, and that's very consistent. Now this afternoon, we know we're trying to sell something this afternoon, it really goes back to the second evolution on consistency, which we're doing a great job at for each of the capabilities, the consistency of security and now we've just given the customer a really powerful reason if they're going to think about us versus that endpoint provider, that firewall provider or that cloud provider why you go with Palo Alto Networks in order to future-proof your investment, which is now they're going to put the application on top of. So if I buy their firewall today, their endpoint today, their end today their cash capability today, they're going to continue to bring more innovation to that purchase and make that purchase more valuable for me for every dollar I spend with them when I deploy them that way. So it's been very, very positive. I think that's really helping us in the market.
Operator: We take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.
Melissa Franchi: Thank you. This Melissa Franchi calling in for Keith. Thanks for taking my question. Mark, I am just wondering if you're seeing any change in customer behavior around refresh? And I'm mostly interested in if you're seeing any customers that are opting to instead deploy a VM series instance versus a physical deployment and what would be sort of the use cases around that?
Mark McLaughlin : Now we see that -- we we've seen everything go in many directions Melissa. We kind of see it's the cloud side of the business, it grow at VM series, the hardware side it grows -- it's is growing as well, but back to this consistency thing if we get a chance to do something for customer they're more often not or going to use this in these - in the environment everywhere. So we gave an example in a car that was kind of interesting about a customer who was a large company that new to us as a customer never want anything, first thing they bought was in the AWS marketplace for VM series, and then over time after we saw them there we contacted and said, how are you doing lead gen for us. And we just closed the seven-figure deal with them on front right because people are living these hybrids -- worlds in hybrid environments. You kind of see it going in the physical, physical of VM; people are going to operate these hybrid environments for quite some time. We think it's been beneficial for us. 
Melissa Franchi: Okay, thanks. And just one quick follow-up for Kathy. It was helpful to see that the tax guidance for the fiscal 2018. I'm just wondering if you could put some color on what we should think on the impact to cash taxes because as far as I understand you still have NOLs.
Kathy Bonanno: Yes. That's right. We do have NOLs and we don't expect to be a cash taxpayer or a significant cash taxpayer for the next four years or so. We mentioned at Analyst Day that we expect to pay about $10 million to $25 million per year over the next four-ish years and that doesn't change with the new tax law because of the NOLs essentially.
Operator: We will go next to Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo.
Philip Winslow: Yes, thanks guys for taking my questions and my congrats again on just an awesome quarter. I have a question on gross margins and most my other questions have been asked already but Mark you laid out sort of the impact of the newer appliances versus some of the older appliances, and the effective on gross margins but as you sort of look up and down cause that way the appliance set to called the service provider large enterprise branch office et cetera. How do you -- how should I think about the differential in gross margins there and as you think about what sort of impacting gross margins over the past years, and as you kind of think about that guidance going forward. How do you think about that mix call it between up and down the appliance range?
Mark McLaughlin : Yes. I think a better way to think about it so is not so much the size of things it's really about what goes into them from a component perspective. It's and there's a mix of components and all these things right. They don't -- they're not all the same across all the devices either. Though it's not just about like a small thing versus a big thing, usually, and I see this in case, newer things right will have lower product gross margins than things that are much more mature over time because we continue to drive economies scale, the components your pricing improves over time things along those lines. So I think about it that way and the mix comment I was making was as the mix of our hardware is goes more to the newer things that we've developed, and we can see we are although performing very nicely on a hardware side, that's positive for the business of course, it's got some short-term impacts on the product gross margins because that mix is larger inside there. Even though we're continuing to improve the gross margins on those products, every single quarter as well.
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'll turn the conference back to Mr. Mark McLaughlin for any closing remarks.
Mark McLaughlin : Thanks operator. Appreciate that we're going to thank everybody for your time this afternoon and I know we're going to see many of you over the coming weeks. Look forward to that. Hope everybody has a great evening and thanks so much for joining us on call today.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

And finally, once we have completed our formal remarks, we will be posting them to our Investor Relations website under Quarterly Results. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Mark.
Mark McLaughlin: Thank you, Kelsey and thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon for our fiscal first quarter 2018 results. I'm pleased to report that we delivered a strong start to the fiscal year. On a year-over-year basis Q1 revenue was $505 million up 27%. Billings were $596 million up 15% and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.74 up 35%. In the quarter we saw a healthy demand environment in all theaters as well as strong customer interest in all the extended capabilities of our next generation security platform from network, endpoint and cloud. The go to market changes we made in midyear fiscal '17 which were designed to drive growth and leverage its scale are paying dividends for us in our channel as we start off our new fiscal year. In the quarter we added over 2500 new customers and are now privileged to serve over 45,000 customers globally. In addition to strong new customer acquisition, we also continue to rapidly increase the wallet share of our existing customers. Our top 25 customers each spent a minimum of $23.2 million in lifetime value in Q1 which is a 53% increase over the $15.2 million in Q1 of fiscal '17. The rapid growth and adoption of our platform, results from our relentless focus on innovation at our customers. Specific examples of customer wins and competitive displacements in the quarter included a seven-figure competitive win against Cisco in a virtualized data center deal with the U.S. military organization. The Cisco displacement as the standard security vendor at one of the world's busiest airports based in EMEA, a Check Point displacement at one of the world's largest technology companies to become its global security platform, a Check Point displacement in the data center of one of the world's leading payment processors based in the United States and a Symantec displacement in an endpoint deal for 10,000 workstations at a U.S. federal agency that also included AutoFocus. There are three Hallmarks to our platform that are increasingly well understood by customers and prospects. The first is our ability to provide increased prevention through automation and orchestration; second, is our ability to deliver these security outcomes consistently across on-premise, endpoint, cloud in hybrid environments; and third, is our demonstrated ability to continually push the boundaries to simplify consumption models at a time when organizations are struggling to balance security needs with limited operational manpower and budgets. To accomplish these objectives we continue to drive disruptive evolutions in the market that are designed to meet today's most challenging security requirements and they build on each other over time to establish significant competitive differentiation. To that end, we introduced two new offerings in September. First, GlobalProtect cloud service which delivers the Palo Alto Networks next generation security infrastructure for remote offices and mobile users as a cloud based service. This offering opens up new use cases for us, help widely distribute organizations, improve their security and reduce complexity. Also in late September we introduced the Palo Alto Networks Logging Service, a cloud-based offering that stores context rich logs generated by our security platform. Managed seamlessly with our existing panorama management product our Logging Service is the foundation of our Application Framework which is the next major evolution in security. We expect our Application Framework to provide a new model for the delivery of security applications that it can apply advanced analytics to massive data sets and have automated workflow decisions enforced through already deployed capabilities in the network on the endpoint and in the cloud. We have received great feedback from the hundreds of customers brief [ph] on the Application Framework which we are on track to deliver in the first half of calendar 2018. Initial reception to GlobalProtect cloud service and the Logging Services has been strong and we are very pleased to have closed several deals in the first quarter. In addition to our new services we further enhanced the capabilities of Traps, our advanced endpoint protection offering with the introduction of Version 4.1. Among the many new features 4.1 added behavior-based ransomware protection, enhanced kernel exploit prevention and local analysis from Mac OS. And just a few weeks ago Traps scored a 100% protection rate and earned the Approved Award in the Business Security Report published by AV-Comparatives, an independent organization that tests and assesses AV software. This is yet another third-party validation of our ability to replace traditional AV products. And in October we expanded the capabilities of Aperture, our Cloud Access Security Broker offering. As part of the migration to the cloud many organizations are adopting a multi-cloud strategy that includes storing large amounts of data within cloud environments and which requires advanced protection that complement basic native cloud offerings to achieve comprehensive and consistent security. Aperture now provides application protections for several AWS solutions including Amazon EC2, AWS Identity and Access Management and Amazon S3. We also enhanced our support for Office 365 and Google applications to include cloud based email services and G3 marketplace applications. We continue to see very good traction with customers as they look to us to help them work through the requirements of security in a hybrid world. Also we were recently honored to be named the Fortune Magazine's list of top 50 companies changing the world and to the Fortune Future 50 list. These acknowledgements further underscore our commitment to innovation and our dedication to improving security outcomes for our customers. I also want to welcome Kathy Bonanno as our next Chief Financial Officer. Kathy joined our team in 2014 and is currently Senior Vice President of Finance responsible for financial planning, treasury, enterprise risk management and facilities. With more than three years at Palo Alto Networks, a decade in cyber security and 30 years business experience she has an intimate knowledge of our company, the industry and broad expertise across financial disciplines as well as a proven track record of building world-class organizations. Congratulations Kathy. I look forward to continue to work with you.
Kathy Bonanno: Thanks Mark. I'm excited about this role and my work with the team. I believe we have a truly unique opportunity to continue to disrupt the security market, take share at scale and increase operating leverage. I will be at several of the upcoming investor conferences and look forward to meeting those of you I don't already know.
Mark McLaughlin: Congratulations again Kathy and I look forward to taking the reins from Steffan this coming Wednesday. And before I conclude, I want to thank our customers and partners for their support and our team for their dedication to our mission which is to protect our way of life in the digital age. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Steffan.
Steffan Tomlinson: Thanks Mark. I'd like to add my congratulations to Kathy as well. I've really enjoyed working with you and I know you'll be successful in your new role. Now let's turn to the numbers and guidance. I'd like to note that except for revenue and billings figures all financial figures are non-GAAP and growth rates are compared to the prior year periods unless stated otherwise. In the first quarter we delivered strong performance against our land-and-expand go to market model. In addition, the power of our hybrid SaaS model was evident in record deferred revenue that continues to be driven by our ongoing mix shift to subscription and support year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin expansion which drove 35% growth in non-GAAP EPS and very healthy free cash flow generation. As we look to the balance of the fiscal year we are pleased with our improving execution and widening competitive positioning which is further differentiated by our new offerings. In Q1 total revenue grew 27% to $505.5 million. Looking at the geographic growth of Q1 revenue the Americas grew 25%, EMEA grew 35% and APAC grew 25. Q1 product revenue of $186.5 million grew 14% compared to the prior year. Sales of the new hardware which we launched in fiscal Q3 '17 continued to perform well as we land new customers and up-sell them into our existence customer base. Q1 SaaS based subscription revenue of $169.3 million increased 40%. Support revenue of $149.7 million increased 32%. In total subscription and support revenue of $319 million increased 36% and accounted for 63% share of total revenue which was a 420 basis point increase compared to last year. Q1 total Billings of $596.5 million increased 15%. Total deferred revenue at the end of Q1 was $1.9 billion an increase of 37%. Q1 gross margin was 76.8% a decrease of 260 basis points compared to last year and within our target range of 75% to 78%. The decline was primarily attributable to the ongoing traction we're seeing with the new products introduced in the third quarter of last fiscal year. Q1 operating expenses were $292.4 million or 57.8% of revenue which is a 360 basis point improvement year-over-year driven primarily by ongoing increasing leverage in sales and marketing. Operating margin was 19% an increase of 100 basis points. We ended the first quarter with 4707 employees. Net income for the first quarter grew 36% to $69.8 million or $0.74 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis for the first quarter net loss increased 12% to $64 million or $0.70 per basic and diluted share. Turning to cash flows and balance sheet items, we finished October with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $2.3 billion. During the first quarter we repurchased approximately 861,000 shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $145 per share leaving a balance of approximately 455 million available for ongoing repurchases through December 2018. Turning to cash flow, Q1 cash flow from operations of $274.1 million increased 35% and included the receipt of a $38.2 million upfront cash reimbursement related to certain of the company's lease agreements. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $32.2 million including $11.2 million of CapEx related to our new headquarters. Free cash flow was $241.9 million up 32% at a margin of 47.9%. On an adjusted basis excluding the upfront cash reimbursement and investment in our new headquarters free cash flow was $214.9 million up 16% at a margin of 42.5%. DSO were 70 days at the low end of the target range of 70 to 80 days. Turning now to guidance and modeling points, this guidance takes into account the type of forward-looking information that Kelsey referred to earlier. For fiscal Q2 '18 we expect revenue to be in the range of $518 million to $528 million an increase of 23% to 25% year-over-year, product revenue to be in the range of $185 million to $188 million an increase of 10% to 11% year-over-year, billings to be in the range of $640 million to $655 million an increase of 14% to 17% year-over-year, non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.78 to $0.80 using 94 to 96 million shares and we expect CapEx for Q2 fiscal '18 to be approximately $30 million. For the full fiscal year '18 we are raising our guidance and now expect revenue to be in the range of $2.145 billion to $2.185 billion an increase of 22% to 24% year-over-year, product revenue to be in the range of $755 million to $770 million an increase of 6% to 9% year-over-year, billings to be in the range of $2.65 billion to $2.71 billion an increase of 16% to 18% year-over-year, non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.35 to $3.41 using 96 to 98 million shares and we continue to expect extremity to be approximately $100 million. Before I conclude, I'd like to provide some additional modeling points for the fiscal year. We continue to expect fiscal Q2 and fiscal Q4 to have the strongest sequential total revenue growth. As reflected in consensus heading into this call our non-GAAP EPS guide continues to include approximately 150 basis points of organic operating margin expansion excluding first half fiscal year '18 investments associated with the LightCyber acquisition. And we continue to expect fiscal year free cash flow margin to be in the range of 37% to 39% as the nonrecurring cash reimbursement received in Q1 will be mostly offset by rent payments throughout the balance of this fiscal year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark.
Mark McLaughlin: Thanks Steffan. Before we head over to questions I want to take the opportunity to thank you again for all your contributions to Palo Alto Networks. You've been an inspiring leader, you've got a great organization and you've been a wonderful friend and a real pleasure to work with you. Thank you very much for that.
Steffan Tomlinson: Thanks Mark, I appreciate the kind words.
Mark McLaughlin: And with that why don’t we head to questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions?
Operator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Philip Winslow of Wells Fargo.
Philip Winslow: Hey, thanks guys and congrats on a great quarter. Obviously the product number was strong again in the quarter and saw an acceleration from the prior two quarters. Wonder if you can double click on just the sales practices that you all discussed following Q2 and just wondering how you feel in terms of just the go to market right now with the changes that you made last year? And then just one quick followup to that.
Mark McLaughlin: Sure Phil, so we saw a good strong environment every theatre so we really liked the health of the market out there and then with being able to go capitalize with some of the changes we made last year which have really taken us back and I think we’re seeing the dividends from that work we started mid last year we feel good about where we are with that process. We're in the we call the base space before the relationship building phase which seems to be going very well, we'd expect that to keep paying dividends for us as we play out the year.
Philip Winslow: Got it and then I was hoping if you all could comment on just the pricing environment as well, are there sort of any changes that you've seen there as we exit through this calendar year versus maybe earlier in the year last year? Thanks guys.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, it seems that, good question. Yes it seems the same it is a very competitive market. We've seen the competition price aggressively for quite some time and what we've seen us be able to do is continue to sell to the value of the platform. I think customers get that more and more. Our team is trained to do that and we like the results of that and we've been able to continue to improve product discounting continuously, sequentially for example, as we like to see that as well and it does not seem like we have to succumb through all the pricing machinations that are going over at the competition here as the customers really adopt the entire platform.
Operator: And our next question will come from Pierre Ferragu of Bernstein.
Pierre Ferragu: Hi everybody, thanks for taking my question. So when I look at your guidance for next year, so you have 6% to 9% in product and 16% to 18% in billing. So if I make the difference you are growing your subscription billing 20% to 23% year-on-year which is first really impressive and are so way above your product growth. So my question would be how does that split between attached and unattached product? How much of that is still driven by your expansion of your installed base of firewall and how much is really like subscriptions that are not attached anymore? And then my second question would be, if you keep growing like that subscriptions much faster than products, next year you are going to have less than a third of your billings coming from products and then in two to three years I wish it would be like 80% subscription and only 20% product business, am I right thinking it that way?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, Pierre, so obviously we don’t guide beyond the year, [Indiscernible] that, but I think this is a general matter. We've seen our business continue to move into the services category over time particularly in subscription services for a few reasons. One is the platform is very powerful and the customers understand how the subscription services provide better security and reduce the complexity of their consumption models. Secondly we continue to introduce new services. We just introduced two in September, the GlobalProtect cloud service and Logging Service and we are happy with the performance already with those. So as we continue to bring new services to market as well we would see the business move in the subscription services direction as well and then on top of that the application framework which will come into market next year as well should also move things in those directions, so that's what we would imaging would occur over a period of time it would keep moving in that direction, but we – for the year we've guided about 65% split if you recall from Analyst Day is revenue as to what will come from the services side of the business.
Pierre Ferragu: Thank you.
Mark McLaughlin: Thank you.
Kelsey Turcotte: Next question please?
Operator: And our next question will come from Rob Owens of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Rob Owens: Great and thanks for taking my question. Maybe you could give us a little more color on the success you are seeing on the products side of things and what's coming from preexisting customers that are within your renewal base versus maybe an increase in competitive wins?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes Rob, well we're doing well in both cases. You can see like net new customer acquisitions continue to be very strong and obviously we're selling product into a lot of those customers, the vast majority of those as a matter of fact. So we continue to bring in new customer wins and also in the expansion business has been strong for us for a very long time and is powering you know the majority of our business [Indiscernible] by math you know the size of the customer base, the expansion business continues to do well. I feel like we're doing really great in white space opportunities and also convincing our customers to continue to grow their life time value with us.
Rob Owens: And I guess along those lines with much of the upside in the quarter coming from product, the billings was at the high end but you over achieved on product and over achieved on total revenue. So if I looked at billings relative to revenue yield or I guess the inverse product with the attach of subscriptions, is that product mainly coming then from preexisting customers, you don’t give us much of a subscription uplift or you have less attach or less duration to attach, maybe you could help provide some color there? Thanks.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, sure, just a couple of observations, rounding out the quarter we are very happy with the product delivery obviously and total revenue delivery and also on the billings side, in the quarter we saw a couple of things going on [Indiscernible] ratio, one was as we continue to improve the product discounting the net would put more into the product revenue buckets so the mixes were a bit higher than we thought we would see in the quarter and also in some of our service provider businesses purchases some of those were a little more CapEx heavy than we had forecasted as well, so that would put some more into the product bucket as well so just really the mix is a little different than we expected coming into the quarter.
Operator: And our next question will come from Ken Talanian of Evercore ISI.
Ken Talanian: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So another one on product, I was wondering if you could give us a sense for how much the VM-Series and Panorama contributed to the product revenue in the quarter and how we should think about that for the remainder of the fiscal year?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, this is Mark, very, very little. VM-Series is primarily almost all of it is heading into the subscription services line that’s how we recognize that and it performed very well by the way but very little that goes in the product.
Steffan Tomlinson: And the same is true with Panorama.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, same with panorama.
Ken Talanian: Okay and I guess you delivered double digit year-over-year product revenue growth in the quarter, expecting the same next quarter. Is there anything that you see in the back half of the year that makes you a little bit cautious?
Mark McLaughlin: No, we like the way the quarter played out, so we over delivered on product which is great. Our forecast looks good in the second quarter and based on that we've increased the product revenue guide on a full year basis, but it's early in the year so we don't see it play out a little bit more?
Operator: And our next question will come from Sterling Auty of JP Morgan.
Sterling Auty: Yes, thanks. Hi Guys. First of all Kathy, congratulations. Steffan, great job to finish off your tenure on such a strong note. But just wanted to take it to the high level with a guide out of the Check Point, out of Fortinet there was all of these concerns about what was happening in the firewall market. Obviously you put up good results but Mark in your comments you specifically pointed out good demand in all theaters. That's what I want to point to. Can you give us additional color as to just in general spending environment for network security more specifically firewalls and there's still this big question on everybody's minds, how much is the move to the cloud going to hamper, help or be a non-event to the firewall vendors?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, so I mean I think that there are two different levels, higher in our S market, talk about that we're just second which are just very strong, but the highest of all and so we've seen healthy demand in the market for security period right and I think what's happening is but are definitely moving in a real platform direction and then we feel like we have the best one of those and it continues to get better and better over time. And if you remember Sterling at Analyst Day we talked about the three evolutions all that build on each other and drive continued competitive advantage in that second one in there which is we defined as consistency of security outcomes across not only the network but end points and also cloud environments whether they're public or hybrid cloud environments is very important. And customers we think agree with that. So we are seeing a good adoption in our cloud offerings the M-Series and Aperture as well. But lots of folks are operating in hybrid environments and I expect them to continue to do that for some time. So that drives strength and not only the cloud offering that drives strength and that data center, what’s happening in data centers from a hardware perspective and we see less and all this. May be Mark can you talk about the theatre?
Mark Anderson: Yes, you bet Mark. So hey Sterling, I think geographical standpoint no we have across the board we saw 25% in the Americas by far the biggest theatre and 25% in fact in Japan and 35% in EMEA, so really good strong execution across the board. I think in all theatres we're getting tremendous set bats [ph] because we've got great geographic coverage in all the sub regions and really good partner traction as well. So we're getting a lot more bats we're winning the vast majority of those of bats because we have a much better solution. I think with regards to cloud as we said pretty clearly at Analyst Day we really think that there’s major tailwinds coming with cloud. We are hearing constantly from customers that they want as they move more and more off of-prim over the long term, they're going to want consistent delivery of security and that's kind of what we've been talking about for a long time and then we think were pretty unique in that.
Operator: And our next question will come from Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets.
Matthew Hedberg: Hey guys thanks for taking my questions. Kathy I'll offer you my congratulations as well. Mark, we continue to hear good things about GlobalProtect cloud services and you've highlighted in your prepared remarks, could you talk a little bit more about the competitive landscape there, what are some of the opportunities? And then I have a quick follow up.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, sure. So I think the way to think about that Matt is and the way we certainly think about it is we want to make sure that our customers when they want to consume the platform, that those consumption models are broad and flexible as possible. So we have for a long time we’ve offered those capabilities from an on-prem perspective as people mentioned themselves we’ve had with MSSP partners where it could be managed by third-party and now with GlobalProtect cloud service we’ve given the option of having that totally the cloud experience as well. We've continued to evolve all the offerings based on what the customer needs will be into the future. So if I step back and that if I say okay, what are we doing? We were bringing the full-on network security or the full-on enterprise security platform in that form factor to the market which means we’re going to be able to provide and we are providing the security outcomes we’ve been driving for some time across all applications consistently from endpoint to network and cloud as well and in ways that are just not be like traffic is leaving but also coming into the network and being able to bridge the multiple user. So pretty distinct competitive advantage I think there and also flexibility on a new model that customers' reaction so far has been very positive.
Matthew Hedberg: That’s great. And then maybe just a quick one, could you comment on the relative rate of sales capacity ads in Q1 relative to your 15% billings growth was it little less, more or about the same?
Mark McLaughlin: Nothing other than - historically so very consistent what we’ve been doing for many years.
Operator: And our next question will come from Saket Kalia of Barclays.
Saket Kalia: Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions here and congrats Kathy for the promotion as well.
Kathy Bonanno: Thank you.
Saket Kalia: Hey Mark, maybe just to start with you, just part of level understanding it’s still early days on Application Framework, I’m just curious how Application Framework is maybe changing customer conversations if at all at this juncture?
Mark McLaughlin: It’s been really dramatic Saket and positive way that when we are talking with customers and we start off are always with the very high level to say, Palo Alto for the last decade has been fundamentally bringing higher and higher rates of prevention to automation and orchestration and addition to doing that, we’ve also been massively simplifying the consumption model along the way, so that customers can have better security with a much simpler consumption model which drives better ROI, less manpower, all the things that we believe is important for long time and we are completely [indiscernible] now with the models the way they are, they’re really broken have to be fundamentally different. And then to show them the way for the third evolution with the application framework to say imagine a world that looks like this that were you don’t have to give up getting lots of innovation from the security market because security has to be highly innovative but no one company can do that, but here is a way to get even more automation, more orchestration, better prevention rates and do it with the vastly simplified, our consumption model is well they really like that. Now I think what that’s doing for us right, right now is very much showing what the future is going to look like as the thought leader. We have lots of demonstrated capabilities of making those real. We have people writing applications for the Application Framework today and we always got to keep in mind that after that conversation they’re going to buy something this afternoon, it might be a firewall, it might be end point solution, it might be virtual machine and the cloud or something along those lines for a project and what I think we’re hearing them say is you've given us a very significant reason why we want to choose Palo Alto Networks as our operating platform for lack of a better term in all places in our architecture for our security capabilities.
Operator: And our next question will come from Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs.
Gabriela Borges: Great, good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. Maybe a follow up on the demand picture, but instead of geographically by verticals, so maybe if you could comment a little bit on federal carrier a bit Mark and I think there was a comment earlier on some of the mix being better towards products because of CapEx from the service provider, so if you could just talk a little bit more about the demand profile and the mix you’re seeing across the vertical that would be really helpful?
Mark McLaughlin: Sure thanks. Yes, so first let me start with we’re very well diversified across our verticals and which is great and we like to see that. I mean mostly it demonstrates that we are truly a platform because you see that horizontally played out across all verticals and from a Fed perspective at Fed year end we saw good wins there and continue to see increasing signs of spending getting back to normal which would be fantastic. There has been a lot of ups and downs and anxiety in the Fed market due to type of leadership positions being filled or in continuing resolution right now. So any - can return to normalcy as a good thing there. And also the Fed space fits very well within our mission for what we do which is to protect our way of life in the digital age and what the federal government is trying to do they find that to be very in line with their mission, so they like that a lot too which is great. On the service provider side that is a good market for us. It continues to grow nicely. We've continued to put more investment in there from a technology perspective of adding features and function and earlier to that, my comment earlier on the prepared remarks around service provider was that the product mix of the deal sets in the service provider is a bit heavier than we thought in the quarter that contributed some to the product mix in the quarter which of course we like to see.
Operator: And we'll hear next from Michael Turits of Raymond James.
Michael Turits: Hey guys. I have two questions. First one I think this is a continuation of Rob Owens question asking about the new risk existing, can you give us some sense of where you are and then refresh cycle coming off of your big build where you approached was really strong back in the 2012, 2013 era and where you might be if that's on track? And then I have a followup question about billings.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, sure. So from a refresh perspective the refresh opportunity as we've said before is large and continues to grow we add this many customers and the cohorts grow over time that's been going well for us. We had to refresh in the quarter, we expect to continue that through the rest of the year. We also mentioned likewise you may remember on Analyst Day that wallet [ph] the case we wouldn’t expect that to be the major driver of product growth in year. We select that to be really the platform itself or new customers or new product introductions and increasing productivity in the sales team that we own, but the refresh is definitely a positive for us and we're doing very well.
Operator: And our next question will come from Patrick [indiscernible].
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks for taking my questions. He I wonder if you would tell us see, or give us indication of the product revenue blend from the new hardware launched in Feb ’17?
Steffan Tomlinson: Product revenue blend, I’m sorry Patrick, I'm not exactly sure I understand the question.
Unidentified Analyst: So of the quarter revenue sold in the quarter what kind of portion roughly was from the kind of new hardware you launched early this year?
Steffan Tomlinson: Yes, that the new products that we launched had a very healthy contributing factor to the mix of products. We don't give out specific percentages, but the traction has been very strong. It's opened up new opportunities to sell to the new customers as well as selling into our installed base from an expansion standpoint and so it was a very strong contributor. We just don't give up the specific percentages.
Operator: And our next question will come from Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray.
Andrew Nowinski: Great, thanks congratulations Kathy. So just may be a clarification I guess your product gross margin was a little bit lower than it has been historically which I think you said was due to the new products the new hardware. But when do you expect to start see the cost efficiencies from the new products where they are no longer headwind to your gross margin?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, what we said earlier when we had new product launches that we would have some headwinds on product gross margins as we got to kind of the scale also that our providers people who supply us with components can also take those components into a broad base into the market. When we look at the size of the product launch we just did back in February is the biggest one we've done by a long shot, so we don't have actually a perfect analogies on that but probably the closest one is the 5000 Series we did a number of years ago and that's about a year or so before we were able to get those economies of scale we expect that to be the case here.
Steffan Tomlinson: And just follow-on point, with that being the dynamic we're still operating within our framework of 75% to 78% total gross margin and we've incorporated that dynamic into that guidance range, so we feel good about that structure.
Operator: And our next question will come from Gur Talpaz with Stifel.
Gur Talpaz: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So a quick question on end point do you think we're at the point now where large enterprises are more willing to buy end point prevention and networking security from the same vendor and are you seeing more in the way of standardization projects thinking perhaps in the quarter.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, this is Mark. Yes, I think that's the case and we believe just as a big picture matter that that's definitely going to be the case in the future we've been very heavily into the end point market as you know. We think it is by matter of necessity and that you think about that second evolution the way we define it is consistency of the network end points that's going to be very important some capabilities from a security perspective or better done on network and some that are better done on end points and increasing the data in the cloud some will be a cloud. So we have to get all of those right and very importantly they all have to work together. We're seeing that the customers want, they want that consistency and I think they also want fewer vendors as a big picture matter as well so being able to have a platform that has consistency that allows to reduce the number of vendors and sprawl in the organization that might be devices in a network, that might be agents on an endpoint is a net positive for them.
Operator: And Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company has our next question.
Gregg Moskowitz: Okay, thank you. Congrats on a good quarter. Congrats Kathy, best of luck Steffan. So I'd like to go back to new customer acquisition because this was an impressive quarter on that basis and especially so for Q1. We do attribute this to the product refresh earlier in the year or would you also say there is a more concerted go to market focus around reaching new accounts? Thanks.
Mark McLaughlin: I think we have a number of things that are going on Gregg. We had solid performance from all the theatres, you heard a little while ago across all the customer profiles. We've got our continued productivity improvements as well from the work we started last year. The new products for sure are getting a positive reception in the market and then also with increasingly growing that of offerings so their new services. We have the ability to talk to customers about new opportunities and land new customers with not cash services as well. So we have a whole bunch of stuff going on from as far as ability of the test customers new products definitely are contributing nicely to that.
Gregg Moskowitz: Okay, thanks.
Mark McLaughlin: Thanks Greg.
Operator: And our next question will come from John DiFucci of Jefferies.
John DiFucci: Thank you. I have a quick follow up question for Gurs question, I mean it has to do with Traps, because it looks like you're seeing some good traction and by the way this question I think is more for Mark Anderson. And that Symantec displacement is really interesting. I assume when you have conversations with customers that first buy your firewall and everything that comes along with that and then they consider Traps. But I guess is that accurate? And have you ever seen, I've seen when they look at Traps are they comparing Traps on its own merits against Symantec? Mark McLaughlin just talked about having both is you know has some advantages, but do they also consider on its own merit against its own merits against the competing product and has it ever been or do you think it will ever be the land product, like hey, I want to buy Traps and then maybe I'll consider the firewall?
Mark Anderson: Yes, John. Thanks for the question. No, I think just first of all about a third of our customers for Traps or that first purchases Traps not traditional network security, so and we think on the merits of the solution with the focus that we have in the field that we are winning because we're delivering better outcomes. And we're going after traditional anti-virus budget because customers have associated very little value with the money that they are spending on traditional anti-virus. I think down the road we won't really strategic space for us and as Mark mentioned earlier and we're going to continue to see success here.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes and I think one of the things John is well and this is important for our teams that are out there making these sales is the ability to be able to tell a customer to say this second evolution where we define it all is really important have consistency of the security outcomes regardless where the data is and sometime want to be on an endpoint right? So we definitely want that consistency and also be able to say on a head-to-head basis we're the best there right? So you should choose us on a competitive bake off which we know you're going to do and we feel very good about that. And as you think about that bake off in addition to winning head-to-head you also get the consistency aspect that allows you to grow in the future into even more interesting things like the Application Framework over time right? So more reasons why you want to deploy off the networks everywhere that's important as a data collection point and an enforcement putting your architecture sometimes network, sometimes endpoint, sometimes in the cloud.
Steffan Tomlinson: And it's really the trust and faith that we've earned from customers over the last decade where they know that we're going to provide a high quality product and then we're going to support it in a way in a more focused way than anybody out there can from a product support standpoint.
John DiFucci: Great, thank you, guys.
Steffan Tomlinson: Sure, thanks.
Operator: And our next question will come from Fatima Boolani of UBS.
Fatima Boolani: Thank you for taking my questions. Mark a question for you around your dedicated efforts around building a public cloud practice and bringing your partners in there. Just at a high level I'd love to see what sort of conversations you are having with the customers around their public cloud challenges and how you are positioned to sort of help them cross the cavern? And a quick follow up Steffan if I may.
Steffan Tomlinson: Yes, you bet Fatima. So I think we've got a really broad spectrum of customers, some are leaning pretty aggressively into public cloud and we're putting preproduction deve ups new applications into the cloud. Some are dipping their toes and I think what we represent for them is an opportunity to provide a real consistent look and feel for their security that we can impose there. This is going to take the place over the next five to ten years. We're going to continue to see more and more migration as people become more and more comfortable for that and I think that comfort is going to come from the kind of security that we can help deliver to them. So I think were in a very good space there.
Fatima Boolani: That's helpful and Steffan if I look back to your billings performance a couple of years ago where you may be signed some longer term contracts, as those come up for renewal in ‘18 and even ‘19 what sort of trends are you seeing in the earlier crop of these longer term deals, are they renewing at the same duration, that would be really helpful? Thank you.
Steffan Tomlinson: Well, if you look back over the last several years, we've seen a modest gradual increase in duration and it seems to have leveled out at approximately three years. And so for the companies who are, who did a three-year deal three years ago, there's really a mix of renewals business right now. We're seeing some re-op for a multi-year term we're seeing others renewing annually. So there's really a mix there, but what we said at our Analyst Day and what we still believe to be true is that for the rest of the fiscal year we don't really see any changes in overall duration that it should be roughly about three years.
Operator: And our next question will come from Walter Pritchard with Citi.
Walter Pritchard: Hi, thank you. I’m wondering just as I look at revenue per customer you highlighted your large I think $0.3 million to be a top 25 customer, can you talk about what's happening at the other end of your business? Are you with some of the lower end products are you released in the last six months, are you dipping down into smaller customers at all and what is your strategy around I know you're not a small office SMB player but kind of when do you look to potentially turn into that segment of the market which is probably some revenue opportunity for you?
Mark McLaughlin: Hey Walter its Mark. Our focus has been and continues to be as you know is enterprise security market mostly because we find focus matters is delivering the best solution and have been support them in a high quality manner. So that hasn't changed for us and we look at the customer acquisition and the mix of customers who are very consistent with what it has been for some time. So we haven't seen a change there as well either. Though I think what we are seeing from some use cases and some of the larger customers is the ability to address interesting and new use cases around like a retail environment and plus some of the services just want to be able to do some more campus work, global user work and things along those lines, I would expect that to continue to be.
Walter Pritchard: Then a question for Mark Anderson just around the European theatre that was to especially strong, was there anything specific, I mean sometimes good execution is the answer, but I'm curious is there anything specific you're seeing in certain countries or certain vertical markets that might explain the strong performance in Europe?
Mark Anderson: Yes that was really good performance across the board in every sub region within in the year Walter. I think just what we're seeing across the board in Europe is they're typically one to two years behind the Americas in terms of their IT culture if you will and we're seeing just a general awareness of the need for migration away from legacy disconnected products to a more of an architecture approach. That’s coming at a time when bad things are happening around the world, focused on legislation with GPR and frankly the coverage that we have now in every major country and in Europe that's getting us in front of customers and showing them how we can be a much better provider for them.
Walter Pritchard: Great, thank you.
Mark McLaughlin: Sure.
Operator: And our next question will come from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley.
Keith Weiss: Hi guys. Thanks for fitting me in and a very nice quarter. I was wondering just on sort of go to market strategy, it seems like the differentiation in kind of this sales sort of what the service kind of selling to the customer base is changing in a big way, this isn't an appliance selling it was not a box selling where you guys are selling a platform, does this change sort of the partners strategy at all or change sort of the kinds of partners you're going to market with and in terms of who could actually get across that value proposition?
Mark McLaughlin: That’s a good question Keith. Certainly we're always on the lookout for surgically frankly for new partners, not looking to cast a wide blanket, but really looking to improve the coverage we have around the world. So it is just naturally as we've grown the kind of partners that we couldn't address the large global ones, the large systems integrators seven or eight years ago now we're at the scale where it's hard for them to avoid us frankly. So we've actually worked really hard on that over the last five years and as I think we’ve discussed in each of the Analyst Days, we’re getting more and more attention there. But I’d say nothing really dramatically different than the last Analyst Day other than just very much a focus on looking for large global distribution partners, large global systems integrators, service provider partners and national brands. What we do want is we want a message that’s consistent with what our field team is talking to customers about that this platform or architecture delivery versus disconnected point products.
Keith Weiss: Got it. And then just one follow up on the federal vertical in particular, any color you could give us on sort of strength of federal in Q1 and given sort of current machinations with budgeting and what not, expectations for potential to continue that strength further into the fiscal year?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes Keith, Mark again. In the Fed space like I said we saw some good wins there in the quarter. I would say big picture on Fed it’s been a mixed bag for a number of quarters as there has been some consternation I think in the federal space on some senior leadership positions that still go unfilled. And it is also just the budget we’re still working on the continued resolution right now that don’t think it’s for December timeframe, but the progression of seeing more normal spending and people understanding what their budgets will look like for the following year is very important to hopefully getting through the continuous solution would be a positive marker on the table and get people back to more normal spending patterns there.
Mark Anderson: Yes and then just I would add, it’s a really important space for us to be in, we’ve invested in the team over the last three years and we’ve got great coverage across the Intel, Pavilion and DoD segments and I think we feel really good about the team.
Keith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you very much guys.
Mark Anderson: Sure, thanks Keith.
Operator: And our next question will come from Karl Keirstead of Deutsche Bank.
Karl Keirstead: Hi thanks for either Mark, I wouldn’t mind going back to the relative performance. It feels like in this quarter and the one you’re guiding to the gap between yourselves and Check Point and Fortinet seems to be widening and I just want to ask if you can help us understand exactly where that wedge seems to be opening up? Is it simple as you've got a product cycle benefit that perhaps they don’t know maybe you could help us there? And then maybe as a follow up to Steffan to build on a prior question, you raised the revenue guidance, but the billings guidance is at least at the high end essentially the same, is that simply because most of the DR comes from maintenance and subscription and those line items were a little bit more in line versus the outperformance on product? Thank you.
Mark McLaughlin: So I will take the first part. What I think we are seeing in the market and have been for a while is the importance of the platform which I mentioned before where things work together in a highly automated fashion and there is really positive benefits in prevention outcomes plus the simplicity of the consumption models that result. I think that’s really continues to distinguish itself in the market because anybody can make those statements but at the end of the day what really matters is the architecture on how it’s actually built. And I think that what we’ve proven over time is we get a lot of credibility there because we’re a company that primarily is working on developing and building those things ourselves, we can make those statements at scale to customers and say no we really think this actually works together right and we have lots of references you can talk to where other companies might be cobbling things together and trying to do things that really don’t work out at the end of the day, when trying to get to the automated platforms. So I think that’s one level, the second thing on the architecture is the elegance of the architecture matters is well where from a simplicity perspective having it work in that automated orchestrated way and kind of mostly in charge of the platform you build a lot of it yourself matters from a stability perspective. So we increasingly as other vendors add more like acquisitions into the mix that stuff doesn’t really work well together and not only does it not try the security outcomes but it is increasing instability in networks as well. but we will hear a lot of folks coming to Palo Alto Networks saying one of the primary reasons is not just technical it’s also stability my currently provide can’t run at these big scales any longer they just keep adding more stuff and starting to break things as well. So if we -whole bunch of stuff in the mix of that but it all comes back to the architecture of the platform is the primary differentiator and as we try these revolutions and they build on each other we think that increases the moat and over time we'll continue to distinguish ourselves.
Steffan Tomlinson: Yes and Karl on the second part of your question, as you mentioned we did raise billings for the full year by $10 million. The mechanics are such that when you look our deferred revenue balance and that what we're adding to it every quarter very robust and healthy growth in both attached and non-attached subscriptions and also maintenance. But they're coming in line as expected and I think to the point that you raised, we are having more in-period more in-period revenue than we had originally planned for because product was so strong and so we also raised product for the full year. And the last point, I'll leave you with is if you think about current billings, current billings was strong and that reflects product revenue in the period versus the change in short term deferred.
Karl Keirstead: Got it, okay. Thanks a lot.
Steffan Tomlinson: Thanks Karl.
Operator: And our next question will come from Shaul Eyal of Oppenheimer.
Shaul Eyal: Thank you. Hi good afternoon guys, congrats on a good quarter, congrats Kathy on the recent promotion, Steffan, thank you for everything. Actually Steffan before we let you go just a quick housekeeping. Number of customers relating to Traps and WildFire historically you have been providing that, any view, any update along these lines?
Steffan Tomlinson: Yes on that front, we release those on a semi-annual basis and we saw a very healthy growth in customer accounts for both of those product lines.
Shaul Eyal: Fair enough. Mark, you mentioned in your prepared remarks an expansion of your cloud product. I think you also mentioned including them an updated email version targeting Office 365 landscape among other things, just want to make sure does that products [indiscernible] successful partnership with Proofpoint? A - Mark McLaughlin Yes what I mentioned Shaul is the for our Aperture offering which is our Cloud Access Security Broker offering we continue to expand the applications APIs that it's worked with and we've expanded it into cloud based e-mail offerings like Gmail for example, so that we've done and so it's you can just think of them as we keep getting more application coverage through Aperture.
Mark Anderson: But there hasn’t been great number of proof point that would when we can make this discovery with Palo Alto Networks integration between Proofpoint can allow Proofpoint actually do something about it, so it really is an ad for Proofpoint.
Shaul Eyal: Got it, that is helpful, thank you.
Operator: And our final question today will come from Jonathan Ho of William Blair.
Jonathan Ho: Hi congratulations, just to make it quick, I will leave with one question, in your early data lake and application framework deals can you maybe give us a little bit of color in terms of what those deals look like and the potential for up sell and expansion over time?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes sure, I will take that and Mark is very involved with some of these, he give some more color, but the big picture on the third evolution Jonathan of bringing the application framework to market maybe somewhat an obvious statement but we definitely are reinforcing that with customers is that if you're going to have capability sets that are really based on analytics and increasingly lots of interesting things and security will be driven on analytic capability, machine learning capability. The data set against which it runs is very important not only in terms of its size but also in the diversity of the kind of data in there right, like for example you don't need machine learning to tell you information is bad, the only data set we put in every bad stuff right. So you want to have very big data sets and you want the diversity of these dataset to have good, bad, unknowns in there and grow a lot of types of Logging Service is a capability set that we could go to customers and say for a very cost effective point of view, you can log all the information coming off of Palo Alto Networks capabilities because you want those really large datasets for all the analytic capabilities like LightCyber for example and things will bring to application framework to chew on and the bigger they are, the better they are and it doesn't have to be cost prohibitive a lot of that information. So Mark was deeply involved in a couple of the sales this quarter, maybe you can add little color.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes I think you pretty much nailed it Mark. I think for – to be able to leverage machine learning like our average series are leveraging against our customers everyday in an increasing scale and velocity. You need to be able to log not just bad and suspected bad but also good to really let the machine crunch as Mark said. So I think what makes us attractive beyond price is the fact that we're able to take the data from Logging Service and add that to the trillions of artifacts that we have in our threat intelligence data centers around the world to really drive the kind of automation that you need to be able to reduce the attack surface. I think that’s the last question. Okay, well thanks. Before I close, I want to thank everybody again for joining us today and I wish you and your families a very safe and happy Thanksgiving. We look forward to seeing many of you in the coming weekly Summer Investor Conferences. I really appreciate your time. See you next time.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect.

Mark McLaughlin: Thank you, Kelsey. And, thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon for our fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2017 results. I am pleased to report that we ended the year with a strong fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, Q4 revenue was $509 million, up 27%; billings were $671 million, up 17%; non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.92, up 39%; and free cash flow was $190 million. For the fiscal year 2017, revenue was $1.8 billion, up 28% year-over-year; billings were $2.3 billion, up 20% year-over-year; non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.71, up 43% year-over-year; and free cash flow was $705 million. I want to thank our customers, our team and our global partners for these results, their hard work and their ongoing support. In the quarter, we saw a solid demand environment in all theaters and strong customer interest in all the capabilities of our Next-Generation Security Platform. We also saw continued solid gains from the go-to-market work we started in our fiscal third quarter. Customer acquisition in the fourth quarter was very strong with approximately 3,000 new customers added. We are now privileged to serve more than 42,500 customers worldwide. This was by far the strongest quarter for new customer adds in our history, including the addition of a record number of G2000 customers which now total over 1,250. We also added approximately 2,000 new WildFire customers in the quarter, bringing our total number of WildFire customers to over 19,000, an increase of approximately 50% year-over-year. In addition to record new customer additions, we continued to rapidly increase our wallet share of existing customers. In the quarter, all of our top 25 lifetime value customers again made purchases and to make this list a customer had to have spent a minimum of $21.9 million in lifetime value, a 56% increase over the $14 million in Q4 fiscal 2016. This represents a multiple of almost 100 times their initial purchase which is up from approximately 50 times the initial purchase of our top 25 in the prior year period. Specific examples of customer wins and competitive displacements in the quarter included an eight-figure Cisco replacement at one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies that included both attached and non-attached subscriptions; a seven-figure Check Point replacement at one of Australia’s largest banks to protect their remote offices; a McAfee replacement on 40,000 endpoints at one of the largest energy companies in the United States; a seven-figure Cisco replacement and competitive win against Check Point at a large U.S. loan corporation for data center segmentation; and a competitive win at a very large global service provider in a cloud data center deal. Our ability to extend prevention capabilities consistently wherever data is deployed or computed is essential in an increasingly dynamic compute environment and, as a result, our platform adoption is increasing across the board. Along with market leading growth for our hardware and SaaS security services, our non-attached subscriptions, including Traps, VM-Series, Aperture and AutoFocus all performed well in the fourth quarter. More than 3,400 customers are now using our VM-Series in cloud deployments, and we have sold millions of endpoints to over 1,400 Traps customers. At the beginning of August Traps received a maximum performance score of 100% detection of real-world attacks on testing done by AV-TEST, a third-party organization with extensive experience testing endpoint security software. In addition, we were positioned in the Leaders Quadrant of the July 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Network Firewalls for the sixth time in a row. We continue to take market share, see rapid adoption of the platform, and receive industry recognition because of our relentless focus on innovation and customers. For over a decade, we have been driving major evolutions in security that deliver increasingly high rates of consistent prevention regardless of where data may be, and marrying innovation with a consumption model that overcomes the legacy siloed, expensive and people intensive models that have reached a breaking point. These evolutions build on each other and fiscal 2017 was a very big year for the introduction of new products and capabilities that are driving increased disruption in the market. In the third quarter, we released our new hardware, high-performance virtualized firewalls and feature rich 8.0 operating system. Feedback on these releases has been very positive which is evident in our Q4 results. These new products and capabilities were quickly followed in May with the release of Traps 4.0, which added several key security capabilities and extended operating system support to include macOS. And, at our user conference in June, we announced two new services, the GlobalProtect cloud service and the Palo Alto Network’s Logging Service. Our new GlobalProtect cloud service will deliver all the prevention capabilities of our platform, including application visibility and control, Threat Prevention, URL Filtering, and WildFire to secure remote networks and mobile users. Our new Logging Service is a cloud-based offering that is the basis for better security analytics that provides scalable storage capacity and processing power to help organizations store, process and analyze as much data as possible without needing to plan for local compute and storage. Both services will be generally available in September. In addition, given our critical mass in deployments of architectural enforcement points globally, we made the game-changing announcement at our user conference in June of the next evolution of the industry and our platform, the Palo Alto Networks Application Framework. This open and flexible SaaS framework leverages the existing Palo Alto Networks security infrastructure already deployed across tens of thousands of global customers and which is growing by thousands each quarter. The data from these deployments, our extensive threat intelligence, and new data from the Logging Service allow customers to address a myriad of security needs by being able to rapidly consume and deploy innovative security applications built by Palo Alto Networks, third-party developers, MSSPs and their own teams. This brings customers and security innovators a new level of agility and speed by reducing the complexity of creating, deploying, and integrating security innovations by leveraging already deployed infrastructure. More than 30 security industry vendors have already engaged with Palo Alto Networks to develop applications for the new Application Framework which we are planning to have generally available in early calendar 2018. There has been a lot of excitement and positive feedback around our fiscal 2017 announcements which we had the privilege of sharing live with customers in June at Ignite and then again just last week at our sales kickoff where we trained almost 3,500 team members and partners on the skills they need to sell the platform. The energy level is very high as we come off a strong finish to the year. As we look forward to fiscal 2018, I am excited about driving further disruption in the market and our opportunity to continue to quickly acquire market share. I’ll turn the call over to Steffan to review the financials and provide guidance in a minute, but before doing so will bring you up to speed on a few organizational announcements we made this afternoon. First, I’d like to congratulate Lee Klarich on his promotion to Chief Product Officer, expanding his responsibility to now include engineering as well as product management. Lee, who has been with Palo Alto Networks since 2006, has been a long-time member of our senior executive team and has played a key role in leading the team that has delivered our market-leading security platform. I’d also like to welcome Sridhar Ramaswamy to our Board of Directors. Sridhar, who is currently Senior Vice President, Ads & Commerce at Google, brings deep technical engineering experience and extensive cloud, analytics, and infrastructure expertise to the Board and we are very happy to have him. And, finally, Steffan has informed me and the Board that he intends to retire from his role as CFO. The Company is initiating a search for his replacement and Steffan will remain as CFO until the search is completed. Steffan, you have been a great CFO and friend, as well as a great business leader. You have built a world-class team that has enabled our market-leading growth that positions us well for the future. While you will be with us until we find your replacement, I did want to take this opportunity to thank you for all that you have done for the team. We are all very deeply appreciative. And, with that, I will turn the call over to you, Steffan.
Steffan Tomlinson: Thanks, Mark. And, thank you for the kind words. It is a privilege to work with you and the team here at Palo Alto Networks. I am very proud of what we have been able to accomplish in leading the market in such a short period of time. Now, let’s turn to the numbers and guidance. I’d like to note that except for revenue and billings figures, all financial figures are non-GAAP and growth rates are compared to prior year periods unless stated otherwise. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see positive indicators of the changes we started to make in Q3 2017 in the go-to-market portion of the business, as sales productivity improved sequentially. It was by far the largest new customer acquisition quarter in the Company’s history and we saw strong expansion sales in the existing customer base. I am pleased with the execution of our growth and profitability strategy as we continue to significantly outgrow the market, delivering record revenue, billings and deferred revenue, while also generating record operating income, earnings per share and free cash flow. In Q4, total revenue grew 27% to $509.1 million. For the fiscal year, we reported total revenue of $1.8 billion, a 28% increase year-over-year. Looking at the geographic growth of Q4 revenue, the Americas grew 27%, EMEA grew 28% and APAC grew 27%. Q4 product revenue of $212.3 million grew 11% compared to the prior year and was greater than we expected. Sales of the new hardware, which we launched in fiscal Q3 2017, contributed to the strong results this quarter. Q4 SaaS-based subscription revenue of $155.7 million increased 46%. Support revenue of $141.1 million increased 37%. In total, subscription and support revenue of $296.8 million increased 42%, accounted for a 58% share of total revenue, and is now approximately a $1.2 billion run rate business. Q4 billings of $670.8 million increased 17%. The dollar weighted contract duration for new subscriptions and support billings in the quarter was just under 3 years, essentially flat compared to the end of the second quarter and up slightly year-over-year as customers commit to our platform as their long-term security architecture. For fiscal 2017, total billings were $2.3 billion, up 20% year-over-year. Product billings were $711.1 million, up 6% and accounted for 31% of total billings. Support billings were $715.3 million, up 23%. Subscription billings were $867 million, up 32%. Support and subscription billings accounted for 69% of total billings in fiscal 2017 compared to 65% in fiscal 2016. This mix shift towards subscription and support is a multiyear trend that we expect to continue, given increasing customer adoption of our eight subscriptions, new subscription services to be introduced in FY 2018 and high renewal rates. Total deferred revenue at the end of Q4 was $1.8 billion and increased 43%. Q4 gross margin was 77.3%, a decrease of 210 basis points compared to last year and at the higher end of our target range of 75% to 78%. The decline was primarily attributable to the new products introduced in our fiscal third quarter. In Q4, discounting decreased sequentially and year-over-year. Q4 operating expenses were $273 million, or 53.6% of revenue, while operating margin was 23.7%. For the full fiscal year 2017, operating margin was 20.1%, an increase of 280 basis points year-over-year compared to FY 2016 operating margin of 17.3%, as reported. Included in the 280 basis point increase is approximately 100 basis points of organic operating margin expansion. We ended the year with 4,562 employees, an increase of 767 year-over-year. Net income for the fourth quarter grew 42% year-over-year to $85.5 million, or $0.92 per diluted share. For fiscal 2017, net income grew 47% year-over-year to $253.4 million, or $2.71 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis for the fourth quarter, net loss increased 22% year-over-year to $38.2 million or $0.42 per basic and diluted share. For fiscal 2017, GAAP net loss increased 12% year-over-year to $216.6 million or $2.39 per basic and diluted share. Both Q4 and fiscal 2017 GAAP results include an impairment loss of $20.9 million on property and equipment related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters. Additionally, we expect to recognize a loss of approximately $15.4 million in our Q1 fiscal 2018 GAAP results as we vacate our former headquarters facilities. Turning to cash flows and balance sheet items. We finished July with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $2.2 billion. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 900,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $134.60 per share, leaving a balance of approximately $580 million available for ongoing repurchases through December 2018. Q4 cash flow from operations of $239.5 million increased 28%. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $49.2 million, including $25.5 million of CapEx related to our new headquarters. Free cash flow was $190.3 million, up 11% at a margin of 37.4%. Excluding CapEx related to our new headquarters, free cash flow was $215.8 million, up 25.8% at a margin of 42.4%. DSO was 70 days, at the low end of the target range of 70 to 80 days. Turning now to guidance and modeling points. This guidance takes into account the type of forward-looking information that Kelsey referred to earlier. For fiscal Q1 2018, we expect revenue to be in the range of $482 million to $492 million, an increase of 21 to 24%; product revenue to be in the range of $170 million to $173 million, an increase of 4 to 6%; billings to be in the range of $580 million to $600 million, an increase of 12 to 16%; and, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.69, using 93.5 million to 95.5 million shares. We expect CapEx for Q1 fiscal 2018 to be approximately $30 million, including approximately $10 million final expenditure related to our new headquarters. For the full-year fiscal 2018, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.125 billion to $2.165 billion, an increase of 21 to 23%; product revenue to be in the range of $735 million to $750 million, an increase of 4 to 6%; billings to be in the range of $2.64 billion to $2.7 billion, an increase of 15 to 18%; and, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.24 to $3.34, using 96 to 98 million shares. Before I conclude, I’d like to provide some additional modeling points. For the full-year, we expect seasonality for revenue to be in line with historical trends as reflected in FY 2018 consensus heading into this afternoon’s call; year-over-year billings growth for the first half of Fiscal 2018 to be approximately 15%; subscription and support revenue to make up approximately 65% of total revenue; our non-GAAP EPS guide to include approximately 150 basis points of organic operating margin expansion, excluding continued investments in LightCyber in the first half of fiscal 2018; CapEx to be approximately $100 million; and, finally, free cash flow margin to be in the range of 37% to 39%. With that, I will turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we’ll go first to Ken Talanian from Evercore ISI.
Ken Talanian: First off, I was wondering, where are you in refreshing the group of customers who are likely to come up to renew hardware within the next year or so and with the new hardware? And then, what assumptions are you factoring into your fiscal 2018 guidance around that?
Mark McLaughlin: Hey, Ken. It’s Mark, happy to take that question. So from a refresh perspective, the cohorts for our customers continue to increase each year, so that gets better and better for us as the years go on. And we’ve been doing well on the refresh so far. We’re doing a lot of work to make sure that we capture refresh opportunity and into the future. In our fiscal 2018 numbers, we have a number of drivers associated with product growth; Refresh is one of them, it’s not the primary driver for growth, but it’s one of them in there.
Ken Talanian: Okay. And then, along those lines, are you seeing any changes to the level of attach for your -- attached subscriptions or acceleration in the unattached?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. We have -- the last time we’d talked about attached, which was a metric that we were not going to provide any longer because we’re more focused on a penetration rate. The last time we talked about it couple of quarters ago, we said it was 2.6 and since that time it’s been rising, continues to rise.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go next to Michael Turits from Raymond James.
Michael Turits: First, congrats on the quarter. Steffan, thanks for all your hard work over the years. Best of luck in all things and glad you are sticking with us through the transition. Two questions. One, first of all, the guidance was all very strong. But billings, billings growth is still lagging by about 5 points. Any thoughts on what’s happening there in terms of duration or why we’re still seeing that lag? And then I have a product question.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, sure. So, on the billings side, Michael, as you know, as we came off of the first half of fiscal 2017, we are working through some issues and those are improving for us. We saw productivity increasing through the second half. So, naturally, we were lower on the billings growth than we originally planned in fiscal 2017, so it created a lag to revenue. As you have seen from the guidance, we would expect that lag to continue, but it’s compressing through the back half of fiscal 2018, as we benefit from the ongoing work there.
Steffan Tomlinson: And we’re not seeing any change in duration for FY 2018.
Michael Turits: And then, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about GlobalProtect cloud service and initial reaction on that. We’ve been very positively impressed by it in terms of its importance to the market, and I wondered what else can you tell us there?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, sure. That’s -- very happy to talk about that. The GlobalProtect cloud service, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks is a new service that we’ll be launching in September, so very shortly. And this is a way for our customers in remote locations and branch offices to use all of our capabilities with the cloud offering, if they choose to do so. So, some customers like to in those kind of location to use hardware, small hardware, and in essence run it themselves. And obviously we’ve been doing that for quite some time for them, others like to have third parties manage that. We’ve been doing that for quite some time with our MSSP partners. And now, we’ll give them an additional way to do that as well through a complete cloud based solution. The interest on this is great from when we rolled it out at Ignite and talked with our customers about it.
Operator: Thank you. And we’ll go next to Walter Pritchard from Citi.
Walter Pritchard: Hi. Steffan. I just wanted to ask you about the free cash flow margin, sort of the high end of the range you talked about. I think you talked about 30 to 40 and you are at 37 to 38. Your revenue guidance at the low end of the range, you talked about corresponding that cash flow range. Any help you can give us understanding what’s enabling you to drive that better cash flow on revenue that’s at the lower end of that range?
Steffan Tomlinson: Well, there are couple of moving parts that go into free cash flow. But, we’re starting to see slight increases in productivity, so billings growth will help with free cash flow. And then, there is also just the overall improving operating margin that we’re trying to drive as well. We’ve signaled that we’re looking at increasing operating margin by 150 basis points of organic operating margin expansion, so that should be helpful as well. So, those are two dynamics. We’re solidly within our growth and profitability framework. And then, the last thing is our taxes continue to be very de minimis. Cash taxes for FY17 were roughly $9 million and we don’t see a very big uptick in FY18 as well. So, those are the moving parts.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go next to Philip Winslow from Wells Fargo.
Philip Winslow: Hey, thanks guys for taking my question. In your comments, you highlighted obviously strong expansion, and then in Q&A you commented on refresh as well. I really wanted to touch on the new customer acquisition, because if I look at what you did in the second half versus the first half, you clearly saw an improvement there. Just to the team here, I just wondered if you could just drill down on that. Have we started to see the positive impact of the changes that you made, mid fiscal year in terms of new customer acquisition? When you look at new customer acquisitions, maybe comment too, not just on count but deal size, and any sort of color you can give? Thanks.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. So, customer acquisition, as you saw very, very strong in the fourth quarter, happy to see that. I think there is a number of drivers inside there. The first and most important is I just think that the customer base continues to really gravitate towards Palo Alto Networks and the platform and what we can do with that with things that we’re talking about doing in the future as well are really resonating with customers who really can’t handle all the complexity and cost in the old way of doing things, so there’s clearly a move towards platforms and we consider ourselves a leader there. The second thing is more tactical in nature or operational, which you touched on is the work that we’ve been doing in go-to-market organization, it has paid off dividends in the -- early in the second half and through the fourth quarter, and we would expect that to continue to pay dividends into next year as well. I think some of that is showing itself through in customer acquisition rates as well. And then as far as the customers themselves, they are -- we’re a very enterprise focused company. The ASPs for customers continue to be in the mid-five digits for us that goes up and down in the various quarters. And we certainly pay attention to that but we pay more attention to the lifetime value and wallet expansion. And as you heard us talk about, lifetime value continues to grow very nicely across the customer base including the wallet expansion as well. So, that’s all going well. And probably one more thing that’s worth noting, in the fourth quarter itself, as we’ve seen -- continued great value internationally as well. So, our brand presence and recognition in international markets continues to grow over time and quickly, and we saw solid performance in every theater in the world, and that also contributed to strong customer adoption.
Operator: We’ll go next to Pierre Ferragu from Bernstein.
Pierre Ferragu: Steffan, maybe -- I hope it’s not too difficult a question. But, could you give us some perspective on what your thinking process has been and how you came to this decision to [indiscernible] you retire from the role? And then, if I think of the Palo Alto forward in the next few years, from where you stand today, what you think is going to be like the most important challenge, the Company is going to face? Thank you.
Steffan Tomlinson: Pierre, I appreciate the question. Over the past five and a half years, I’ve been fortunate to be part of the team that’s helped grow and scale to be a market leader. And the company is in a really good shape. We have a lot of management bench strength, and I’m focused on an orderly transition to whomever my successor is. And when I think about just the overall opportunity for Palo Alto Networks with leading technology, great go-to-market organization and the vision in leadership that the Company has, I think the future is very bright. But, I’ll turn that part over to Mark.
Mark McLaughlin: Thanks, Pierre. And the second part of your question, I’d say the most important challenge for us in the future is one that’s been with us for a quite some time, which is to make sure that we can scale well. I think from an innovation technology perspective, he’s done a very nice job. He gets very high marks from the industry, from the customers, from third-party recognition. We just launched a whole slew of new services, the Application Framework which we just announced, we truly believe is very, very disruptive and it’s going to change the entire industry as well again, we’re going to do it again; it’s our plan. But though all that, we’re a large company, growing very quickly and we have to execute well all the time. And I believe that would be the single biggest challenge for us to just make sure we get it right, again and again and again. And yes, we’ve been more right than wrong, but we’ve got a assess it.
Operator: We’ll go next to Rob Owens from KeyBanc.
Rob Owens: You mentioned in your prepared remarks less discounting in the period. And I was curious, if this is a function of the environment or a function of the new solutions that you have, if you can elaborate that would be great. Thanks.
Mark McLaughlin: I think it’s a mix of both things, Rob. So, what I mean by that is that Palo Alto has been very well known for bringing the highest levels of security into the enterprise base for long-term and as a result of that, I think we’re really the premium provider in terms of innovation, and we’re not the cheap providers in the market from a price perspective. So, our customers pay for value and we believe we’re delivering very high value. And as we keep delivering more and more capabilities and value, they’re continuing to pay at the prices we’re looking for and they’re getting a lot for that. So, in addition to that from the price performance throughput on things in the hardware category, those change over time as customers need better and better performance with better and better price for performance. We do things like SSL decrypt and use cases that are growing in nature, and we’ve been able to continue to do for that the customers as well, so that they can have all the performance they need at an acceptable price. I think it’s a mix of a combination of things there. 
Rob Owens: Great. And then, on the DSO front, massive improvement on a year-over-year basis. And I guess, it’s one of your best results this year. Was this a more linear quarter than you have seen, it really speaks to you guys kind of getting back to a normal cadence of sales? Thanks.
Steffan Tomlinson: Yes. That’s great question, Rob. So, we’ve been operating in a range of 70 to 80 days. We are at the lower end of the range this quarter. There are number of puts and takes to DSO. We have seen improved linearity, that’s one in particular. But we’ve also seen just good business traction as well and good question cycles. So, a number of things that go into it. But, being at the low end of the range is a good thing. But, we have a range [ph] for a reason because we do see some ebbs and flows to DSO.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go next to Jonathan Ho from William Blair.
Jonathan Ho: Hi. Good afternoon. And I wanted to add my congratulations as well. Maybe starting off, give us little bit of an update in terms of [technical difficulty].
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, sure. Jonathan, it’s Mark. We were barely able to hear you, but I think I got question. And from using the baseball analogy, from the go-to-market work we’ve been doing, it’s called the bottom of the fifth. As we motioned before, we took a four phased approach of this. We were going to design what we were going to do, we were going to communicate to folks, we were going to implement it and then we have to put it in runtime. We finished the first three phases; we’re in the runtime phase. We have the folks in the chairs for the most part that we need and establish the relationships appropriately with the customers. And this is the human element portion of it now, where we have to have those relationships bake over time. We are exactly where we expected to be at this time, so I’m very happy with the progress. And we think we’re seeing the fruits of that as you can see from the Q4 results.
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And then just in terms of the application framework. Can you give us a little bit more detail in terms of how you think that can maybe further differentiate Palo Alto? And what that could maybe mean for win rates going forward?
Mark McLaughlin: Sure. Let me start off on this one. The hundreds of customers that I’ve been spoken to about this over the course of this past six months at Ignite, BBCs, [ph] the reaction has been very, very positive. And the reason for that is that is pretty obvious that the consumption model in security is fundamentally broken. What I mean by that is, most customers will complain and rightly so that they have way too many vendors, how do you add the next one with less people to do it, less money to do it and complexity to do that. And what we’re doing at the Application Framework is to continue to change, not only what the definition security is which is very high rates of prevention, in this case using increasingly better and better analytics on massive sets of data, but also to be able to consume innovation in a different model. So, no single security company can innovative everything that is going to be needed. Customers know it, we know it. So, the Application Framework is leveraging all of the infrastructure that we’ve already deployed and we’re increasing that by thousands every quarter from a customer perspective and to a big data lake, which is already running at terabytes and petabytes of data for a long time, applying analytics on top of that, which we’ve been doing for long time as WildFire and MineMeld and LightCyber now. And then opening that up through an open API at the top, so that not only the Palo Alto Networks services and capabilities can be consumed, all the things you’ve already deployed but third parties as well. I mentioned in the prepared remarks, over 30 security vendors are currently writing applications into framework, we expect it to be a lot more over time. So, it’s a route to market but other vendors and including ourselves where the customer gets to use that capability, simply by turning it on, without having to deploy something additional into the network or their endpoint or the cloud, which is the very traditional model. So that’s why we think it’s very compelling, customers seem to agree with that.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go next to John DiFucci from Jefferies.
John DiFucci: Thank you. Mark, you said that ASPs for new deals were in the mid-five digits, but it sort of bounces around a little bit. By my math, and I’d try to figure it out, it was lower than it used to be, let’s say a year ago, and forgetting over the year where there’s lots of things happening, is this just -- does it have anything to do with the greater ratable portion of revenue from new deals, more ratable subscription maintenance than product or is there something else going on there?
Mark McLaughlin: John, it’s a good question and I think that when we are adding as many customers as we add every quarter, you see a wholesale slew of use cases for why people are coming to Palo Alto Networks. As a general matter, as we can average it all out but the definition of what ASP is, the general amount, and we average that all out, we are displacing our competitors at very high rates and lots of times the way that that happened is they want to use us for something and then they go from there and they expand. So, usually, when we’re going to come into an engagement somewhere, we’re going to -- one of the first things that we do, put this in a lab environment or ops environment or some environment to get started and tested. And that of course goes into the ASP for what they’re doing. But then, what happens almost all the time is they buy a lot more from us and spread out very rapidly, which is why we tend to pay a lot more attention to the lifetime value expansion and the wallet expansion of the customers as well. So, it’s not really about ratable subscription services. It’s really about, how do you start off with Palo Alto Networks and then what happens after the initial purchase.
John DiFucci : Got it. Okay. Thanks. And if I could just on the refresh, and maybe this one maybe for Mark Anderson. Since your new products that just came out of last quarter, imply improvements. Are you seeing with some times let’s call that sort of a trade down you’ve seen with other companies in history, when they come out with new products and when customers start to refresh, they may actually buy a lower level product, because they don’t need the same. Maybe they don’t need to spend as much as they did previously. Are you seeing any of that at this point?
Mark Anderson: I mean, we see -- anytime we bring out a new product family it offers dramatic price performance. We see really three things, we see customers to change, they need more bandwidth, because they’re moving a lot more applications around, maybe back and forth public to cloud, and they’ll trade up. We’ll see some customers that will trade down, because the price performance and port density meets their needs on the trade down. But more importantly and this has really become a big factor already as quickly as Q4, is we’re getting deals that we would not have otherwise won with the price performance of the -- in particular, the PA-850 and the PA-5200 family. It’s just very, very disruptive relative to what’s happened with the competition. So, for customers that want real fast capabilities and our next generation visibility, the applications and user behavior, there’s nothing like it out there and that’s been a big help.
Operator: We’ll go next to Sarah Hindlian from Macquarie.
Sarah Hindlian: Congrats on the quarter. I wonder, if you can talk about the overall threat environment a little bit more. Where are you seeing dollars rotated in your products? What’s sort of driving the better attach rate there are on the subscriptions side would be of great interest to us as well? Thanks.
Mark McLaughlin: Sure, thanks Sarah. So, on the threat environment, I think as you can -- the threat environment that we’re seeing, Sarah, let’s start with that. And you can see it all the time in newspapers and the various attacks. What we see from that from customers is the increasing recognition that the position you want to be in as a customer is the ability to get every possible shot you can to prevent an attack and be able to do that very consistently everywhere possible. So that would mean whether it’s in your network or in the cloud or endpoint, and to be really interjected into the attack lifecycle everywhere. So, you increase the probability analysis that you’re going to prevent that attack successfully. That is the definition of platforms and security, which is the ability to get high degrees of prevention in a highly automated way with less and less human involvement but tons of leverage from other companies all in the same kind of network effect if you will and getting consistently wherever data resides. And that’s what we’re delivering of our folks. So, earlier somebody asked a separate question, which I -- the recognition of the need for platforms in this kind of environment where the adversary is increasingly automated, really is starting to underline the need for less and less complex and manually dependant systems that have been delivered through legacy platforms and point solutions. And that’s fundamentally what’s happening with Palo Alto Networks and what’s been driving our growth.
Sarah Hindlian: That’s very helpful, thank you. Sorry for the bad reception. And on products attached, can you dive into that a little bit, maybe a little bit more color? [Technical Difficulty].
Mark McLaughlin: I’m sorry, Sarah. I missed half of that?
Sarah Hindlian: Second part of the question was about Traps, the first was attach…
Mark McLaughlin: Okay. As I said earlier in the attach side, a metric that we’re not sure as all that helpful from what’s happening from lifetime value and extension, [ph] the customers who are looking penetration rates, which continue to grow up over time, the attach rates have increased as we -- as I said earlier on the call and continue to increase, we expect that to continue as customers adopt all of our services. And on Traps, very happy with how Traps performed, of course it’s getting to be a good sized business for us. We have as you heard over 1,400 customers and millions of endpoints. And that’s growing really well and not only does our sales force agree with that, they are very excited about selling Traps, you can see it working very well for customers as well as the partner community as well where increasingly large number of partners are becoming Traps specialized partners, getting all the training as needed in order to bring that to market.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go next to Gur Talpaz from Stifel.
Gur Talpaz: Great. Thanks for taking my question, and Steffan thank you for all the help over the years. So, I wanted to ask about interest level and uptake in your standalone subscriptions, namely the VM-Series following the refresh earlier this year. Given the added capacity going over to 16-gigs per second with the 700 Series and as well the new features you’ve added to PAN-OS 8. Have you seen any change in the demand pattern for products like 300, 500 or 700 over the past few months?
Mark McLaughlin: Gur, what we’ve seen is really good demand in both cases. So, customers have a lots of use cases, and we’re trying to address all of their used cases. Obviously, some of them and only big growing part of that is cloud-based and where they’re using our VM-Series is in cloud environments, which is whether it’s hybrid or private or public, we can serve all of those with the VM-Series. And with the increasing amount of bandwidth required through because of cloud, SaaS and things along those lines, we have been and will continue to deliver faster and faster throughput in the VM-Series as well. At the same time, with the hardware that we have and we’re going continue to have, hardware is important part of the business. We are the biggest hardware security provider in the world today by launch [ph] we think. Some customers are doing both. They have physical hardware and also have virtualized capabilities in the cloud. They need the consistent protection between both of those. And so, lots of customers are using our hardware and our VM-Series, and we would expect that to continue in the future.
Gur Talpaz: That’s helpful. And then one more follow-up, if I may. On Traps, within endpoint, there’s been a lot of talk about endpoint conversions, primarily through the incorporation of EDR. Do you feel like that’s somewhere you need to go or is that somewhere -- is that a feature you think that could be addressed through the application delivery framework and some of the third parties that are building on top of your framework? Thank you.
Mark McLaughlin: I think we will be both. So, as we went to the very basics of -- when we launched Traps in the first place, so some of the really simple -- simple way to think about things about what you need from an next generation endpoint security solution, you would want the ability to do prevention if you could, detection if you can; you would want EDR capabilities and you want the ability to do some automated forensics as fast as possible. So, over simplifying things along those lines. And what you’ve seen us do with our roadmap with Traps is continually march down that list of things and also partner in cases where we don’t have those capabilities in the market. So, I think it will be a mix of those. And then, on the application framework itself, the other endpoint vendors as well running applications into the framework. And I think other security vendors will do that, even perhaps hopefully some of our competition at some point because ultimately what’s best for the customer is the delivery of the best capability and some largest set of data. And we think we are -- we have the largest set of data today. We’re going to continue to have that -- those are the very, very fast rate of deployment at Palo Alto Networks globally, as you can see from the customer additions and lifetime value extension.
Operator: We’ll go next to Sterling Auty from JP Morgan.
Sterling Auty: Let me start, Steffan, congratulations on a wonderful career. And I do know I’m going to get the questions, so I’m going to ask it in this form. Are you retiring or just retiring from Palo Alto and could we see you as a C level executive in another company going forward?
Steffan Tomlinson: Currently, retiring from Palo Alto Networks as CFO. I’d like to take a little bit of time off to figure out, what I’m going to do next. But, the most important thing for me right now is to ensure an orderly transition and be here until my successor is named.
Sterling Auty: Understood. Again, congratulations. And then, one follow-up. Really impressive results out of EMEA. We saw struggles out of Check Point and [indiscernible] in the quarter and there has been a lot of questions about GDPR and other things. Mark or Mark, any commentary to what you saw in the quarter, perhaps the linearity or the discussions and demand specifically to the theater?
Mark Anderson: Sterling, it’s Mark A here. We did have a very good quarter in EMEA. I think a big part of it is continued kind of elevation of our brand and the combination of the marketing and the sales covers that we have has really helped drive awareness to how we’re different and it gets us appointments. And especially with the GDPR coming in May of next year, there is sort of forced awareness that we’re not running around cashing ambulance. But we’re certainly being asked questions as subject matter experts and we’re turning -- showing ourselves to be much more relevant and much more of a thought leader and then maybe some of our competitors. And just secondly, the team there, the performance across all regions in EMEA without exception was very good and very consistent. So, all the way from the Middle East back to Western Europe in the UK and down to South America was just very solid. So, I think it’s a combination of a good team, elevated brand and just heightened awareness of the fact that legacy, point products, security and devices, we need to move beyond those.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go next Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company.
Gregg Moskowitz: Okay, thanks very much. And Steffan, congrats and best of luck. Mark, I wanted to follow up on the Application Framework because it does present a fairly radical change to security architecture, as we know it. Can you talk about over what time period you see this playing out as well as what do you think this might mean for your financial model, both over the medium term and long term?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. It’s a great question, Gregg. As you know, we like to be the disruptors in the industry. So, we’re going to keep doing that. And as I said, I think the model for security today or for some time has been increasingly broken consumption, right. And we did a huge amount of work around that. I’ll call the first evolution that we drove with the Next-Generation firewall where we proved that you could assume a lot of capability that used to be provided as point solutions as hardware into SaaS applications delivered off a hardware. And that’s a big part of our business. We do the second evolution about three years ago by proving this, we still have a lot -- ways to go on this, of course, we’re proving this. The consistency of having the same kind of security, not only the network but also the endpoints and cloud is actually critical and will grow in criticality over time. And very few vendors are going to be end up being able to make those claims as they can do that, high risk prevention exactly the same way, everywhere where the data may be. And then, the third major change or evolution is how do you consume all these things in the future where data become more and more important. So, that’s sort of the setup. I think the specific question about the model and the business is, we would expect this to be transformative to the industry over time. It’s going to take time of course to do that. The Application Framework as we said will be available in the calendar 2018 from us. And we would expect that over time, it would grow nicely. And its routes to market become open to security innovators that would not be able to go build businesses and reach scale and get the data importantly themselves as they could -- that we have because we have it in massive amounts. And just a couple of other thoughts around that. It’s a very virtuous cycle, if you will. And the more capabilities, analytics you can do in data that you have with your own, things you bring to market like Palo Alto Networks has done in the past and will continue to do in the future or that third parties can tap into through that application framework, makes the whole thing more valuable. And we’ll pull through the sensors, if you will, the endpoints and the hardware and the virtual capabilities, because that’s actually how you consume. And then, more of those that are deployed; and we deploy a big amount, drives more data, which makes the data more attractive to people to write applications into. So, I think you kind a get upfront, if you will, bottoms up and the tops down, these things are very self-reinforcing and will grow over time.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we’ll go next to Fatima Boolani from UBS.
Fatima Boolani: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. Mark, and a question for you around the lifetime value metric. That metric continues to be resilient for you and continues to slope upwards. And maybe going back at the basics, can you help us understand sort of what’s going in that metric and maybe what the most sensitive drivers are there in there that we are underestimating and that continue to outperform for that number to reach the $20 million mark?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, sure. Maybe the simplest answer would be, everything goes in the lifetime value. So, if you purchase something from Palo Alto Networks, it could be hardware, it could be virtual, it could be maintenance and support, it could be subscription services, it’s going to count inside the lifetime value metric, which is one of the reasons why we talk about the multiple of your initial purchase. Somebody earlier asked about ASPs. So, if you look at the multiple of initial purchase, it’s really that and continues to grow over time. As far as the other part of question about what might be less evident, if you will, inside of that, I’ll turn it over to Steffan.
Steffan Tomlinson: Yes. I think as you platform resonates with customers and they’re looking to adopt all of our subscription services, all the new hardware, we have this dynamic where the expansion value of an opportunity, once we acquire the customer dwarfs the initial purchase. So, our customers continue to come to us and say they want less security vendors in the space; they’re looking for a consolidated platform. And the fact that we have great innovation engine going on at the company, we’re coming out with subscription services and products that customers want to buy, that’s playing right into the wheelhouse of where the industry is moving. So, it’s platforms are winning over time. We believe we have the best platform and those are like the key drivers.
Mark Anderson: And there’s probably a dozen different places in a large enterprise that we can sell our use cases. So, we’re constantly looking to pull more arrows from our quiver and which we’ve certainly done with amazing innovation over time. And we can do that in multiple places within the enterprise. So, with the right account coverage, we’re looking to continue to expand at all times.
Operator: We’ll go next to Erik Suppiger from JMP.
Erik Suppiger: Steffan, good luck with retirement. Great working with you. My question is, as you look into 2018, how do you see the expansion into cloud services progressing? Did you see, what kind of adoption did you see in Q4 and how do you plan to position the Company for that in 2018?
Mark McLaughlin: Sure. Hey Erik, it’s Mark. Well, we saw very strong adoption in cloud, and in cloud, there is a number of things inside of there. One is the VM-Series, so lots of strong customer adoption. That’s a good size business for us, keeps growing at very rapid rates. We also saw good adoption from Aperture, which is our CASB offering. We’ll throw that into cloud category as well, so I think customers, they do that. And then, the third thing of the services we just announced on the Logging Service and the GlobalProtect as a cloud service as well. We’ll also add the ability to serve use cases into the cloud for customers. So, we would expect a adoption over time from that as well.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take our final question from Karl Keirstead from Deutsche Bank.
Karl Keirstead: Thanks. Maybe given last, I’ll squeeze in two. One is, Mark, on the federal government side, we’ve heard from Juniper and most recently Ciena this morning about some expected softness in the federal government side. Obviously, they are big quarters right now. Your guide for Q1 doesn’t seem to reflect weakness. But, I’m just curious what you’re seeing there. And then, if I could squeeze in a second. It seems like Palo Alto is replacing John as the Head of U.S. Sales and I’m wondering if you could put that in context. And is that sort of a last big piece on the sales leadership front as you close on your reorg? Thanks so much.
Mark McLaughlin: Sure, Karl. I’ll take -- this is Mark M, I’ll take the fed question and give Mark Anderson the John’s question. On the fed side, just as a big picture item, we’re a very well diversified company from a revenue perspective, no vertical -- and any quarters representing 12% to 14% of revenue, which is good because our verticals go up and down obviously and sentiments and spending patterns. That’s been a very good business for us for a long time, we’d expect that to be the case in the future. But, I believe that there is a lot of uncertainty in the fed space right now, giving budget anxiety. So, you just pick up the paper, you can read about whether we’re going to have a budget, a continuing resolution. And I think that is past the cloud over what’s going to happen from a spend perspective. Unfortunately into the end of the fed year we’re spending which ends in September, as you know. So, we’ve taken all that into account from a guide perspective. And we hope there will be more clarity in that space in not too distant future but we’re watching like everybody else. I’ll turn the discussion to Mark.
Mark Anderson: Yes, sure. So, Karl, with regards to Spiliotis, [ph] he was with us for over 4.5 years. And gosh, what incredible job he did building the business. He came to us over a year ago and said that -- mostly for family health reasons, he wanted to shut it down at some point and just in a move of incredible character said, what would be the best time for Palo Alto Networks. And so, as we went through our transitions, challenges in the second quarter, John was there leading the changes and really driving that and finished up with the really good strong Q4. And just hats off to him. I’ve known him for 25 years and he’s a good friend and a tremendous guy and he deserves to take a rest, which I know he’s going to do. So, with that much time, we were able to do a good -- I think a good discrete search and spend a lot of time with Patrick Blair. Patrick comes with incredible credentials; he’s a good guy, great culture fit. And as you can hear, the team has incredibly strong bench strength and lot of tenure in the senior leaders of that team. And we’re excited about what Patrick brings to the mix. Patrick’s got scale, managing thousands and billions, which is important for us as we look to our future. And he had incredibly warm welcome at our SKL [ph] last week. And I think people are excited to have him onboard because he’s got a great reputation here in the valley.
Kelsey Turcotte: We’re going to quickly wrap up. Before I turn over Mark, I know we gave you a lot of modeling information today. By practice, we post our script to the webpage as soon as we hang up this afternoon. So, please do go look for that information because there is a lot detail in there that I think you’ll find helpful both for Q1 and for the full year. And with that, I’ll turn it over to Mark.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. Thanks, Kelsey. And thanks again everybody for joining us on the call today. And as Kelsey mentioned in the opening remarks, our Investor Day will be September 27th in New York. We hope to see everybody there. I appreciate your time on the call. Bye, bye. 
Operator: That does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation.

Mark McLaughlin: Thank you, Kelsey, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today to discuss our fiscal third quarter results. In the third quarter, revenue grew 25% year-over-year to $432 million, and billings grew 12% year-over-year to $544 million. We generated free cash flow of $163 million and reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.61, up 33% year-over-year. As many of you know, we initiated a sales force reorganization at the end – at the outset of our fiscal third quarter. We’re making solid progress in these efforts and are on track with our project plans. While we have much more to do and it will take time to fully realize the impact of these changes, early feedback from customers, partners and our sales team has been good. Now turning to the quarter. In Q3, new customer adds were the second highest in the company’s history. We’re now privileged to serve more than 39,500 customers worldwide, including 86 of the Fortune 100, and approximately 1,200 of the Global 2000, 40 of which we added during the quarter. Feedback on our technology, approach and strategy is very positive, as evidenced not only by higher rates, customer acquisition, but also by external recognition. For example, customer satisfaction is very high as measured by our net promoter score of 73, which is more than 20 points higher than what is considered a best-in-class net promoter score of 50. And in Q3, we were privileged to earn the SANS Best of 2016 Award for Next Generation Firewalls, which was voted on by the SANS community of security operations professionals and security managers from around the world who have used our technology to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of their cybersecurity programs. In Q3, we continue to see strength not only in new customer acquisition, but also in increasing wallet share of existing customers for our next-generation security platform. In the quarter, all of our top 25 lifetime value customers, again, made purchases. And to make this list, a customer had to have spent a minimum of $20.1 million in lifetime value, a 61% increase over the $12.5 million in Q3 of fiscal 2016. Specific examples of customer wins, competitive displacements in the quarter included a Check Point data center replacement for one of the world’s largest retailers and eight-figure deals to replace Check Point in a large U.S.-based auto insurance provider; a seven-figure Cisco replacement that included all of our tax subscriptions, where we became the security platform for one of the world’s largest travel companies based in Europe; a seven-figure Cisco replacement with our PA-7080 chassis and new PA-5200 series devices at a multi-state network of physician clinics, outpatient centers and hospitals in the United States; a seven-figure deal to become the security architecture for one of the largest insurance companies in the United States, including securing their cloud initiatives and two large antivirus replacements with Traps and one of Southeast Asia’s largest banks, as well as a U.S.-based healthcare provider. We’re able to win at very high rates in a very competitive market because of the unique capabilities of our platform. As the recent WannaCry global attack illustrated, the need for integrated and automated security is growing quickly. We are always pushing the innovation curve to keep customers safe across their entire architecture, including on-premise endpoints, third-party SaaS applications, and public and private cloud deployments. And this approach is constantly enhanced by the network effect of tens of thousands of customers and our technology partner ecosystem providing leverage to each other through our platform. Our continued innovation has been well received by the market. Our new hardware generated very high interest in the quarter and we’re pleased that demand for these new products exceeded our internal forecast. Also market reaction was very positive for the introduction of our new high-performance virtualized firewalls, as well as our new 8.0 operating system with more than 70 new security features that enhance all aspects of our next-generation security platform. Momentum with our attach prescription services was also evident in Q3, including WildFire, where we added approximately 1,500 new customers. We’ve been adding over 1,000 WildFire customers per quarter for over three years and are now serving approximately 17,000 WildFire customers. WildFire is a great example of our integrated and automated approach to enterprise security, not only improves prevention outcomes, but also drives operational efficiencies for customers overwhelmed by the numbers, cost and complexity of legacy tools and point products. With the size of our customer base, the capabilities deployed, we’re also using analytics to provide differentiated tools and actionable intelligence. We saw strong customer growth in AutoFocus, as well as a high degree of interest in our newly acquired LightCyber technology. We remain on track that LightCyber integrated into our platform can offer us a subscription service by the end of this calendar year. In addition to analytics, cloud security is top of mind for our customers, and we continue to see solid uptick on our cloud offerings due to our unique ability to provide not only clouds specific security capabilities, but also the consistency of security wherever data resides are computed. In Q3, we saw a strong substantial growth for Aperture added hundreds of VM-Series customers and are continuing to expand our market reach by leveraging our partnerships with all leading cloud infrastructure providers. Interaction continues to grow nicely for Traps, where hundreds of channel partners are now selling Traps, and we’re serving over 1,000 customers. In early May, we announced the latest release of Traps endpoint technology. Enhancements in this 4.0 release include the additional support for macOS and a beta for Android, plus several new prevention modules designed to detect and stop ransomware and other advanced threats. When implemented with our next-generation firewalls, customers can now correlate endpoints and network security events in our network security management tool, Panorama. In just a couple of weeks, we’re expecting thousands of guests to join us in Vancouver for Ignite, our annual user conference. This is proven to be a great and highly anticipated event by our customers and partners, we hope to see you there. Registration information can be found on the Palo Alto Networks website. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Steffan.
Steffan Tomlinson: Thanks, Mark. Before I start, I’d like to note that except for revenue and billings figures, all financial figures are non-GAAP and growth rates are compared to the prior year periods unless stated otherwise. In our third quarter, we saw some early positive indicators of the changes we’re making in the go-to-market portion of our business. Sales and productivity improved sequentially, with product revenue coming in better than we had expected as customers invest in our next-generation security platform. We delivered record revenue, strengthened our balance sheet, and generated strong cash flows. Turning now to the financial highlights for the quarter. New customer acquisition and expansion within our existing customers drove revenue growth of 25% to $431.8 million. Looking at the geographic mix of revenue, the Americas grew 22%, EMEA grew 32%, and APAC grew 33%. Product revenue of $164.2 million grew 1.3% compared to the prior year. Increasing adoption of our eight subscriptions and high renewal rates continue to drive sales in the recurring portion of our business. Q3 SaaS-based subscription revenue of $143.2 million, increased 55%. Support revenue of $124.4 million, increased 37%. In total, subscription and support revenue of $267.6 million, increased 46%, and accounted for a 62% share of total revenue. Billings of $544.1 million increased 12% and contract duration was unchanged compared to the prior year. Total deferred revenue of $1.6 billion, increased 51%. Moving on to margins. Q3 gross margin was 76.4%, a decrease of 150 basis points compared to last year, and within our target range of 75% to 78%. The decline was primarily attributable to the new products we introduced in the quarter. As we indicated on last quarter’s call, new products typically have a higher initial cost of goods sold, which will improve over time. Looking forward, we expect there will be fluctuations in product gross margin, particularly with the recent introduction of our new products, when we typically see a decline in product gross margin for a few quarter. And in the quarter, discounting decreased sequentially and was essentially flat year-over-year. Q3 operating expenses were $250.8 million, or 58% of revenue. Operating margin was 18.4% in Q3. Net income for the quarter grew 35% year-over-year to $57.1 million. EPS grew 33% to $0.61 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis for the third quarter, net loss was $60.9 million, or $0.67 per basic and diluted share. We finished April with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $2.1 billion. During the third quarter, we’ve purchased approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of $113 per share, leaving a balance of approximately $705 million available for ongoing repurchases. Q3 cash flow from operations of $211.2 million increased 24%. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $48.6 million, including $32.8 million of CapEx related to our new headquarters. Free cash flow was $162.6 million, up 8% at a margin of 37.7%. Excluding CapEx related to our new headquarters, free cash flow was $195.4 million, up 29% at a margin of 45.3%. DSO was 78 days within the target range of 70 to 80 days. Turning now to guidance and modeling points. This guidance takes into account the type of forward-looking information that Kelsey referred to earlier, and also takes into account the work we still have to do on the go-to-market changes we introduced last quarter. For fiscal Q4 2017, we expect revenue to be in the range of $481 million to $491 million, an increase of 20% to 23%, and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.78 to $0.80 using 93 million to 95 million shares. In addition, we expect the following modeling points for Q4 2017. Billings to be in the range of $625 million to $645 million; product revenue to be in the range of $188 million to $191 million;, and CapEx to be approximately $55 million, including $30 million related to our new headquarters. And for the fiscal year, we expect non-GAAP operating margins to be 19.5% to 19.6%, which is an increase of 220 to 230 basis points relative to FY 2016 non-GAAP operating margin of 17.3%, as reported. Included in that 220 to 230 basis point improvement is approximately 100 basis points of organic operating margin expansion and 180 to 190 basis points positive impact from the deferred commissions change, offset by an approximately 60 basis point headwind from LightCyber, and we expect fiscal 2017 free cash flow margin, excluding our headquarters investment to be, at least, 40%. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We’ll take our first question today from Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs.
Gabriela Borges: Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. May I just start off from, you mentioned in the prepared remarks a little bit on the progress you’ve made with the sales force and then there are still some work to do. Maybe you could just give us a little more detail there on what you feel you’ve accomplished thus far into the second-half of the fiscal year? And what are some of the milestones that you’re looking to achieve with the productivity and other internal metrics as we go through fiscal year into the next fiscal year? Thank you.
Mark McLaughlin: Sure, Gabriela. Yes, thanks for being on the call. Yes, as we mentioned last quarter with the reorganization, we are taking a four step approach to this. We needed to design what we wanted to do differently. We want to communicate that to everybody. We need to do account mapping exercises with the accounts in the right place coverage wise, and then we’ll make sure everybody’s in the chairs to cover that then we have to run it that way. So over the course of the last quarter, we got the design work finished, the communication work finished. We’ve met all the accounts, and now we need to make sure that the folks are in the chairs to cover the accounts and that other folks who have just picked up accounts are working as fast and as hard as possible with our help to build those relationships and those accounts as well, so that’s where we are. Right now, we’ll be continuing that through during the fourth quarter, for sure, hopefully, see a positive impact from this through fiscal 2018.
Gabriela Borges: That’s helpful. And as a follow-up, if I could, just from a comment that discounting activity has moderated year-over-year, just your thoughts on what you think is driving that? Is that a function of some of the new products? Is it a function with competitive environment or effects, anything that would be helpful?
Mark McLaughlin: Well, the – different folks in the market have different go-to-market motions. Ours has always been to really focus upon security, reduction with complexity and, of course, we want to deliver that in a way that is within the cost envelope of what customers have, other folks have come out of it from the bottom of that stack, and really decided to go from a cost perspective and worked their way out, that’s not really been our go-to-market motion. So we believe there’s a lot of value in the problem. We train our salespeople and talk very consistently to the value proposition that’s going to provide for security, reduction and complexity and better total cost of ownership. And we think as a result of that, we’ve been able to maintain pretty good discounting discipline through the company’s history and you see that in this quarter as well.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company.
Gregg Moskowitz: Okay, thanks very much and congratulations on a nice bounce back quarter Mark, just to follow-on Gabriela’s first question. If we could apply the overused baseball analogy to the progress made with respect to your sales reorg, what inning would you say that we’re in right now?
Mark McLaughlin: I’d say, bottom of the second, top of the third.
Gregg Moskowitz: Okay, that’s helpful. And then just for Steffan, any color that you can provide on the percentage of units roughly that were shipped this quarter that came from the new product family, and if you have any commentary just as it relates to ASPs for the new products sales vis-à-vis the other prior ones? Thanks.
Steffan Tomlinson: Well, we’re very pleased with the adoption of our new products, they fill a need in the market and they also filled a need in our overall product line up. We don’t give exact percentages of how – of what percent of products were shipped coming from different units. I can tell you that the adoption was very strong. And as far as ASPs are concerned, it – the ASPs were very healthy kind of in line with what we thought. Anytime you have a new product introduction, you’re going to have a trade-up trade-down a new incremental opportunities presenting themselves, and we see – we saw all of that and overall it was a net positive for our business.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from John DiFucci with Jefferies.
John DiFucci: Thank you. I guess, my question is about the new products that came out. And do you think that, I mean, I know you’ve had talked a lot about the sales reorg, and it sounds like that’s going well. But there’s also seems like there’s most likely some pent-up demand sort of waiting for these new products. Do you think that had ended up and looking an on-site had an impact that was material on the results over the last couple of quarters?
Mark McLaughlin: Hey, John, it’s Mark. It’s always hard to tell right. When you have new product introductions, we have to assume that there would be some slippage from one quarter into the next as folks even see what their new products are about. So we assume, when we came out of the second quarter that we might have seen some of that fall into the third quarter, and have to assume that’s some of the overage in the third quarter is associated with that as well. I don’t think that that was the – I don’t think that was the majority of the over performance of what we guided there. But it’s – and it’s very difficult like to tell the exact amount one way or the other, but assume there’s some of that in there, of course.
John DiFucci: Okay. Thanks a lot, Mark.
Mark McLaughlin: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.
Matthew Hedberg: Great. Thanks, guys. Congrats on the quarter results from me. Growth in EMEA was particularly strong. I’m curious, is that more a function of easier compares, or our European customers starting to talk more about the breach notification going live next year?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, Matt, it’s Mark. A couple of things in that. One is just as the size of market, EMEA is a large market. And when you look at the – just the dollars we’re doing in that market, we think we have a long way to go and grow in that market. So I would expect to be able to grow very hopefully in that market for some period of time. So we’d like to see three handles are better on the growth, so we’d like to see that in the quarter. For the GDPR, which is a legislation you’re talking about. There certainly a lot of attention and focus on it that basically is legislation that’s going to present companies with some pretty large fines, if they’re found to be lacking in their duties of using state-of-the-art technology, which is not a defined term in the legislation, but it talks about it that way state-of-the-art technology. So there’s a lot of focus from companies and Board of Directors to say, are we doing that right? And I think that’s really driving a lot of interest in getting off of legacy technology and it’s certainly a great opportunity for a platform provider like ourself.
Matthew Hedberg: Great. Thanks.
Mark McLaughlin: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo.
Philip Winslow: Hey, thanks, guys, and congrats on a great bounce back quarter. I have a question about just the aging of your installed base. In the last Analyst Day, you all talked about just the potential wave of appliances coming up for renewal. Wonder if you can give some more detail to sort of what you saw this quarter, maybe compare that to the prior few quarters, if that wave starting to come on, or if that’s still on to come?
Mark McLaughlin: Hey, Phil, yes, it’s Mark. Yes, I think that the majority of what I would call that, the refresh potential for us is in the future and that’s just simple math. I’m looking at the classes, so we consider our classes as cohorts and doing by year. If you look at how that cohorts build over time, each year is getting a substantially bigger. So when we – if you think of like four to seven-year average refresh cycle somewhere in there, the big, big, big part of our customer base is going to be in refresh cycles and coming a couple of few years time versus the last couple of few years time. So we think that that’s something that should provided a tailwind for us go forward.
Philip Winslow: Got it. And then just one quick follow-up to that. I mean, in terms of just the new products we all launched in February. How do you think that influences, which way just the timing of people refreshing the installed base and considering you just have a new sort of virtual and physical appliances out?
Mark McLaughlin: So, yes, I think it would be helpful. And maybe an obvious point that, when you have new capability sets in a market, it gives the customers more choices. We like the lineup of technologies we had prior to the new products we launched. We just complemented them with a whole set of new products as well. So when customers are thinking about what their needs are, price performance needs are, throughput needs are that we’ve got a very, very full lineup now of capability sets and lots of upgrade for refresh when they’re so inclined when they reach that sweet spot in their refresh cycle.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Saket Kalia with Barclays Capital.
Saket Kalia: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions here. First, maybe for you, Steffan. You said last quarter that billings should lag revenue growth by about 10 or 15 points, at least, for the back-half of this year. And it looks like that relationship will hold here in the fourth quarter as well, realizing that that you’re not ready to give us guidance for fiscal 2018 yet. Can you talk qualitatively if that relationship between billings and revenue should maybe be consistent, or perhaps widen? How do you think about that going forward?
Steffan Tomlinson: I think, Saket, so last quarter we did say that the billings growth rate would trail the revenue growth rate by about 10 to 15 points, and in Q3, we came right about the midpoint of the range. Our Q4 guidance actually indicates that the range is improving and the range if you to – if you were to benchmark it off of the midpoint of our revenue guide, it’s about – billings growth rate is about 8.6% to 12.1% below revenue growth. So that that range is actually improving. And it’s too soon to call, what’s going to happen in 2018. But we’re definitely, we’re doing everything that we can to improve the growth profile of the company.
Saket Kalia: Got it. And then maybe for a follow-up here quickly for you, Mark, and maybe more philosophically. How do you think that last quarter’s experience is going to change that playbook in sales that’s been successful for so long in terms of splitting territories, allocating resources. How do you think about that playbook changing perhaps after last quarter’s experience?
Mark McLaughlin: I think that some of the chapters in the book are good and some of the chapters have to be modified, right? So the – we will continue to split territories. We wouldn’t do it at the rate and pace that we had done in the past. I think we talked about that on the last call, and then we will continue to do market segmentation, but we won’t be making assumptions about what the capability sets are from a sales team perspective one various customers that they could cover. So there’s – there are things that I would say will more or somewhat timeless when you think about sales playbooks and enters the execution based on which maybe unique to each company. So we’ve learned a lesson on that stuff, and we’re going to apply that fiscal 2018 and beyond.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Jonathan Ho with William Blair.
Jonathan Ho: Hey, guys, congratulations on the strong quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about maybe a shift, or acceleration of virtual appliances, and what you saw this quarter potentially relative to the public cloud?
Mark McLaughlin: Hey, Jonathan, it’s Mark. Yes, we continue to see a really nice adoption from the VM-Series and a lot of that’s being used in the public cloud environment, as well as private cloud, or NSX is doing very well. We’ve had that relationship for quite sometime. We’re seeing hundreds of customers in the public cloud environments using the VM-Series as well, and we would expect that to grow over time. There’s a lot of different angles on that that we look at, one is lead regeneration. We’re seeing some customers use us for the very first time, and AWS, for example. And then we get the lead in order to follow-up to see if we can ride additional security outside of just that public cloud infrastructure throughout their on-prem, through endpoints and things along those lines, see lots of people taking their own licenses up there and we see increasing sales in the marketplace just using AWS. We’re seeing that Azure, Google, other infrastructure providers as well. But it seems like it’s – it seems like it’s solid growth for us.
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And then just relative to WannaCry, are you seeing any sort of impact from the increased attention around breaches, or do you think that that’s just more sort of support and removal or friction around the spending? Thank you.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, sure. There are couple of things in that. The first is, WannaCry certainly got a lot of public attention. It’s – there’s going to be another attack like, I can’t say what it is, don’t know when it’s going to be right, but there’s always going to be the next one. I think, the WannaCry thing raised a lot of awareness and anxiety one, because it’s really kind of focused in the healthcare community first, it moved out of there. So further evidence of, I’ll call, critical aspects of our society that relying on the digital age of technology being at risk and certainly would capture folks attention. The other thing I think I highlighted for us as well as opportunity is the increasing need for platform. So, I think, WannaCry was looked at primarily as like an endpoint problem. But it – but it’s broader than that, once it gets in a – once it gets into an organization that moves around, it had the ability to spread. So platforms like ours are uniquely able to handle that stuff. So Traps, for example, would have stopped it on the endpoint. If it were in the network, WildFire would have picked it up. It was – if it was somebody was going to download it from a malicious URL and we would have stopped that. Threat Prevention would have stopped lateral movement and the internal spreading of the infection. So it really helps to have multiple ways to beat these attacks, and WannaCry is a great example of a good position you would be and if you had all those capability sets.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Michael Turits with Raymond James.
Michael Turits: Hey, guys, two questions. But first, you had talked in the past about the back-half of the calendar year getting some tailwinds both from the product refresh in general, as well as the new product cycle. Does that still looks like something that could be an accelerated growth at this point?
Mark McLaughlin: Hey, Michael, yes, as we talked about, we certainly talked about that at the beginning of the year and we had laid out a number of reasons why we believe that product growth would accelerate partly due to the ramping capabilities as sales force currently due to the assumption. There would be new product introductions service writer business, increasing productivity and lot of that holds true, but we have the crosscurrent of the sales force reorganization and things that we’re dealing with. So there’s puts and takes on both sides of that. We’re happy to see the product revenue in the Q – in the third quarter, but frankly, we’re not satisfied with where we are and we think we can do better and we aim to do better.
Michael Turits: And then second question, a bit more specifically on the VM-Series. One of the important thing about the new release was the increase in throughput, or capacity for the new virtual. So what’s been – has there been a measurable impact from that both in terms of cloud adoption and the utilization and well – as well perhaps in the on-prem or in the private cloud that people thinking about it relative to other a trade-off of using virtual versus using physical box?
Mark McLaughlin: I think there’s – here’s how we think about, I think, a lot of customers are thinking this as well, which is, it’s really kind of a used case specific. So, your data is going to reside in different places, it’s going to be computed in different places, it’s going to move back and forth very, hopefully, very efficiently and without friction. And that’s really what we’re trying to do with the platform is providing the security in all those places. So when you talk about the cloud or in used cases or like East-West traffic in a highly virtualized data center. One of the things you’re going to see there, for sure, is just an ever-increasing amount of throughput requirements, because volume is growing from a number of applications, number of third parties applications being used for encryption, decryption capabilities or decryption needs, for example, so the throughout is going to continue to rise over time. So I think in the case just like we did with our hardware of having the much higher performance and same with the virtualized firewall as well as with the quadruple performance there, and we’re going to keep growing that performance, because as used cases, whether they’re physical or they’re cloud demand higher throughputs.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray.
Andrew Nowinski: All right. Thanks, guys. Just a question on the product guidance – product revenue guidance, you had great upside in the quarter, you had 1% year-over-year growth off of tough comp. I guess, why aren’t you expecting that momentum to continue in July quarter since your guidance suggests that product revenue will decline on a year-over-year basis? Is that just you being more conservative than usual?
Mark McLaughlin: Hi, Andrew. So when looking at the product side, we’re happy to see where we came in third quarter. Of course, like I said, we’re not satisfied big picture of where we are and we aim to be better than what we’re doing. When we look at the third to fourth quarter, we’re still looking at like a 15% sequential increase from the third and fourth quarter of the guide we gave, so that that’s a big increase. It’s a doable increase, for sure, we think and we expect it to get that done. But we’re kind of look at that on a relative basis sequentially and we’re looking at on a year-over-year basis while we’re coming off very, very high comp in the fourth quarter last year.
Steffan Tomlinson: And we’re still in the midst of going through the sales force reorganization. So that also is a crosscurrent.
Andrew Nowinski: That’s right. Okay, I got it. And then on with regard to Traps, it’s still – you certainly continue to add more customers, but still has, I think a penetration rate of less than 3% on your installed base. When do you think, it’s going to start to gain a little bit more traction? When do you think we’ll start to see that penetration rate increasing at a faster clip?
Mark McLaughlin: Sure. That’s actually an area of an intentional focus for us, Andrew, which is given that we’ve been in the market for about three years now as one of the next gen providers after a replacement budgets like everybody else’s. We’ve been very intentional in targeting new customers, as well as our existing customer base for larger customers and larger deployment of endpoints, and that’s what we’re accomplishing. We’re very happy to have over 1,000 customers now, rate of customer growth is good. We would expect the penetration rate to go up faster later. But we’re – as we saw for all this referenceability that we’re getting now and increasing the technical capabilities like the 4.0 release. I think that with all that focus in mind, we’re getting where we want to go and when you think about the next gen AV providers in the market today, based on what we know about that we think we’re one of the biggest from a sales perspective.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Michael Kim with Imperial Capital.
Michael Kim: Yes, good afternoon, guys. Just a follow-up on Traps. Are you seeing an increase in head-to-head evals and any early feedback on when win rates? And out of that 1,000 customers, 1,000 of customers that you’ve accumulated are the majority of those existing or net new logos?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, sure. So, yes, we’re doing lots of head-to-head, that’s actually what we’re trying to do right? We’re focused on trying to take the AV budgets from legacy providers when a lot of people are dissatisfied with them. So we’re certainly seeing them head-to-head and in a lot of the situations not surprisingly lot of the next gen folks are being evaluated, and kind of as a side note that, Michael, one of the interesting things that we’ve found with the customers that we’ve acquired so far when we survey them, that well more than half of those customers when asked why are you buying Traps from Palo Alto Networks. In addition to saying, it’s a great best-of-breed next gen endpoint security capability are saying, because it’s actually very well integrated with my network security capabilities and increasing with a cloud security capabilities, that consistency is very important and that approach where we’re driving is very important. Can you remind me your second part of your question?
Michael Kim: Yes. So I was curious out of the 1,000 odd customers you have today, how much – how many of those were net new logos to Palo Alto versus existing customers? And I’m curious kind of what the initial uptake has been?
Mark Anderson: Yes, Mike, Mark Anderson here. It’s actually a pretty good balance that we have, I’d say close to 50-50. And the great thing is, our core sales team is getting better and better enabled each quarter at being able to integrate the Trap story into their next-generation network security story and prove the value of these two things working closely together. So whenever we do get a Traps customer, that’s a first-halftime buy. We’re able to go back and very seamlessly sell network security as well.
Operator: That’s great. Thank you very much.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Pierre Ferragu with Bernstein.
Pierre Ferragu: Hi, thank you for taking my question. We talk a bit about like a refresh of opportunity and I even sure you got confused about how much refresh do you have in product revenues reported this quarter? Is that like am I right thinking, it’s still like a very, very negligible, very small part of your business and most firewalls, you’re selling today are still like adding up to your installed base, or is the fresh business already something fairly sizable and will you have an idea of what percentage of your product revenues would be refreshed already to-date? And then I had a – just like a very quick follow-up on sales cycle. We heard a lot over the last six to nine months in the industry that sales cycle were getting a bit longer. Plants were taking more time to figure out what they want in terms of network security. If you could give us like the latest update on that front as well?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, Pierre, it’s Mark. I’ll take the first question, pass the second one to Mark Anderson. On the refreshed side of it, we don’t breakout the percentage of what portion of product is coming from new expand versus refreshed. But I can’t say in the refresh side is the – refresh for us has been strong in the past through our cohorts, which was great and kind of get a sense of that when you think about our renewal rates, our NPS scores, all these other externality that point to customers really like Palo Alto Networks and they can do refresh with us as well. Back to the cohort thing, I was talking about earlier. The percentage of the business is coming from the refresh has been increasing just kind of naturally mathematically as we gradually years, if you will, through those cohorts, and we would expect it to increase into the future.
Pierre Ferragu: Yes [Foreign Language] Pierre. So as far as the sales cycles go, I think, the new normal is that these sales cycles are taking longer. Clearly, security continues to be a Board level number one or number two priority for customers at every level. And there’s also copycats out there in the market that are mimicking the value proposition at Palo Alto Networks is going to pioneered. And really, that’s getting our sales teams trying to work hard to solve to a technical proof-of-concept, because when we get a chance to demonstrate in their live – with their live network traffic how differentiated we are. We typically win. So that does take a little extra time. We’ve sort of factored that into our forecast and guidance each quarter. And certainly, our sales teams have kind of factored that into their campaigns to win customers to really get to that technical proof-of-concept.
Pierre Ferragu: Thank you.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer.
Shaul Eyal: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on the solid execution quarterly performance. Mark, how is the LightCyber integration has been coming along so far? I don’t know if you can quantify or provide us with some color, they have some potential contribution this quarter?
Mark McLaughlin: Sure. Let me take that financially first and technically second. On the financial basis, the contribution was de minimus. From a top line perspective, when we gave some guidance last quarter from the impact from operating margin perspective, which as Steffan went over. On the technical basis, the integration is going, as planned. We’re on our project launch there, which is fantastic. We expect that will be a subscription-based service, like I said, before the end of the calendar year just as a kind of a side note on that, and you’ll hear more about this at Ignite if you just attend Ignite, that’s an example of capability, which is a really great technical capability, highly innovative for network behavioral analytics that when it is integrated in a platform, will take something that has historically been a product sale like by products and deployed everywhere to something that is a – as the software. So the subscription service without having to deploy additional hardware. So the feedback from the customer base on that model and what we’re demonstrating there with LightCyber has been very positive so far feedback wise. And they also like the service itself, it’s a very important service defined anomalies when somebody is moving through your network and they’re looking for just getting that best-of-breed capabilities on-site platform.
Mark Anderson: Yes, and if I can just add to that, Mark. I think from a people standpoint, we’re really impressed with the quality of the people that came over with LightCyber. They’ve co-located with our Tel-Aviv team in Israel and it’s a really good fit.
Shaul Eyal: Got it. And then in the latter part of calendar 2016, if I’m not mistaken, you’ve established a telco-related type of activity, or maybe telco-related group. Just interested, Mark, around how the ramp-up has been coming along so far?
Mark McLaughlin: Sure. Yes, that’s the service provider group, we talked about that like a couple of years ago actually saying we wanted to be very focused on that more so than the past on the service provider, because it had been a couple years ago relatively untapped market for us right. The service provider market has some very specific technical needs capabilities. They also have some very specific go-to-market requirements, where you have to understand them, we have to talk – their talk. You have to know what their needs are and relationships really matter. So over the course of the last couple of years, we’ve building up the service provider team that has been built out very well, and they’re contributing very nicely the business we’d expect that business to grow over time for us.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Catharine Trebnick with Dougherty.
Catharine Trebnick: Hello. Thank you for taking my question. Mark, I have a question regarded – regarding your virtual firewalls. It seems to me you said on earlier in your commentary several hundred this quarter. How – could you explain how differentiated you are with your virtual firewall versus Check Point in the AWS cloud or Azure? It seems to be rapid migration to cloud right now, and where do you see us fitting into this migration? And how fast is this possibly replacing some of your core – hardware products? Thanks.
Mark McLaughlin: let me comment on that backwards, Catharine, for a second, which is so far and we think obviously continue into the future, we’ve seen the cloud in general and then our VM-Series and other cloud aspects like Aperture to be additive. So we think that’s a lead provider for us and a growth provider for us in use cases. As far as differentiation relative to any of the competitors really kind of three things going on there. The first is that the – our VM-Series does exactly everything that our physical capabilities that would do. In the physical capabilities, as you know, the hardware capabilities are highly differentiated on what we do with Apple ID, content ID, user ID plus all the subscription services that you’re able to run on that. So we virtualized all that quite sometime ago. So that the difference is the customers really loved and appreciated in a physical world, they get all those in the virtual world as well. So that’s a starting point and very important point. The second part of that is just part of the platform. So you don’t have to give up, or accept a different, or lower security capabilities when you go to the cloud with all the networks, you get to have all those capabilities seamlessly from endpoints network to cloud to private cloud, third-party SaaS application, it’s exactly the same outcome. And customers really love the orchestration, the automation that you get as a result of that as well. So there’s – those are the fundamental two kind of differences on a competitive aspect that that people really appreciate when they look at our VM-Series.
Catharine Trebnick: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI.
Ken Talanian: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, first off, have you seen any changes in the customer’s desire to do multi-year deals? and then can we – along with that, can we expect contract duration to remain relatively constant going forward?
Mark McLaughlin: Over the years we’ve seen a slight uptick in contract duration, and that’s really been customer led. And it’s indication of our – the value that we’re bringing to the table. And that customers want to standardize on us for a multi-year period and also renew at very high rates. Contract duration has been stable year-over-year. It’s hard to predict where contract duration is going to go. But at this point, from our own internal modeling standpoint, we’re not assuming any wide variation in contract duration on a go-forward basis. Time will tell.
Ken Talanian: Okay. And just a follow-up, I know we’ve sort of touched on this before with some of the prior questions. But I’m just curious what of – which of the new appliance families demonstrated the most traction in the quarter?
Mark McLaughlin: Well, we saw a great traction from the PA-5200 series and also the PA-220 and the 800 was also good too. So it was really kind of across the board. We saw really nice adoption.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Walter Pritchard with Citi.
Walter Pritchard: A question on your product revenue. You’ve had pretty dramatic difference in growth rates over the last couple of years and your billings are growing probably in line with the industry, your product revenue probably growing below the industry, although, as many pointed out off of tough comps. I’m wondering how you think about that going forward just roughly, you generated a lot of of subscription attached, you have the unattached of subscription. And I’m wondering if we will continue to see a total business grow as long as excessive product, or if you think those will converge as things start to normalize here?
Mark McLaughlin: Hey, Walter, we have few thoughts around that. One is, like I said earlier, that we’re happy to see if we got a product revenue from third quarter perspective, the general matter, we think – yes, we plan to do better along these lines. When we think about the industry, it doesn’t look as though, people really breakout product or what hardware specific in the industry. One of the things that we look at is just how much money gets spent by everybody to report on the hardware side and we continue to take more than our fair share on that from a product perspective. We also know, of course, those relationships in the products of the hardware and the attach services as well. So as we work to improve the product revenue growth over time, and that would have some impact on the attach subscription service and we’re doing very well on the non-attach as well from a growth perspective that small part of the business are growing very quickly. So we’d expect that to do better for time as well. There’s a lot of things into the mix around that, which all comes out in the wash on. Billings growth and total revenue growth over time which is what we’re very focused on as part of the total platform.
Walter Pritchard: And any comment on attach revenue this quarter, just any run rate, or anything to help us understand sort of traction collectively in that part of the subscription business?
Mark McLaughlin: Sure. Yes, we talked about the attach business on a semi-annual basis, but we can – we said last quarter was about 2.6, it’s outside and it went up.
Steffan Tomlinson: And then on the unattached business, it was very good. We had – we referenced in our prepared remarks the number of new customers. So that’s an indication as well of the traction that we’re getting.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, our final question today comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.
Keith Weiss: Thank you, guys, for sneaking me in. One of the things that I want to kind of drilldown into is or better understand. Is there dynamic on, are you able to like keep adding customers. So you had a really good, like a new customer add quarter just like, I would tell you, going through a sales reorg. And so one might, how does that dynamic sustain like? How do you guys sustain new customer adds so well, while you’re going through the sales reorg? And then on the flip side of the equation, while new customer adds look to be up pretty nicely on a year-on-year basis, product revenue was basically like flat on a year-on-year basis. Should we take away that sort of where the weakness reside just more in terms of sort of expanding existing customers, more so than getting new customers in the door?
Mark McLaughlin: That’s a great question, Keith. Well, a couple of thoughts in that. The first was, I think there’s a reverse, as we said last quarter, when you look at our business, it’s going to come from new customer acquisition and expansion of existing customers, about two-thirds of our business today is driven by expansion opportunities with customers we already acquired. So, of course, we want to continue to have higher rate of customer acquisition, I’ll come back to that thought in just a second. We’re very happy to see higher rates of customer acquisition. Then the trick is to expand the business side of this. Where we had some issues, we’re working through them with the reorg stuff was looking at the lifetime value expansion when you look at the segments in the market. So when we look at the highest end segment of the market, which is part of the Global 2000 and biggest customers, wallet share lifetime value expansion has done very nicely there and continues to be very nicely there, despite some of the issues that we’ve talked about before is really about getting the lifetime value expansion, where we wanted to be and where it had historically below that segment of the market. That’s where a lot of the reorg and alignment issues were and that’s what we’re really focused on that. We’re focused on fixing. And just from a new customer acquisition perspective, we’re getting new customers not only from our direct team as well, we’re also getting customer acquisition through the channel, or channel strongly grown over time. So we’re going to continue to get more customers from them. If I love the fact that we just had our second highest customer acquisition in the quarter history, I think we could do better, right? We get – the better we get from a got-to-market perspective, we should be able to continue acquire even more customers than that and we look forward to being able to do that.
Keith Weiss: Got it. And if I can sneak in follow-up. So while 1% product revenue growth was better than what we had anticipated. It’s still under growing the marketplace. But I’m assuming as both dynamics around sort of the new customer acquisition being able to like continue to get the customers to the door that give you guys the confidence that you’re not kind of losing share, if you will, that that opportunity remains just more of like untapped within these existing customers versus kind of net losing opportunity?
Steffan Tomlinson: Hi, Keith. Yes, just on the year-over-year growth rate, we’re clearly coming off of – was it very high tough comparable product revenue last year 33% year-over-year. If you look at the dollar amount of product revenue that gets done in a particular quarter, as Mark mentioned earlier, we’re taking more than our fair share and there are some vendors that don’t even give out product revenue, and so like we’re shadow boxing with them a little bit. But we’re doing very well in the market. And the new products that we have that we’ve just introduced, the revenue customer acquisition,we feel like, there are crosscurrents that we’ve talked about around sales reorganization. But we’re laser focused on increasing the growth prospects of the company.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, and that, of course, includes product revenue as well, so.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. Mr. McLaughlin, I’d like to turn the call back over to you for any closing remarks.
Mark McLaughlin: Thanks, operator, appreciate it. Before I close, I want to thank the Palo Alto Networks team for their dedication and our customers and partners for the opportunity to work with them. We hope to see everyone at Ignite in just a couple of weeks. Thanks for being on the call today. Bye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s conference. We appreciate your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Palo Alto Networks Fiscal Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Kelsey Turcotte, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Kelsey Turcotte - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Palo Alto Networks fiscal second quarter 2017 financial results. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed on the Investors section of our website at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. With me on today's call are Mark McLaughlin, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Steffan Tomlinson, our Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our results for the fiscal second quarter ended January 31, 2017. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online on our website. We would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements including statements regarding our financial outlook for the third quarter and full-year fiscal 2017, our competitive position and the demand and market opportunity for our products and subscriptions, our ability to drive outsized growth rates, trends in certain financial results and operating metrics, our initiatives, plans and investments regarding our sales productivity, success and timing of integration of our newly acquired products and innovations in our product, subscription and support offerings. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future and we undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. For a more detailed description of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, filed with the SEC on November 22, 2016, and our earnings release posted a few minutes ago on our website and on the SEC's website. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. For historical periods, we have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in the supplemental financial information that can be found in the Investors section of our website located at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. We'd also like to inform you that we will be presenting at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference on Thursday, March 2; and the Raymond James & Associates 38th Annual Institutional Investors Conference on Tuesday, March 7. And finally, once we have completed our formal remarks, we will be posting them to our Investor Relations website under Quarterly Results. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Thank you Kelsey, and thank you everyone for joining us today on the call to discuss our fiscal second quarter results. In the second quarter, revenue grew 26% year over year to $423 million and billings grew 22% year over year to $562 million. We generated free cash flow of $170 million, up 24% year over year, and reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.63, up 47% year over year. There are a lot of very positive things to discuss from the second quarter, which I will do later in my remarks, but I wanted to start off by noting that we are disappointed in our Q2 revenue results and guidance for the balance of the year. Upfront, I want to discuss what is happening, what we are doing about it, and then Steffan will discuss the impact to us for the second half of our fiscal year. As far as what is happening, we believe that our weaker performance is primarily caused by go-to-market execution issues that are becoming more evident as we progress through the year. The impact from these issues is lower productivity than we planned for in the year with a broader base of slower pipeline conversion than what we started to experience in the first quarter. Why would this be? For several years now, we have been running a playbook that has resulted in high growth rates. The basic components of that playbook are that each year we split territories, continually segment the market both vertically and by customer size, and forward invest in sales and marketing resources. These actions are, of course, designed to drive productivity. We have had very good results with this playbook for some time and continued with it in our fiscal 2017 planning. We were not seeing the expected return on investment. In drilling into why, our initial analysis is that we over complicated our go-to-market motion with a lot more territory splits and segmentation than we have done in the past. This appears to have been too much too fast as we changed the coverage model for many customer relationships resulting in lower productivity and less accuracy in forecasting. So, what are we doing about it? We are working diligently and quickly to identify the actions to adapt at the midpoint of the year and are focused on the following things right now. First, we are reorganizing our account coverage model to drive more accountability and clarity. Second, we are re-calibrating investments in our sales and marketing resources to better support this revised coverage model. And third, we are updating our second half plan to better reflect our mid-year forecast assuming near-term disruption as we make the moves necessary to get back to the productivity levels we expect of our investments. While we continue to grow very quickly, I have stated many times both in the company and externally that quality execution at rapid scale is very important for the success of the company. We are accountable for the issues and we believe we can fix them. Because we want to ensure that we do that in a thoughtful fashion, and so that we can answer all the questions I am sure you will have as we progress through that work, we are going to postpone our Investor Day currently scheduled for March 16 until September 27, 2017. This will allow us to be as thorough and definitive as possible when we gather in New York. Despite these execution issues, we continue to capture market share at high rates. In Q2, we added approximately 2,000 new customers and are now privileged to be serving more than 37,500 customers worldwide. Customer wins and competitive displacements in the quarter included: a Cisco and McAfee replacement to standardize all security at a large multinational business services company that included all attached and non-attached subscriptions, including a significant Traps investment; a competitive win against Cisco to secure the datacenter and perimeter at one of the world's largest physical security companies that included all attached subscriptions; a Cisco replacement and competitive win against Check Point for a datacenter project at a major North American healthcare provider that included a significant investment in both hardware and subscriptions; a Check Point replacement to secure the retail network at a large North American retailer, including our VM-Series and AutoFocus; and a competitive win against Cisco and Check Point to secure the private cloud of a bank based in Europe. Adoption across our platform also continues to drive lifetime value growth. All of our top 25 lifetime customers again made purchases in the second quarter and to make this list, a customer had to have spent a minimum of $16.6 million in lifetime value, a 46% increase over the $11.4 million in Q2 of fiscal 2016. Customers are choosing Palo Alto Networks because our platform provides high degrees of automation, ever increasing leverage from our large and growing ecosystem of customers, consistency of security regardless of where data resides from network to endpoints and the cloud, and the power that comes from the increasing analytic capabilities we are applying to the petabytes of data we now process. These are the hallmarks of a true platform and customers are seeing the results in better security, less complexity, and a better total cost of ownership. And, in looking at the offerings in the platform, we continued to see momentum across the balance of our attached subscriptions, including WildFire where we added approximately 1,300 new customers, bringing our total WildFire customer account base to approximately 15,500. Our non-attached services, which include Traps, VM-Series, Aperture and AutoFocus, are also growing very well and in the second quarter were on a combined annualized run rate of over $100 million in sales, growing greater than 100% year over year. Traps, our advanced endpoint protection, provides customers with prevention capabilities at endpoints, seamless understanding of threats across the network at endpoints, and the leverage inherent in our very large and growing customer ecosystem across their entire environment. In the second quarter, we grew the Traps customer base more than 35% sequentially to 875 customers and saw significant increases in deal sizes. A recent survey of our Traps customer base indicated that over 70% of those surveyed chose to replace legacy antivirus with Traps due to its superior protection from malware and exploits combined with the integration with our Next-Generation Security Platform. Our VM-Series cloud security offerings are growing very quickly as well due to our unique ability to provide superior and consistent security across all cloud and on-premise environments, and deep integration with cloud automation and orchestration. This is evident with the success of our VM-Series where we now have well over 2,500 customers with increasing deal sizes. To continue accelerating success in cloud security, we now have all technical sales engineers trained on cloud with a growing number of cloud specialists dedicated to these opportunities. And with our expanded lineup of VM-Series offerings and continued deep integration with leading private and public cloud platform providers, we are well positioned in cloud security. For Aperture, our SaaS security offering, we increased our customer count sequentially by over 40% and are quickly expanding the number of applications we can protect. The latest Aperture release now supports complete automation for data leakage and threat risk remediation, with the ability to instantly quarantine malware and remove sensitive data sharing in violation of policy to protect the network and enforce compliance on SaaS applications. And, on the machine learning front, we continue to make good progress with AutoFocus, with over 150 customers, including some of the world's largest organizations. AutoFocus was our first subscription developed to leverage the massive amount of data we are now ingesting and take advantage of our analytics and machine learning capabilities to make high quality, predictive and proactive security decisions that can be automatically enforced across our entire Next-Generation Security Platform. Along those lines, we are very pleased to be announcing today the acquisition of LightCyber, the leading company in the behavior analytics space. We have spent quite some time evaluating the players in this fast-growing space and are very impressed with the capabilities and team at LightCyber. The LightCyber offering will continue to be sold as it is for now and will be integrated into the platform and offered as a subscription service by the end of this calendar year. And we are accelerating the platform advantage. We are very excited about the new product launch we held on February 7 where we had more than 20,000 participants attend both live and through our webcast. At the event, we introduced PAN-OS 8.0, our newest operating system with more than 70 new features and many new products and unique capabilities, including: six new hardware appliances designed to enable customers to deploy next-generation security from large data centers to small branches, all managed centrally by a new and faster version of Panorama. These appliances provide faster performance for deep visibility into and control over all traffic, including encrypted traffic, which is becoming an increasingly strategic need for effective security. Three new VM-Series models to add to the existing four we currently offer, creating the broadest range of cloud security offerings in the market. This enables a wider range of deployment types and even greater integration with Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and VMware NSX to deliver scale, redundancy, and automation that allows customers to easily build cloud-centric architectures. The industry's first multi-method, scalable and automated approach designed to prevent credential-based theft and abuse by attackers. Credential theft has become an increasingly popular tool for attackers as it often allows them to bypass a number of other difficult steps in the attack lifecycle. Our new capabilities include the unique ability to prevent sending password-based corporate credentials to unauthorized sites and an innovative approach to policy-based multi-factor authentication enforced at the network level to prevent the re-use of stolen credentials. And several new threat prevention capabilities, including automatic command and control signature generation; a new custom, built from the ground up advanced hypervisor and bare metal analysis capabilities in WildFire; and MineMeld integration with AutoFocus allowing for third-party feeds to be easily correlated with our data for deeper analysis and automated protection using groundbreaking machine learning. In summary, we continue to see positive reaction to our approach in our platform and strong market traction. And we believe in our ability to address the execution issues I noted earlier, allowing us to continue to drive outsized market share gains. With that, I will turn the call over to Steffan.
Steffan C. Tomlinson - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Mark. Before I start, I'd like to note that except for revenue and billings figures, all financial figures are non-GAAP and growth rates are compared to the prior-year periods unless stated otherwise. Let me start by saying we are disappointed that we fell below our revenue guidance range for Q2. In the quarter, we reported revenue of $422.6 million, an increase of 26%. Looking at the geographic mix of revenue, the Americas grew 28% and accounted for 69% share, EMEA grew 27% and accounted for 19% share, and APAC grew 14% and accounted for 12% share. Product revenue of $168.8 million was essentially flat compared to the prior year. We anticipated that Q2 product growth would be weak due to a difficult year-over-year comparable, but product revenue fell below our expectations due to the execution issues Mark discussed as well as some customers more than we anticipated delaying purchasing decisions based on the significant product release in early February. Subscription and support revenue is now on an annual run-rate north of a $1 billion and continues to grow at very high rates. Q2 SaaS-based subscription revenue of $134.3 million increased 59%. Attach rates grew to 2.6 subscriptions per device shipped, up from 2.3 in the prior year period. And subscription renewal rates are greater than 90%. Support revenue of $119.5 million, increased 48% and we enjoy approximately 100% renewal rates on support. In total, subscription and support revenue of $253.8 million, increased 54% and accounted for a 60% share of total revenue. Turning to billings, Q2 billings of $561.6 million, increased 22%. The dollar weighted contract duration for new subscriptions and support billings in the quarter was 3 years compared to 2.7 years in the prior-year period as customers increasingly commit to our platform as their long-term security architecture. For the first half of fiscal 2017, billings of $1.1 billion increased 27% year-over-year. Product billings were $334.3 million, up 6% and accounted for 31% of total billings. Subscription billings were $395.9 million, up 41% and support billings were $348.3 million, up 39%. Subscription and support billings accounted for 69% of total billings in the first half of fiscal 2017 compared to 63% in the first half of fiscal 2016. In Q2, total deferred revenue of $1.5 billion, increased 61%. Moving on to margins. Q2 gross margin was 78.6%, an increase of 140 basis points compared to last year. The increase was driven by improvements in recurring subscription and support gross margins, offset by a product gross margin decline of 50 basis points year-over-year. Looking forward we expect there will be fluctuations in product gross margin, particularly with the recent introduction of our new products when we typically see a decline in product gross margin for a few quarters. Q2 operating expenses were $249 million, or 58.9% of revenue. Operating margin was 19.7% in Q2, representing 120 basis points of improvement year-over-year. Net income for the quarter grew 51% year-over-year to $59.6 million. Non-GAAP EPS grew 47% to $0.63 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis for the second quarter, net loss was $60.6 million or $0.67 per basic and diluted share. Turning to cash flows and balance sheet items, Q2 cash flow from operations of $214.3 million increased 39% year-over-year. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $44.7 million, including $31.1 million of CapEx related to our new headquarters. Free cash flow for Q2 was $169.6 million, up 24% at a margin of 40.1%. Excluding CapEx related to our new headquarters, free cash flow was $200.7 million, up 46% year-over-year at a margin of 47.5%. We finished January with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $2.1 billion. And I am pleased to announce that the board of directors has authorized a $500 million increase to our existing share repurchase program and extended the end date of the program to December 31, 2018. This brings the total amount authorized under the current program to $1 billion. During the second quarter, we purchased approximately 900,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $132 a share, leaving a balance of approximately $830 million available for ongoing repurchases. DSOs were 78 days, within the previously provided range of 70 days to 80 days. As we look toward the future, we remain committed to our long-term strategy to capture market share within our financial framework of growth and profitability. We are not satisfied with our productivity and know we have work ahead of us to maximize our potential. Turning to guidance and modeling points, this afternoon, we announced that we have acquired privately held LightCyber for $105 million in cash. LightCyber expands our Next-Generation Security Platform with its highly automated and accurate behavioral analytics technology. And while we will continue to offer the LightCyber products and to support existing customer implementations, we expect to make LightCyber available as a non-attached subscription by the end of the calendar year. For fiscal 2017, LightCyber's contribution to revenue will be immaterial and we expect to invest approximately $5 million per quarter in both Q3 and Q4, primarily in R&D and platform integration. For the third quarter of fiscal 2017, our guidance anticipates that there will be some disruption as we implement changes to our go-to-market playbook and as a result, sales productivity will remain below our originally planned productivity levels in the second half. We expect revenue to be in the range of $406 million to $416 million, an increase of 17% to 20%. Incorporating the approximately $0.04 earnings per share impact from LightCyber, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.56, an increase of 17% to 22% year-over-year. Excluding the LightCyber impact, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.58 to $0.60, an increase of 26% to 30%, using 93 million to 95 million shares. We expect Q3 product revenue to be in the range of $145 million to $148 million. Based on our current pipeline analysis, we anticipate billings growth to trail revenue growth in each of Q3 and Q4 by approximately 10 percentage points to 15 percentage points. Our current view for the full fiscal 2017 is an annual revenue growth of approximately 25% and essentially flat product revenue growth for the year. We anticipate annual non-GAAP operating margin to increase approximately 170 basis points to 180 basis points relative to fiscal year 2016 non-GAAP operating margin of 17.3%, as reported. Included in the 170-basis-point to 180-basis-point improvement is at least 100 basis points of organic operating margin expansion and 130 basis points to 140 basis points positive impact from the deferred commissions change, offset by approximately 60-basis-point headwind from LightCyber. We expect full-year non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.50, which includes a $0.07 impact from LightCyber, and a share count of 94 million to 96 million shares. And we expect CapEx and free cash flow margin to be the range of $160 million to $170 million and 35% to 40% respectively, which includes approximately $100 million related to our new headquarters of which we expect approximately $35 million to fall into Q3. Excluding CapEx from the new headquarters, free cash flow margin is expected to be at least 40%. Structurally, our hybrid-SaaS model combined with operational discipline continues to drive strong deferred revenue, revenue and free cash flow generation. With that, I will turn the call back over to Mark.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: We appreciate you being on the call today. In summary, while we are excited and confident about the future, we know we have work to do to improve our execution and operational discipline. We will navigate the near-term challenges while executing on our strategy of being the leading global enterprise security provider. And with that, we will open the call up for questions. Operator, please go ahead.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go to Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.
Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Mark, in your prepared remarks, you talk about reorg'ing your go-to-market model. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more specifically about changes you plan to make and how long should we expect some of these to start producing the desired results?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Sure, Matt. Thanks. Great question. So, we need to do three basic things here from a go-to-market perspective on the items I talked about. The first is we have to go back and do account mapping or remap the accounts from a coverage perspective because we have the account coverage blurred right now in a way that's not helping us. Second thing we're going to have to do is reallocate the resources to properly align with that account coverage. And then the third thing is to make sure we've got the right people with the right skills in the right seat. So, it's a pretty big effort we have to undertake here. We started it already. We expect to be working through that in the second half and hopefully we'll see the benefits of that as we come out of the back half of the year into fiscal 2018.
Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And that's great. I'm sure we'll hear more it as we move. And I guess maybe drilling down specifically on the sales and marketing line item, I'm just kind of curious what you think in terms of capacity adds here. I know productivity's lower than you expect here, but did you still expect to add capacity, maybe at a lower rate to sort of map to the billings growth, or just trying to get a sense for capacity adds.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Yeah, it's a good question, Matt. So, what we're very focused on is productivity at this point, right. So, we've brought a lot of people in in the tail half of fiscal 2016, twice as many as we've done before. So, we're going to continue to add some heads into this from a go-to-market perspective. We'll slow that rate down in the back half of the year, but we're primarily interested in increasing the productivity and the conversion in the pipeline. So that's our main effort.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James.
Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. It's Michael Turits. I'm trying to understand exactly how you think the sales strategy was wrong because it seems like it's made sense to the extent that you were increasing the breadth of the product portfolio and you were going through a very staged process of first adding vertical overlays and then getting rid of them and then integrating those new product sales capabilities into the existing sales force, which seems like a very deliberate process strategy for what you've been doing. So, what really was the disconnect? And how are you planning to do things differently?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Yeah, Michael. It's Mark. So, we have been running our playbook very successfully for quite some time, as I said, and we continue to run that in fiscal 2017. What we did incorrectly as we look back on this, and it's biting us now, is just the magnitude of what we did coming out of 2016 into 2017 in the rate of territory splits. And I'll give you some other examples as well. In the hopes of driving higher productivity on investments, we moved broad swaths of customer base into inside sales and resourced that accordingly. That turned out to not be the boost to productivity we thought so as an example, we had to bring big swaths of customer accounts from a mapping perspective back into territories, have the right people in the chairs in order to execute on those. So we know the playbook has worked for us in the past, and we think we realize what we've done incorrectly with that playbook and we're going to go fix it.
Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And I guess just to continue on the same bent, any change in the channel strategy relative to this?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: No. We like our channel a lot. Channel's been very good to us, and we've got great relationships with the channel so we're not going be changing that strategy.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with Bernstein.
Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Mark, what's giving you confidence and what's your level of confidence that like your disappointing productivity and disappointing sales performance is an issue that really comes from internal problems and that it is not also simply related to the fact that maybe your competitive environment has been evolving and you're facing competitors there who are like catching up and putting their game together? And then on the productivity front, so if you had like product sales this quarter that were about in line with where they were last year, you have like a significantly higher number of salespeople in the organization today. Could you give us a sense of how much bigger you are today in terms of sales organization compared to one year ago? And then if you could maybe give us a sense of how did the sales force basically waste this productivity? So where did their time go? Where did their efforts go? And then which led them to see lower productivity?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Yeah, sure, Pierre. Let me see if I can track all that. Let me start in with the first one. On the competitor front, we watch that very closely. We believe and have believed for some time that we have the best technical leadership in the market today. We vastly increased that with the new product launch we did on February 7, which is very well attended, and the addition of the LightCyber is an example into the family as well. The issues that we're dealing with we think are primarily execution oriented and that we can go address those things. We've seen continued progress in the market. We just did another quarter of 2,000 net new customers, increasing the lifetime value as well, Very, very high customer sat scores and Net Promoter Scores as well. So, the feedback from the market seems very positive. This is something it appears that we've done to ourself and something that we can fix. On the size of the sales force, to give you some example, we brought in more than twice as many folks into the sales organization as we progressed through fiscal 2016 than we did in 2015 and added some more in Q1 of 2017 as well. So the rate and pace was a lot higher, and in hindsight realizing that that is something that has created challenges for us and we're going to go fix that. And on your last question as far as what are people working? Everybody is working very hard and very diligently, but the amount of relationship changes that occurred, these various account coverage moves that we made is very high. So when you're moving the relationships around and trying to build on those relationships, it's hard. And at a minimum, we would see something like we're seeing now. We should have seen this earlier, but inaccuracies in forecasting about where things are in the pipeline, as people are getting closer and closer to that customer over time.
Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks, Mark.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Pierre.
Operator: We'll go to Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray.
Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.: All right. Thanks. I wanted to ask about a comment you made about the delayed purchase decisions that customers made with regard to the new products that you launched in the quarter. Given the performance improvements in the new products, you would think that it would compel those customers to move forward with Palo Alto, but your guidance suggests the opposite. So, I guess can you help us understand why the deals that were delayed due to the new product launch would not come through in the April quarter?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Hey, Andrew. It's a good question. It's possible they may. The new products have been received very well from customers' feedback. So far we've had a fantastic launch and they are really good. As Steffan mentioned, we did see some customers delaying purchases. We got to the end of the second quarter in January, we're always trying to walk a very fine line on bringing new products to market and when you do that. We certainly wouldn't want to bring to market at the end of the quarter, so we brought them out right in the beginning. You may have noticed we did a lot of advertising, not specifically about the products, but that something big was coming. So that's always hard to get that right towards the beginning of a launch. As far as folks coming into the third quarter, we expect the products to sell very well, and we think they're fantastic. Unfortunately, what we have is the execution issues are going to overweight any goodness in that for some time, and we have to work through those execution issues.
Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. And then given all the new products in virtual solutions you launched a few weeks ago, can you just give us your thoughts on the pending refresh cycle this year and how we should think about that with regard to your expectations for the remainder of the year?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Yes. As we've said in the past, we think we have a very significant refresh opportunity in front of us, and that, of course, hasn't changed. I think, the new products is going help on that. It's going to be up against the headwind of the execution stuff we just mentioned. But kind of putting that in perspective, so if you look at all the cohorts or classes of customers as far as from 2008 to 2012, it's about a little over 8,000 total. The 2013 class in and of itself is 6,000, and it grows from there. So I think we've got a lot of refresh opportunity in front of us. That hasn't changed. We're confident about that. But we got to work through these other issues to really get the benefit of that.
Operator: We'll now hear from Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo Securities.
Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks, guys. Just to build on that. Two questions I guess. On the refresh side, how do you think the changes to the go-to-market strategy may be effective, the timing of that refresh at all? Obviously it averages about call it five years, but things can slip. Did any of the changes impact call it existing customers in your thinking of sort of your cadence of refreshing those? And then also, one of the things you talked about in the past too was service provider wins. Wonder if you can just double click on that space a little bit? Sort of what's happened year-to-date? How you're thinking about the second half?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Yeah, sure, Phil. On the first question on the refresh. Well, having execution headwinds doesn't help at all of course. But we're very confident that people are going to – want to going to refresh on the new product line. The new product line is really good and it provides three or four different opportunities from a refresh perspective, and it's clearly designed to do it that way. But again, it's going to be up against this just getting our act together from a go-to-market perspective, and implementing the changes we need to implement. I'll let Mark Anderson answer the service provider question.
Mark Anderson - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Yeah, hey, Phil. As you know we started focusing on service provider about a year and a half ago, and it's going very well, especially given the new product map that we have for virtualized products going much smaller, and much bigger, is really going to help us quite substantially in our managed services business with those customers. So we feel very good about where we are, and the team is ramping very nicely.
Philip Winslow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. Thanks, guys.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Phil.
Operator: And Jayson Noland with Baird has our next question.
Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. Mark, I wanted to ask your thoughts on the industry backdrop coming out of RSA. Does it seem like how 2017 budgets are getting better year-on-year? And then clarity. There's a lot of new players in the industry. It seems crowded and combative at some points. Maybe if you could talk about budgeting? And then how people are going to spend their money? Thanks.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Yeah, sure. A very good question, Jayson. Lots and lots of vendors up there, and lots of people showed up at RSA which is I think a good thing in the sense of there needs to be a lot of innovation in the security industry. But I'll answer your question in two different ways. First from a backdrop perspective, it seems like securities still remains a priority and spending is good on security. So what we're facing here is things that we've created ourselves here, not so much a spending issue in security. I think on the second front, it's becoming more apparent and I can see it (33:31) at RSA about what the consumption model of all that innovation is going to look like over time. And what I mean by that is very clear that the age of the platform for security, we invented that in the first place and we're doing very well against that. And I think people are going to increasingly consume all that innovation through platforms. There's going to be less and less platform companies out there. And a lot of the smaller companies who are highly innovative will become parts of those platforms evidenced by the LightCyber acquisition this afternoon. Whether it's through acquisition or partnerships, I think more and more is going to happen over time.
Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI.
Ken Talanian - Evercore Group LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First off, just wondering, could you give us a sense if there are any changes that you've noticed in the go to market approaches by your competitors? And, really, I'm thinking about Cisco here, in particular.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: No, the competition has been fierce for a long time, Ken. And I think it will continue to be that way. People buy usually on three angles. Security, reduction in complexity and cost and different players in the market have gone after different levels there. Ours is kind of top-down, which is security, reduction in complexity, and at a very good cost. Other people approach from a different angle, but haven't noticed anything different from the competitive landscape in that regard.
Ken Talanian - Evercore Group LLC: Okay. And then also, based on your guidance for next quarter, it looks like product growth might actually decline both sequentially and year-over-year. So one, just curious if that's directionally correct? And then if you could give us a sense for what product growth will do in fiscal 2017 overall.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Yeah, sure, Ken. Yeah, we, of course, we anticipated and we said this before that we thought that Q2 would be the low point from a product growth perspective year-over-year. And unfortunately, we were inaccurate in that regard because of the things we're facing here. But we also believe those things are within our control and we can fix them and that we will be able to get back on track from a product growth perspective.
Ken Talanian - Evercore Group LLC: Okay.
Operator: Now we'll go to Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.
Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. Would you say that the execution issues were evident throughout the quarter? Or did they manifest later in the quarter? And the reason I'm asking just given the good results we saw out of off quarter companies like Barracuda and the December quarter earnings from everybody else, did this manifest late in the quarter?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Yeah, great question, Sterling. I think, we could actually back it up a little further from a Q1 perspective, and what we saw in Q1, which we talked to you guys about as well, which was the first two months being on track and then seeing some slowdown in month three, in our case is specific to some large deals. In hindsight, looking back on that and looking for a pattern in that, that's what we saw play out in Q2 as well. We had a good November, right on track. We had good December, right on track and then we saw a slowdown but on a much broader base in January. So that's what it looked like as far as the Q2 playing out from a linearity perspective.
Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And even though you said the sales execution changes would outweigh any pickup from stuff that was frozen waiting for the new products, is there a way to at least quantify how much business you felt rose and waited for the new appliances in PAN 8 launch?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Yeah, I don't think it was that much. I mean, if you look at – we're not happy that we came in under the guide, right, in Q2 on that, but we weren't that far away from it. So it's not that much and it's also very hard to tease through like what's related to the execution and then what people are saying specifically on product delays, so it's a little bit difficult to say.
Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. Thank you.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Sterling.
Operator: And Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company.
Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. Thank you. I had a question for Steffan. If I recall correctly at your last Analyst Day, you talked about Palo Alto being in high growth mode and put out expectations to continue to grow 30% or more for the foreseeable future. Obviously, you've guided to 25% growth for fiscal 2017 and the question really is did these results change your view looking forward of where Palo Alto sits on the growth and maturity curve?
Steffan C. Tomlinson - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Yeah, so we just came off a quarter where we posted 26% year-over-year growth and clearly we're not satisfied with that. We've identified execution issues that we're in the process of working through, and we have a high level of confidence they're within our control and we can fix them. We need to get through that work before we call the ball on future levels of growth. But I can tell you that we feel very confident in returning to growth. And we get these execution issues fixed and we'll be in a much better position going forward.
Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go to John DiFucci with Jefferies.
John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC: Thank you. From our calculations, anyway, new business growth was very modest for the second consecutive quarter. And I know you're talking a lot about your missed execution, but you're really not the only ones to have some challenging quarters over the last year or so. I mean even Check Point has had a couple of quarters – had some challenging periods before that. I guess, Mark, if there's anything else other than missed execution, what else might be happening out there that could be affecting your results?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: That's a great question, John. So I think – well, a couple things on this; one on the new business side. We have to acquire new customers; and we have to expand in our existing customer base as well. And so we always watch both of those, and the bulk of the business obviously as we get bigger will come from expansion. We just acquired 2,000 new customers in the quarter, so it seems like from a customer acquisition and win-rate perspective and the environment, it's been healthy. It continues to be healthy. And what we're seeing now is the slowdown from a conversion perspective on the expansion downstream, which makes sense to us as we look back onto the go-to-market motions we made about changing these relationships around. So existing relationships got changed around a lot within two, three different times in a short period of time is going create some anxiety from the customer account coverage perspective. And that's where we see the slowdown, and the conversion is down through the expansion business.
John DiFucci - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Okay. And then one area in particular that we've been hearing more about is just trying to protect east-west traffic which, as you know, it's not something that everybody does and it's not something everybody does broadly. But I think it's generally thought of, Palo Alto Networks actually does it very well compared to others. At the same time, it's an area where we do hear people questioning how much they're going to need to do that, especially if they start to move workloads to the cloud. Are you seeing anything around that today?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: We're actually seeing an increase in east-west traffic, interest and protection. And the reason, it's actually is related to the cloud as well because at the same time people are on a journey to the cloud, they're also doing lots of data center work to virtualize and optimize data centers. When they do that, they use a lot of virtualization inside those data center environments, which means that they're going to micro-segment all those environments inside of the data center, which is great. But then you have to also be able to protect the information, and it traverses east-west through those micro segments, not just north-south. So we're actually seeing a continually building use case for that or ever since we started off with that with VMware NSX, which has been pretty successful for us.
Operator: Our next question will come from Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs.
Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a little more on the assumptions that are going into guidance for the back half, if I could. Steffan, you mentioned that you are accounting for sales productivity being below the originally planned productivity levels, but how does that compare to the productivity levels you're seeing today? And similar question for the timing of deal cycles and how long you're assuming deal cycles take to close. Thank you.
Steffan C. Tomlinson - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Yeah, good question, Gabriela. When we're looking at sales productivity relative to our plan, we are looking at high single-digit delta between what the planned productivity was and what it's actually forecasted to be. And we're factoring that into our guidance for the second half, and we're purposefully being prudent and cautious around the guide because we understand that the execution issues will take a while to get through. We're actively working on those remediations right now and we factor that into the guide. And when you look at timing of sales cycle elongation, we've seen elongating sales cycles. We called that out in Q1. We saw an extension of that in Q2 but on a much broader base. So we're clearly not satisfied with the year-over-year growth that we're posting. And we feel like after we make the execution fixes, sales elongation should contract a little bit, and sales productivity should increase.
Operator: Thank you. And Walter Pritchard with Citi has our next question.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Mark, I guess, a question for you. I look at the metric on new customer adds, 2,000, looks pretty good. I'm wondering as we look at the results in the context of the new customer adds and the sales changes or the sales disruption, it would seem like the sales disruption might impact your ability to bring in new customers, and yet that metric was good. Could you give us some color on how you saw the impact here ripple across the existing customer base? The new customer base? Maybe there's a deal size issue that was a part of it as well? Just trying to round that all together.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Sure thing. Walter. So we just put up another 2,000 net acquisition quarter, which is good. We have to make some assumptions as we play out the second half of the year with the execution issues as to how that would impact things. We will see how that plays out. It's a little too early to call that right now. But as I was telling John a little earlier on his question as well, we have to get two things right. We have to get the net new customer acquisition right, and then even more importantly, we have to get the expansion right in the existing customer bases. And if you move the relationships around inside of there, it can create longer timeframes that you know what's happening from a deal perspective and accurately forecast when you are going to get the ball over the line. And I think that's the area where we broke things and we're going to go fix them.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And then just a follow-up for Steffan. On the duration, you talked about three years which it sounds like is an average. Did you open up a program or anything that drove – because if three years is the average, it sounds like there could be a substantial number of customers who are actually finding duration that's longer than three years. Was there something that was done programmatically either this year or in the quarter to drive that higher?
Steffan C. Tomlinson - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: There was nothing done programmatically to drive it higher. This is a dollar weighted calculation. mot a simple average or just number of customers. So we always see that customers – we've been seeing this trend over time. Customers are asking us to standardize for multi-year periods on our architecture. We view that as a positive indicator of our technology lead. And so there's nothing new from an incentive standpoint to encourage that behavior. It's more customer driven.
Operator: We'll go to Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. I've got two questions, both on the guidance. First, your guidance suggests the second half of fiscal 2017 should see about 20% growth. And maybe I'll throw this one to Mark. Do you think that's a realistic target for fiscal 2018? Do you think you can hit 20% growth next fiscal year? And then the second one is for Steffan. Steffan, you mentioned that – if I heard you correctly, the billings growth should be less than revenue growth by 10 to 15 percentage points in the back half. So if the back half revenue growth is 20 percentage points, you're suggesting that the billings growth should be 5% to 10%. And given that your subscription and maintenance billings are tracking close to 40%, it's almost hard to get the billings growth all the way down to 5% to 10%, and maybe I'm missing something you could help me with? Thank you.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Yeah, I'll take the first one, Karl. So we're not happy with the guidance we've put out there, we're working to fix that, of course. And we have a number of issues we got to go work on. We're going to progress through that through the back half of the year and expect that will get us back on track. We need to go sort that out, and we'll come back to you as fast as we can with much better answers on a long-term basis for fiscal 2018. We don't think that would be prudent right now to set that out there.
Steffan C. Tomlinson - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Yeah, and from a billings growth standpoint, and you look at how that translates to revenue, let me start by saying it all really begins with sales productivity. And with sales productivity tracking high single-digits below our plan, that translates into much lower billings growth. If you remember, if you look at the composition of our billings we get in the first half of 2017, about 69% was subscription support and renewal. When you look at revenue, we're effectively indicating that product revenue is going be flat for the full year fiscal 2017 versus 2016. We're still anticipating high levels of subscription and support growth from a revenue standpoint. But because sales productivity is tracking so far below where we had originally planned, and we're intentionally taking corrective steps to fix that problem, we're anticipating much lower billings growth during this transition period as we're trying to correct the problems. And after we correct the problems, we should see a return to much healthier billings growth than what we're seeing today and what we're forecasting for the balance of the fiscal year.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thank you both. That's helpful.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Karl.
Operator: We'll continue on to Catharine Trebnick with Dougherty.
Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC: Oh, hi. Thank you so much for taking my question. You had said that the product revenue growth was expected to be now flat year-over-year. Outside the execution issues you discussed, how much of that flat growth would be attributed to your VM-Series and the rapid adoption of migration of the cloud by your enterprise customers? And then the second piece of that, did I hear you correctly that you said the channel was okay? So am I to assume that your competing overlay sales teams perhaps caused some of the execution issues and inaccuracy in your reporting? Thank you.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Yeah, hey, Catharine. It's always good to hear from you. On the cloud side, I don't think the product growth for the second half has anything to do with the cloud. That's actually been a good opportunity for us. In a lot of ways, a lead generator. It's always when there is something new, whether it's virtualization or cloud, in this case for mobility, we've been able to exploit that opportunity is another reason to talk to Palo Alto Networks where somebody may not otherwise and start doing business with them in the first place and do more business over time and that's what we've been seeing. So we're not happy about the product guide for the second half of the year. We don't believe that's due to the cloud, I'm going let Mark Anderson take the channel question.
Mark Anderson - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Yeah, so let me just add on a little bit to what Mark said. Firstly, the overlay team, there's no confusion, Catharine, in what our overlay teams are doing. It's primarily technical sales overlaying our core sales teams to help them sell Traps, sell into the cloud environment, sell Aperture and AutoFocus. We're very happy with the way that's going. I think as far as the channel goes, the channel is a very good channel, as we said before. They're executing very well. We're onboarding new channel partners like AWS and Microsoft Azure. Our service provider channels continues to get better. All of this execution rests on me. It rests on the sales team, and definitely know what we're doing to fix it and we're going to be fixing it as we go on through the fiscal year.
Operator: We'll now hear from Jonathan Ho with William Blair.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Just wanted to understand with a little bit more granularity, were there any particular geographies or market segments that we should be on the watch for, where the sales execution challenges were more pronounced?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Hey, Jonathan. No, this is across the board. But it may be obvious but I'll state it anyway that with the Americas being such a large contributor to the business today, that's where we would see the most impact.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. And then just in terms of the account coverage shift, how long do you expect that to take to really re-establish the results? And do you see the potential to sort of get back to growth once these issues have been corrected?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: So from a timing perspective, we're underway with the activities that I talked about a little earlier. We'll be prosecuting those through the back half of the year. And we would hope to have them all finished by the back half of the year and we'd be able to come out of the year and into fiscal 2018 in a better position than we are. I was saying a little earlier, we've got a lot of stuff to sort out here. We know we can do better than we are today and what we're guiding. But it would be too early for us and really not prudent to try to call out what it may be into next year.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Thanks, Jon.
Operator: And we'll go to Fatima Boolani with UBS.
Fatima Aslam Boolani - UBS Securities LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Question for you, Mark, just with respect to the new product lineup. It was obviously one of the bigger launches you've had in the last several years and you did talk about some purchasing positives with respect to the customer base. I'm wondering if you can help us drill down on how you are managing the forecasts for any potential trade-down effects? Or just generally how you were thinking about that?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Sure. That's a very good question. So, whenever we introduce new hardware, we're expecting movement from existing hardware products to new ones. So in all these cases some customers are going to move up. Some will move across. Some are going to move down. It's just inevitable that it's going to occur so we have to try to take all that into account when we're forecasting. So with the introduction of the PA-220, the 800 and the 5200 series as the main things we just brought to market. We expect we're going to see a lot of movement with the new hardware platforms and we're going to see two incremental opportunities. One is going to be the refresh as we were talking about a little earlier, and they also give us a chance to just get new competitive wins with these hardware capabilities. And just, I think something we also have to think about we have here is that when you are thinking through trade down the impacts, you want to make sure that's minimal. So it's our job to make sure we're offering customers a really compelling reason to want a higher capacity and performance for us. We see our very high attach rates and use of subscriptions. We're seeing increasingly growing need for SSL decryptions, so customers are looking for a lot more powerful systems like the ones that we just introduced. So that's art and science there. We hopefully get both of them right.
Fatima Aslam Boolani - UBS Securities LLC: And a quick follow up, if I may. You still demonstrated a fair bit of confidence around the installed base to refresh dynamics. Could you parse out qualitatively for us to what extent that confidence is tied to the base doing sort of upsizing on the hardware refresh versus incremental subscription attach rates? And this just in the context of the 2.6 percentage point attach rate, which didn't really change much versus the past six months.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Sure. So they're related very much, so we have – the attach rates have been up year-over-year from 2.3 percentage point to 2.6 percentage point. And of course, they're attaching the hardware device itself. So when we think about refresh opportunities, we're giving customers a lot to progress towards from a refresh perspective. And we're also hoping that as happened in the past, that people would attach subscriptions at very high rates when they do that. And then we also have a great opportunity just to win new business as well with the new hardware along with the growing capabilities with platform as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays.
Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in here. Hey, first, Mark, maybe just for you, obviously, you talked about execution challenges a bunch kind of impacting pipeline close rates. But can you just qualitatively talk about overall pipeline growth in the second quarter?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Yeah, that's a really good question, Saket. So from a pipeline perspective, we have done in the past, we're continuing to do a very nice job in demand generation. So we have a very good pipeline in terms of the size of the pipeline. We think the quality of the pipeline is very good as well. What we're seeing though is the conversion of the pipeline, so it's not really a demand generation issue; it's really just making sure that we get it converted in the timeframe it's going to get converted. But the pipeline's good.
Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And then for my follow up, it sounds like maybe one of the execution challenges besides increasing segmentation was maybe moving some accounts to inside sales which might have created some noise. I'm sure that there were a multitude of things with as complex of a sales organizations you have, but would you say that that was maybe one tangible item that contributed to some of the challenges this quarter?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Yeah, there are multiple things there, I can't remember who asked that question before, but as an example of something that we've always done in the running of this playbook was increasingly segment the market; in this case, in trying to drive increasingly higher levels of productivity and better return on investment, we've moved a broad swath of customers into the inside sales organization and resourced that accordingly, the folks who used to be in what we call (56:40). So just think of it simply along those ways. And that's really not working out, so as just one example of things we need to do is we need to map those accounts back from where they were back into those territories. Make sure we got the right people focused on them and make sure we realign the resources appropriately.
Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Very helpful. Thanks, guys.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Thank you, Saket.
Operator: Thank you. And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Mark McLaughlin for any additional or closing remarks.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Palo Alto Networks, Inc.: Great. Thanks, operator. I appreciate that. Before I close, I'd like to thank the Palo Alto Networks team for their dedication and our customers and partners for the opportunity to work with them. And I'd really like to welcome the LightCyber team to the company. And we take the responsibility of helping the world's largest organizations solve their most critical security challenges very seriously and we appreciate your support. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And, ladies and gentlemen, again, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all again for your participation.

Operator: Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Palo Alto Networks' Fiscal First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Kelsey Turcotte, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead Ma'am.
Kelsey Turcotte: Great. Good afternoon and thank you everyone for joining us on today’s conference call to discuss Palo Alto Networks fiscal first quarter 2017 financial results. This call is being broadcast live over the Web and can be accessed on the Investors section of our website at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. With me on today’s call are Mark McLaughlin, our chairman and chief executive officer, and Steffan Tomlinson, our chief financial officer. This afternoon we issued a press release announcing our results for the fiscal first quarter ended October 31, 2016. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it on-line on our website. We would like to remind you that, during the course of this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our financial outlook for the second quarter and full-year fiscal 2017, our competitive position and the demand and market opportunity for our products and subscriptions, our growth rates and trends in certain financial results and operating metrics, sales productivity, sales cycles, seasonality, and innovations in our product, subscription and support offerings. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. For a more detailed description of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on September 8, 2016 and our earnings release posted a few minutes ago on our website and on the SEC’s website. Also please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. For historical periods, we have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in the supplemental financial information that can be found in the Investors section of our website located at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. For planning purposes we expect our fiscal second quarter 2017 earnings conference call to be held after the market closes on Tuesday, February 28th. We would also like to inform you that we will be presenting at the Credit Suisse 20th Annual Technology Conference on Thursday, December 1st, the Barclays Global Technology, Media and Telecommunications Conference on Wednesday, December 7th and the 19th Annual Needham Growth Conference on Tuesday, January 10th.

In addition, the Supplemental Financial Information posted this afternoon to the Quarterly Results section of our Investor Relations website provides recast tables reflecting the change in accounting for sales commissions. And, finally, once we have completed our formal remarks we will be posting them to our investor relations website under Quarterly Results. And, with that, I will turn the call over to Mark.
Mark McLaughlin: Thank you, Kelsey. And thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon to report our fiscal Q1 results. In the first quarter, our results significantly outpaced the growth of the market and the competition. Revenue for the quarter grew 34% year-over-year to $398 million, while billings grew 33% year-over-year to $517 million. We generated free cash flow of $182 million, up 43% year-over-year, and reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.55, up 62% year-over-year. Security remains a strategic priority for global enterprises and organizations and we continue to capture mindshare and market share at very high rates. In the quarter, we saw strong demand for our next-generation security platform from both new and existing customers who are also increasingly deploying our eight subscription offerings. We added well over 1,500 new customers and are now privileged to be serving more than 35,500 customers worldwide. New customer wins and competitive displacements in the quarter included: A Check Point replacement in the data center at one of the world’s busiest airports. A competitive win against Check Point and Cisco at an EMEA based investment management and services organization which made a seven figure investment in our next-generation security platform. A large cloud deal with a global systems integrator where we replaced Cisco, Fortinet, and FireEye with a significant investment in both our hardware and subscriptions, including AutoFocus which served as a strategic competitive differentiator. A McAfee replacement on more than 10,000 endpoints in a government agency in EMEA. And a Fortune 500 manufacturing company where we beat and replaced Cisco for data center segmentation. On the expand side of our business, adoption across our platform continues to drive lifetime value growth across the board. All of our top 25 lifetime value customers again made purchases in the first quarter and to make this list a customer had to have spent a minimum of $15.2 million in lifetime value, a 50% increase over the $10.1 million in Q1 of fiscal 2016. Customers are choosing Palo Alto Networks because our platform provides high degrees of automation, ever increasing leverage from our large and growing ecosystem of customers, consistency of security regardless of where data resides from network to endpoints and the cloud, and the power that comes from the increasing analytic capabilities we are applying to the petabytes of data we now process. These are the hallmarks of a true platform and customers are seeing the results in better security, less complexity, and better total cost of ownership. Our native platform approach has put us at the forefront of technology evolutions over the last decade and continues to do so with important macro trends like cloud, analytics and machine learning, and IoT. For cloud computing - private, hybrid or public - we are uniquely able to help customers achieve the same consistency of security in the cloud as they can achieve in their on-premise environments which is removing a major inhibitor for large enterprises to move to the cloud. This is increasingly evident with the success of our VM-Series where we now have well over 2,000 customers. Half of our new VM-Series customers in the quarter were first time customers to Palo Alto Networks with the VM capability being their first experience working with us. In addition to the private and public cloud, the need to protect SaaS applications delivered from the cloud also continues to grow in importance and we saw strong sequential growth in customer count for Aperture. And, on the machine learning and analytics front, AutoFocus grew very well in the quarter. This is our first offering that provides high degrees of relevance and correlation across our large data set. Customer feedback on this offering has been very good and we are now seeing service providers create revenue streams around this capability to provide their MSS customers with highly relevant and actionable threat intelligence. We also continue to see the increasing importance of visibility and enforcement capabilities at both the network and endpoint, especially with the growing focus on IoT. Traps, our advanced endpoint protection, provide customers prevention capabilities on endpoints, seamless understanding of threats across the network and endpoints, and the leverage inherent in our very large and growing customer ecosystem across their entire environment. Standalone endpoint products cannot compare on these three important differentiators. This quarter Traps received independent verification that it can help customers meet specific PCI DSS and HIPAA security compliance requirements, allowing financial and healthcare organizations to replace legacy AV on client PCs. We now have well over 600 Traps customers, are seeing the Traps pipeline and deal sizes increase, and are currently protecting more than one million endpoints and servers. And we continue to see momentum across the balance of our subscription offerings, including Wildfire where we added more than 1,000 new customers, bringing our total customer base to over 14,000. While continued adoption of the platform was borne out in Q1 across many metrics including new customer acquisition, increasing life time value, and growing penetration rates of our new subscription offerings, our Q1 results were not as robust as we expected. We are seeing purchasing decisions have to go through additional approvals, particularly in larger companies on the increasingly larger opportunities we are winning. As a result, we saw some deals push. Our win rates remain as high as ever, a good number of the pushed deals have closed, and we are benefiting long-term as the security provider of choice. In the short-term, we have taken the longer sales cycle into account in our guide. It is clear that security is a priority and will remain so for companies, governments and organizations across the globe for a very long time. We are highly technically differentiated and our competitive position continues to grow rapidly. Heading into calendar year-end the team is focused on helping our customers solve their toughest security challenges in an increasingly complex environment with the market’s leading next-generation security platform. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Steffan and look forward to taking your questions.
Steffan Tomlinson: Thank you, Mark. Before I start, I’d like to note that except for revenue and billings figures, all financial figures are non-GAAP unless stated otherwise. In Q1, we continued to execute our financial strategy of growing both the top line and expanding profitability. Our hybrid-SaaS model continues to pay off as we posted record deferred revenue, significant year over year margin expansion and non-GAAP EPS growth, and record free cash flow. Turning to the numbers. We reported Q1 revenue of $398.1 million, an increase of 34% year-over-year. Looking at the geographic mix of revenue for Q1, the Americas grew 33% and accounted for 70% share, EMEA grew 32% and accounted for 18% share and APAC grew 47% and accounted for 12% share. Q1 product revenue of $163.8 million increased 11% year-over-year and growth was healthy across our product portfolio. To better describe the value we are delivering and to improve clarity, we have renamed the services revenue line on our income statement to subscription and support revenue. In the quarter subscription and support revenue of $234.3 million increased 57% over the prior year and accounted for a 59% share of total revenue. SaaS-based subscription revenue of $121.2 million increased 65%, while support revenue of $113.1 million increased 49%. Q1 billings were $516.9 million, up 33% year-over-year. Total deferred revenue was $1.4 billion, an increase of 69% year-over-year. Short-term deferred revenue of $758.1 million increased 59% year-over-year and accounted for 56% share of total deferred revenue. Long-term deferred revenue of $601.5 million increased 84% year-over-year and accounted for a 44% share of total deferred revenue. The growth in deferred revenue is driven by customers adopting our subscription and support offerings and renewing them at very high rates. With the top line details covered, I will now turn to margins. Our Q1 gross margin was 79.4%, an increase of 150 basis points compared to last year. The increase was driven by improvements in both product and recurring subscription and support gross margins. Turning to expenses, please note that starting in Q1 fiscal 2017 we moved from our historical approach of expensing all commissions during the period in which the related revenue contract was booked, to an accounting policy where commissions are initially deferred and subsequently amortized over the term of the contract. With our business evolving to more of a recurring revenue model, this method provides a much better match between revenue and expenses on the income statement. Q1 fiscal 2017 operating expenses were $244.4 million, or 61.4% of revenue. Operating margin was 18% in Q1 representing a 170 basis points increase year over year. Net income for the quarter was $51.2 million compared, with net income of $30.8 million in the same period last year. Using 93.2 million shares, non-GAAP EPS in Q1 was $0.55 per diluted share and grew 62% year -over-year, compared with non-GAAP EPS of $0.34 per diluted share in Q1, 2016. On a GAAP basis for the first quarter, net loss was $61.8 million, or $0.69 per basic and diluted share. This compares with a Q1, 2016 GAAP net loss of $39.9 million, or $0.47 per basic and diluted share. Turning to cash flows and balance sheet items. On a year-over-year basis, Q1 cash flow from operations was $203.3 million, up 39%; free cash flow was $182.4 million, up 43%; and free cash flow margin was 45.8%. Capital expenditures in the quarter, including investments in our new corporate headquarters, totaled $20.9 million. We finished October with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $2.1 billion. During the first quarter, we purchased approximately 340,000 shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $146, leaving a balance of approximately $450 million available for ongoing repurchases through August 31 of 2018. DSOs were 79 days, within the range we provided during our Q4 call in late August. Turning to guidance. For the second quarter of fiscal 2017: We expect revenue to be in the range of $426 million to $432 million, which represents 27% to 29% growth year-over-year and implies a first half fiscal 2017 growth rate of 30% to 31%. And we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.61 to $0.63 per share using 93.5 to 95.5 million shares. Before I conclude I’d like to provide modeling points for the full-year fiscal 2017. We expect revenue growth will be in the range of 30% to 31%. We continue to expect full-year product revenue growth of 12% to 13%. And we expect sequential growth from fiscal Q1 through the remainder of the year, with the lowest year-over-year growth in Q2 and the highest year-over-year growth in Q4. The non-GAAP tax rate is 31%. And we continue to expect full-year non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.80 per share using 94 to 96 million shares. These non-GAAP earnings per share guidance range includes at least 100 basis points of organic non-GAAP operating margin improvement and roughly 150 to 200 basis points from the deferred commissions change. We expect CapEx and free cash flow margin to be in the range of $160 to $170 million and 35% to 40%, respectively which includes approximately $100 million related to our new headquarters. CapEx will be more heavily weighted toward Q2 and Q3, with approximately 60% of total CapEx falling in these two quarters. Excluding CapEx for the new headquarters building, free cash flow margin is expected to be at least 40%. With that I will turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] This time I will take the first question from Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. 
Ken Talanian: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to get a sense for the contribution from unattached subscription to subscription billing and how we should think about that going forward? 
Steffan Tomlinson : The contribution from unattached subscription billings was healthy on year-over-year basis. We still have a predominant amount of billing from attached subscriptions but the percentage growth rate for unattached subscriptions tends to outpace the attached at this point just given the relative sizes. 
Ken Talanian: Would you say it is doubling year-over-year like triple digit growth something in that range? 
Steffan Tomlinson: For our unattached subscriptions, they are growing triple digits. 
Operator: Move now to Weiss from Morgan Stanley.
Keith Weiss: Thank you guys for taking the question. And looking at Q1 and it not being as robust as expected, can you help us understand what gives you guys the comfort that it's not competitive or it's not market saturation that it’s just really extended deal cycles? And in sort of how that confidence extends to the full year guidance which is now looking for acceleration into the back half of the year particularly on that product revenue side? 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, sure. It's Mark. Yes, I am pretty sure it's not competition related, right, when you get to see that playing through from a data perspective, when we look at the quarter we just posted with 34% revenue growth and look at the major competitors, we are 3x higher than Cisco in growth, 5x higher than Check Point in growth right. So those win rates are very high, they have been consistently very high and we expect them to continue to remain that way into the future. So it doesn't look to be anything competitive there. Importantly, we are always look at the technical stuff as well competitively and we don't see anything that competition has done differently. I think the kind of rates of growth and the compares really prove that out.  From a second half perspective, we said earlier that we expect the second half to be stronger than the first half. We still expect that to be the case. We know that this second half comps are better in the first half, that the increasing cohort opportunity and bigger cohorts to refresh and the innovation engine to fuel that. We are also continuing to see pickup from the service provider which had a very good first quarter beating the numbers which we like a lot. 
Keith Weiss: Got it. And then Q1 is always a time when -- if there is going to be any changes in go to market strategy, there is - anything unusual this year about sort of the go to market strategy or any changes that you guys put into place that might have impacted getting those deal signed on time in the quarter? 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, we've been growing at very high rates as you know over time so we’ve prided ourselves in trying to make sure that we are putting all the people processes and system changes in place to scale with that growth, that advance so we make changes every year from a go to market perspective just in order to keep up with that kind of growth. We didn't do anything different this year. 
Operator: I now move to Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.
Sterling Auty: Yes, thanks. Trying to put in the context kind of reiterating the full year EPS but kind of tougher start on revenue especially product revenue. What are you baking in in terms of the improvement in the environment? Do you hit that acceleration in the back half of the year versus how you are changing your construct in terms of the growth versus margin expansion? 
Mark McLaughlin: I'll take the first part of that, Sterling. So from a change perspective I mean change what we are thinking before which we expected the second half to be stronger than the first half. So that's still obviously is the case given the guidance, that were given today for the reasons that I just gave to Keith so from an environment perspective looks like from a mixed environment out there, if you look at all the security companies and peers recording, that hasn't changed a lot in the last couple of three quarters. So they got better and that would be a positive for everybody but still not an [inaudible] we are delivering way faster than all the competition in the space. I'll turn the EPS question over to Steffan.
Steffan Tomlinson: Yes. We continue to expect to grow revenue greater than 30% and closer to the 30% to 31% for the year. That's really due to elongating sales cycle. As Mark mentioned, it is much faster than the growth rate of the competition or the rate of the market. We feel comfortable that even with a little bit of lower revenue number for the year, we are able to still get to the $2.75 to $2.80 non-GAAP EPS through operational discipline and rigor. And that's why we feel comfortable with the $2.75 to $2.80. 
Sterling Auty: And maybe just to clarify for people because I got the question already a few times in email and IM, the $2.75 to $2.80 is not because of the sales commission and accounting change, correct? 
Steffan Tomlinson: Well, it's inclusive of it. So our guidance range last - when we talked about in our Q4 earnings call for the set up for FY2017 was $2.75 to $2.80, and that was including a benefit of the deferred commission change so that's still baked into it, but the $2.75 to $2.80 that's we are calling right now is not changing any assumption that we talked about from Q4. 
Operator: We move now to Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray.
Andrew Nowinski: All right, thanks. Maybe just from a geographic perspective, looks like this is the first quarter in about two years where your revenue growth in EMEA outpaced the Americas. So just can you give us any color on what impacted the moderation in revenue growth and specifically in the Americas? 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, Andrew, it is Mark. Yes, so as we noted earlier we've seen a number of deals, a handful deals that [inaudible] larger deals because we are winning bigger deals with bigger companies and it doesn't take a lot of those to push just going a quarter, given that our biggest market is the Americas and that's where we, lot of our customer base is, that would be the place that would be most impacted. 
Andrew Nowinski: All right. Then on VM-Series, now you had strong growth this quarter and I think you said 50% of those customers in the quarter were new to Palo Alto, is it possible that the VM-Series might be cannibalizing some of your product revenue selling into those new customers? 
Mark McLaughlin: That's good question. I don't think that's the case, Andrew. The VM-Series, our cloud in general I think it continues to be great selling point for us because we can provide the consistency and security both across on prem, hybrid to public cloud environments, and that's what customers are responding to. The front end of that thrust is the VM-Series and I said in my prepared remarks about half of the customers that came to us in the first quarter their first experience with Palo Alto Networks is to buy VM-Series. So it's clearly opening door for us. Maybe more interesting to your question though if we looked at over the 2,000 plus customers we have on VM-Series today, that trend is holding about more than half of those were first time customers at Palo Alto Networks with the VM-Series. Again if we look at back that, more than a majority of those have come back and purchased hardware, for example, since they joined us with the VM-Series. So this looks to be a positive [inaudible].
Operator: We will now move to Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer.
Shaul Eyal: Thank you. Hi, good afternoon, guys. Mark any specific product that either outperformed or underperformed this quarter? How did the 7080, 7050 performed specifically this quarter?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, we saw good contribution across our entire family not just in the hardware side but across all the services side as well. One thing that we really like to see in the first quarter went well for us was particularly in the high end stuff is in the service provider business. We organized a lot around that in last year's time and that team did a great job beating the number in the first quarter. So that's fantastic like to see more of that coming and those customers tend to buy the higher end device. 
Shaul Eyal: Got it. Got it. And how the federal vertical specifically this quarter? 
Mark McLaughlin: It was good. We got a good Fed business that's true across civilian, the intelligence community, the defense community as well. So we are growing a very nice Fed business that quarter came in well for us as you know the Fed year end is inside that quarter. The only blemish on that business here was we had one high seven figure deal that pushed into the next week for the few number days, mostly due to the government is still operating under continued resolution so it has a little couple more approvals had to get done in budget. So but other than it was exactly a good we expected.
Operator: This time we'll hear from Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.
Karl Keirstead: So you step in on the long term DR, super strong performance in the quarter and just given that this underpins your billings growth and to some extent your free cash flow growth. I just like to understand that a little bit better. The mix I think now 44% of all of your DR, do you think that can still increase -- to help us understand how some of the environmental stuff you talked about with longer sales cycle et cetera. That didn't seemed to have any impact on long-term DR, so I am wondering if you could explain that if there was any kind of lengthening of [Technical Difficulty] duration that might offset that. Thank you. 
Steffan Tomlinson: We did see modest uptick in duration on a sequential basis. When we see growth on long-term deferred revenue in this quarter kind of year-over-year basis is about 84%. That's been in a relatively call it tight range over the last several quarters. That is an indication that our customers are willing to standardize on us a platform. So [Lockson] is a strategic partner. And we believe that's a very good indication. It's actually a sign of the strength of the platform. We have seen some larger deals that Mark had highlighted that they ended up slipping past to end of the quarter sales elongation is the reason there. Had those bill not slipped we would have seen even more healthy kind of increase in both short term and long term deferred revenue. So the deferred revenue would have been better had we not had the sale cycle elongation. And going forward we factored in sales cycle elongation into guidance. And that is a prudent thing to do at this point. And if sales cycle start to shorten we will update then but right now we are basically taking our sales cycle and factoring that into the methodology for the guidance, for not end of the quarter but for the year. 
Operator: We will move now to Jayson Noland with Baird.
Jayson Noland: Okay. Great, thank you. Just to ask on the longer sales cycle, was there any feedback from the customer base that would be helpful? I just wondering if that was the US election or just more general. 
Mark McLaughlin: Hi, Jayson. It's Mark here. It's hard to pass through that level of detail with the customers. So first of all let's just talk about the handful of the deals, so it is not lot of things. Getting to the specifics as to why that may occur, whether it was related to election or not, that's hard to get from customers. I think generally it is good thing that watch is over from a consistency and certain key perspective regardless of who win right. I think everybody probably feels that but we didn't hear that being expressed through the customers. But we are seeing is that we are winning bigger deals, bigger companies, we are working on a architectural, strategic, long-term projects with companies which is great but we are seeing a bit longer to get done. 
Jayson Noland: Okay. That make sense. And I wanted to ask on service provider too. It has been a challenging vertical for some key suppliers here under exposed to gaining traction. I guess Mark how should we think about SP into 2017?
Mark McLaughlin: We think a couple of things. First is that as you know it was a vertical that we hadn't been super focused on for a number of years and we've organized around that last year to both from a product perspective to really get some service provider to put a lot more focus on that internally. That's primarily because we think that industry can benefit from the advanced security we have. Also when you see data moving around as it is, it has been continued with IoT and things like that. The mobile framework is becoming increasingly important in order to make those things happen right. So security is going to become increasingly important. And we want to make sure that we bring our advanced security capabilities to that market. And we are doing that. So that said, pleased with service provider results, that business is not as big as rest of our business yet but it is growing at very nice rates and that feedback so far has been very positive on we brought to the marketing. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] I'll now take a question from Michael Turits with Raymond James.
Michael Turits: Hey, guys. Two questions. First of all back on the sale cycle question. Is there any sense that there is hesitation regarding our extensive let's call decision cycles given people's plan so what they will do in cloud which tends to be complex sometimes? 
Mark McLaughlin: I'll take the first question on that. [indiscernible] of course right it is a big deal, it is macro trend and as people are thinking about cloud, one of the main things we hear from customers not surprisingly is the security aspect of that and an increasingly what's obvious to us as well is they beat and won of the consistency of security and with their on prem in cloud and any play with cloud right. And that's where we are uniquely bringing to the customer base here today. You don't have to have different security and more when you have different security outcomes [Technical Difficulty] like to have on prem, so they are looking for that answer. And they are also know that they are probably going to have multi call strategy as well. So who can bring the consistency of security in all the situations that increasingly as the powerful network and I think that showing through with our relationships with the results for our VM-Series. So I think it's a good thing. I mean all those kind of accurate things with IoT or cloud or all those things go into the next when people are making their decisions over top technologic companies we think the positive of course. 
Michael Turits: And then the other question was on Trap side, most of your address is directly, you pointed out the Traps is doing what-- anything that point to concretely in terms of uptick or positive reaction following the new release in Traps and how people reacting to that? 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, Michael speaking about our version 3.4 which we brought out in the late summer timeframe which got very positive reviews both externally and from our prospect and customer base. The main reason for that is as we continue to iterate Traps and that was a very big iteration there, it became very clear after that release that it could be a head on to the replacement right. And that's what the big budget in the market is and that's where people are increasingly buying traps to that. Now in addition to having those capabilities to be an AV replacement which it has, we also want to get external validation of that -- get that in a number ways. Some as third party testing, so you've seen some of the reports coming out where those tests supporting well, getting the kind of compliance check off like I mentioned on the call for HIPAA and PCI is important so that people from an auditing perspective, so yes that can be an AV replacement, and in third just reference ability. Now if over a million things under protection with Traps bit size and very fast growing customer base. People talking to people saying this really works not just only as an AV replacement more importantly as fill time prevention end points and probably just as importantly to seamlessly bring together progression from end point to network to cloud to all things platform provide them. 
Operator: We will now take a question from Saket Kalia with Barclays Capital. 
Saket Kalia: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Just first for Mark, Mark you talked about some of the stronger cohorts in the past like 2012 for example starting to become for refresh, presumably we've just seen the beginning of that trend, what do you have seen so far? Are you seeing anything different in this refresh cycle versus others that you've seen in the past? 
Mark McLaughlin : No. I guess couple of things, one is you correctly noted that from a refresh cycle perspective and the amount of customers that would even be up for refresh, vast majority of that is coming into play starting in the second half this year and beyond. That's the first thing. The second thing of the refresh as we've seen in the earlier cohorts even though a small have been very strong and then just as a general matter so it is not really Palo Alto Networks view point but it is from an industry perspective haven't seen anything different in the cycles of refresh, little hard to call those but generally 4 to 6 years but that seems to be the case still. 
Saket Kalia: Got it, got it. And then for my follow up just specifically on the Wildfire subscription, presumably you are going to see more competition from other specialists that are going to maybe compete with cloud delivery. Do you still think that Wildfire has the advantage as being part of the Firewall and being cloud delivered or is that something that you maybe start to hear from customers as maybe sandbox start to change? 
Mark McLaughlin: Well, couple of three things and that probably fact it is the first is that that Wildfire has to be and is very good at these end marks right. So super capable as best of breed right from a sandbox perspective and those are cable space, in order to that for people and I think with the size of the customer base and the kind of customers they were adding we can see it's get very high mark, so that's one. Two, Wildfire is really well done in a sense that it is delivered from the cloud right. So the second thing is that for us to have the ability to bring that kind of capability from the cloud and do it at enormous scale which we are doing today is a competitive differentiator for us. The third thing is that it is under the brains of the platform right. So when you have Wildfire and you are using it that is how you actually get in about five minutes real time update to everything we know across the earth ecosystem of our customers provided you automatically to high degrees of automation. And the last point which I think is going to be increasingly important over time and here we are way ahead just given the size of the customer base and the architecture is we are dealing with gobbs of data right, and I said petabytes of data here. So our ability to make that data useful for Wildfire itself to get the five minute update and then to do additional things like we've done with AutoFocus which is to provide high degrees of relevance and correlation almost in real time to that data and be able to continue to do that without much that kind of scale is increasingly important. So I think those are very high competitive barriers for anybody to get over let alone somebody who is just showing up to the bogging. 
Operator: We will now move to Rob Owens with Pacific Crest Securities. 
Rob Owens: Great. And thanks for taking my question. Mark you mentioned how is you participating more architectural strategic long-term deal. So those are typically falling into a budget process that's long way -- the large deal slippage, is that year sensitive more of lack confidence in IT budget going to spend at this point or do you think there might be some re-prioritization going on?
Mark McLaughlin: I think it looks like security is still a big deal right. And I would guess that was going to be the case for really long time to come just because it is so important to underpinning all of the trust in the digital. So I don't see that changing whatsoever. What we are seeing in our business is that we are in bigger and bigger companies getting these larger deals done. And they tend to be more complex because of the architectural aspects of it and we are winning them right. So it just taking longer to get some of them on which is unfortunate but on a long term basis it is very beneficial for the company. We put a hell a lot of focus as we mentioned before in 2,000 customer segment because we think 70% plus of the addressable market opportunity in that segment. We got over 1,100 customers in Q1, 100 right now, we've added 1,000 in Q1, we added over 100 year-over-year. And about 40% of our sales in Q1 for example are coming out of G2, 000, and that's growing high and up into the right. So it is increasingly important segment but what you get with that is you are going to get these larger architectural designs right that are taking so longer to get done and like I said that's a good thing for us in the long term but it might have some impact on a short term. And all that said not we do have to win these fields, we got to call bond then we are going to get them as well. So we realize it we do a better job on that. We are definitely focused on that. 
Rob Owens: And as a follow up, can you talk with the level of discounting in the quarter which you are seeing either from competitors or expected discounting from end customers? 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, sure. So two angles on that. One is this has been a very, very competitive market. You can think as being competitive market we definitely looked on to the price card, Cisco, Check Point, Fortinet have been doing that for quite some time. If we look at our quarter gaining gross margin are good or high, we didn't see any discounting pressure meeting on us from a sequential basis. And we are able to combat that like I said with this architectural design win what we bring from a platform perspective, we expect to really continue to do that.
Operator: We will now move to Pierre Ferragu with Bernstein. Go ahead. 
Pierre Ferragu: Hey, good evening. Thank you for taking my question. I'd like to come back to your elongating sale cycle. You mentioned a lot of things you talked about more complex deals going to larger client as well and my question is how much of that is actually just like more like broader environment and macro drivers, so I am thinking about like the Brexit in Europe. In US we have heads are run up to the election. Did you see a moment of like macro affecting decision cycles just because people are more careful with the budget? And if that's the case any indication of how significant it was compared to things that are more specific to the complexity of what you are selling?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. I think it's a good question. So I have two angles on that one. The first would be for the things that we think we know for sure right which would be when these bigger companies and bigger deals with like I said these architectural design wins and meeting to the architectural wins that are strategic in nature. A very good sense of that because we are winning the deals. We know we are continuing with the winning and is very high rates on that. As far as how long they may take from an approval process or spending cycle process they get done, there could be lots of factors that play around that. You mentioned a whole bunch of right election price boil and brexit and interest rate and all sorts of stuff that can provide, that can put some uncertainty into the macro spending environment that which looks today like I said earlier next that's what it sound like from report that we've seen and certainty in business deal and those things that would help improve our time, those would be great. But we are trying to really pay attention to things that we can be for sure than with -- 
Operator: And I'll now move to Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Co.
Gregg Moskowitz: Hey, thanks very much. Mark could you talk about the sales cycle and length and envelop of the larger deal that pushed but of the business that did goes in the quarter, did you see any change to average deal size? 
Mark McLaughlin: No. It's very consistent. One of the things we mentioned in the past Gregg that it continues to be the case is from ASP perspective generally those continue to grow over time. Lot of our wins is first time wins for somebody and we get into expand very dramatically over time and on to those dynamics change. 
Operator: Now we will move on to Walter Pritchard with Citi. 
Walter Pritchard: Hi, thanks Mark. I am just wondering if you could talk to the customer count, the customer addition in the quarter I think it was 1,500 in last year in this quarter was about 2,000. Because I think about large deals pushing is probably not impacting that number that much but I am wondering kind of generally how we should think about that metric as a driver of your particularly your product growth going forward? 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, Walter, good question. So, yes, all these quarters when we talk about these numbers and to round right so but I said well over 1,500 in a quarter that would closer to 2,000, this quarter than 1,500 so customer, new customer acquisitions has been very sharp. 
Steffan Tomlinson : And on a year-over-year basis, I know is the largest Q1 customer adds that we had so and relative to contribution. We still get call it three quarters to 80% of all our business from our install base of customers. And you can imagine with 34,000 customers that we had entering the quarter, the purchasing power of their installed base is extremely high. So contribution from new customers definitely helps but the purchasing power is really lies in the installed base. 
Walter Pritchard: And then Steffan on the duration you did mention it was up a little bit. Is there anything about certain types of customers tends to driver longer duration or is it service providers or anything systematic that's happening there? Or is it more just how the chips falling in a quarter?
Steffan Tomlinson: It's kind of where how the chips fall in the quarter with the when you wants that larger customers tend to do multiyear deals but we do see smaller customers doing multiyear deals too just that the impact of the larger customers is more pronounced just because of the ticket size is often times it could be four five times greater than what the smaller customer is purchasing. 
Operator: At this time we will move to Brent Thill with UBS.
Brent Thill: Mark, I just wanted to clarify you mentioned a lot of deals in Q1 that slipped and had closed running in Q2, I just wanted to understand with that the majority of deals, can you just give us a little more color on what you meant there? 
Mark McLaughlin: Sure. Well, if I back up for a minute get handful of thing can over line as I mentioned before. Over 10,000 plus deals so some of the -- it is only take few of the very one not come across the line to have the less or best quarter than we would have fight and that's what happened the situation. So when we look at what's happening right now, about half of those are closed so far we got deadline -- 
Brent Thill: Okay. Just a comments on sales cycle, you are not alone there has been numerous security companies that are assign the same reason. And I guess is there any other further explanation why the industry is seeing? I think I wanted to point the cloud, is there digestion of past purchases that still or happening.
Mark McLaughlin : Yes. I have seen commentary along that, you are correct on pass as well I think it looks as though in the last few years time a lot of stuff has been bought in security from a lot of different providers right. And what we've seen from the -- people working in their way through that is a lot of the point capabilities that it were sold and bought by these folks, they have to work their way through those capabilities being from a minimum from an amortization depreciation cycle perspective right. So you can see that we are subsuming a lot of that into the platform at very high rate but it is not unusual to go into a customer and say, hey, use Wildfire for example, we wanted to sell Wildfire, you already bought parts for the platform before and get a comment from them to say got love it, it sounds great, I tested it, I got to amortize to think I have a depreciate to think I have just little further so locked to be in six months right or whatever the situation maybe. And that could be true for proxies or sandboxes or desk capabilities for end points go across the board. So folks digesting a lot of things that they got over the last few years. It can have an impact on when they made purchase our thing that is part of the platform. 
Operator: At this time we will hear from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.
Matt Hedberg : Hey, thanks for taking my question guys. Mark your growth in EMEA was better, I am curious are you some of your European customers talking about the pending GDP breach notification and maybe if they are not yet do you see that as a potential driver next year? 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. A lot of people are talking about that. It's I think it's going to be important, this is a general matter and what Matt talking about there is not in distant future like in United States there will be similar kind of legislation that will take effect. It is already passed, it will take effect in Europe that says you have to report breach right. And when those things happen the focus and attention for companies once they actually have to report stuff should go up. Now we certainly saw that in United States. We think you would see that in Europe. Now the dimensioning part of that legislation is that it uses the term that's very important and it says that you need to state of the art security capabilities right. So state of the art is great right that next generation, that's advanced, that's platform that's all of the things that we've been successful selling. And to double underline that point just to make sure that folks in Europe know that Palo Alto Networks is provider of that. We've taken a lot of the marketing capabilities that we've been so successful force to bargain, we export them most recently for example we published a version of our book which is called Navigating Digital Age which is something that is designed for C suite executive and board members and it has been incredibly well read in the United States. We just published that in French. And that would came out end of last quarter and in side we also launched in Australia as well not the US - a pack that they similar legislation coming into play very same. So we are pushing materials like that in local languages with local experts and very much aligning ourselves with the -- in the case of Europe with state of the art and defining what that means for security feature. 
Operator: And at this time we will take a question from Gray Powell with Wells Fargo.
Gray Powell: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple if I may. So I mean product revenue it slowed for everyone in the network securities space this year. I just looked at some of the public players and the group, it looks like product growth expected to be in the call it the high single digit range in the second half of 2016 versus more like 25% last year. Do you think we are back head sort of normalized level of growth and do you see anything that can do either direction going forward? 
Mark McLaughlin: A couple of things there. One is I think this is definitely the age of the platform right. We are definitively seeing the move from, the paradigm shift from point solutions that are prevention delivered as hardware into nextgen platform that are prevention oriented, some of which will be delivered as hardware and a lot of which we delivered as software and from a stocky facility and that's what's driving the growth in our platform. We are going to have both of them. It is going to be hardware and software capabilities and we would expect that the hardware component that would be follow product end front that would be healthy and continues to grow over time. We said we saw second half acceleration which we do expect to see for some of the reasons we expressed already. And that's our view as to where this is going to go. 
Gray Powell: Okay. That's helpful. And just a quick follow up. I mean you have your 30% long-term growth target. Is there some sort of base level of product growth revenue growth that's required for you to hit that target? 
Steffan Tomlinson: Well, we have this growth and profitability framework which we have outlined and that we are adhering to. And what we called out as that in this fiscal year we are going to be in high growth mode which is greater than 30% revenue growth. And what we've given as a construct for the year is that product revenue growth on a year-over-year basis would be approximately 12% to 13% year-over-year. And we would need that to be the case in order for the projections to be achievable. So that's basically the construct for the year. We don't have a product growth rate on a long term all basis that we talked about because ultimately it is about selling the whole platform. And we are focused on selling all elements of the platform and that's how we talk about total revenue growth as the primary indicator. There are sub components that we give headlights too like product and subscription and services and renewals. But it is really total revenue growth. 
Operator: We will now take a question from Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities.
John : Hey, guys, this is John on for Erik. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is can you just remind us what percent of the billing that comes from existing versus new customers and how that's trended over the last year? And then also were the push deals concentrated on either new or existing customers? 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. On the percentage of billings from new versus existing, it is approximately call three quarters to 80% of billing come from our existing and installed base of customers. And in the dynamic which I reference in the past is this quarter we added north of 1,500 customers in the quarter, new customers but that's too a base of 34,000 customers. And you think about the flywheel that's going on around repeat purchasing, the top 20 five, you look at all of those LTV stats; those are all up into the right. So the purchasing power is a lot greater for the installed base of customers which is why you have three quarters to 80% contribution coming from there. Then your second question was on push deals and whether those came from new customers or existing customers, is primarily new customers where we saw a little elongation of sales cycle. 
John: Okay. And then last question. Overall the one million Traps end points paid or some of those unpaid? And if so how many of them?
Mark McLaughlin: They are all paid.
Operator: We have time for one question. This will be from Jonathan Ho from William Blair. 
Jonathan Ho: Hey, guys. I just wanted to understand a little bit better your public thought opportunity. I mean we saw VMware sign deal with AWS including you in that platform so can you just give us a little bit more color in terms of what that opportunity looks like for you guys? And maybe what this deal could mean. 
Mark McLaughlin : Yes. I think that deal is a bridging if you will of the public and private collaborate. So I think it is a growing recognition by public call providers and hybrid or private call providers that it is going to be a hybrid world into the future. That's going to be on premise, it is going to be hybrid, and it is going to be public as well. And what companies want to do and I mentioned this consistency aspect is that they want to be able to move their data seamlessly across all over though they sometime they want to be in cloud, sometimes they want to be on prem and sometime they want to be between both. And I think that's what the AWS and VMware deal represent, recognition by both of those companies, probably more in the industry that's going to be the case in the future. So from the security perspective our ability to tell a customer that we can provide exactly the same kind of security in a high consistent manner whatever the data maybe and cloud whether it is on prem, hybrid or public or even more important that it maybe just as important that is everywhere else too across endpoints and third party SaaS application being delivered from the cloud. We get to say we can do the exact same level of security which is the most advanced security can possibly have, exactly the same in all those cases. [Technical Difficulty] 
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And then just relative to your commentary on the platform, can you talk a little bit about the number of subscriptions that you are attaching to new product and whether you are seeing that continue to increase or shift around and based on the activity this quarter? 
Steffan Tomlinson : So for the four subscriptions that attached to the appliance we've seen very strong growth rates and very high attached rates. On a sequential basis -- we talk about it on a semi-annual basis. And I had gone back and take a look at if the number grew on a year-over-year basis but that attach rates were healthy. The fun attached business which we have four subscription services that are AutoFocus, Aperture, Traps and Virtual, those don't have a concept in their attach. They are lower in terms of the base but they have triple digit growth rates. So both subscriptions both the attach non attached are growing very healthily. I have just get back to you on whether or not the second half -- if the attach growth rate grew on an annual basis. 
Operator: It concludes the question- and-answer session. I'll turn things back over to Mark McLaughlin for any additional or closing remarks. 
Mark McLaughlin: Great. Well, thanks everybody for being on the call this afternoon. And before I close as always I want to thank the Palo Alto Networks team for their dedication and our customers and partners for the opportunity to work with them. We take the responsibility of helping the world’s largest organizations solve their most critical security challenges very seriously. Also, I hope everyone has a safe and enjoyable Thanksgiving. Thanks for your time. 
Operator: Once again this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation.

And finally, for your reference once we've completed our formal remarks, we will be posting them and the related slide deck to our Investor Relations website under Quarterly Results. And, with that, I will turn the call over to Mark.
Mark McLaughlin: Thank you, Kelsey. And, thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon. I am happy to be here with you to share our results for our fiscal fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2016. Our fiscal fourth quarter capped off another record year for Palo Alto Networks. In the quarter, we grew revenue 41% year-over-year to $401 million; billings were up 45% year-over-year to $572 million; free cash flow was up 72% year-over-year to $171 million; and we reported non-GAAP EPS of $0.50. In Q4 we saw a better macro sentiment than what we witnessed in Q3. For the fiscal year 2016, we reported revenue of $1.4 billion, up 49% year-over-year; billings of $1.9 billion, up 56% year-over-year; free cash flow of $586 million, up 85% year over year, and non-GAAP EPS of $1.67, up 94% year-over-year. In our industry these growth rates at our scale are unprecedented and I want to thank our customers, our team and our global partners for these results, their hard work and their ongoing support. We've been driving a paradigm shift toward a real platform which customers are adopting in record numbers. As a result, we continue to outpace the competition and rapidly capture market share. Financially the paradigm shift is providing us with sustainable benefits evident in our strong product sales, significant growth in attached and non-attached subscription services, and very high renewal rates. In particular, the rapid growth in recurring services provides sustainable growth in both short and long-term deferred revenue, increasing visibility into future revenue, higher operating margins over time, and high free cash flow generation. As a result, we are confident that we will continue to deliver high revenue growth at scale for years to come. This paradigm shift is inevitable in an age where attacks are increasingly automated and sophisticated. Historically, the answer to the attack growth and sophistication has been to attempt to detect an attack through a combination of best of breed technologies, often delivered as individual hardware appliances or disparate software agents, and then have the customer be responsible for acting as a back-end integrator to try to gain some leverage from the products. It is increasingly obvious that this approach is failing and instead of providing leverage against the automated attacker, it's resulted in security defined by the least common denominator in the security stack, increased complexity in the network, increased cost to deploy the technologies, and increased reliance on man power which is hard to find and is the least leverageable resource a company has. As a result, customers are moving away from point products that do detection and drive manual responses, to real platforms that provide high degrees of prevention through native integration of best of breed capabilities which are increasingly delivered as services, high automation, increasing ecosystem leverage, and seamless deployment in all environments including the cloud. Vendors today are being judged against these requirements and we can clearly see a few things occurring. First, customers are making purchasing decisions based on strategic architectural considerations as opposed to the more transactional “one of each” hardware model seen in the past. Customers want better security, a reduction in the number of vendors, and better value for their spend. They're being more thoughtful about their decisions, more open than ever to transition from legacy technology, and awarding larger deals to fewer vendors. Second, those vendors that have traditionally served the firewall market are relying primarily on price, bundling of free services, or promises of future roadmap to try to stay in the network. And third, point product vendors are finding it increasingly difficult to justify their standalone value proposition when their capabilities are being subsumed into the platform. As the primary driver of this paradigm shift, we are benefitting disproportionately compared to the rest of the industry. Our Next-Generation Security Platform prevents threats across the entire attack lifecycle simply and seamlessly by automating security in a way that transcends individual capabilities and is easily deployed as either hardware or software, in the network, on endpoints and in the cloud. Customers recognize and embrace the uniqueness of our approach and our metrics show we are delivering on their requirements. In terms of customer growth, in the fourth quarter we had the highest rate of new customer adoption in our history, adding over 2,000 new customers and are now proud to be serving approximately 34,000 total customers globally. This includes over 85 of the Fortune 100, over 70% of the Fortune 500, and 55% of the Global 2000. In terms of capabilities of the platform, we continue to see rapid adoption, real usage, and very high renewal rates. At the end of the fourth quarter, we now have more than 29,500 customers using Threat Prevention, more than 24,000 using URL filtering and 3,500 using Global Protect. We added the highest number of quarterly WildFire customers in our history to bring our total WildFire customer base to over 12,500. Our Traps offering and our VM series offering each are on mid-eight figure run rate in sales growing at triple digits. Specifically, we grew our number of VM series customers to over 1,700, up from the approximately 1,000 we reported recently at Analyst Day, with hundreds of these customers deploying in the public cloud and, Traps continues to ramp quickly. We now have well over 500 Traps customers, up from the approximately 300 we discussed at Analyst Day. Finally, we have approximately 100 customers using AutoFocus and Aperture resulting in a combined eight figure run rate in sales for these offerings growing at triple digits. Platform adoption is driving record lifetime value growth across the board. For example, all of our top 25 lifetime value customers again made purchases in the fourth quarter and to make this list a customer had to have spent a minimum of $14 million in lifetime value, a more than 50% increase over the $9.2 million in Q4 of fiscal '15. With the market’s only true platform, our technology, ecosystem and competitive advantages are increasingly evident. Some examples of wins in the quarter include a Check Point replacement at a large U.S. financial services company to secure their datacenter with our PA-7000 series chassis; a competitive win against Cisco in the defense industry for a significant IoT use case utilizing VM series. A perimeter and datacenter Cisco replacement with PA-5000s, Threat Prevention, URL Filtering and WildFire in one of Europe’s largest retailers with over 6,000 stores; a Check Point replacement including dozens of devices across product lines, Threat Prevention, URL Filtering and GlobalProtect where we became the standard security platform for one of Europe’s largest media companies; a Cisco replacement in the internet operations of one of the world’s leading SaaS vendors with our PA-7050 chassis, Threat Prevention and URL Filtering. And, we closed a seven-figure Traps deal for 30,000 endpoints with a U.S.-based integrated health care organization where we replaced Symantec for anti-virus. We are also increasing leverage and return on investments for our customers with additional partnerships designed to reduce the burden on customers to integrate technology. For example, earlier this month, we teamed with Accenture, Splunk and Tanium to develop an integrated security offering wrapped with Accenture services that includes our Next-Generation Security Platform. This unique combination will help organizations better defend their networks, protect their endpoints, gain insight into the security behavior within their enterprise, and effectively automate breach detection, prevention, response and recovery efforts. And, we are always working to further extend our technological advantage by consciously fostering a culture of innovation and continually enhancing the capabilities of our platform. Most recently, we announced the release of Traps version 3.4 with new functionality, including increased significant machine learning capabilities for real-time unknown malware prevention and quarantine of malicious executables. These updates further strengthen the malware and exploit capabilities of Traps and alleviate the need for legacy anti-virus technology to protect endpoints. We also introduced the WildFire EU Cloud. Customers will now have the option to submit unknown files and email links to a WildFire cloud within the EU for analysis, where the customer’s submissions will be fully analyzed and stored without ever leaving the EU borders. Data privacy and protection is paramount when it comes to cloud-based threat analysis and with the WildFire EU cloud it is now much easier for global and European customers alike to fully utilize this critical threat prevention capability. Response to our recent platform releases and roadmap continues to be very positive. On the go-to-market front, we just completed Sales Kick Off for 2017 where more than 2,000 enthusiastic sales, marketing and product team members sat side-by-side with over 800 partners hearing about our objectives for the fiscal year, as well as participating in the same training programs and certifications as our own sales professionals. This event is a great way to kick off the year and I can assure you the team is fired up. We are in a very large addressable market with high single digit market share. We have significant runway ahead of us and we have been continuously optimizing the team across all functions in the company for deep bench strength to ensure we can seamlessly scale at unprecedented growth rates. I was very pleased to announce the next step for us in that regard at our sales kickoff event with Dave Peranich joining the team as EVP, Worldwide Sales and Mark Anderson being promoted to President. Dave, who will be reporting to Mark, will focus exclusively on sales and channels, while Mark will retain ownership of sales, lead our go-to-market strategy, as well as customer support and business development. I am very pleased with these appointments and look forward to working with Mark and Dave for a long time to come. Congratulations to you both and welcome to the team Dave. As we look forward, we have confidence that we are the leading beneficiary of the move to real platforms and we are anticipating another exciting year of high growth for the company. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Steffan.
Steffan Tomlinson: Thank you Mark, and thank you all for joining us. Before I start, I’d like to note that except for revenue and billings figures, all financial figures are non-GAAP unless stated otherwise. As it’s the end of the fiscal year, I will be covering more material than a standard quarterly call. This includes Q4 and fiscal 2016 financial results and key metrics; a discussion on the model and related mix assumptions; And, I will conclude with guidance and modeling points. I’ll start with the results. For both the quarter and the year we delivered industry-leading topline growth, at scale, and increased profitability. Our platform and our unique hybrid SaaS financial model provide a combination that translates into sustainable growth and structural leverage both now and in the future. Turning to the numbers, in Q4, our total revenue grew 41% year-over-year to a new record of $400.8 million. For the fiscal year, we reported total revenue of $1.4 billion, a 49% increase over the prior year. The geographic mix of revenue for Q4 was 72% Americas, 17% EMEA, and 11% APAC. Compared to the prior year, both the Americas and EMEA each grew 41%, and APAC grew 42%. Q4 product revenue of $191.1 million increased 24% year-over-year and growth was healthy across our product portfolio. Recurring services revenue of $209.7 million increased 61% over the prior year and accounted for a 52% share of total revenue. SaaS-based subscription revenue of $106.5 million increased 66%, while support and maintenance revenue of $103.2 million increased 57%. Q4 billings were $572.4 million, up 45% year-over-year. For fiscal 2016, billings were $1.9 billion, up 56% year over year. Product billings were $670.1 million, up 35% and accounted for 35% of total billings. Support billings were $579.6 million, up 70%. Subscription billings were $655.9 million, up 72%. Support and subscription billings accounted for 65% of total billings in fiscal ‘16 compared to 59% in fiscal ‘15. Total deferred revenue was $1.2 billion, an increase of 74% year over year and 16% sequentially. Short-term deferred revenue of $703.9 million increased $280 million year-over-year and accounted for 57% share of total deferred revenue. Long-term deferred revenue of $536.9 million increased $247.1 million year-over-year and accounted for a 43% share of total deferred revenue. On a semi-annual basis, we update a number of metrics which give insight into the drivers of top line performance. In Q4, customer adoption of our eight subscription services continued to be strong. The attach rate of the four attached subscription services increased to 2.6 subscriptions per device sold in the quarter, up from 2.3 in Q2 and 2.2 in Q4 of fiscal ’15. Of note, these services are being attached to higher priced devices, which has consistently been increasing the dollar value of transactions over time. And, finally, renewal rates for subscriptions and support continue to be high at greater than 90% and approximately 100%, respectively. With the topline details covered, I will now turn to margins. Our Q4 gross margin was 79.4%, an increase of 110 basis points compared to last year and 150 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by improvements in recurring services gross margins. Total Q4 operating expenses were $245.7 million, or 61.3% of revenue. Operating margin was 18.1% in Q4 representing a 400 basis points increase year-over-year and 100 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year improvement was primarily comprised of gross margin improvement of 110 basis points and sales and marketing margin improvement of 210 basis points. For the full fiscal year 2016, operating margin was 17.3% representing a 440 basis point increase year over year. Net income for the quarter was $46.2 million, or $0.50 per diluted share using 91.7 million shares, compared with net income of $25 million, or $0.28 per diluted share in Q4‘15. For fiscal ‘16, we reported net income of $152.6 million, or $1.67 per diluted share, compared with net income of $75.2 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, in fiscal ’15. On a GAAP basis for the fourth quarter, net loss was $54.5 million, or $0.61 per basic and diluted share. This compares with a Q4’15 GAAP net loss of $46 million, or $0.55 per basic and diluted share. For fiscal ’16, we reported a GAAP net loss of $225.9 million or $2.59 per basic and diluted share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $165 million or $2.02 per basic and diluted share in fiscal ’15. Turning to cash flows and balance sheet items, on a GAAP basis, in Q4 cash flow from operations was $187.5 million, up 68% year-over-year; free cash flow was $171.2 million, up 72% year-over-year; and free cash flow margin was 42.7%. We finished July with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.9 billion. DSOs were 69 days, an increase of one day on a sequential basis and 11 days compared to Q4 last year, reflecting a strong July and an increased mix shift towards subscriptions and support. With the Q4 and fiscal year recap complete, I’d like to provide some insight into the continued evolution of our hybrid-SaaS model and the mix shift in the business. In the execution of our model we are driving a shift towards more products being delivered as SaaS-like services resulting in more recurring revenue. This is a natural outcome of selling all elements of the platform and is beneficial from a financial standpoint because it makes us more strategic and sticky with customers, is higher margin business, provides increasing visibility into future revenue streams, and drives sustainably high free cash flow generation. As customers commit to our platform, a natural outcome is increased scope and duration of contracts. In Q4, durations for new contracts both on a quantity and dollar weighted basis were 2.1 and 2.7 years, respectively. Of note, when we look at our top 25 customers, we can see that all of them have made multi-year purchases and all of them continue to make many and frequent additional purchases during and after these multi-year commitments. This behavior is unlike traditional SaaS models and is consistent across our customer base. The result is that the lifetime value of each customer cohort continues to increase significantly and, also unlike traditional SaaS models, we bill and collect the cash for deals upfront instead of annually which is driving high deferred revenue growth and strong free cash flow. Over the past three years our short-term deferred revenue has grown more than 60% year-over-year and long-term deferred revenue has grown more than 70% year-over-year. This, of course, provides us with increasing visibility into our high growth expectations on future revenue. I now would like to move to an update on the deferred commissions project, guidance and modeling points. As discussed at Analyst Day, we have been working on a project that allows us to better match commissions expense to our ratable revenue. Starting in Q1 we plan to move from our historical approach of expensing all commissions during the period in which the related revenue contract was booked, to the accounting policy used by many other companies where commissions related to ratable revenue are amortized over the term of the revenue contract. With our business evolving to more of a recurring revenue model, this method provides a much better match between revenue and expenses on the income statement. Guidance provided this afternoon reflects this anticipated change of accounting policy. It's important to note that the contribution of this change is not linear over the year and the vast majority occurs in the second half of the fiscal year when accelerated commission payments are in effect. Accordingly, we anticipate the change will have less than a $0.01 contribution to fiscal Q1 non-GAAP EPS and an approximately $0.25 contribution to full-year non-GAAP EPS. And for reference purposes, if the anticipated change had been in effect for fiscal 2016, the estimated incremental contribution to non-GAAP EPS would have been approximately $0.12 to $0.15 in Q4 and $0.19 to $0.23 for the full year and the corresponding operating margin would have been 22.6% to 23.6% in Q4 and 19.3% to 19.8% for the year. Now, turning to guidance, for fiscal Q1 2017, we expect revenue to be in the range of $396 million to $402 million, which represents 33% to 35% growth year-over-year and, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.51 to $0.53 per share using 92 to 94 million shares. While we don’t provide annual guidance and will not be updating this information in the future, in order to assist in modeling the deferred commissions plan impact for the fiscal year, we want to provide a one-time, full-year view on non-GAAP EPS. Using current fiscal '17 consensus of $1.827 billion for revenue, our outlook for the full-year non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.80 per share using 94 to 96 million shares. This range includes the benefit of at least 100 basis points of organic non-GAAP operating margin improvement and approximately 150 to 200 basis points from the deferred commissions change. Before I conclude I’d like to provide a number of modeling points. First, it's important to note that as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal '17, we expect that recurring services revenue will be approximately 60% and product revenue will be approximately 40%. We expect total recurring services revenue to grow at least 50% year-over-year with about $700 million of short term deferred revenue coming from the balance sheet as of July 31. This represents approximately 65% of total recurring services revenue for the year. We expect year-over-year annual product revenue growth of approximately 12% to 13% in the full year 2017 taking into account the challenging year-over-year comparables, particularly in the first half. We expect product revenue to grow sequentially from fiscal Q1 through the remainder of the year and we would expect the lowest year-over-year growth in Q2 and the highest year-over-year growth in Q4. Additionally, we expect higher product revenue growth rates in fiscal '18 given lower comparables relative to fiscal '17. We are planning for DSOs to be in the range of 70 to 80 days for the year as the mix of business shifts towards more subscriptions and support. The effective non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal '17 will be 31%. CapEx for fiscal '17 is expected to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million for the year taking into account the one-time $100 million investment associated with the construction of our new headquarters. Normalizing for this one-time event, CapEx would be in the range of $60 million to $70 million for the year. And, we expect total CapEx will be more heavily weighted toward Q2 and Q3, with approximately 60% of capital expenses falling in these two quarters. Excluding the one-time $100 million CapEx investment in our headquarters, free cash flow margin is expected to be at least 40% for the fiscal year. Including the CapEx for the new headquarters building, free cash flow margin is expected to be in the range of 35% to 40%. And, finally, I would like to note that our Board of Directors has recently authorized a stock repurchase for $500 million effective through August 31, 2018. With that I will turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Just to remind our ladies and gentlemen, you can find the prepared remarks and related slides posted at the Palo Alto Networks Investor site. [Operator Instructions] And at this time we will take our first question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.
Keith Weiss: Thank you guys for taking the question. Mark, you talked about a better macro environment this quarter versus what you've seen in prior quarters. I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on that. And then in terms of the guidance into next year, when we think about a low to mid-teens product revenue growth, should we think about that as a unit volume growth expectation for the overall business that's made up with ASPs, or how should we think about that type of growth rate in terms of garnering incremental share within the broader market opportunity?
Mark McLaughlin: Yeah. Keith thanks. So in the first question on macro size, we said in the last quarter and I think that we saw this broadly across the whole technology industry, there was fairly negative sentiment out there. And we saw that improve in Q4 and we’re happy [indiscernible] that would expect into the future. And we had mentioned a couple of soft spots last quarter as well that one being Australia. We saw very different performance there in the fourth quarter and very excited team who has done a great job for us there, and we see increasingly nice revenue growth rates in APAC as a result. On the product revenue side, when I think about what's happening in the industry with the paradigm shift and really looking at the growth of the platform, right. So we are attempting to build the entire platform. I think when you look at the success of that and the total topline revenue growth of the company, we are outpacing everybody in the industry by very wide margin. And that’s true in every aspect of the platform including the product portion of it as well. We know we're coming off some pretty tough comps through fiscal '17 compared to '16, but we still expect that we would outpace all the players in the industry by wide margin in product as well as for the total platform.
Keith Weiss: Got it so from a competitive standpoint, no change in your view on competitive positioning, versus some of the incumbents?
Mark McLaughlin: Not at all. I think they were doing very well competitively and doing better and better as time goes on. It's pretty evident that I think if you look at the result that customers are really rallying around the idea of a platform for the reasons I mentioned on the call there, I mean this is evolutionary in nature, but I think it's taken up steam. They're really fed up with the cost expense [indiscernible] point products and legacy technology and I think the platform concept for real platform is resonating very well with them. When you look across the board at some of the statistics that I noted and Steffan noted about the growth that's not only on the hardware side of the business, but the attached and non-attached subscriptions side are all growing at very high rates.
Steffan Tomlinson: And I'll just also add on that Keith is, this was the highest new addition of customer logos in the quarter that we've had, which demonstrates that we are taking market share in a meaningful way. And the other point that I would like to make is we're able to monetize our customer base and platform much better than the competition. And if you look at any metric on a revenue per customer basis, and you stack us up against any of the competitors out there, we are multiples ahead of them, which demonstrate the fact that the customer base wants the entire platform both the hardware, each subscription that we sell, the four attached and the four non-attached.
Operator: We'll move along to Brent Thill with UBS.
Brent Thill: Good afternoon. Steffan, just on the bottom line, you posted 440 basis points this year, and you're guiding to 100 organic for next year. Just given the recurring subscription, which seems like it's going to come at a pretty high margin, why such a delta this year from what you put up this year, versus how you're thinking about '17 on organic basis?
Steffan Tomlinson: Well we are running the playbook that we've been running for a long time now. And we updated at our Analyst Day, we have a growth and profitability framework where we're in high growth mode, where revenues are growing greater than 30%. We are focused on growing that top line but also increasing operating margin and what we committed was, we be in 100 to 200 basis points range of annual operating margin improvement which is exactly what we are calling for with our guide. And then we have the incremental benefit from the deferred commissions project which gives us another 150 to 200 bps on top of that, but this is a playbook we are running and we have call it, top high single digit market share and what will be a $22 billion TAM and the platform is resonating so well with customers we are not trying to stretch for profitability at this point. The other point I will make is operating margin is a lagging indicator of the business. People need to be looking at free cash flow as an indicator of profitability in addition to operating margin and we are looking at posting free cash flow margins of greater than 40% on an adjusted basis for the fiscal year. And that was actually the power of the model, and I don’t know of many other companies who are able to post that type of top line growth and those types of free cash flow growth and margin structure.
Brent Thill: Okay, and real quick for Mark, just on the transition to Dave as the new Head of Sales, clearly Mark is still there, so it's not necessarily a traditional sales change that we've seen. But there is also some that are nervous any time a change like this goes down. Can you just walk through the hand off, and in terms of the transition here, and how you see that going?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, sure it’s completely understandable Brent as well. So as we've grown the business and we're running at a pretty big scale right now, whereas you can see from the billings side as well to well over $2 billion and growing very quickly we have to keep trying to invest in advance everywhere in the company to maintain seamless growth and we've been doing that for a long time from people process and business perspective and we’re going to keep doing that into the future. At this size we thought it would be very good for us to have a great professional who has been around the block a number of times to pay attention exclusively to sales and channels, working with Mark in that regard who has done a great job for us for the last four years and has built up a great rapport with the customers and the team as well. And we also wanted to give more focus and capacity, capabilities to Mark for some very important things that we need to do in the future, like driving relationships with strategic [integrators] [ph]. He is going to take on the bulk of the strategic relationships with our cloud partners and business development as well. So we can give more focus and capacity in those areas which are going to be important for us to grow into the future. And of course benefit of that as well as that gives me some more focusing capacity to work on the more strategic things in the company. So I would just look at this as continued increase in focus and capacity and we're really glad to have Dave on the team.
Operator: We’ll now move to Saket Kalia with Barclays.
Saket Kalia: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, maybe just to start off, very nice to see the capital return, with the share repurchase authorization. Mark, we haven't historically seen share repurchase from Palo Alto, so maybe touch on why the change in direction? And more importantly to the extent you can comment, is this something that you think could be done a little bit more regularly?
Mark McLaughlin: Good question, Saket. So we're looking at our business model and where we are as a size of the company today. We’ve got a great model with the platform. Steffan mentioned, has very high free cash flow generation. We expect that to continue in the future as we benefited a lot from that. We had about a $1.9 billion in cash primarily on shore. We're throwing off very high numbers from our free cash flow perspective and we’re going to keep doing that into the future as people adopt the platform. And so with all that in mind, we talk about use of cash regularly and the Board as you want us do and expect us to do. There are always three objectives in that right. One is to make sure that we then invest well into the business, which we're doing. You can see, we've put a lot of money into the business appropriately to continue to get market share at these rates. We also when I make sure we have appropriate amounts of cash that we could action in the M&A that we might find interesting. At any given time we certainly have the capability to do that. And then also, if possible opportunistically to return some cash to shareholders. You can take that into account as well. So at this size, with the kind of cash flow generation we think we can accomplish all this effectively.
Saket Kalia: Got it, very helpful. And then for my follow-up, for you Steffan, just on the accounting change, and you touched a little bit on this earlier, but as we go beyond 2017, and as you hopefully continue to be in high growth mode, should we normalize the 100 to 200 BPs of expansion that we talked about at Analyst Day, or does the accounting change maybe adjust that range with that given growth rate, if that makes sense?
Steffan Tomlinson: We feel committed to the ranges that we talked about at Analyst Day. And so when you look at what we are delivering for FY '17, we are little bit above that stated range because of the impact of deferred commissions. Post '17, because of the amortization you're going to have some of the FY '17 expense hitting in FY '18 etcetera. So we are still committed to the 100 to 200 Bps post FY '17 provided we’re in high growth mode. At some point in the future, as the model indicates, we’ll start delivering more operating margin expansion if and when revenue growth moderates a bit. But we remain confident that we're going to be in high growth mode for years to come and we have a framework that we're running the business to and we want to be very transparent with investors on both the organic improvement and the improvement from the deferred commissions change.
Operator: Sterling Auty with JPMorgan has the next question.
Sterling Auty: Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. You talked about the improved macro in the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about what you saw in terms of linearity in the quarter, relative to what you saw in the third quarter?
Mark McLaughlin: Hey, Sterling. We had a strong July. We would expect that when everybody is into their -- accelerates in the fourth quarter. So it's not unusual to be the case. We did say in the third quarter we saw some more loaded third month in that quarter I think that was really sentiment related, but really nothing unusual from a fourth quarter perspective.
Sterling Auty: Okay, so maybe a bounce back to what you normally see in the quarter? And then just a follow-up, in terms of looking to fiscal '17, what changes have you made around either sell structure, quotas, et cetera, to think about driving some of the subscriptions, especially the standalone stuff like Traps?
Mark McLaughlin: Sterling I am going to hand it over our new President Mark Anderson line today.
Mark Anderson: Hey, Sterling. How are you?
Sterling Auty: Good.
Mark Anderson: So really not a ton of changes. I think we've got a really good solid playbook that drives really good productivity across the Board. We expect to continue to run that. We did a lot of segmentation last year by bringing in a new service provider organization and adding a commercial tier to our enterprise go-to-market. Both of those are tracking well ahead of plan and feel really good about kind of stabilizing FY '17 and beyond with this organizational structure that can really scale for years, I think.
Kelsey Turcotte: Next question?
Operator: Next question will be from Walter Pritchard with Citi.
Walter Pritchard: Hi, thanks. You gave us some color on the Aperture and AutoFocus revenue run rate. I'm wondering on this if you can give us any update around Traps, or any just view as to how you're thinking how the unattached billings performed in FY '16 and how you look at them performing into '17, the unattached subscription.
Mark McLaughlin: The unattached, they're all doing very well. We put out some slide materials as well which I am not sure if you are able to reference, but if you have them Walter or not, but when you get a chance, you can take a look at them. And one of the slide that we dropped in there is really showing the customer adoption rates of all the services right. So that's slide 12 in the deck if you're looking at it. So we're trying to show a number of things there. One is you can see where the services were introduced from availability perspective right and you can see historically over time, after we've done introduction of a service, over the years it has grown very nicely from a customer adoption perspective and it certainly looks like the newer services are tracking in that regard. I mentioned Aperture and AutoFocus have about 100 customers now and the year after launch and that’s growing very nicely. Traps are well over 500 customers now. I think for sure we're hitting an inflection point in that business in the second half of '16. We are getting very, very good feedback from customers and partners on that now and we expect it will be major playing in that business. And the M-series is growing very well too. We have over 1700 customers in the M-series and it continues to grow at higher rates. One of the interesting thing about the M-series as well as if we took what we did in business and I mentioned some of the magnitude on that and look at that in fiscal '16, product wise, it’s not product revenue of course. It is subscription services revenue but that would add a few points of our product revenue in fiscal '16. And then finally, I gave this on the call and the script, but we're running Traps business and VM-Series business each of those are at multiple mid-figure at mid eight figures right now growing at triple digit, and so we're very happy with the progress of all the unattached services and we’d expect that growing over time.
Walter Pritchard: Great. Thank you.
Operator: At this time, we’ll take a question from Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs.
Gabriela Borges: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just a little bit of follow-up on the commentary on product revenue growth rates, if you don't mind. In particular on the comment that fiscal '18 product revenue could accelerate a little bit, I understand the dynamic here with tough comps and easier comparisons, but if you could just give us a little bit of color on how you are thinking about industry growth rates normalizing over that time frame?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, sure. I think when we look at the nature of the industry, if you took like a 10-year view, right, particularly in a borrower market and sort of cyclical in nature and with various ups and downs over time, but regardless of the cyclical nature in that, and if you look at our performance over that period of time, we continue to significantly outperform the market on all aspects of the platform, including like the hardware portion of that is well. And we’re looking at fiscal '17 over '16. We’ve got some pretty tough comps, as you can see, particularly in the first half. We do expect to grow the product revenue sequentially every quarter after Q1, as we said. And we also believe that we’ve got the benefit of our own internal refresh, which is good and increasing over time. And when you look at the cohort analysis of the number of customers into the cohorts, almost 29,000 of the 34,000 customers are after 2012, right? So it’s a very significant uptick post the 2012 cohort as well, and we expect to see that continue to add steam towards the back half of the year and into fiscal '18 and beyond.
Steffan Tomlinson: And putting things in context, our guidance indicates that we’re running roughly three quarters of $1 billion product revenue business in FY '17, which is by far in a way, the largest from a product revenue standpoint versus the competition. And the other thing is we are driving a platform sale. So product, it is an important component, but it’s not the only component. We’ve been driving the business and you’re seeing the impact of recurring revenue coming into the mix in a meaningful way. So it is a platform approach and we’re calling for high growth mode for this year. So the products is one component of the analysis.
Gabriela Borges: That's very helpful color, and as a follow-up if I could, maybe just on the platform approach and the capital allocation, an update on how you're thinking about M&A and what criteria you're screening for, as you think about building that platform, and engaging with customers more deeply over the longer term? Thank you.
Mark McLaughlin: Sure. That’s a great question. We’re very convinced that the platform is the winning strategy. It’s been the case for years now. And our view of the platform is, is that it’s very important that the capabilities are doing a number of things. One is that they’re actually doing something from a security perspective to try to find and stop an attack somewhere in its lifecycle. The second thing is that there is need to each other and what I mean by that is they actually work very, very closely together, so that you get a high degree of automation. And then from that, you can get leverage when you add every new customer in that, right? So every single customer helps every other consumer. So that's really the kind of simplest definition of a platform. And it is way more possible to get that outcome when things are actually under your control and you build them yourselves. Our motion here is to get it to a more than $2 billion run rate in billings, has been primarily to do those things ourselves because we get all three of those very important points from a platform perspective, right? Now that doesn’t mean that there can’t be M&A in the future. It’s possible. We’ve done a few deals like that. We would action that if we thought it was important from a platform perspective and we put something seamlessly into the platform to fit all those definitions into the future, but customers really know the difference. They know the difference when you’re trying to smash things together that you purchased in the market and try to call the platform a pseudo platform. They don’t like the fact that those things don’t really get integrated and they have to be the integrator of those technologies over time and they’re really just rebelling against that. So anyway, the native concept of the platform I think is very, very important. And our primary motion would be to make things ourselves when we can.
Operator: We’ll now move to Rob Owens with Pacific Crest.
Rob Owens: Great, and thanks for taking my question. With regard to Traps, you mentioned the inflection that you've seen in the back half of fiscal '16. What do you think is driving that? Is it broader market acceptance of the technology, was it the last rev, just the market maturation overall?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, Rob. It’s a good question. I think it’s a mix of all those things. But if I had to weigh them, right, I would say that primarily we’re getting better and better and better at this, right? So we've got some competitive advantages here on Traps in and of itself, like every other one of our capabilities in our platform. Our bar we use for that it has to be as good, if not better than any best of breed capability and we're definitely doing that with every release and making it the best possible endpoint protection you can get and AV replacement, right, in three, four, which we just released is a major step forward to this thing ahead on AV replacement, right? The second thing is we want to make sure that we leverage those best capabilities from an endpoint perspective into the network itself. So a unique competitive advantage we have here is it that they’re very tied into, for lack of a better term, the networks to the network and the endpoints are learning from each other and actually being able to do prevention with each other in a highly automated fashion.  And then the third point is the very native integration into WildFire. So we get the leverage from a threat intelligence perspective both to the endpoints and to the networks. Customers really understand that and I think that when they’re comparing them to either a legacy solution that really isn’t working and they know it, they’re choosing Palo Alto more often than not.  And when they compare us to the multitude of next-gen endpoint providers in the market, those providers really can’t stand up to the platform, the power of the platform, and we’re seeing that, like I said, in the second half of fiscal '16 that the team did a fantastic job of growing the customer base, growing the bookings on that and I expect that will continue in the future.
Rob Owens: Great, and then second, some of your competitors started discounting and frankly discounting maintenance in this quarter, as things have become more competitive. So curious what you're seeing, either in terms of what customers are asking for, or a rational competitive behavior out there? Thanks.
Mark McLaughlin: Well, Rob, it’s always been a very competitive market that we live in. And I expect that that’s going to continue and maybe even heat up as we go into the future. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that if you are a legacy firewall vendor, they’re kind of getting down to the last cards you can play. Increasingly, one of those is price. And if you’re a point provider, that maybe the only cards you can play at this point. So we’re definitely seeing very aggressive behavior in the market. Nonetheless, we continue to win at very high rates. You can see from our gross margins, they continue to be very good. So we’re able to sell value. We’re not intentionally, we’re not selling on price. We’re selling on value. And we expect that we’ll be able to continue that into the future, but, people are getting desperate out there.
Operator: At this time, we’ll move to Pierre Ferragu with Bernstein.
Pierre Ferragu: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I have actually a question on like the color you provided on guidance. You started by making reference to where consensus expectations are at the moment, so am I right thinking you have beat your earnings guidance, based on that revenue number of $1.8 billion or so? And then if that's the case, my question would simply be how do you feel about that number? What would be your own perspective on what revenue you can achieve in 2017? Is it a stretch, or like an easy mark? That would be very helpful.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, Pierre, good question. So as you know, we don’t provide annual guidance right and we would not be doing that in the future. But we want to be as helpful as we possibly can from a modeling perspective here. And with the impact of the deferred commissions, it has a good positive contribution to EPS on a full year basis, but it lags itself over the full year, right? So we really, want to make sure that we can be helpful with the models on thinking about what the impact of that would be over the years. So that’s why we wanted to give a full, one-time full year view on what the EPS range could look like. And of course, if you’re talking about EPS and you don’t have some kind of revenue in mind, that’s not very helpful as well. So we just anchored that into current consensus, which we’re comfortable with, and that’s why we did that.
Pierre Ferragu: Okay. And then I have a quick follow-up which is an on the product revenue gross number you gave. Is that like in the same picture, so is that like backing off from this $1.8 billion consensus revenue number, your revenue growth in products would be 12% to 13%, or is that something on which you have better visibility, and it's more of a statement this is what you expect for next year, just on product revenues?
Mark McLaughlin: We considered in the commentary to give some guidance on the EPS related to the current consensus on revenue what we’ve talked about from a product revenue perspective of the 12% to 13% growth rate.
Operator: We’ll now move to Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.
Karl Keirstead: I've got two related questions about the product revs. Maybe I'll start with Steffan. Not to be too short-term here, but it looks like you're guiding to something below 12% to 13% product revs growth for the October quarter. You mentioned it would be lowest in Q1 and increase thereafter. What is it about October that might result in a slowdown in product revs growth from 24% this past quarter to 12% to 13%, because it doesn't appear as if the comp gets that much more difficult. So is there anything else happening, that's causing that and secondly for you, that's giving you confidence that in January, that trend can increase? And then for Mark, I've got a related question. This mix shift away from product to subscription and recurring is not just a Palo Alto Networks phenomenon. We're hearing it across the industry, and it's really picked up in the last six months or so, and I'm wondering if you could give us some perspectives, given your client conversations, as to what fundamentally is driving that shift? Thank you very much.
Steffan Tomlinson: So on the first one, Karl, in the prepared remarks; I had mentioned that actually, the January quarter not the October quarter is going to have the lowest year-over-year growth from a product standpoint. And that’s because Q2 of last year, we posted our highest year-over-year product revenue growth in that quarter at close to 47% year-over-year a year ago. So it’s largely due to the comps and we’re looking at growing revenue sequentially after Q1. And the other thing is when we look at our pipeline view for the first half and the full fiscal year, we see pipeline very strong, the comps get easier in Q3 and Q4 and we look to accelerating product revenue growth at the back half of the year and into FY '18.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, Karl, and the second point, I think you’re spot on for sure. The whole industry is talking about what we’re talking about here, and that’s because of this paradigm shift I mentioned, right, and not to give ourselves too much credit, I think we’re the main driver of that over time. We created a concept of a real platform. We’re assuming services into that platform at a rapid rate and very seamlessly, right? And I think if you’re a point provider in the market today and your capabilities are going away from a hardware perspective, you only have one direction to go, which is try to tournament the services, which people are trying to do. But at the same time, you’re facing those things just being subsumed into the platform. And if you’re a legacy firewall vendor, you don’t have a real platform. Of course, you’re all coming up with the services as far as I can tell. I don’t have all the details, right? It looks like a lot of those folks are trying to bundle them from free as a way to maintain the firewall position. But if they’re not used, right, they’re not very useful. In our case, we know that people are using them. They’re paying us. They’re paying us full boat for those things, renewing them at very high rates which is great and they’re buying it very rapid rates, right? And we can see that across the board from a purchasing perspective, right? Steffan mentioned that in our prepared remarks, in our top 25 customers on lifetime value and I don’t know if you have those charts, but if you get a chance check out number 17, which really is the view that you’ve seen for some time on lifetime value. But we went back and took a look at customers with multi-year purchases as well, right, because multi-year purchases mean they’re committing to Palo Alto Networks and more and more capabilities and for longer periods of time but also, I think people are little worried about it. People are making multi-year purchases, are they gone, right? And what’s happening from buying perspective, on Slide 17 there, even if people are making multi-year purchases, they're making frequent purchases inside that multi-year period, excluding renewals, right? And though they’re continuing to come back and adopt more and more of the platform. And if we look at over a top 1,000 customers and look at all those who made a multi-year purchase just to expand this view for a second and made a multi-year purchase, over 90% of them have made a subsequent purchase after they made multi-year purchase, right? So anyway, sorry, I’ve going on in length here, but I think this whole paradigm shift you’re seeing and you've noted in the entire industry is very important and there is definitely a move into more of these capabilities being delivered in services. And like I said, not to give ourselves too much pat on the back, I think we actually, we invented that and we’re disproportionately benefiting from it.
Operator: We have time from one more question. This will be from Michael Turits with Raymond James.
Michael Turits: Hi guys. Granted the tough comps on product and also mix shift, but is there anything inherent in the market, even if we think of it on a unit basis, in terms of the amount of let's call it boxes to be sold, that would be slowing that growth rate now, in terms of penetration, or greater comps, it's still quite a significant decile.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, Michael, no, I don’t think so. I think we’re looking at the overall numbers that we’re driving if we start with that for a second, right, just what’s happening from wins in the market, we’re always going to start with and try to drive the total revenue rates on the platform. So you can see we’re very committed to high continued, high growth in this. And that includes the product component. And like I said to the earlier question, to the extent that there is cyclical natures and product purchases over time, we’ve outperformed that very handily in any of those kind of environments as well. But mostly, we’re just dealing with tough comps here as we look at fiscal 2017.
Michael Turits: And also Steffan, you had talked about still being on plan for the 100 BPs of organic expansion on plan of 100 to 200, but that's still at the low end of that range. So why this year are we at the low end of that range?
Steffan Tomlinson: Because the market opportunity is so great. We have single digit market share in a $22 billion market. We’re posting topline growth that’s far in excess of all the competition. There’s really no reason to stretch to maximize operating margin in the near term to slowdown the revenue growth. We’ve been driving from the day to the IPO to balance growth and profitability. We’ve been growing way faster than the rate of the market and we’ve been expanding operating margins. So our plan is to continue to do that on a go-forward basis. We’re committed to that, and we look forward to continuing to take market share and increase profitability.
Mark McLaughlin: I think that’s all the time we have. So I’d like to thank anybody for being on the call this afternoon. Just to reiterate, fiscal '16 was a very good year for us. I want to once again thank the Palo Alto Networks team and our partners for all their hard work and their support and particularly our customers as well for their trust they continue to put in us. As we look ahead, we’re more convinced than ever of our ability to continue to take market share and distance ourselves from the competition. We look forward to updating you on that progress in the next call. Thanks, everybody.
Operator: And again, that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation.

And finally, at the conclusion of today's conference call, we will be posting our prepared remarks to our Investor Relations website under Quarterly Results. And, with that, I will turn the call over to Mark.
Mark McLaughlin: Thank you, Kelsey. And, thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon. I am pleased to report that in Q3 we once again delivered record results, significantly outpacing the growth of both the market and our competitors despite macro volatility. Q3 revenue was $346 million, up 48% year-over-year; billings were $486 million, up 61% year-over-year; free cash flow was $151 million, up 95% year-over-year and we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.42. Our results demonstrate not only that security is as important as ever and a priority spending item, but also that we are cementing our leadership position in the market at scale. Customers agree that having the right foundational approach to security is critical. From inception we have been focused on a prevention oriented approach, which we believe is the only way to combat the imbalance between a highly automated adversary and increasingly manually dependent responses. And, we are delivering that approach with a true, next-generation platform that integrates and automates prevention capabilities, is extensible and flexible to address the ever-changing security landscape, provides consistent security in both physical and cloud environments, and leverages the ecosystem effect of our expanding customer base so that our customers do not have to fight this battle alone. This approach has enabled us to continually widen the gap in a highly competitive market. In the quarter, new customer additions were very strong and we are proud to now be serving over 31,000 customers across the globe. Competitive wins in the quarter included, a Check Point and Juniper replacement at one of the largest life insurance companies in the U.S. with our full platform running on PA-7050’s and PA-7080’s, including WildFire, AutoFocus and Traps; a new win with a global semiconductor company where we replaced Symantec and FireEye to secure more than 10,000 workstations and servers with Traps and more than 20,000 users with Aperture; a multi legacy vendor replacement at a U.S. Federal agency to secure their internet access with PA-5060’s, PA-7050’s, and PA-7080’s; and a Cisco replacement at one of the world’s largest hosting companies to protect their infrastructure and ensure security compliance. We also continued to expand the customer lifetime value of our top 25 customers, all of whom purchased in the quarter. To make the list in Q3, a customer had to have spent a minimum of $12.5 million in lifetime value compared to $8.2 million in the prior year period. These wallet share gains underscore that customers understand the mathematical advantage of having an effective prevention capability at each part of the attack lifecycle built natively from the ground up with highly automated outcomes that increase security, reduce complexity, and result in significant total cost of ownership advantages. Customers are securing their environments by adopting all aspects of our platform, especially our subscription services where revenue grew 69% year-over-year. Our overall recurring revenue now represents 53% of total revenue. This trend is very good for the business long-term as it creates revenue visibility and strong cash flow generation, as well as greater leverage over time. Importantly, we are constantly improving and extending our platform capabilities through development efforts and partnerships. On the development side we recently released several updates to our Next-Generation Security Platform, including, augmentation of our universal protection across multi-cloud environments and SaaS applications, including the announcement of integration with Microsoft Azure and enhancements to our VM-Series. Extension of Aperture’s SaaS security to safely enable Microsoft’s Office 365; advancements in certificate and two-factor authentication to help protect user credentials or neutralize them if they are stolen; and, the addition of Mac OS X coverage to WildFire, as well as the reduction in time from APT detection to prevention from 15 minutes to 5 minutes on average. This is a major value proposition in the battle against advanced persistent threats. Our more than 10,000 WildFire customers appreciate the capability set we're delivering to them and how the large and fast growing ecosystem around WildFire is providing them with significant leverage. And, it's not just customers who see the value in our approach, but also partners. Our NextWAVE partner community is thriving with both new and existing partners de-focusing on legacy vendors and shifting their investment to Palo Alto Networks as we become increasingly strategic to each other. Hundreds of these partners attended our third annual Ignite user conference in early April, which brought together thousands of security practitioners to network and share best practices on their use of our platform in the battle for cyber security and breach prevention. And, we are developing new routes to market with global systems integrators and service providers who are building out practices and managed services that will allow customers to benefit from our platform and our partners’ offerings and expertise. For example, we're working with Honeywell Process Solutions to boost the cyber security capabilities of ICT and SCADA systems used in industrial facilities and critical infrastructures. Telstra announced they will be offering Palo Alto Networks as a virtual NFV solution, launching later this year as part of their Cloud Gateway Protection offering on their SDN network platform and Palo Alto Networks and PwC’s Cybersecurity and Privacy practice have joined efforts to design a next-generation security framework that will serve as a guide for customer organizations to establish a breach prevention-oriented security architecture. These efforts and partnerships will help ensure we have the capacity to grow with the market demand for our platform. I am also pleased to announce that yesterday Gartner positioned us in the “leaders” quadrant of the “Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Network Firewalls” for the fifth year in a row. We're well positioned in the paradigm shifts from legacy to next generation, detection to prevention, physical to virtual, and on premise to cloud and I am incredibly proud of our team and their hard work and am grateful for the trust our customers and partners place in us. And, with that, I’ll now turn the call over to Steffan to discuss the financials in more detail. Steffan?
Steffan Tomlinson: Thank you Mark, and thank you all for joining us. Before I start, I’d like to note that except for revenue figures which are GAAP, all financial figures are non-GAAP unless stated otherwise. Demand was strong in Q3, which once again resulted in record revenue, billings, non-GAAP operating margin, free cash flow and free cash flow margin. Core growth drivers in the business remain healthy, as we continue to see broad adoption of our Next-Generation Security platform, particularly our subscription services. New customer additions were robust and we continue to expand customer lifetime value across cohorts. These drivers resulted in Q3 total revenue of $345.8 million, an increase of 48% over the prior year. The geographic mix of revenue for Q3 was 71% Americas, 18% EMEA, and 11% APAC. Compared to the prior year, the Americas grew 56%, EMEA grew 34% and APAC grew 24%. We saw broad strength across a wide range of verticals and did not have any end customer concentration. The three components of our hybrid-SAAS model; product, subscriptions and support all grew well in Q3. Q3 product revenue of $162.1 million increased 33% over the prior year. Growth was healthy across our product portfolio, with strong contribution from the PA-7050 and PA-7080 chassis. Adoption of subscriptions and high renewal rates for both subscriptions and support continue to be catalysts for our recurring services business. Recurring services revenue of $183.7 million increased 63% over the prior year and accounted for a 53% share of total revenue. Looking at the two components of recurring services revenue; the first component is our SaaS-based subscription revenue of $92.6 million, which increased 69% over the prior year. Support and maintenance revenue, the second component of recurring services, was $91.1 million, an increase of 57% over the prior year. Billings in Q3 were $486.2 million, an increase of 61% year-over-year and annual contract duration ticked down slightly sequentially. Total deferred revenue grew to $1.1 billion in Q3, an increase of 77% year-over-year and 15% sequentially, with strong growth in both short-term and long-term deferred revenue. The growth in deferred revenue underscores the power of our hybrid-SaaS model and provides increasing visibility into future revenue streams. Total gross margin for Q3 was near the high end of our target range at 77.9%, an increase of 40 basis points compared to last year and 70 basis points sequentially. Product gross margin was 76.3%, a decline of 10 basis points year-over-year and sequentially. Over time, we expect there will be fluctuations in product gross margin. Services gross margin for Q3 was 79.4%, an increase of 80 basis points year-over-year and 130 basis points sequentially. Services gross margin continues to benefit, in part, from ongoing growth of our high margin subscription services. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was 3,591 up from 3,343 at the end of the prior quarter. We continue to thoughtfully add talent across the business as we scale to support our growth. For the quarter, research and development expense was 10.6% of revenue, decreasing approximately $800,000 sequentially to $36.7 million. Sales and marketing expense for Q3 was 45.3% of revenue, increasing approximately $10.5 million sequentially to $156.6 million. This was primarily due to headcount additions, as well as marketing expenses related to the RSA security conference and our annual Ignite user conference. General and administrative expense for Q3 was 4.9% of revenue, decreasing approximately $1.2 million sequentially to $16.9 million. In total, Q3 operating expenses were $210.2 million, or 60.8% of revenue. Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 17.1%, representing growth of 320 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially. Net income for the quarter was $38.5 million, or $0.42 per diluted share using 91.3 million shares, compared with net income of $20.5 million, or $0.23 per diluted share in Q3‘15. Our effective tax rate for Q3 was 38%. On a GAAP basis for the third quarter, net loss was $70.2 million, or $0.80 per basic and diluted share. This compares with a Q3’15 GAAP net loss of $45.9 million, or $0.56 per basic and diluted share. We finished April with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.8 billion. Cash flow from operations, free cash flow and free cash flow margin for Q3 were $170.1 million, $150.8 million and 43.6% respectively. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $19.3 million. The accounts receivable balance was $267.6 million in Q3, up from $254.4 million in Q2. Reflecting a more back end loaded quarter, DSOs increased sequentially by seven days and year-over-year by 13 days to 68 days. Now, turning to the fiscal fourth quarter guidance and modeling considerations. As we look at the fourth quarter, we continue to see robust pipeline coverage and strong demand and a volatile macro environment. Our guidance takes this into account. We expect revenue to be in the range of $386 million to $390 million, which represents 36% to 37% growth year-over-year against an exceptionally strong comparable in Q4 fiscal '15. And, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.48 to $0.50 per share using 91 million to 93 million shares. Turning to modeling points; first, we have anticipated for some time that seasonality would evolve in the business and this is becoming increasingly evident in our Q1 and Q3 sequential results. Given the current size and scale of our business we would expect this seasonality to continue and to grow over time. Consistent with previous comments, we expect fiscal Q2 and Q4 to show our strongest sequential total revenue growth. We continue to see a mix shift in our business towards ratable services billings as customers more broadly adopt our platform capabilities. As we said previously, we expect to exit Q4 at approximately 18% to 19% non-GAAP operating margin, which represents an approximately 400 to 500 basis point increase year-over-year. We expect CapEx to be in the range of $85 million to $90 million, which includes investments in infrastructure, cloud services and facilities to support the growth of our business. And, we expect free cash flow margin to be approximately 40% for Q4 of fiscal ‘16. With that, I will turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.
Sterling Auty: Yes. Thanks. Wanted to start off with a point that was really a topic of conversation through most of the quarter, which was the duration, because it still looks like a healthy amount of long-term deferred revenue growth, but you mentioned that the duration ticked down. So wondering how we connect those dots? What contributed to the strong long-term deferred with the shortening duration?
Steffan Tomlinson: Well both short term and long term deferred grew very nicely and that is -- that's a phenomenal statement that our customers are making because they want to standardize on us long term. The way that we calculate duration is units based duration, it's not a dollar weighted duration and we use that contract unit duration as a way to manage the business internally because it takes out the variability of any large deals that come in and out of a quarter. So we feel very good about the quality of the deferred revenues. The fact that we have over a billion deferred revenues on the balance sheet, our standard process is to collect the cash up front and that is also a benefit to our model as well and we have very healthy renewal rates. So all those things put together, we've seen both a great increase in short term and long term deferred revenue.
Sterling Auty: Okay. And then one follow-up, Mark, for you. Looking at the example you gave of Aperture and Traps selling in to replace Symantec and FireEye, are you seeing, A, increasing traction with larger deals on Traps in terms of larger production deployments? And B, along with that, are you seeing a better tie ratio, meaning that you're seeing more customers that want Traps and Aperture going in at the same time?
Mark McLaughlin: So in the first point Sterling on Traps, yeah we're definitely seeing continued strong adoption of the Traps and we're also seeing larger deployments as well which is exactly what we would expect over time as we get reference ability and really work our install basis there as well. From a Traps and Aperture, perspective we're seeing good growth in all of our services. So Aperture did well in the quarter too. There is not really so much of a time between Aperture and Traps. There really is a tie in on the concept of location about where your data is and where you have to protect it right. So if data is increasingly moving endpoints, you definitely want to have protection there and we're for sure seeing strong move of folks using third party SaaS applications. So you want have your data protected there and that’s why Aperture is going to do for you. So it all points to the platform from a service respect we're seeing good strong adoption.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Saket Kalia with Barclays Capital.
Saket Kalia: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. First, so obviously another strong subscription billings quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about how much of that strength is coming from getting the existing installed base to turn on more subscriptions, like WildFire, versus the higher attach for some of the new appliances sold versus renewals, if that makes sense?
Mark McLaughlin: Hey Saket, it’s Mark. So as you saw we had a good billings growth of 61% year-over-year. So we're very pleased with that. As Steffan mentioned, it's a great indication that customers are adopting more and more of the capabilities across the platform. We're seeing that in the installed base really understanding the mathematical leverage they get every time they take one more service they are increasing the mathematical probability that prevention is going up for them. We are definitely doing our best job to convince that to new customers when they come in the door we've a very good customer adoption, net new customers this quarter. And we're trying to make that point to those customers as well to take as much as much -- as much of the services as they can, and they want right up front, because it increases that mathematical prevention. So a lot of them are buying services in addition to buying a product. And on the renewal side as you can see as our business grows like this over time, we have a very healthy renewals business. We have very high renewal rates and with a large customer base like this and adding 1,000 plus customers every quarter that's going to continue to feed us into the future.
Saket Kalia: Very helpful. And then for my follow-up, I think we've all heard the pushbacks on stock compensation and share dilution, of course understanding the demand for talent in the Bay Area. But can you just talk to us a little bit about how you can leverage that stock comp line item, and also how you think the Board really thinks about the use of capital when it comes to share buyback?
Mark McLaughlin: Yeah, sure Saket, I’ll take that one as well. So from a SBC perspective as you noted, we're here in the heart of Silicon Valley in a very, very competitive talent environment and we're very fast growing company. So the combination of those two things has meant that to support the growth we're hiring a lot of people and we do that where you're granting them equity to put make them part of the team and that's ownership skin in the game as well along with the shareholders and that is driven stock-based compensation as you can see and I know it's high by the way and high along with some of our very fast growing peers along those lines. As we think about that into the future, the SBC will come down. I certainly expect that to be the case and I would expect that to start next year as a matter of fact. And then as far as using cash for buybacks related to that concept of dilution when you're a fast growing technology company like ourselves, we watch cash all the time, how too much comes in the door and thinking about what the optimal uses of cash would be as a Board and we don't think it's this time the appropriate thing to do to be to be using it to buy back stock.
Operator: Okay. Thank you so much Saket for your question. Our next question comes from Ken Talanian from Evercore ISI. 
Ken Talanian: Hi guys. Thank you for taking my question. If I did my math right and heard your headcount right, it looks like you hired fewer people in this quarter than you did in the last couple quarters. Was wondering if you could give us a sense for how we should think about that uptick going forward and how it might relate to operating expenses from a trend perspective?
Mark McLaughlin: Yeah Ken, so as far as on the headcount side, we've added a lot of people we've added almost a 1,000 people in the first nine months of the year. And we have to continue to add lots of team members into the organization to support the high growth you're seeing 48% year-over-year your revenue growth, 61% billing growth that takes a lot of talent to do that at scale. So we'll continue to hire folks on the team, but we'll also be doing that thoughtfully and we would assume that over time in size that the absolute numbers of people that we hire would come down over time. On the operating margin side the -- we obviously would get less expense for a less numbers of people you bring into the equation, but on the driver for that for us in the short term is really the strong growth you're seeing in subscription services when you're posting up numbers like this on the billing side where subscription is growing at really high rates like that and having that mismatch between the commissions and the ratable revenue on that, that puts some short term pressure on the operating margin.
Ken Talanian: Okay. Great. And if I may, one follow-up. You're somewhat early on with your endeavors on the service provider side. I was wondering if there's anything you could update us with there in terms of your traction?
Mark McLaughlin: Sure, happy to do that. On the service side, we called that out a number of times in the last two quarters. It's something we're very focused. We have been for a while looking at that market as an opportunity and then with every release that we put out the door and introduction of new, introduction of new capabilities particularly in the hardware side ensuring that we have capabilities that will address the very specific needs of the service provider market. And then also organizationally made a change about nine months ago where we created a very specific service provider theater concept, build a theme around that, very aggressive right now, working with service providers and we have a number of design wins coming from that team already. So we would expect that we will get growth into the future on the service provider market which is something we really haven’t touched yet. 
Ken Talanian: Great. Thanks very much.
Mark McLaughlin: Thanks Ken.
Operator: And our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.
Matt Hedberg: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So recurring revenue, obviously strong. I think you mentioned 53% as ratable, SaaS growing 69%. Is there a rule of thumb longer term to think about what the right mix is on ratable revenue? And then I have follow-up question to that.
Mark McLaughlin: Well, it's certainly going to grow over time as our platform is more fully adopted by all of our customers and when you think about what we’ve done over the past several years, we've gone from a couple of subscriptions services now to eight and the adoption rates and penetration rates continue to be very high and the renewal rates for both subscriptions and support are extremely high as well. So you have this compounding effect of the services business which will play out over time. So, we haven't given a long term model around kind of revenue split between services and product, but it should be growing over time and with the call it a $1.1 billion on the balance sheet we have more visibility in future revenue. So, think of it as up into the right. It will be a little bit -- it could be little bit lumpy relative to the traction that we are -- the strong traction that we’re still getting out of our product business.
Matt Hedberg: That's helpful. And then, Steffan, as a follow-up to that, you mentioned seasonality, increased seasonality as we go, and Q3 is a seasonally weaker quarter for you guys. Strong services, but product was a little bit light. And I realize you don't guide to the license component, but I think it grew about 33%. What's the right way to think about that, given that a lot of these subscription services are additive versus cannibalistic to the product side?
Steffan Tomlinson: Well, as you mentioned the 33% year-over-year growth is very strong considering that we’re operating at scale and when you think about seasonality in our business what we’ve always said and now its playing out is that Q2 and Q4 will be our strongest sequential quarters and Q1 and Q3 both on a relative basis just be less strong . In our fiscal Q3 is proxy for like a calendar Q1 but just still being said that’s sort of thing. The other part of your question as it relates to call it subscriptions business we have four subscription services that actually don’t attach to the device. So, there is a separation between the product revenue that we’re bringing in, half of the subscriptions that we offer attached to the device, but half of them do not and the half that don’t, are newly -- relatively newly introduced subscriptions that have a high growth rate trajectory that we’re looking to monetize over time. So, less and less tying of subscriptions revenue to product revenue though it still will be tied, but it's less of the concrete tied then it has been in the past.
Matt Hedberg: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James
Michael Turits: Hey guys. Two drill downs. One, in terms of, Steffan, in terms of, or Mark, in terms of those non-attached subscriptions, which were the ones that really drove things in the quarter? And also, I wanted to see if we could look at the duration question again and explain to us what that unit versus dollar issue was?
Mark McLaughlin: So I will take the first one. I'll let Steffan take the second one, like on the non-attached subscriptions we -- if there is a reminder for our folks who are keeping track, we have Traps, we have Aperture, we have AutoFocus and then we have our VM series. And of those four, the two that are larger than the other two right now mostly because of when they're introduced the VM series and Traps, but all four of them did well in the quarter.
Steffan Tomlinson: So on the duration, as I said on the call the way that we calculated is a unit based duration and it ticked down slightly and I'll try to viewpoint on that is if you look at a dollar weighted based duration, that's something that we track internally, but we haven’t chosen to share that with the street because the way that we manage our business is off of the units based metrics and it takes up a volatility. Now I’ll tell you that if you look at the profile of both the short term and long term deferred growth, they both had extremely high growth rates. Short term actually grew on a dollar basis, greater than long term year-over-year and then the other kind of lens that we look at is if you were to look at a proxy for call it current billings and which is you take our revenue plus change in short term deferred, you're looking at growth rate north of 50%. So all of those things together kind of point a very healthy, both billings and deferred revenue business and the contact duration as measured on a units basis ticked down slightly.
Michael Turits: And then just a housekeeping, did you give the WildFire paid customers this quarter?
Mark McLaughlin: We said Michael it's over 10,000 for the quarter.
Michael Turits: Thanks. Missed that. Sorry. Thank you.
Mark McLaughlin: Yeah.
Operator: Next we have Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley
Keith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and nice quarter. I think the questions that I'm getting after hours is really on the deceleration in the product revenue from Q2 to Q3 and guys just really asking me the question, has anything changed in terms of the competitive environment or the macro environment out there to cause that slower pace of growth? You talked about seasonality. I see in the results that Asia Pac seemed to have slowed down a lot. So maybe to ask the two questions, one, from a competitive standpoint, anything change to slow down that rate of product revenue growth, or from a geographic or macro standpoint, anything change in the macro environment that caused Asia Pac to slow down like that?
Mark McLaughlin: Hey, Keith, it's Mark. So let me take the competitive question first. On the competitive front, we haven’t seen anything different from the competition and the way we always think about that is will fall on the two buckets. Technology and marketing we care more about the technology buckets and the marketing bucket, both are important. But on the technology side we haven’t seen the competition do anything technically interesting there that will cause us any concern. I think you can see that also reflected just kind of as a proof point on very strong new customer ads, very strong lifetime value increases, strong attach rates, strong penetration rates. Everything was working well there from that side. So on the marketing side we continue to see people be very aggressive from a pricing perspective, but that’s an environment we've lived in for quite some time. On the macro side, we did mention that we’ve seen from the beginning of the year, the calendar year a lot of macro volatility and what I mean by that is there is same covering around out there whether there is a price of oil or what’s going to happen with interest rates, China, the stock market being up and day down and I think from a sentiment perspective of our customers it has them more cautious then they had been in the past and they’re doing more inspection on deals, it's taking longer from a deals sales cycle as they look at -- as they look at different things, different number of times. And also in some cases trying to did you with less today that they can in the future. So, a bit obviously in a better environment or macro environment those things can't go away. So -- but that’s we saw on our guide implied a sequential decline as we thought about that from beginning from January and as you can see from guide going forward, it's against a very, very strong comp of course but we took that macro into account when we provide Q4 guide.
Keith Weiss: Got it. And then maybe just one quick follow-up, in terms of the linearity in the quarter. Anything unusual in terms of linearity through the quarter and as strongly as it began?
Mark McLaughlin: We see on a -- yes, so as you can see we had a back ended loaded quarter there Keith on what we saw in more getting done in April then we usually see historically and I think that’s very tied to where we are saying on the macro sentiment of people just taking longer to get deals done. Team did a great job bringing the business in April. So we're very proud of that, but we did see -- we did see a different looking April than we had in the past.
Keith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you very much, guys.
Mark McLaughlin: Thanks Keith.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Co. 
Gregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thank you very much and good afternoon, guys. I just wanted to touch on the number of customers, and you mentioned over 31,000. But unless there's significant rounding involved, that would seem to imply some degree of slowdown in net adds versus what you've been showing over the past several quarters, and just wondering if there's any additional color you can provide on the rate of new customer acquisition this quarter as compared with historical periods?
Mark McLaughlin: Yeah Greg, there is a rounding going on there, just using round numbers when we report these, but no slowdown at all that the number was well over 1,500 in the quarter so closer to 2,000.
Gregg Moskowitz: Okay. That's helpful, Mark. And then just as a follow-up on Keith's question, because I noticed also Asia Pac growth, at 24%, was lower than we've seen in some time and just wondering if there was anything particularly pronounced from a macro standpoint or anything else that you would call out there?
Mark McLaughlin: Yeah we did see some in different places in the world we saw some of this what I would call the macro sentiment impact and one of them was in Australia for Asia is about 24% year-over-year growth as you saw, what we saw in Australia that was concern I think from customers in that environment they're very tied into China. China's got a cold where they get the flu. So there's from a specific area Australia we saw some weakness there in the quarter. We also saw the Middle East having some concerns around the price of oil and budgets being reset by governments and companies over there as a result of that. So that was an area as well, but generally you can see strong growth in the topline numbers, the billing numbers in our most mature market the Americas at 56% year-over-year growth so very strong there.
Gregg Moskowitz: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Owens with Pacific Crest Securities. 
Rob Owens: With regard to the July quarter and what's coloring your guidance, can you talk a little bit about velocity of business versus large deals and what you're seeing in the pipe? I know you said there's some modest extension, as people are looking at deals more closely right now. But just curious, as we look at the fourth quarter here versus what you've seen traditionally, how does it look from a velocity perspective versus a big deal perspective?
Mark McLaughlin: Rob, I think just as a general matter where we've seen very strong velocity in the business and at the same time associated with that, we are continuing to work with larger and larger companies on bigger and bigger deals when you look at our penetration and well over a 1,000 and above 2,000 now in the high 80 percentage range on the Fortune 100. And as we get to work with bigger companies like that, we're going to get to work with them on larger deals as well. So from a fourth quarter perspective it's always a seasonally strong quarter for us and we would expect that to be the case here. We are working against all the monster comp, if you recall, we had a fantastic color on fourth quarter last year, but we're also taking that macro into account when we set that guidance.
Rob Owens: And secondly, you mentioned success with a federal agency. And as we look at some of the newer opportunities that Palo Alto's getting into, whether it be government or critical infrastructure and SCADA systems, which you've mentioned, or service provider, what do you think can provide the most upside over the next six months to 12 months, just in terms of the overall business and monetization of some of these newer opportunities? Thanks.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes sure, as you've seen it from our business when we've shown you every year at our Analyst Day the vertical penetration we have we're a very horizontal business and I would like to see that personally and running the businesses because it shows one we don't have used exposure anywhere and two, we have a useful capability to all verticals. So that continue to be the case by the way. We’ve seen increasing interest in business in the federal space. You can definitely see everybody great team together there. About two years ago they were really performing well and it takes a very long time to crack into that market, but when you're in you start to perform better and better if you're doing something useful for the customers. So we see that service provider which I just mentioned a few minutes ago is an area we're putting a lot of attention of focus and we think that that will go well up for us and just as a general matter in the enterprise space with large companies, the attention to focus that Mark has put into the major accounts and global counts, that organizationally has really been paying off dividends for us and we would expect that to continue as well.
Operator: All right. Thank you. And our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi.
Walter Pritchard: Hi thanks. Thanks. Mark, I'm wondering if you can talk about specifically the VM series, and there was, I think, some notion that depending on if customers deploy VM versus an appliance, the rev impact is different. Did you see any unexpected volatility in the mix between the VM series and the appliances in the quarter?
Mark McLaughlin: Just for background from what Walter is talking about is with our VM Series depending on how the customer takes it either perpetual license or non-perpetual is going to fall in category of product versus subscription services, that's basically the background for the question. The VM Series has continued to perform very well for us including in the third quarter. But the breakdown between the perpetual and non-perpetual has been consistent and we didn't see any big swing there.
Walter Pritchard: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Mark McLaughlin: Thanks Walter.
Operator: Next we have Ryan Hutchinson with Guggenheim.
Ryan Hutchinson: Thanks. So I appreciate the color on duration and deferred. My question is back to billings, as a percentage of revenue, it's the highest it's been in any given quarter, with billings accelerating year-over-year to 61%, but revenue guidance is in line. I'm trying to get a better understanding of the relationship between billings and revenue, especially as the adoption of software and subscription services increases as a percentage of the overall mix. So the question is, as we look forward over the next, call it, 12 months, will billings as percentage of revenues stay or improve off these higher levels? Any color on how to think about the change in the model and the relationship between the two would be appreciated. Thanks.
Mark McLaughlin: When you think about the relationship between the two, it all starts with the concept of mix and over the last couple quarters at our Analyst Day we devoted a fair amount of time giving insight into how that mix has been shifting. In the first half of the fiscal '16 that mix was 63% services, relative to where it was the first half of '15, which is 58%. So you're starting to see that that shift over time. So billings is increasingly benefiting from higher adoption rates of all of our subscription services and higher renewal rates of both subscriptions and support and that as a percentage of the business is growing and you're seeing that with the percentages that I just mentioned. And by the way in Q3 that mix shift continued in the direction of favoring subscriptions. So the relation between billings and revenue should continue to have a separation, that should continue to grow over time, because those -- the services billing that go on to the deferred revenue side of the house will come off ratably whereas the product revenue that's associated with those billings is shrinking as a percentage of the total. It's still growing in terms of absolute dollars, but on a percentage mix standpoint it's decreasing. So on a relative basis, billings and specifically services billings should be outpacing the rate of product billings over time and that same or similar proportion relates to revenue as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill with UBS.
Brent Thill: Thank you. Mark, there's a lot of metrics that we probably aren't really accustomed seeing from you guys. You saw a spike in the AR, DSOs shot up. I think you mentioned sales cycles are extending. We know there's some seasonality, but what do you think happening? You mentioned it's not really competitive, so are you just pinning this all to macro, or is there some type of overall customer behavior maybe you haven't seen for a while? I'm just trying to understand if they're saying, hey, we're going to with you, but we're just taking a little more time or having trouble getting funding. What was the common denominator or the customer conversations during the quarter that caused those dynamics which you haven't really seen in the past several quarters?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes just to be specific from a dynamic perspective Brent, what I was saying was that the one metric you can look at there with DSOs being higher, you can see we had a more backend loaded quarter in April than before and the reason for that we believe we believe is we're very engaged with the customers is them taking longer to get approvals for deals. I think I might use this term volatility before as a lot of things that play out there, but it ultimately boils down to sentiment right about how the customers feel about things and I think that sentiment in that environment has been cautious from January and it continues to be that case. And they're putting more attention and focus on what they're going to spend and how they prioritize that. I think in a very good way as you can see from a lot of other companies reporting in the IT sector and what they’ve reported and how they felt about the future security I think obviously remains at the top it's a priority spend item. How do we see customers taking longer to get the deals approved as are getting checked two or three times in a row just to make sure that they want to spend their money.
Brent Thill: Just to be clear, were deals, did you slip deals to the fourth quarter, given how back-end loaded it was, that you were anticipating those to come in Q3?
Mark McLaughlin: Brent, we're doing 1,000,1,000, 1,000 of deals this size right now as a company. So in any given quarter we're going to get cautious across quarters in the last month. So we saw that but that’s no different than what we've seen for some time now.
Brent Thill: Okay. Thank you.
Mark McLaughlin: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Kim with Imperial Capital. 
Michael Kim: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Just going back to international, can you talk about the progress on your go-to-market initiative, especially around channel enablement? And then just aside from the macro volatility, is that changing your pace of hiring or where you're shifting your resources by GO?
Mark McLaughlin: That’s a good question Michael. So from a channel enablement perspective one of the things for sure we're seeing across the Board is in the channels whether it's distributors or whether its reseller or even distance integrators, we’ve achieved the size in the market and continue to have very, very high growth rate where everybody is paying attention to that and they want definitely want to have call it the networks as a place where they're going to investing and take in that high growth. So we’re delighted with that of course as we have to continue to add capacity to do that. We’re doing that on a global basis as well and we’ll stay very focused on that as well  So from a headcount perspective, we're always watching resources lies where we're going to put resources. We've obviously started the year with the plan off of what the assumptions would be. As we progress through the year depending on the ROI we're getting out of this places headcount wise we may shift heads around into places with higher productivity. So that's a dynamic thing for us. We don’t try to just set a statistic thing beginning the year and play with it, no matter what’s happening, but there is headcount rates. As I said earlier they're high and they remain high from a sales perspective just because the demand is obviously there and we want to make sure that we have the people and the place where we can satisfy the demand.
Michael Kim: And are you seeing a significant difference in the purchasing patterns of some of the international customers versus what you typically would be seeing in the Americas?
Mark McLaughlin: No, it just stands on a couple countries and this is every quarter we're going to see something in different places like that world is never filing on all cylinders at all times. As I said I think a little earlier in this quarter, areas where we saw a more weakness than usual was the Middle East that was pronounced and I think as the price of oil has been so volatile and lower than I think many of the governments and then companies have set their budgets against as they have to reset those things and look for cost savings that we saw in the Middle East, we saw that in couple of the oil producing regions of Canada and then we saw not associated with oil, but just political stability issues in Brazil and we saw some weakness down there as well.
Michael Kim: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.
Karl Keirstead: Hi. A question for Steffan. I know you don't guide to product revenues, but given your macro commentary and the fact that you've got a 10% tougher compare, I suspect many on the line will end up modeling that product revenue for 4Q in the perhaps low to mid 20%. As we model that line item, besides macro and the tougher compare, anything else that you'd encourage us to keep in mind?
Steffan Tomlinson: I’d encourage you to really kind of look at the mix shift in our business. Well we don’t guide as you said specifically on product revs. The implied guide would call for a sequential increase in product for sure, but I think where some of the modeling has been off base has been the contribution from the subscriptions and services side of the house. So, when you look at the guide that we gave off of a extremely tough comparable last year, there is going to be healthy growth in both product and services, but the mix I think you should really take a look at. So I would say look at the mix patterns and take into consideration what we've said as a company around how that the power of the platform is playing out.
Karl Keirstead: Yes. Makes sense. Thanks, Steffan.
Steffan Tomlinson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Catharine Trebnick with Dougherty.
Catharine Trebnick: Thank you very much for taking my question. Nice quarter. Mine is on endpoints. Could you give us a little commentary on within the security budget what you're seeing is a concentration towards endpoints, and then do you think you believe you have the right product at this time to tackle that piece of the market? Thank you.
Mark McLaughlin: Sure, hey Catharine, it's Mark. Yeah so from an attention perspective, end points of very high attention, it’s pretty obvious to customers that legacy technologies are really not working that well for them and I think as a result of that, there has also been a shift of influence on those budgets as well up the chain into the CSO office of the CI office as well. We like that a lot by the way because we are really trying to operate at those levels with a two platform approach that when we can get into this CIO, CSO, CTO level conversations, those folks are thinking about how do I protect no might higher enterprise, and that higher enterprise consistent of all the data and that data is all over the place right. So our story and our reality of being able to deliver in the story of the platform as we can protect the data everywhere including at the endpoints. Now from how you do that to your second part of your question, we think that a prevention oriented approach is a right one, just as we done at the network level very successfully in the past and we think that’s the right approach to the end points as well. And that’s what Traps does. It's a very prevention oriented approach because its tied into WildFire, it also provides the advantages of having your network and endpoint understand each other from a fed perspective and then also very significantly because its hid into WildFire, you also get the ecosystem of everything that we're finding from our customer ecosystem as being updated not only at the network level but at the end point level of course as well. So we think we’ve got the right technology to solve a very important problem and that problem is growing in awareness and attention for customers. 
Catharine Trebnick: Well, a follow-on to that, Mark, who do you guys typically see in a bake-off for some of these endpoints and do you think you're winning more of the bake offs and less of bake offs. Thanks.
Mark McLaughlin: We’re doing well in the bake offs Catharine. It’s a very, very busy market right now here in the endpoints space. So almost in every case that you're involved in you have the legacy provider in there and then you have a very, very long list of “next gen endpoint companies“ who are showing up trying to compete there. I think we're doing very well in that competitive environments for the reasons I said, which is in addition to say we do something very important which is actually prevention of the end point, nobody think can match the follow on statements we're saying and it works with your network and you get these advantage of having 30,000 some plus customer and ecosystem working for you from a threat intelligence perspective at the endpoint level as well.
Operator: Thank you so much and our final question is from Scott Zeller with Needham & Company.
Scott Zeller: Thanks. Just looking for a little more color regarding the 4Q guidance, given the comments earlier about the seasonality, saying F2Q and F4Q are the strongest, it appears that the guide is conservative for the fiscal fourth quarter.
Mark McLaughlin: Well what we said Scott is that from a seasonality perspective we expect Q2 and Q4 to be stronger sequentially as you've noted and that would continue to be the case from the guide perspective. I know as I said a little earlier, we’ve taken into account that guide, not only they're really, really strong comp that we're working up against, but also the macro environment working in as well.
Scott Zeller: Thank you.
Operator: That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Mark McLaughlin for closing comments.
Mark McLaughlin: Thanks operator. Appreciate that. Thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. We’re all very excited here at Palo Alto Networks about the future and I want to thank our customers, partners and entire Palo Alto Networks team for their hard work and support in the third quarter and we look forward to updating you for the fourth quarter results in about 90 days. Thanks a lot.

Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Kelsey, and thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon. I'm pleased to report that we had a very strong fiscal second quarter. In the quarter, revenue grew 54% year-over-year to a record $335 million. Billings grew 62% year-over-year for $459 million. Free cash flow grew 93% year-over-year to $136 million; and we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.40. I'm very proud of our results for the quarter and the teams continued hard work in delivering on our mission to secure the digital age. Security remains a top strategic priority for global enterprises and organizations, as they realize that without a significantly improved security posture it is likely that the productivity gains from the digital age are at risk. With this backdrop, it is evident from our results that we continue to capture mind share and market share at very high rates as we become the primary go-to security partner for enterprises globally. There's a paradigm shift underway as legacy point products that are primarily reactive are rapidly giving way to our next generation platform that not only provides superior proactive security, but also simplifies networks and reduces the total cost of ownership. We are unique in having this platform. And as a result, customers are standardizing on Palo Alto Networks as their security architecture. We see this in new customer additions, continued strong lifetime value growth and rapidly accelerated adoption of our subscription services. In Q2, we added close to 2,000 new customers and are proud to now be serving over 30,000 customers across the globe. Some examples of wins in the quarter include becoming the Advanced Endpoint Protection standard for one of the world's largest consulting and business services companies, where we replaced McAfee; replacing Check Point in a very large U.S. retailer for both data center and in-store security; and beating Cisco as the standard for company-wide security at one of Europe's largest agricultural producers, as well as at one of the Middle East largest government agencies. Our technology differentiation, best-in-class customer satisfaction is also reflected in the continued expansion of customer lifetime value. To make to our top 25 customer lifetime value list in Q2, a customer had to have spent a minimum of $11.4 million in lifetime value, compared to $7.4 million in the prior year period. Also, as an indication of the rapid expansion inside our customer base, 24 of our top 25 customers made a purchase in the quarter as they continue to invest in the complete platform. The consistent increases in lifetime value demonstrate that not only are customers adding more of our products into their architecture, they're also quickly accelerating adoption of the recurring revenue subscription services that maximize their prevention posture. The result is strong momentum across our hybrid SaaS model. For example, as of the end of the second quarter, we now have over 9,000 customers use WildFire, including over half of the Fortune 100. We saw the fastest ramp in sales in our history for a new service on our platform with AutoFocus. We had another very strong quarter and our largest quarter ever for Traps, where sales and new customer additions continue to validate the power and prevention capabilities that come from our platform approach with protection at all stages of the attack lifecycle, from the network to the endpoint. We continue to expand our presence in the data center and service provider market with both our PA-7050 chassis, as well as our new PA-7080 chassis. We also had the largest quarter-to-date for Palo Alto Networks edition for NSX, the joint solution of our VM-Series and VMware's NSX. Our success here demonstrates our unique platform capabilities in the cloud. And as we mentioned last quarter, we now serve well over 1,000 customers who utilize our VM-Series offering. Finally, we substantially expanded our presence within an existing customer, a large financial services company, where we became the security standard for their software-defined data center strategy in which almost all of our services were adopted. Our plan to drive high growth, capture market share and have all companies adopt all of our platform capabilities is working. In fact, in Q2, we saw faster adoption of the subscription services capability to the platform than we anticipated; and our second half pipeline review at this stage indicates continued strong adoption of our entire platform, especially subscription services. Very few companies have been able to sustain this level of growth at our scale, and we know the effort it takes to deliver results so they consistently outpace the competition. Our go-to-market capabilities and demand generation, field marketing, sales, partnerships and customer support are world-class. I was particularly pleased and proud of the fact that in the second quarter we were recognized by J.D. Power's and the Technology Services Industry Association for exceptional support services, further evidence of the teams commitment to delighting our customers, which results in a strong competitive advantage for us as we displace existing legacy providers globally. And we continue to expand our partner ecosystem, including our recent announcement with Proofpoint where we've teamed up to share intelligence on sophisticated attacks, enabling the creation of automated and coordinated protection across our next generation security platform and Proofpoint's targeted attack protection and social patrol capabilities. As we look forward, we know there is concern in the macro environment. While we do, of course, monitor that closely, some observations early in the quarter are that our customers continue to indicate that security is a strategic issue and hence a priority spend category in calendar 2016. Our pipeline is at a record high. Our executive briefing center continues to run at very high capacity. And our partners and sales teams around the world are well-trained in proving that a true platform allows customers to not only have a superior security posture, but also superior ROI total cost of ownership savings since the platform simplifies your network and results in fewer vendors. Also, I'd like to welcome Frank Calderoni to our board of directors. With more than 30 years of business and financial experience, including his current role as Executive Vice President Operations and Chief Financial Officer at Red Hat, as well as his previous role as CFO of Cisco, Frank brings a wealth of experience and a unique perspective to the board, and we are very happy to have him. We look forward to seeing you at RSA next week at an Analyst Day in early April. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steffan. Steffan?
Steffan C. Tomlinson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Mark, and thank you all for joining us. I'll start by first covering the results for Q2. Then we'll describe the business trends and the financial model, and we'll conclude with Q3 guidance and modeling points. I'd like to note that except for revenue figures, which are GAAP, all financial figures are non-GAAP unless stated otherwise. Q2 total revenue grew 54% over the prior year to reach a new record of $334.7 million. The geographic mix of revenue for Q2 was 68% Americas, 19% EMEA, and 13% APAC. Compared to the prior year, the Americas grew 56%, EMEA grew 38%, and APAC grew 67%. We saw broad strength across a wide range of verticals and did not have any end customer concentration. The three components of our hybrid SaaS model – product, subscriptions, and support – all grew well in Q2. Q2 product revenue of $169.9 million increased 47% over the prior year. Growth was healthy across our product portfolio. In particular, the PA-7050 and PA-7080 chassis continue to help accelerate growth in the high-end data center market. Recurring services revenue of $164.8 million increased 62% over the prior year and accounted for a 49% share of total revenue. Looking at the two components of recurring services revenue, the first component is our SaaS-based subscription revenue of $84.3 million, which increased 68% over the prior year. Support and maintenance revenue, the second component of recurring services, was $80.5 million, an increase of 55% over the prior year. Billings in Q2 were $459 million, an increase of 62% year-over-year. Total billings for the first half of fiscal 2016 were $847 million and grew 62% year-over-year. First half product billings were $315.3 million and grew 44%, accounting for 37% of total billings. First half support billings were $250.4 million and grew 72%, accounting for 30% of total billings. In first half, subscription billings were $281.3 million and grew 77%, accounting for 33% of total billings. Renewal rates remain high and contract duration modestly increased to just over two years. Total deferred revenue grew to $928.8 million in Q2, an increase of 73% year-over-year and 15% sequentially, underscoring the power of our hybrid SaaS model and increasing visibility into future revenue streams. Total gross margin for Q2 was near the high end of our target range at 77.2%, a decrease of 60 basis points compared to last year and a decrease of 70 basis points sequentially. Product gross margin was 76.4%, a decline of 70 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points sequentially. The sequential decline was due in part to product mix. Over time, we expect there will be fluctuations in product gross margin. Services gross margin for Q2 was 78.1%, a decrease of 60 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points sequentially. The sequential decline was due in part to investments in WildFire and AutoFocus as well as customer support. Total head count at the end of the quarter was 3,343, up from 2,998 at the end of the prior quarter. We continue to thoughtfully add talent across the business as we scale to support our growth. For the quarter, research and development expense was 11.2% of revenue, increasing approximately $3.5 million sequentially to $37.5 million. The increase was primarily due to head count. Sales and marketing expense for Q2 was 43.7% of revenue, increasing approximately $16 million sequentially to $146.1 million. This was primarily due to our strong Q2 billings performance and the associated sales commissions. G&A expense for Q2 was 5.4% of revenue, increasing approximately $400,000 sequentially to $18.1 million. In total, Q2 operating expenses were $201.7 million or 60.3% of revenue. Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 16.9%, representing growth of 450 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially. Net income for the quarter was $36.3 million or $0.40 per diluted share using 91.7 million shares, compared with net income of $16.9 million or $0.19 per diluted share in Q2 2015. Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for Q2 was 38%. On a GAAP basis, for the second quarter, net loss was $62.5 million or $0.72 per basic and diluted share. This compares with a Q2 2015 GAAP net loss of $43 million or $0.53 per basic and diluted share. We finished January with cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $1.6 billion. Cash flow from operations, free cash flow, and free cash flow margin for Q2 were $153.8 million, $136.4 million, and 40.7%, respectively. Capital expenditure in the quarter totaled $17.4 million. The accounts receivable balance was $254.4 million in Q2, up from $196.4 million in Q1. DSOs decreased sequentially by one day and increased year-over-year by nine days to 61 days. With the Q2 recap completed, I'm now going to provide some perspective on the momentum we've been seeing in the business year-to-date and an update to our target model for exiting Q4 fiscal 2016. We have been and we remain committed to driving growth and profitability, and the growth engine has never been stronger, as evidenced by new customer additions, expansion in current customers, and continually increasing sales productivity. Billings, revenue, and deferred revenue are very robust and have far exceeded the rate of the market growth and our competition. With our hybrid SaaS model, we have delivered top line growth with expanding non-GAAP operating margins and generated significant free cash flow. Customers are increasingly buying all elements of our platform, which has been our strategy and has long-term benefits for our financial model. As a result, we're in a good position to exceed our internal sales expectations, particularly in the rate of services adoption, which you can see in the billings mix, which is now 63% services for the first half of fiscal 2016 compared to 58% for the first half of fiscal 2015. Over performance in billings, which drives the mix towards ratable services, means higher deferred revenue and higher free cash flow. It also means incurring 100% of the commissions' expense in period against the higher ratable revenue, and, as a result, slower near-term growth rate of non-GAAP operating margins and EPS. As we head into the second half of the fiscal year, our pipeline is at record levels and indicates strong year-over-year growth in product billings, and with the faster rate of subscriptions adoptions, the pipeline indicates continued over performance in services billings relative to our original forecast. For this reason, we're making two updates to our full-year guidance. First, given the timing mismatch of higher services billings and ratable revenue with higher in-period commissions' expense, we now expect to exit Q4 at approximately 18% to 19% non-GAAP operating margin, which represents approximately 400 basis point to 500 basis point increase year-over-year. And because of the over performance on billings, we are increasing free cash flow margin estimates to approximately 40% for Q3 and Q4 of fiscal 2016. We continue to refine our target model, which will call for increasing our long-term profitability targets, and we look forward to sharing it with you at our Analyst Day on April 4. With less than 10% market share in an $18 billion total addressable market, barring any systemic macro issues, we are well positioned to continue to deliver strong top line growth and profitability. Now turning to the fiscal third quarter guidance and modeling points. We expect revenue to be in the range of $335 million to $339 million, which represents 43% to 45% growth year-over-year. And we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.41 to $0.42 per share using 90 million to 92 million shares. We are starting to see some moderate seasonality in our business with fiscal Q2 and Q4 showing our strongest sequential revenue growth. And we continue to expect CapEx for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $85 million to $90 million, which includes investments in infrastructure, cloud services and facilities to support the growth of our business. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. Also, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. And our first question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.
Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. I know you've mentioned the momentum in the business, but, you're right, everybody is very concerned about the macro. Can you give us maybe a little bit of color by some of the major theaters, Europe versus North America; are you seeing any lengthening sales cycles or anything else to be concerned about on the macro side?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Sterling. It's Mark. A couple of anecdotal points there. One, in the quarter itself, we have January in the quarter and the linearity for the quarter was exactly the same as historical precedent. So we didn't see anything happen in the quarter that would raise any concern around that. I travel around all the time myself globally. I had the chance in January to be not only in Europe, but in Asia as well. And all the places that I went to, the customers that I talked with said that security remains a priority spend item for them as well. So we haven't seen anything to indicate that what we're seeing in the stock market means anything about the macro economy yet, but we watch that closely.
Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. And then one follow-up, on the product gross margin, can you maybe give a little bit more color there? You mentioned the mix, but in the prepared remarks you were kind of highlighting the higher end solutions is having particular strength. I would expect that to be good for product gross margin.
Steffan C. Tomlinson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It is good for product gross margin. But remember, as I've highlighted in the past, whenever we come out with a new chassis or a new product, there is usually a slightly depressive effect on near-term product gross margins because we haven't achieved volume. So costs are a little bit higher than they will be on a go-forward basis. That's definitely true with the PA-7080, which was introduced a relatively short time ago. So even though we saw a very strong contribution from our higher end products, there was a slightly depressive effect until we get to scale.
Operator: And our next question will come from Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Steffan, if we could go to the 4Q operating margins and the decision to lower the guide somewhat, I just want to make sure I understand. I feel like Palo Alto Networks has been over performing on the billings actually for several quarters now and you've been able to meet roughly the non-GAAP operating margin guide and expectations. So what's changing in 4Q? Is it that you expect a particularly strong billings performance as a result of a good subscription attach? Or maybe is some other element in the model changing that sort of didn't give you the lever to offset it? Maybe a little color would be helpful. Thank you.
Steffan C. Tomlinson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure thing, Karl. What we're seeing is customers adopting all elements of our platform, which is very positive for us. In fact, the attach rate concept that we've introduced over the last few years is becoming less and less relevant mainly because now we have seven subscriptions that we are selling; and three of the newest ones are Traps, AutoFocus and Aperture. So with the adoption of the overall platform, we are looking at outsized billings numbers; and that's driving incremental billings. So because those subscription services are effectively deferred revenue and they become ratable revenue. We have 100% of the commissions that we are getting in period. So with the mix shift happening, that's what you're seeing. And so kind of bridging from, call it, 22% at the low end of our range to roughly 18% to 19%, the vast majority of that is commissions; and there's a little bit relative to the mix.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Helpful color. Thanks a lot, Steffan.
Steffan C. Tomlinson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah.
Operator: And our next question will come from Rob Owens with Pacific Crest Securities.
Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities: Great, and thank you for taking my question. So if we look at the billings strength, you did see a shift to more long-term contracts. And is that just a function of the environment right now and people are locking in? I would think given the speculation of weakening things it'd be going the other way, so just a little color. And I realize it was a modest extension duration, but you long-term did show some nice outperformance relative to the expectations.
Steffan C. Tomlinson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, we are seeing customers standardizing on our platform. They want to go with multi-year. The net effect of that for contract duration was actually very de minimis, just a modest uptick. If you look at the actual dollar growth from a short-term deferred revenue standpoint, short-term deferred actually grew more in terms of dollars than long-term. So we're seeing a nice pickup in both short-term and long-term. But to your broader point, customers want to standardize on the platform of choice and they want to be locking in for a number of years. That's all good for us.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Rob, and this is Mark. That's exactly what we've always wanted to occur and we hope to continue to drive that in the business where folks are making these architectural decisions with Palo Alto. And there I think the market's really starting to realize that the more the prevention capability that they adopt, the better their prevention gets. And you can see that with the growth in subscription services.
Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities: And for my follow-up, just want to touch on the partnership with Proofpoint. And I guess at a higher level, the concept of threat intelligence and where you guys are sharing back and forth, is there an opportunity for you to monetize some of this threat intelligence? Or as a solutions vendor, is it a given that your products should inherently lever this knowledge to increase efficacy?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: That's a great question, Rob. And I get that from customers all the time. So big picture is the way that we monetize intelligence is in the platform itself. I mean the platform is a high proactive prevention capability. And the more intelligence we have in the platform, the better job we do at that. So with that in mind, we have an insatiable desire for threat intelligence and being able to partner up with Proofpoint to have everything they're seeing from an e-mail gateway perspective is beneficial for us and vice versa for them. Really interesting, when I'm talking to customers, I have a lot of customers who are telling me that they think the day of security vendors trying to monetize intelligence is long over. And they're very upset with security vendors who come in and try to sell them intelligence as a service, where they're trying to monetize that. And I think that's going to change pretty rapidly into the future where you just better be able to take intelligence and put it in your platform for your products and do something with it for the customer; and that's where the value proposition will lie.
Operator: And our next question will come from Michael Turits with Raymond James.
Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Although, obviously, with that mix shift, you've – less than the expected EBIT margin on the exit rate, but really strong guidance at the 40% of free cash flow margins. So two questions. One, if we look out long-term -and I know you said that you'd address that at the Analyst Day – do we return to kind of reasonable amounts of growth in the EBIT margin? And also, is there anything unusual in those 40% free cash flow margins or is that sustainable and is that something we should see expansion in?
Steffan C. Tomlinson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, as we indicated in the prepared remarks, longer term, this business will generate much higher EBIT margins, as we call them operating margins here, over the longer term for sure. The dynamic that you're seeing now is given that there's more adoption of services and you have higher services billings, because of the commissions expense being hitting in period, as the revenue is coming off the balance sheet, that's going to be accretive to margins down the road. So this will be a building margin story. I think one of the most important things which you've highlighted, Michael, is we just grew free cash flow 93% year-over-year and we're basically looking at very high free cash flow margins. Many companies have a correlation, a near-term correlation between operating margin and free cash flow. If operating margins are coming down on a growth rate basis, free cash flow typically comes down. That's not the case with Palo Alto Networks. Because of our powerful hybrid SaaS model, we are actually delivering much more free cash flow than operating margin, and we feel very good about the overall growth engine in the business.
Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So as I said, just via follow-up, just to clarify anything, it's strong, but, I mean, as we look forward, is there anything that is one-time of nature in those 40% free cash flow margins? Maybe what happens with cash taxes? How should we think of that trending over time to the extent that you can help us out there?
Steffan C. Tomlinson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. We'll give you more color commentary on the convergence of free cash flow margin and operating margin over time. But for the foreseeable future, call it the next at least three years, there should be a pretty wide separation, positive separation, between free cash flow and operating margins. Over time, those numbers will converge because we will become more of a cash taxpayer, and that will – that plus a couple of other things will see the spread narrow. But for the foreseeable future, there should be a pretty wide spread between free cash flow and operating margin.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: And, Michael, it's Mark. There is no one-time aspects in the free cash flow numbers you're looking at right now.
Operator: And our next question will come from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray.
Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hi. Thanks a lot, and congrats on the nice quarter. Maybe just to start, I had a question on product revenues. So it was up 47% year-over-year, which was not only an acceleration from last quarter, but also one of the strongest growth rates we've seen with the exception of fiscal Q4 of last year. But your total customer count continues to go up by about the same amount, in that 2,000 range. So is product growth coming from a hardware refresh cycle within your installed base, or are they just purchasing more of your products within your platform?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Andrew. Yeah, you can see product growth or platform growth – generally, right, and then product growth since that was your specific question is going to come from a number of areas. One is continued customer acquisition. You saw almost 2,000 new customers. That's a great land engine for us, and that continues to drive the entire platform, including products. So that's very healthy. The second thing is expansion inside the existing customer base. As we get bigger and bigger, more and more of our business will come from expansion opportunities instead of the – or in addition to the land opportunities. Expansion is going very nicely, as well. And then, the third is we're growing a very large base of business here as far as customers, all with products and all of whom would at some point will refresh those things. When we think about what that can look like into the future using sort of a five-year rule of thumb on refreshes, that would take us back basically to the 2011 cohort. If we added up 2009, 2010, 2011, it's about 4,000 customers total across those three cohorts, which means there's 26,000 more after 2011. And when we throw in close to 2,000 customers a quarter on top of that, that's a gift that just keeps giving into the future.
Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): That's great. Thanks. And then just a follow-up. If we go back to your comments in fiscal Q4 of last year, you said that Traps would be a material contributor to revenue in FY 2016. I'm wondering if you could put any parameters around that in terms of what we should expect now that we're in the back half of the year?
Steffan C. Tomlinson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. Yeah, so what we said was we thought it would be like a more material contributor to the overall business, and we've seen that. We've seen a record quarter for Traps in terms of billings. However, because it's a subscription-based revenue model, revenue will be coming off the balance sheet coming into the P&L. So that is more of a future growth driver for top line revenue. It's definitely been a more meaningful growth driver for billings, but it's coming off of a relatively small base. So we feel very good about the endpoint business. It helps complete our platform story. And we'll give you more color at Analyst Day about customer accounts and that sort of thing, but there's been very nice traction there.
Operator: And moving on to Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse.
Sitikantha Panigrahi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, guys. This is Siti Panigrahi for Phil. Congrats on another awesome quarter. I just wanted to drill into the subscription business. Good to see solid growth there. Last time, you gave subscription attach rate around 2.2% per box. Just wondering if you have any update on that, what you're seeing there. And also, one of your new subscription, just wondering what kind of feedback you're getting on AutoFocus? That would be great.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, great. This is Mark. On the attach rate side, attach rates are good and growing. We'll give you more color around that at Analyst Day in about 35 days or so, but the attach rates continue to do very well. And then, on the new services, which are in the order of history they're Traps, AutoFocus, and Aperture. Traps, Steffan just spoke to, continues to do very nicely for us. AutoFocus you may have heard, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've enjoyed the fastest sales ramp in the history of the company for a new service with AutoFocus. So there's great demand for that. And a very strong pipeline for Aperture as well, as people continually get interested into the CASB space for third-party applications. And I just want – hearkening back to the attach rate thing as well, and we'll discuss this in more detail at Analyst Day. As we continue to have more services that don't have attach rates on them, we'll talk through how that impacts the concept of attach rates, that I think will become increasingly irrelevant to the business over time. And we're just thinking more in terms of billings or subscription billings on this service because it's how much dollars that comes in that really matters.
Sitikantha Panigrahi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.
Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets: Yeah, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Another one on Traps. It sounds like there was a nice McAfee AV replacement in the quarter. I'm curious, do customers normally replace their anti-virus solution completely with the Traps install? And I'm wondering if you could talk about the drivers for adoption versus legacy solutions. Is it cost, is it better prevention, or maybe a combination of the two?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Matt. It's way more about security than it is about cost. So folks are more and more realizing that if you're thinking about security and prevention, which is what they want to do, where the data is, a lot of data is at the endpoint, and that's one of the easiest ways to get into the network, as well, as AV continues to be less and less relevant there for them. So on your first question, folks want to, I think, more and more want to replace AV, not because it's so much they want to get rid of AV, but they just want to have security that would actually work for them. In the cases where we've seen people who said I have to have or really want to have AV, it's become more and more places that have to do that for compliance reasons or audit reasons, and they're doing something additive on top of that. But the primary driver there is security. The other interesting thing that we hear a lot, and it's really analogous to where we started in the firewall space and in all the other components that made their way into networks over time because stateful inspection firewalls weren't working for them as they built more and more complexity in the network, is the same thing on the endpoint. So people, they're not interested to add one more agent onto the endpoint. They have a lot of them there. So the same kind of simplification for better security that would result in better total cost of ownership, but primarily simplified on the endpoint of better security is a driver. And it's very analogous to what we saw when people said, hey, I don't want firewall plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, right? They want the simplicity of the network and better security. So it's working just on the endpoint as we thought it would, and we have a lot of experience in selling that kind of concept from our network genetics.
Matthew George Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets: That's great. And then, Mark, I think you called out the PA-7080 box in the prepared remarks. Could you talk about some of the performance benefits there versus some of the other high throughput boxes? And how are yours holding up under pressure now that they are under increased traffic now that you've got some more history there?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Well, the PA-7080, so everybody knows that's our latest chassis. It's a 200-gig throughput, and it has 10 slot cards in there, right? So that's what it looks like. And it's pretty exciting in the data center and service provider space because it is very high throughput. But even more important than the high throughput, it has all of the security capabilities that Palo Alto's known for now from a prevention perspective. So you get the best of both worlds with all those prevention capabilities and increasingly a higher throughput with none of the degradation of performance that you get with stateful inspection firewalls when you have to turn on various concepts that really reduces those throughputs. So one of the favorite angles for competitors is to talk about faster and faster and faster stateful inspection firewalls, partially because they have to, because every time you turn on one of these other cobbled-together capabilities for IPS or filtering or APT or something like that, it seriously degrades the performance in the first place; and that's something that we don't experience because we have a single-throughput engine. So we've gotten really high marks in the market so far for this.
Operator: And moving on to Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.
Melissa A. Gorham - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. This is Melissa Gorham calling in for Keith. Mark, I just have a high-level question. So the growth is clearly pretty impressive, are very impressive on the billings line. And as you look across your universe, it seems like some of your peers are seeing decelerating growth. So it does seem as though potentially your share gains are accelerating. Is that the right way to think about it? And how much runway do you think that you have in terms of share gains within the core network security market?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. That's a great question, Melissa. Couple of angles or ways to think about there or at least the way we think about that. And if you start with the size of the addressable market, as you know it's very big, and us at high single digits or about 10% market share, there seems to be a lot of runway from an addressable market opportunity capture perspective. And then inside of that, who is capturing what, right? So there's money here, it's up for grabs. I did a simple math experiment the other day just because I saw some third-party numbers on market share, and they tend to be kind of confusing to me because it's really hard to tell who's doing what there. So what I did was I took five vendors – Palo Alto Networks, Cisco, Check Point, Fortinet, and Juniper – and using the last calendar reported quarter, meaning this one for us and their fourth quarters for everybody in fourth quarter, I added up the year-over-year increase in revenue across all five of those vendors; and the total amount of new revenue across all five of those vendors was about $300 million. That's the total, right, of pie that everybody added. And inside of that, Palo Alto is about $120 million of the $300 million, okay. The average is $58 million, roughly $58 million if you do the math. So we're about $120 million of that, right? And I can give you the other numbers if you care about that. But I think it's very obvious that we're taking share from everybody in the space in order for those kinds of numbers to work out that way.
Melissa A. Gorham - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's actually – that's really helpful. And then just one quick one on the federal opportunity. There's definitely more of a push from the administration on enacting cyber security laws and also incorporating more into the budget. And I know there's nothing necessarily concrete today, but can you just give us a high-level overview of what you're seeing in terms of federal traction and then what you're expecting in terms of growth?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Our federal business is good and growing. So it's a market we like a lot, not surprisingly, given what our technology does and what the government more and more needs and recognizes they need. A couple of things that are interesting, you noted that – or I think you were noting that recently President Obama came out and called for a 40% increase in cyber security spending. You will see what happens with that. That's a request, not an order, right? So we'll see what happens with that. But obviously if there was that amount of spending there, it's $5 billion of additional dollars if it comes into the federal budget, specifically for cyber security. And on the same day he announced that, the Director of National Intelligence said that cyber security is the number one national security issue facing the United States, right? So I think the amount of attention from the government on cyber security is very, very high and could even be higher. But more interesting than that, they're really trying to put their money where their mouth is here with some of these announcements of what we have to do to take legacy architecture across the federal space and get it into next generation platforms, you could really do prevention.
Operator: And the next question will come from Ryan Hutchinson with Guggenheim.
Ryan Hutchinson - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Great. Thank you. Steffan, my question is on billings. I know you don't give guidance, but one way to look at it is as a percentage of revenue. It stands at 137%, which is the second highest ever outside of Q4 last year. So given we're going into a seasonally weak period, obviously offset by some subscription attach rates in this platform play you've alluded to, is this trend sustainable? Any color there would be helpful. Because basically you can look at this one of two ways. If it turns back towards more of an average of where you've been over the last eight quarters, billings will be down sequentially. If you look at the other way, the trends flat to slightly – flattish, let's call it, billings actually could be flat to slightly up? So that would be my question.
Steffan C. Tomlinson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Okay. Yeah, so because we don't guide on billings, I can just give you kind of directional commentary. It would be candidly be a surprise to us if we went backwards on billings on a sequential basis. The power of the platform, the pipeline that we have, you look at how the setup is for Q3 and Q4, even though we are in a relatively seasonally weak quarter in Q3, we are still looking for growth. And so that would be my answer. I can't give you a rule of thumb relative to where billings in revenue is. But with more subscriptions being adopted – and I'll parse that out – more being attached and then more of the three subscriptions that we are selling without being attached, there should be good growth there.
Ryan Hutchinson - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Okay. So it'll grow sequentially is what you're telling us?
Steffan C. Tomlinson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Directionally.
Ryan Hutchinson - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question will come from Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities.
Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC: Yes. Just first off on the duration. Steffan, can you give us a heads-up on where that was last quarter or the year ago quarter?
Steffan C. Tomlinson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes, it was shy of two years last quarter. And I'd have to pull up where the year ago quarter was, but there has been – we've been calling out that there's been a modest uptick in duration. But quarter-on-quarter, we're talking it's measured by in the couple of months type of thing. So not a very big move up in duration.
Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC: Okay. And then on the services growth, is that driven more by the installed base going back and up-selling or is that equally driven by new products going into new customers?
Steffan C. Tomlinson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It's a combination of both. But what I can tell you is we've seen fantastic opportunity going back into our installed base, selling them more elements of the platform. They are adopting a lot more subscription services than they have in the past, both the ones that attach to the devices and in the new subscriptions. So proportionately, given the fact that we have, call it, 30,000 customers, or heading into this quarter, we've got 28,000 customers, the pie is much bigger there than the new customers that are being brought into the fold. So the expansion opportunity is definitely bigger than the new opportunity. The up-sell and cross-sell that we are able to do is a testament to our go-to-market functionality that we've put in place with Mark Anderson leading the charge there. We've been able to really put in programs to monetize the accounts.
Operator: And our next question will come from Jonathan Ho with William Blair.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Congrats as well on the strong quarter. I just wanted to understand you guys talked a little bit about strength in your NSX business. I just wanted to get a sense from you or some additional color in terms of what may be driving this as well as maybe what you're seeing in the data center market?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Jonathan. It's Mark. Something we've seen for a while and I've mentioned it before is that when customers are thinking about security there, you're thinking less and less around topology and more around data and prevention, right? So what they want to do is make sure that they have this best prevention posture they can have wherever the data is. So when you think about where is data going, a lot of – more and more and a lot of it's going into public and private cloud environments and next generation data centers, right?. And when that's where it's going, we want to make sure it's secure; and that's I think partially what's driving a lot of strength in NSX itself, right? And then with our relationship with VMware with the integration of VM-Series in there that's better and better that they are going to do in that space, and they've been reporting pretty good numbers there. That's a great opportunity for us as far as where we can hunt along with them to provide the security.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. And then can you talk a little bit about sort of the investments that you're making on an international basis, whether you're sort of pleased with the performance that we're seeing out of EMEA and APAC, and just sort of what you think those regions, the potential could be over time?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, we're pleased with the international performance. You can see, if I back away from that for a minute that just the North America which is continued powerhouse for us. So it's fantastic to see a business of the size of North America continue to grow at the rate that it's growing. I think that just shows how much demand there is still in a mature market for Palo Alto with single-digit market share. And then, when we look internationally as well, we're seeing strong international growth. I think you can see in our numbers there, we had a very strong quarter in APAC quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year, and we also had a good quarter in EMEA, as well. As we continue to make investments in various areas, we expect to continue to grow these businesses, and our market share in those markets is even lower than it is in North America today. So there's even more upside.
Operator: And our next question will come from Fred Grieb with Nomura.
Fred T. Grieb - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hey. Thanks, guys. First up, going into RSA, can you discuss customer interest in WildFire versus Traps? I know for a few years APT has sort of been a top priority for CSOs, but is there any chance you're seeing the shift towards the endpoint this year?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Fred. I think – I'll make a prediction. It's RSA, and it's always dangerous to make predictions, but I think you're going to see at RSA this year a lot more folks than just Palo Alto talking about prevention. Last year, we were talking a lot about platforms, and people came around to that thinking right away from a marketing perspective. And I think you're going to see a lot more people trying to market around prevention now that we've shown that that's the right approach to this philosophically. And when you're doing prevention, you have to do it everywhere, right? Wherever the data is, as I was saying, a little earlier. And I think there will be a lot of focus and conversation around endpoints, given that prevention historically has been pretty weak there. And that's why people are adopting Traps so rapidly. So I would expect that to be the case. On the WildFire side, while thinking about advanced persistent threats and threats and how do you take an unknown threat and turning it into a known threat, that's as relevant as it ever has been. It's probably going to be incredibly relevant into the future because it's the unknown threats are the ones that are going to get you, and that's why people are adopting WildFire so rapidly, as well.
Fred T. Grieb - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Got it. And then, maybe can you provide a little bit of background on why it made sense to partner with Proofpoint instead of bringing to market your own solution?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, Proofpoint's an email – primarily email security company, right? So they're sitting in front of an email server or gateway with their technology, and that's messaging security. So if you parse out the whole security industry, messaging security is separate from traditional network security. We're just in different markets with very complementary capabilities. Things that come through email are interesting to us from a threat perspective because sometimes it's the first place you see something, and there's obviously a lot of phishing attacks and things like that. So getting the ability to gather the information from a threat perspective from somebody like Proofpoint and put it into WildFire makes WildFire very powerful. On the flipside, for them as well, everything that we're seeing from endpoints and networks that are related to threats that they in turn can use to make their technology smarter about the threats, as well, makes sense, too. So it's a very symbiotic relationship.
Operator: And next question comes from Gur Talpaz with Stifel.
Gur Talpaz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So as customers migrate workloads into the public cloud, have you seen any sort of pick up in interest for the VM-Series for AWS? And then, I guess, more broadly speaking following up, how do you feel about AWS and public cloud adoption more broadly impacting your business? Thank you.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Gur, it's Mark. Yeah, so for AWS, I think we mentioned in the last call that we had – well, on this call, we mentioned we had over 1,000 of our customers and growing using our VM-Series, right? So start with that as sort of the baseline. And then, the VM-Series capability in use and integrated at different places is growing well, too, like NSX in a private cloud environment. I think last quarter we said we had over 100 customers currently using our VM-Series and AWS, and that's growing, too, and we'll update you all that – on those kind of things at Analyst Day. So what we're seeing, again, is folks saying where is my data, and I need to protect it. And we don't want security to be an inhibitor about where the data can be. So if it's going to the public cloud, and workloads, a lot of times developers just put it up there, and the security guy doesn't even know about it yet, right? Those are the kind of things that worry security people. So they're going to make sure that they can – they want to make sure that they can secure those things. On the general question of AWS as a platform versus security, AWS is doing a lot and will do a lot to secure the platform itself, right? But from a security perspective of things like applications and network connections back to the ones who are consuming this stuff, the enterprise who consume this stuff, that's not something that they do, and I doubt that they will, because that's where companies like Palo Alto Networks have spent a decade honing prevention capabilities. And that's why having a capability in AWS is very powerful.
Operator: And next will be Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Co.
Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you. Thank you very much. Mark, I'd like to go back to your comment on AutoFocus being the fastest ramp of any Palo Alto subscription. My understanding is it's sold per security operator. And because of that, I was always wondering how big would this market be, and would it just be relevant to a fraction of your very high-end customers? So is the strength that you saw mostly a function of high ASPs, or are you also seeing pretty broad customer uptake out of the gate? Anything you can do to sort of help size the AutoFocus opportunity would be helpful.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, sure. So if I back up for a second, just say for AutoFocus, list price that is $35,000 a year per operator, right? So think of this as a tool that an operator would look at and get highly correlated, relevant intelligence that can give them things to do proactively about threats in their network based on everything we're seeing from 30,000-plus other networks today and growing. So that's what it is, right, and that's the price point today. As I noted, that is the fastest growing service we've ever had, which is fantastic. I think the appetite for people to want to do proactive prevention is very high, and the ability to bring that kind of hardcore correlated analytics to bear is interesting. It's been interesting to large companies and medium-sized companies, as well. So what we've seen so far in selling is that people understand it very quickly. Now in the base of customers, large companies are going to have a lot more operators than small companies. So we have seen, and we expect to see some companies will buy one of them – from a license for one of them for one operator, and larger companies will buy multiple licenses for multiple operators. So the early view on this is it's got a very wide applicability.
Operator: And our last question will come from Jayson Noland with Baird.
Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks for fitting me in. Mark, I wanted to ask about non-perimeter defense. Palo has a network segmentation gateway. Others have talked about their internal segmentation firewall. What are your thoughts on this market today, and what should we expect down the road?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I think segmentation is very important and customers want to do that. And I think they're going to try to do it and basically should do it everywhere they can. So they may do segmentation on internal networks from a user perspective and segmentation of data on externally facing servers and data centers, and that's a good idea. I really don't think there's any correlation between the two from how many, what are your needs internally versus what your needs are going to be externally. There's no correlation about doing more in one area is going to reduce it in others. It's just a good hygiene idea to do segmentation wherever your data is. And the more they want to do it in the internal, that will drive internal business. The more they want to do external will drive the external business. But I wouldn't think of that as an either or, I think of that as both.
Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned the seven subscription modules earlier. In calendar 2016, is the focus on ramping some of these newer modules versus launching new modules?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: It is. So what you've seen us do in the past is be thoughtful, I – we think we're thoughtful. Hopefully you would agree with this, but be very thoughtful from a platform perspective that does prevention as to what should be in the platform, right? So we're not attempting to roll up the security industry just to have a lot of stuff. What we are trying to do is to make sure that when we think about the attack lifecycle and every chance we can get to interdict an attack before it can ultimately be successful across the lifecycle, can we have a very good and increasingly better and better and better prevention capability at every one of those points. And that's really the philosophy that's driven the company in our entire roadmap over last 10 years and will into the future. So we would, I'd expect, that we would have more services later as the attack landscape changes. And we'll definitely want to make sure that we are wherever the data's going to be.
Operator: And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I now turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Great. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us this afternoon. I'm really excited about the future, and I'd like to thank our customers, partners and the whole Palo Alto Networks team for their hard work and support. And we look forward to seeing many of you at Analyst Day in April. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for your participation today.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Palo Alto Networks Fiscal First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Kelsey Turcotte, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kelsey Turcotte: Great. Thank you very much. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Palo Alto Networks fiscal first quarter 2016 financial results. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed on the Investors section of our website at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. With me on today's call are Mark McLaughlin, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Steffan Tomlinson, our Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon we issued a press release announcing our results for the fiscal first quarter ended October 31, 2015. If you'd like a copy of the release, you can access it online at our website. We'd like to remind you that, during the course of this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our financial outlook for the fiscal second quarter of 2016, the spending environment and market opportunity for our products and services, demand for our products and services from both new and existing customers, certain financial results and operating metrics, our growth rate, operating leverage, ability to expand market share, product and service development, and the timing and impact of new releases, expected benefits of our partnerships and our competitive position. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. For a more detailed description of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on September 17th, 2015, and our earnings release posted a few minutes ago on our website on the SEC's website. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. Historical periods, we have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in the supplemental financial information that can be found in the Investors section of our website located at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. For planning purposes, we expect our second quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings conference call to be held after the market closes on Thursday, February 25. We'd also like to inform you that we will be presenting at the Credit Suisse 19th Annual Technology Conference on December 2nd, the Raymond James Technology Investors Conference on December 7th, the Barclays Technology, Media and Telecommunications Conference on December 9th and the 18th annual Needham Growth Conference on January 13th. And finally, at the conclusion of today's conference call we will be of posting our prepared remarks to our Investor Relations website under quarterly results. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.
Mark McLaughlin: Thank you, Kelsey, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. I'm pleased to report that we had a great start to fiscal 2016. In the first quarter, revenue grew 55% year-over-year to a record $297 million, while billings grew 61% year-over-year to $388 million. These are the highest first-quarter year-over-year growth rates we have reported since going public. Our Q1 non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 16.7% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.35 more than doubled year-over-year. We continue to post industry leading growth rates at scale for a number of reasons. First, security remains a strategic consideration embedded in virtually every IT decision for both fundamental and new requirements, like cloud and mobility. As a result, the demand environment remains very healthy, and as we look ahead, we expect this to continue to be the case. Second, legacy products continue to give way to true next generation technology. It is increasingly evident to organizations globally that retrofitted legacy technology is not the same as purpose-built next generation security capabilities. And third, point solutions continue to give way to prevention platforms. Customers and prospects understand and appreciate the high value associated with the only true platform in the market that natively provides prevention, as opposed to the alternative of legacy products or point solutions, which cannot provide prevention and add more complexity and cost. As a result of these factors, Palo Alto Networks has established itself as the leader in next generation security. This is increasingly evident in our size, continued rapid market share gains, and global brand recognition, as customers respond well to our vision and technology. We are very proud to now be serving over 28,000 customers across the globe, who are choosing Palo Alto Networks as their strategic security partner for the future. And we're not resting here. We know that our success is due to our intense focus on solving the hardest security problems for the most demanding customers. With this in mind, we are always improving our prevention platform and capabilities, further distancing ourselves from the competition. Some examples of these efforts include our continued momentum in the APT prevention space, as evidenced by the fact that we added the second highest number of new WildFire customers in the company's history during Q1. We now can count well over to 8,000 WildFire customers, including over half of the Fortune 100. The introduction in August of PA 7080, our 200-gig chassis. We are very pleased with early customer reception and the PA 7080 was the cornerstone to several large Q1 deals. The September launch of Aperture, our new service that is designed to safely enable the use of sanctioned SaaS applications, and AutoFocus, our threat intelligence service that is designed to provide real-time correlation and relevance for threats across our large and growing customer base. Interest in both is high, and we are pleased to see these services being adopted in Q1 by multiple customers across diverse verticals. We also continued to execute well in the endpoint security market with Traps. Customers such as a US-based media conglomerate and a European specialist in financial services adopted Traps in Q1, because of our unique endpoint prevention capabilities. Customers and prospects appreciate the power that comes from our platform approach, with protection at all stages of the attack life cycle, from the network to the end point. We believe no other competitor can match these capabilities, and we feel very good about our position in the quickly-evolving endpoint space. And we are leading the way in providing next generation security for customers, regardless of whether the deployment model is on prem, in private, public, or hybrid cloud environments. Our pioneering work with the virtualization capabilities of our VM series has led to good growth, and we now have over 1,000 customers utilizing our VM series offering, and strong demand for our cloud offerings with partners such as VMware for NSX and AWS for public cloud deployments. Reflecting this strong demand environment, we continue to see customer engagements increasing in number, scope and size. For example in Q1, we conducted over 140 executive meetings at our briefing center in Santa Clara, the highest number ever for the company. And again, we added well over 1,000 new customers, including one of the world's largest software companies based in EMEA, where we beat Check Point, among others, for their global security business, a high profile US government agency that adopted Traps for next generation endpoint deployment in a very competitive bake-off, and where we also sold AutoFocus; one of the largest biopharmaceutical companies in the world, where we replaced Check Point and beat Cisco in a seven-figure data center deal, and a large US-based financial services company where we beat Cisco in a seven-figure global perimeter deal. Our technology differentiation and best-in-class customer satisfaction is also reflected in the continued expansion of our customer lifetime value. To make our top 25 customer lifetime value list in Q1, a customer had to have spent a minimum of $10.1 million with us in lifetime value, compared to $6.1 million in the prior-year period. Also, as an indication of the rapid expansion inside our customer base, all of these top 25 customers made a purchase in the quarter, as they continued to invest in our next-generation security platform. It takes a lot to win, expand and service customers in such a rapid growth trajectory at this scale, and we have always been and continue to be intensely focused on effectively scaling our business. This includes our people, where we continue to attract the best talent in the industry to work at Palo Alto Networks. In Q1, we added more than 350 team members across the organization. Our partners, where we continue to expand our global coverage model, with some of the largest most respected channel partners to provide our customers with the best sales experience and value-added services. These relationships are very important to us, and we see our partners as an extension of our sales team, and a reflection of our culture and values. Our go-to-market capabilities, where we continue to execute against the large market opportunity in front of us, with the world's best demand generation, sales and marketing professionals, and our customer support teams, who continually delight our customers with the best service and support in the industry. We are serious about our mission as a company to prevent cyber attacks, in order to maintain our way of life in the digital age. We are grateful for the trust our customers place in us, and the opportunity to do something very important for them, and we are cognizant that our success is based on having the best people and technology in the world. Looking ahead, we feel very good about the state of the business. The spending environment remains robust. The market opportunity is significant and growing, our pipeline heading into Q2 is healthy, and we are confident in our ability to continue to execute against the opportunity and widen the gap between us and the competition. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steffan.
Steffan Tomlinson: Thank you, Mark and thank you all for joining us on our call today. Before I get into the details of our results and guidance, I'd like to note that except for revenue figures which are GAAP, all financial figures are non-GAAP unless stated otherwise. Q1 was a very good start to fiscal 2016, with both revenue and profitability increasing nicely. Revenue growth accelerated year over year, and significantly outpaced the growth rate of the competition, reflecting broad receptivity to our next-generation security platform, and momentum in our scalable go-to-market structure. There were a number of growth drivers, including robust new customer acquisition, expansion in existing customers, and strong demand across the entire portfolio of products, subscriptions and support. These growth drivers resulted in record revenue and deferred revenue, and strong non-GAAP operating margin expansion, and free cash flow generation. I'm pleased with our execution and remain confident in our ability to continue to take market share. Now, let me turn to the numbers. Q1 total revenue grew 55% over the prior year, to reach a new record of $297.2 million. The geographic mix of revenue for Q1 was 71% Americas, 18% EMEA, and 11% APAC. Compared to the prior year, the Americas grew 60%, EMEA grew 40%, and APAC grew 46%. We saw broad strength across a wide range of verticals, and did not have any end customer concentration. The three components of our hybrid SaaS model: product, subscriptions and support, all grew well in Q1. Q1 product revenue of $147.7 million increased 46% over the prior year. Growth was healthy across our product portfolio. In particular, the PA 7050 and PA 7080 chassis continued to help accelerate growth in the high end data center market. Recurring services revenue of $149.5 million, increased 65% over the prior year, and accounted for a 50% share of total revenue. Looking at the two components of recurring services revenue, the first component is our SaaS-based subscription revenue of $73.6 million, which increased 69% over the prior year. Support and maintenance revenue, the second component of recurring services, was $75.9 million, an increase of 61% over the prior year. Billings in Q1 were $388 million, an increase of 61% year over year. Total deferred revenue grew to $804.5 million in Q1, an increase of 71% year over year and 13% sequentially, underscoring the power of our hybrid SaaS model, and increasing visibility into future revenue streams. Total gross margin for Q1 was at the high end of our target range of 75% to 78%, at 77.9%, an increase of 110 basis points compared to last year, and a decrease of 40 basis points sequentially. Product gross margin was 76.7%, an increase of 160 basis points year over year and a decrease of 110 basis points sequentially. The sequential decline was due in part to product mix. Over time, we expect there will be fluctuations in product gross margin. Services gross margin for Q1 was 79%, an increase of 40 basis points year over year and 20 basis points sequentially. Services gross margin continues to benefit in part from ongoing growth of our high margin subscription services. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was 2,998, up from 2,637 at the end of the prior quarter. We continue to add talent across the business as we scale to support our growth. For the quarter, research and development expense was 11.4% of revenue, increasing approximately $3.9 million sequentially, to $34 million. The increase was primarily due to headcount. Sales and marketing expense for Q1 was 43.8% of revenue, decreasing approximately $6.7 million sequentially to $130.1 million. This was primarily due to a decrease in sales commissions related to our strong fiscal '15 year-end performance. General and administrative expense for Q1 was 6% of revenue, increasing approximately $2.4 million sequentially to $17.7 million. The increase was driven in part by consulting and outside services related to projects in the G&A organization, as well as headcount additions. In total, Q1 operating expenses were $181.8 million, or 61.2% of revenue. Q1 non-GAAP operating margin was 16.7%, representing growth of 610 basis points year over year, and 260 basis points sequentially. Net income for the quarter was $31.6 million or $0.35 per diluted share, using 90.7 million shares compared with net income of $12.8 million or $0.15 per diluted share in Q1 2015. Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for Q1 was 38%. On a GAAP basis for the first quarter, net loss was $38.7 million or $0.45 per basic and diluted share. This compares with a Q1 2015 GAAP net loss of $30.1 million, or $0.38 per basic and diluted share. We finished October with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.5 billion. Cash flow from operations, free cash flow and free cash flow margin for Q1 were $146.7 million, $127.2 million, and 42.8% respectively. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $19.5 million. The accounts receivable balance was at $196.4 million in Q1, down from $212.4 million in Q4. DSOs increased sequentially by four days and year-over-year by three days to 62 days. Turning to guidance, in Q2 fiscal '16, we expect revenue to be in the range of $314 million to $318 million, which represents 44% to 46% growth year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.39 per share, using 91 to 92 million shares. Before I conclude, I'd like to highlight a number of considerations for modeling purposes. Due to continued strong growth, seasonality has been difficult to forecast, but we believe that fiscal Q2 and Q4 will show our strongest sequential revenue growth. We continue to expect to exit Q4 fiscal '16 at a 22% to 25% non-GAAP operating margin, which was the target range and date we set at the time of our IPO in 2012. To achieve this objective, we continue to expect sequential non-GAAP operating margin expansion, with the majority of the acceleration into the back half of fiscal 2016. The effective non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal '16 will be 38%. We continue to expect CapEx for fiscal '16 to be in the range of $85 million to $90 million, which includes investments in infrastructure, cloud services, and facilities, to support the growth of our business. We expect free cash flow margin to be greater than 30% throughout fiscal '16, and finally, our share count is expected to increase by approximately 1% to 2% per quarter. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray.
Andrew Nowinski: Great. Congrats on another great quarter, guys.
Mark McLaughlin: Thank you.
Andrew Nowinski: Maybe just real quick here, billings growth remains strong, and it continues to outpace revenue growth. So based on some of the customer discussions you've had so far, I'm wondering if you can give us any color with regard to what your customer security budgets are looking like in 2016, and whether the growth will be more dependent on market share gains, or whether you can see a benefit from an improving spending environment? And I have a follow-up, too. Thanks.
Mark McLaughlin: It's Mark. I think we're seeing a mix of those things. What we've seen for quite some time is that, when given an opportunity to get in front of the customer in the first place, regardless of the insertion point, we have demonstrated the ability to come in and displace and incumbent and expand with that over time. So that's a big driver of business, obviously. Then in addition to that, with security being so important globally as a consideration for companies, there's also new spend opportunities from a CAGR perspective. We do very well there, as well. We benefit from both of those.
Andrew Nowinski: Okay. And then geographically, your mix from EMEA and APAC remained largely unchanged, and the growth remains below that of the Americas. Do you have to increase hiring in those regions to drive growth, or will that come more from the channel and distributors?
Mark McLaughlin: What we're seeing with North America as our most mature market where we started, and the company just continued amazing growth in an area where we still have so much untapped potential for the company, the US being the largest economy in the world, a lot of focus on cyber security. So it's great to see the biggest market continue to grow at those rates. In addition to that, we're posting very nice growth rates in EMEA and APAC as well, as you can see from the results. Those are both areas where we continue to invest as well, not only from a brand recognition perspective, but sales and distribution capabilities as well, so things look good.
Operator: And we'll go next to Saket Kalia of Barclays Capital.
Saket Kalia: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. First, maybe for Steffan, Steffan, can you talk a little bit about linearity in the quarter? I would imagine August was slow seasonally, but do you have any qualitative color on maybe how September and October may be, compared to some of your prior years?
Steffan Tomlinson: Yes, linearity was basically consistent with prior fiscal Q1s. It was maybe modestly a little bit more back-end loaded, mainly because August is a slow month. We also have our sales kickoff meeting that happens, and we're coming off what was a phenomenal Q4, and we want to get everything set up. September and October were very strong, and we had a very nice conclusion to the quarter.
Saket Kalia: Got it. Got it. And for my follow-up, for Mark. Mark, couple nice deals involving Traps. Can you just give us an update as of start the year, if you can comment on growth or size? But more importantly, where are customers in that decision process, about shifting to that next-gen endpoint platform?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, I think the – first of all, it's a big market opportunity, it's about a $5 billion market, and I would not -- I don't think it's an understatement to say that's up for grabs substantially. There's a lot of activity in the space. What we're hearing more and more from customers is a recognition of two things. First is the legacy endpoint technology just is not doing the job for them. It's pretty obvious. The second thing is, they're not looking for yet one more point solution or one more thing to put on an endpoint. They very much like and the platform story, and it resonates very well with them. What we're hearing customers say is we like the fact Traps actually does prevention, not just yet another detection capability, and that it's natively integrated into the platform so it connects my network and the endpoints together, so it's a powerful story.
Saket Kalia: Got it. Thanks very much.
Mark McLaughlin: Thanks, Saket.
Operator: And we'll go next to Michael Turits of Raymond James.
Michael Turits: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Two questions. First, it's been sort of a mixed quarter amongst a lot of the security companies that reported, and you put up a very consistent and strong quarter. Is there any kind of change in the nature of spending in security that you're seeing?
Mark McLaughlin: That's a good question. I think something that we believed for quite some time and I think it will definitely play out in the future, whether a quarter shows progression, I would never call something on one quarter, but we're pretty convicted that a few things are happening. One is that legacy technology is definitely giving way to next-generation technology. The second is that point solutions are giving away to platforms, right? And then the third is that the primary focus being I’ll call it downstream response remediation, giving way to upstream prevention. So if you put those three things together, if you are able to ring the bell on all three of those, the way Palo Alto can do, I think we would continue to distance ourselves from the competition. Other players can ring one, two of those bells, but nobody else is ringing three of them. That's why we continue to outpace everybody.
Michael Turits: And then on legacy displacement, it sounded like things seemed strong. Some of the other players, including Cisco, seem to be cleaning up their act a bit, and Fortinet has obviously been strong over a multi-quarter period. Is there any change in competitive landscape, especially around legacy displacement?
Mark McLaughlin: I haven't seen that, generally. What we've seen is a couple things. One, I've heard Cisco saying they are now serious about security. I've heard that a few times in the last few years. But we only really take our cue from what our customers tell us. And what our customers are telling us is that you can't retrofit legacy technology by buying companies and popping them on top of each other, and come out with a next generation of platform capability, and that just sounds like more cost and complexity. We continue to beat Cisco handily quarter after quarter, as we've done this last quarter. I would note some other players who, a while back, have touted that the problem is not technology, it's a lack of sales and marketing costs, have invested heavily in that, and doesn't really look like their growth rates are supporting that statement, looks more like a technology issue to me. Again, I would never call something on one quarter.
Operator: And we'll go next to Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen and Company.
Gregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thank you. Congratulations on a good quarter. I thought it was really impressive that all of your top 25 customers made a purchase this quarter. I know it may be a little difficult to generalize, Mark, but what did these customers buy this quarter? Were they primarily maintenance renewals? Were they healthy additional appliance purchases? Were they strong subscription upsells on existing deployments, any color there would be appreciated?
Mark McLaughlin: Sure, Gregg. That's a great question. The answer not surprisingly is all of the above. We have lots of customers who just continue to expand with us in different portions of their network environment. Lots of customers continue to add subscription services that they didn't start with in the beginning, and some, of course, are doing maintenance renewals as well. It's really a mix of all those things. But as we mentioned before, the expansion part of our business is, the majority of our business is growing very, very nicely, and you can see our customers and large customers just continue to buy more and more from us over time.
Gregg Moskowitz: Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, if you can comment, Mark, on the quarterly performance in federal that would be great.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. Good question. So Fed's a great market for us. We had a very nice quarter there, and good strong end to the Fed year, so we're very pleased with it.
Gregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thanks very much.
Mark McLaughlin: Thanks, Gregg.
Operator: And we'll go next to Brent Thill of UBS.
Brent Thill: Thanks. Mark, just on WildFire, you mentioned that you had a great quarter there. I'm just curious what you're seeing with some of the point solutions, and are you seeing an increasing rate of customers turning off and deciding to be part of the Palo Alto family? Can you just walk through the dynamics there?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, sure, Brent. What we're seeing is a across the board, regardless of what subscription service we're talking about, there's a clear desire for folks to have a high degree of prevention orientation, and have that to be native in one platform. You have to - when we look at our platform, and the capabilities of every aspect of the platform, we'll stack them up all day long to any best of breed provider on their capabilities, and WildFire, in that case, performs very, very well. And in addition to that, which is unmatched, it's part of the platform. The platform is more powerful, because of every piece that's part of it, and each of the pieces are more powerful, because they're in the platform, and that's the reason why customers are coming to this so rapidly, as you can see from the numbers. Then on top of that, we network the whole thing, which means we can rapidly share what we find from one customer's perspective, with thousands and thousands of other customers, which increases the probability that the next time an unknown threat comes across somebody's network, we saw it somewhere else, and we just stop it right away. It's really a combination of those things that's driving WildFire.
Brent Thill: And for Steffan, this is the third quarter in a row, the accelerating deferred revenue, one of the highest growth rates you've seen. Can you just help us understand what you're seeing there in the buildup of that DR?
Steffan Tomlinson: What we're seeing is the resonance of our platform really taking hold. We're seeing increasing subscription attach rates. Over time, we are seeing high renewal rates for both support and subscriptions. And the fact that we are truly a platform play, plays to our strength, and that's playing out in the deferred revenue line. As you mentioned, total deferred revenue grew 71% year-over-year. That was one of the highest growth rates that we've had in about eight or nine quarters. So it's a further affirmation of the business model, and the power of the platform.
Operator: And we'll go next to Catharine Trebnick of Dougherty.
Catharine Trebnick: Thank you for taking my question. I have a question on your virtual edition. You talked about 1,000 customers. There's several private companies out there, vArmour, et cetera, and can you just quickly say what your advantages are in that sector and how well you're doing? Maybe more details on that. Thank you.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, sure, Catharine. Yes, there is a few very important differences. The first is that the virtualized series we have, the virtualization of everything we offer, right, so you have to start with next generation technology versus legacy stateful inspection technology. Other competitors in the market have virtualized stateful inspection firewalls, which means they are equivalent technically to a stateful inspection firewall. We have virtualized our entire next generation enterprise security platform, so that's the primary difference between us and all comers in that case, whether they be some large existing legacy providers, or any of the new ones.
Catharine Trebnick: Okay. And that's where you're really seeing the accelerated movement with Amazon and then the NSX with VMware, correct?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. What we're seeing there, Katherine, that's a great question, is that as things move around, like the network becomes more amorphous in nature, applications move off network, users move off network, cloud computing, all the things that are big macro trends. What we're seeing there is that it's very important to have virtualized capabilities, because you need to move those virtualized capabilities around very quickly and have a very good degree automation amongst them. It's the combination of that, that's really enticing our customers to use us, and we noted how fast the VM series is growing, and that's just one indicator of how forward leaning we are into the virtualized space and the adoption rate there.
Operator: And we'll go next to Shaul Eyal of Oppenheimer.
Shaul Eyal: Thank you. Hi, guys, congrats on strong results and outlook. Mark, so you mentioned 140 executive meetings during the quarter. Are these Board people joining meetings? Are you seeing the level of attendees according of seniority of those participants hitting a level higher?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, the engagement level for us has been high and continues to be high into the company and I should have been more specific. What I meant there was what we call executive briefings. We have an executive briefing center here in Santa Clara. When we bring somebody in for an executive briefing, it's usually folks are coming in for a minimum of four hours, perhaps eight hours. So they spend an entire day with us with a big portion of their senior technology executive team, sometimes executives outside the technology team as well, and we get an opportunity to hear what their needs are, what their strategy is, we'll do a deep dive on our road map, bring in our technical experts, and these are fantastic. The feedback on this from customers is really great. They very much find it to be a useful, useful amount of their time, and they also get the opportunity to do actual testing in our lab. We'll take them right across the hallway, and they get to test as much as they want, so it's very useful. I just wanted to note that because with 140 of these in the last quarter, that is the biggest number we've ever done. We're literally bursting at the seams. We had to knock down a couple of walls about three months to add more space down there, so it's just something that's a great demand generator for us.
Shaul Eyal: Great. And for Steffan, so good news, tax rate at 38% is not and probably cannot be going any higher. I know I keep giving you a hard time on this one. How do we bring it down to be slightly more in line with some of your technology-related peers?
Steffan Tomlinson: Well, the 38% is a non-GAAP effective tax rate, if you look at the actual GAAP tax rate or cash tax rate, it's in the low single digits, or it's even negative. The non-GAAP tax rate is a place holder that we've put out there for modeling purposes. We do believe that non-GAAP tax rate will come down over time, most likely to the high 20s or low 30s. And I'll just leave it at that.
Operator: And we'll go next to Philip Winslow of Credit Suisse.
Michael Baresich: Hi, guys, this is Michael Baresich on for Phil. Congrats on the great quarter. Question about the attach rate of subscriptions. Can you give us some color on where it was, and are there any changes in attach that you'd note this quarter?
Steffan Tomlinson: Hey, Michael. Attach rates are good and increasing. We talked about that at the end of the fourth quarter. I think we said the attach rates at that point across the board were 2.2, and that attach rates, we would expect those to go up. Again, we'll give more detail about that later in the year, but they continue to rise.
Mark McLaughlin: The other thing is, it's not just about the attach rates of the four subscription services, but we have Traps, AutoFocus and Aperture, our three subscription services that are coming into play, and that is also providing incremental business opportunity from us, which is starting to show up in deferred revenue and billings.
Michael Baresich: Great. And that actually leads into my follow-up. Could you give us an update on the customer feedback on AutoFocus so far?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, it's great. Michael, this is Mark. We had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of customers in the beta before we rolled that out, and a lot of them now are looking for purchasing decisions. We sold AutoFocus in Q1 to a number of those customers. So far the feedback is -- they say this is very impressive. This is taking a lot of data and making it very relevant for me in a very fast basis, so I can make decisions with my least leverageable resource I have in the company, which is my people.
Operator: And we'll go next to Jayson Noland of Robert Baird.
Jayson Noland: Thank you. And I'll add my congratulations. I wanted to ask first on the potential for a refresh that was mentioned last quarter. There were 4,000 new customers from F '09 to F '11. Have you started to see the refresh in early F '16?
Mark McLaughlin: Jayson, its Mark. We have seen our own customer base refreshing, as well. As you noted, the couple cohorts we discussed before actually 2009 and 2010, which is a bit less than 2,000 customers against a 28,000 customer base. Of course, we're very pleased to see customers refresh that technology. We'd expect that to continue over time, as more of the base matures. But the biggest driver of the business today is the expansion inside of those customers, not just the refreshes. So they're all expanding, or pretty much all been expanding at very healthy rates. On top of that, when these bigger numbers of cohorts kick in, from a refresh perspective, that should be a tailwind for us.
Jayson Noland: Okay. That makes sense. Steffan, I wanted to ask a follow-up on the gross margin. You're already at the top of the range. I assume with mix shift, would that potentially go above the range in fiscal '16, or is this an opportunity to invest to take more share?
Steffan Tomlinson: We feel good about the 75% to 78% gross margin range for the rest of this fiscal year. It's something that we've - that line item in our target model was actually up, increased at our last analyst day, reflecting, again, the power of the model, with our subscriptions business being close to, call it software type gross margins. That provides a good backstop to that range of 75% to 78%. So for the rest of the fiscal year we feel good about that. And then, at some point, we will update our target model, and we'll look at all the line items in that model, including gross margin.
Operator: And we'll go next to Gray Powell of Wells Fargo.
Gray Powell: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just one from my end. So as your operating margins scale from 14% in Q4 last year into your target range of 22% to 25%, how should we think about your ability to maintain heightened billings growth, and then how does productivity of new salespeople factor into your thinking there?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. So I'll take the second part first, which is the productivity of our sales force is one of the key drivers of our business. We have now much more than 50% of our quota-carrying salespeople being fully ramped versus ramping, and we continue to see that trend going forward. So that plays a key role in the overall, both productivity and capacity of our overall sales organization. And we have done, I think, a decent job of managing growth and profitability. We continually balance that on a quarter by quarter basis, and you saw that we've again reiterated our 22% to 25% non-GAAP operating margin exiting Q4 fiscal '16, and we don't give guidance more than one quarter out relative to billings or revenue. But we feel like we can -- we are optimally set up to continue to take a lot of market share, but doing it in a profitable manner. What we've also said is, this is a growth and profitability story. It's not a growth or profitability story. So we continue to manage that dynamic, and we're doing what's in the best interest of our business.
Gray Powell: Understood. That's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Walter Pritchard with Citi.
Walter Pritchard: Thanks. Mark, can you talk about the 7080 opportunity, and where your -- what sort of business are you winning that you weren't able to win before, or is that a continuation of what you had with the 7050?
Mark McLaughlin: Walter, I'd put it more in a continuation bucket. What we're seeing in general is throughput requirements just continue to rise for companies in general, with more applications that are heavier throughput hogs. The second thing we're seeing is a lot of work in data centers as people are moving to next generation data centers, as well. And a third area we see progress is in the service provider market. So it's a combination of all three of those things that have us selling well with the 7000 series, which now includes the 7080 as well.
Walter Pritchard: Okay, and then Steffan, on the end point side is there a thought to at some point breaking that business out if it gets large enough, or I don't know, would love to hear, just we're trying to track it to some degree, and understanding it's small at this point.
Steffan Tomlinson: What we're thinking about right now is giving visibility in terms of number of customers, and we plan on doing that on a semi-annual basis. When the endpoint business gets very large, we'll consider breaking it out. But right now it's part of the overall platform, which is why at least in the, call it, near to medium term, we'll continue to give color commentary on it, but not break it out specifically in terms of revenue.
Operator: And we'll go next to Joel Fishbein of BTIG.
Joel Fishbein: Good afternoon, guys. Just a follow-up on Aperture, a space that's been consolidating here. Gartner calls it the CASB space, I hate that name. I know it's very, very early but it could be a big opportunity. Could you just go into some detail about it, and what you're thinking there?
Mark McLaughlin: Joel, its Mark. So let me -- for background, let me say what the market is, right? As data users and things move around, as the traditional concept of the network gets more amorphous over time, one of the areas that's important is where's your data, and what applications are being used. So if you're using an application that's not on your network, and the user is connecting to it not through the network, then the ability to apply network security processes to it, and policies to it is limited because there's no visibility on it. So that's the problem, right? What Aperture does is it uses API hooks to stand in the shoes of the credentialed user in a major third-party sanctioned SaaS application that has really great technology that is looking for anomalies based on users' end data and the ability to identify and quickly fix it. That's what it does. Naturally, we think that is part of a prevention platform. It's important, but it doesn't deserve to be outside of the platform, and I don't think customers want to be buying yet more devices and complexity to put in their network to solve that use case. And that's what they've very clearly told us, and that's why we made a move into that market.
Joel Fishbein: So do you think that there won't be so-called a broker anymore in the middle, that you'll be one of the people that will be providing that as a service?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, I think that somebody had to -- what we're talking about is in a sense somebody had to broker your data for you. We're just trying to do is make sure you can control the data in the first place, you don't need to add another third party in the process to do that. That just adds complexity.
Operator: And we'll go next to Michael Kim of Imperial Capital.
Michael Kim: Can you talk a little about the opportunity with the manned security service providers and early progress with new partners like Trustwave, and how you see that developing and where that's giving you an opportunity to leverage into new segments of the market?
Mark McLaughlin: Sure, Michael. So, there's, as you know, some customers will choose to outsource portions of the security operations into managed security service providers, definitely seeing a growth in that business. And almost all of the large MSS providers know how to work with and manage Palo Alto capabilities. Where there's a distinguishing factor that's really good for as MSS providers is what the Palo Alto Networks platform spits off, for lack of a better term, is way, way different and superior than just reading blogs off of firewalls. When they're working with Palo Alto Networks' platform they have a capability and ability to do something of high value for customers as opposed to low value, just reading logs. Another aspect to that we think is interesting is to take AutoFocus as a tool, and have those MSS providers use AutoFocus and provide even more valuable intelligence to their customers as a result of that sale. We think there's some interest there, and as you noted, we are working with some of the providers there to be forward leaning like Trustwave.
Michael Kim: Great. And then switching gears, can you talk a little about how the partnership with Tanium is progressing and was that a contributor to WildFire customers in the quarter?
Mark McLaughlin: The partnership is going very well. So just for background for everybody, quickly what we did with Tanium was back in September, we did work for quite some time with them, and then in September we bought out the connection between the Tanium capabilities and WildFire. That's important, because indicators of compromise that WildFire is finding can be automatically sent to Tanium, and it can look for it in a highly automated way as well, as opposed to have to figure out what to look for. Similarly, we're taking things off of the end point that Tanium sees, back into WildFire, for processing as well. It's a very symbiotic relationship. The feedback we've heard, so it's a technology relationship, let me start with that, it's a not a SKU, right? But the feedback we've heard from our field, from their field and customers is that makes a lot of sense, particularly when you're thinking about end points and are saying, I'd like to prevent things. I want to detect things, I couldn't prevent them. I want to isolate them, and I want to remediate them in a highly automated way, if I was unable to prevent them. That technical combination is pretty powerful.
Operator: And we'll go next to Sterling Auty of JPMorgan.
Sterling Auty: So given it's the first quarter and you had sales kick off, can you highlight for us any tweaks or changes that you made in your go-to-market, whether it be distributors, and what each one is focused on, or addition or subtraction, or any changes to the reseller program?
Mark McLaughlin: Sterling, its Mark. A few things that came out of, I'll call it hopefully the seamless growth of the business through rapid growth phases, and we're always paying attention to that, clearly it's on the go-to-market distribution side. So Mark Anderson continues to do a fantastic job of managing a large and growing sales force through splitting territories rapidly. He formed a new theatre [ph] for service providers as well, so we've got a lot of focus on that. We continue to work very well with our large distributor partners and reseller partners. I think we mentioned on the last call that we had over 500 of them in attendance for sales kick-off, treating them just like our own sales team from a training perspective. And those relationships continue to grow very nicely over time.
Sterling Auty: Then just as a follow-up, you talked about the relationship with Tanium, but it does seem to be a bit of a morphing in terms of how enterprise are thinking about the endpoint security strategy. Is there any pieces of the technology puzzle on the endpoint that you feel at the moment that you don't have, that you would have to go through some sort of build versus buy analysis?
Mark McLaughlin: I think most importantly what you would do with the endpoint if you could, is you'd prevent an attack. That is by far the highest value order bid, and the things that we're solving for constantly, and that's what we're doing with Traps. That's why we bought Cyvera in the first place. That's why we did the integration to WildFire, and that's why we're making a lot of leaps and strides on our capabilities, along those lines. There are downstream things from that, that if you couldn't prevent, you would like to be able to do, like things I mentioned. But we're very, very focused on prevention, and think we've got all the tools to do that.
Operator: And we'll go next to Rob Owens with Pacific Crest Securities.
Rob Owens: Curious about the strength in short-term deferred. Is much of that unshipped product, or is that all subscription related? Just trying to get a sense of the first quarter's velocity.
Steffan Tomlinson: It's a mix of both products and subscription and support. And by definition, if you have a one-year subscription and maintenance contract, that goes into short-term. If it's a multiyear, it goes into long-term. But if you look at the demand that we're seeing across the board, I would tell you that the vast majority of all of our deferred is subscriptions and support, and there's very little, because we are a book and ship business.
Rob Owens: Great. And Steffan, I appreciate the guidance one quarter at a time. Now that over half your business is coming from subscription-related items, why not give an annual number?
Steffan Tomlinson: We constantly look at different models for guidance, but given our business and the growth rates, we feel comfortable giving one quarter out. We always leave the door open for looking at alternative models, but this approach has served us well, and we feel like it's a good indicator of what the environment looks like. The other thing I'll tell you is, we also give modeling points on our earnings calls, which gives some more color commentary around the overall health and growth of the business. So we try to give a little bit of a hybrid approach, when it comes to guidance.
Operator: And we'll go next to Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Mr. Weiss, your line is open. Please go ahead. Mr. Weiss, please pick up your handset or press your mute function, I am unable to hear you. And we'll go next to Scott Zeller of Needham.
Scott Zeller: Hi, thanks. Wanted to ask about the velocity of deals. Can you tell us if you're seeing any change in sales cycles, or if you're seeing a need for more signoffs at all in deals?
Mark McLaughlin: Did you say signoffs?
Scott Zeller: Signoffs, yes.
Mark McLaughlin: Okay. Deal velocity's good. We said for actually quite some time that the -- from a start to finish on average things take about 90 days, some of those much longer, we get some big organizations, government organizations, and some can be shorter. About 90 days. That really hasn't changed for us. From a signoff perspective, the only thing we've seen signoff wise, which is a good thing, that slows deals down occasionally, is deals are getting bigger. The bigger they get, the higher they go in the organization, in order to get signoff. And we're fine with that, because we definitely don't mind having visibility, this gets to the CFO, CEO level sometimes in some of these companies because we want to be the strategic security provider for these companies.
Scott Zeller: Since you don't comment on ASPs, is there anything you can give us regarding your comment, Mark, around deals getting bigger, or any color, if you're not willing to offer an ASP.
Mark McLaughlin: Sure. What we have said around the ASPs is they tend to be in the mid-five figure range. They continue to be there. They continue to increase over time. So that's been a pretty consistent trend for us, year-over-year. The reason we don't put a lot of focus into ASP from a reporting perspective is we're way more interested in lifetime value of customers, and that's because usually we're coming in, we're taking somebody out of the equation from a displacement perspective, and a customer's going to give us a shot to do something. The first shot in that may be a relatively minor shot, but over time we continue to grow and grow and grow into the account, and that's why the ASPs would be not as indicative of the health of the business, I don't think, as lifetime value. Although like I said, ASPs continually increase year-over-year.
Operator: And we'll next to Tal Liani of Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.
Tal Liani: I want to go back to the question on the PA 7080. What do you think -- the market, the high end market has different dynamics, and we see Juniper back in the market with new high end solution. Some companies are kind of established in this space, Cisco and Juniper and Check Point. What do you bring to this market that is different than what's available today now? And can you elaborate maybe on the competitive pressures, how are they different at this side of the market versus the general side of the market?
Mark McLaughlin: Paul, its Mark. I'd say from a difference perspective it's basically doing what we've been doing for 10 years, which is the difference between legacy technology and the next generation. And we pioneered that, and we're the only ones who are doing that, not using stateful inspection technology. From a throughput perspective, what we've seen with the 7000 series, like I said, is an increasing demand from customers as they go to next generation data centers, application usage increases from a throughput perspective, is they want that next generation security. They want it at very high speeds as well, which is fantastic, and an opportunity for us. But at the end of the day, what we've been doing is the same thing we've been doing for a decade now. That's clearly working in the market. We haven't seen any resurgence of anybody, frankly, in the market. And you can see that from our results compared to everybody else's.
Operator: We ask that you limit yourself to one question. And we'll go next to Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley.
Keith Weiss: Hi, guys. Sorry about the technical difficulties. So thanks for taking the question, and a very nice quarter. I wanted to go a little bit more broadly into sort of the idea that next generation security platform, and really talk about the distribution side of that. You talked a little bit about the executive briefings and going higher in terms of what your sales guys are doing to engage at a higher level, more strategic level with your customers. How do you get your partner channel on board with that as well? How do you get those guys up the ramp to be able to be helping you guys sell a more strategic sale into the customers, because partners have always been a very important part of the story here.
Mark Anderson: Keith, its Mark Anderson here. That's a good question. You may have read, last year, we made the decision to involve all of our partners, give them the ability to participate in our internal sales training. So whether it's having 548 of them at our sales kickoff meeting in August, whether it's having a couple hundred engineers come to our tech summits, or every month having 10 to 15 sales engineers and account managers participate in our monthly new hire, they're learning the exact same curriculum as our field salespeople, because they're an extension of our field sales team. The objective there clearly is to get them to do more of the lifting farther down the field than we've seen in the past, and we think, so far, internal expectations are being exceeded there. So the other thing is, we're now, I think, a lot more relevant to these bigger model partners. So large cloud companies, large telcos, large systems integrators, more and more want to work with us and build out services to sell to their large customers. So it's a big focus for us. We're really ramping up the worldwide channels team, and feel very strongly that it's only going to get better.
Operator: And we'll go next to Karl Keirstead of Deutsche Bank.
Karl Keirstead: Thanks and congratulations on a great quarter. This question is for Steffan. Steffan, the difference between your non-GAAP operating margins of 17%, and your free cash flow margins of 43%, actually widened out in Q1. I'm wondering if you can remind us of the factors that are likely to cause this gap to narrow throughout the fiscal year, as your guidance suggests? Thank you.
Steffan Tomlinson: The factors that will contribute it to narrow over time is, we will become a cash taxpayer over, call it over time, and right now, we have very limited cash taxes that we're paying. So that's probably the primary thing. What we've given as a guidepost is, we've talked about our target operating model of 22% to 25%, which again, we believe that we'll get to exit in Q4 of fiscal '16. What we've said is, we think that our free cash flow margin should track 5 to 8 points above the top end of that range. That is a guidepost, and we'll continue to refresh that over time. I'll also tell you that, in this quarter, we had exceptional free cash flow margins at north of 42%. Part of that over performance was driven in part by a really exceptionally strong quarter in Q4, where we had billings and revenue growth that were at al -time highs. And we got the benefit of that cash collection in Q1. So that's one of the reasons why the spread widened in Q1, because of the strong sequential benefit that we got from Q4 billings.
Operator: And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the call back to Mark McLaughlin for any additional or closing remarks.
Mark McLaughlin: Thanks, operator, and thanks everybody for joining us this afternoon. We're really excited about the future, and I'd like to thank our customers, partners and the entire Palo Alto Networks team for their hard work and support in Q1. We're looking forward to seeing many of you in December, and we hope everyone has a great Thanksgiving. Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

And finally, at the conclusion of today's conference call, we will be posting our prepared remarks to our Investor Relations website, under Quarterly Results. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.
Mark McLaughlin: Thank you, Kelsey, and thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon. I am happy to be here with you to share our results for our fiscal fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2015. 2015 was another great year for the company, one in which we continue to distance ourselves from the competition. In the year, we grew our customer base more than 35% to over 26,000 customers and are now privileged to serve almost half of the Global 2000. The number of WildFire customers increased approximately 140% year-over-year to over 7,000 customers. We grew both revenue and billings more than 55% year-over-year. We significantly expanded our non-GAAP operating margin. We generated free cash flow of more than $300 million. We expanded key technology partnerships and distribution relationships around the world. And we continue to strengthen our platform with new offerings, including Traps, WildFire enhancements and data center appliances. We were able to grow at these rates and deliver these results because we have established ourselves as the leader in next-generation security. Cyber security is an increasingly complex and long-term issue that threatens the fabric of our day-to-day digital lifestyle. To meet this challenge, enterprises, governments and service providers are having to re-architect their systems and networks off of legacy platforms and onto next generation technology. This has led to an increase in investment levels in security that we do not expect to change any time soon. Customers recognize that security is not a problem that can be solved by cobbling together disparate point products or legacy solutions, but that an entirely new approach is needed. There is a growing global market recognition that our prevention first mindset, with the market's only true natively integrated and automated next-generation security platform, delivers demonstrably better protection and prevention at a very attractive total cost of ownership. And our singular focus on innovation continues to strengthen this platform with highly disruptive offerings, each of which provides market-leading prevention capabilities and when natively integrated into platform, increases the overall capabilities of the platform. As a result, we are rapidly replacing existing security solutions and winning new opportunities in organizations around the world. And we are taking market share with growth rates that significantly outpace the market and the competition. We can see this once again in our Q4 results. Revenue of $284 million grew 59% year-over-year, while billings of $394 million grew 69% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 14%, and we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.28. We added a record 2,000 plus new customers in the quarter, including a North American brokerage and banking company, where we replaced Cisco in a seven-figure data center deal; a utility provider of natural gas and electricity where we beat both Check Point and Cisco for their advanced network protection project; a diversified managed health care company in North America, which purchased Palo Alto Networks for NSX in a seven figure transaction; an Asian government security agency where we replaced Cisco in their security infrastructure; and one of the largest airlines in the world located in the United States where we replaced Check Point in an outbound internet project. Equally important as new customer acquisition is the expansion of customer lifetime value. To make our top 25 customer lifetime value list in Q4, a customer had to have spent a minimum of $9.2 million in lifetime value, a more than 60% increase over the $5.6 million required in Q4 of last fiscal year and up from $8.2 million in Q3. This lifetime value expansion is being driven by a number of factors. One example is the continued rapid adoption of WildFire, where we saw attach rates grow to well over 50% in Q4. While we're very pleased with these results, we continue to believe there is a lot of runway ahead of us with WildFire, which appeals not only to existing customers, but attracts a significant number of new ones as well. In the fourth quarter, we also saw continued strong adoption of Traps, our advanced endpoint capability, which we introduced in the first quarter of fiscal '15 and where we are now serving close to 150 customers. Wins included a large Japanese multi-national telecommunications and Internet corporation and a large U.S. regional supermarket chain. Given the vulnerability of endpoints and the deficiency of current legacy solutions that market is ripe for disruption and we believe our prevention-oriented approach offers customers the most scalable and effective solution. Feedback from our customers is that our platform advantage continues to resonate and differentiate us from the competition and we look to widen that gap in fiscal '16 with the introduction of capabilities that will further enhance our platform. By the end of this month, we expect to bring two new services to the market. The first service, AutoFocus, gives security practitioners highly relevant access to the threat intelligence and context we gather from our large and ever increasing customer base. This helps them focus on stopping the truly unique and targeted attacks. We have been running an AutoFocus Community Access program for several months now and are very pleased with the level of participation and feedback we have received. The second service, Aperture, is based on the technology we acquired with CirroSecure in fiscal Q4. Aperture expands our ability to safely enable applications by providing visibility and control for sanctioned SaaS applications such as Box, Google Drive or Salesforce.com that are highly collaborative, but often contain an organizations' most sensitive data. We also recently announced availability of our newest high-end chassis, the PA-7080. At 200 gigs a second, the PA-7080 is now our fastest throughput chassis designed to help organizations secure high-speed internal networks, data centers and large internet facing connections without compromising their need for true next generation security capabilities. Early interest has been strong and, in addition to the enterprise customer, we expect the PA-7080 will help us further penetrate the service provider market. And, in early August we announced an exclusive agreement with Tanium to integrate Tanium's technology with WildFire to enhance both network and endpoint security. On the distribution front, we are very pleased with the continued progress we are making with our channel partners on a global basis. The largest and most respected channel partners are making significant investments with Palo Alto Networks, providing great leverage for us, high rates of revenue growth for them and value-add for our joint customers. For example, in fiscal '15 CDW grew their business with us more than 85%, while Dimension Data and close to 500 other channel partners all doubled their business, giving us the capacity needed to support our growth. It is clear to the partner community that Palo Alto Networks is leading the market and very quickly taking market share from all legacy and point providers. As a result, in fiscal '15 well over 12,000 of our partners security professionals invested in education, training and building capabilities around our platform, which should allow us to continue to grow together into the future. Q4 was a fantastic end to a record-setting year for us, one in which we delivered unprecedented growth at scale while delivering consistent and meaningful non-GAAP operating margin expansion and cash flow. I'd like to thank the Palo Alto Networks employees for their hard work and our customers and partners for their ongoing partnership and support. We completed our Global Sales Kickoff a few weeks ago and I can tell you that there is a lot of energy and excitement around what we will accomplish in fiscal '16. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steffan.
Steffan Tomlinson: Thank you, Mark, and thank you for joining us on our call today. Before I get into the details of our results and guidance, I'd like to note that, except for revenue figures, which are GAAP, all financial figures are non-GAAP unless stated otherwise. Q4 was a strong finish to fiscal 2015, a year in which we delivered industry-leading sales growth, expanded operating margins and increased free cash flow generation. During the fourth quarter, our land and expand sales strategy resulted in a record number of new customer additions and expansion in existing customers that once again drove growth across the entire portfolio of products, services and support. We delivered record revenue, deferred revenue, billings, non-GAAP operating income and free cash flow. As we look to FY'16, we feel good about our ability to continue to grow the top-line and drive incremental leverage in the business. Now, let me turn to the numbers. Q4 total revenue grew 59% over the prior year and 21% sequentially to reach a new record of $283.9 million. For the fiscal year, we reported revenue of $928.1 million, a 55% increase over the prior year. The geographic mix of revenue for Q4 was 71% Americas, 18% EMEA, and 11% APAC. Compared to the prior year, the Americas grew 68%, EMEA grew 32% and APAC grew 61%. We saw broad strength across a wide range of verticals and did not have any end customer concentration. The three components of our hybrid-SaaS model, product, subscription services and support, all grew well in fiscal 2015, with particular strength in Q4. Q4 product revenue of $154 million increased 54% over the prior year and 27% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, we saw healthy growth across our product portfolio. In particular, the PA-7050 chassis continues to help accelerate growth in the high-end data center market. Recurring services revenue of $129.8 million increased 65% over the prior year and 15% sequentially, and accounted for a 46% share of total revenue. Looking at the two components of recurring services revenue, the first component is our SaaS-based subscription revenue of $64.1 million, which increased 70% over the prior year and 17% sequentially. Excluding Traps, which does not ship as an attached to our appliances, in the fourth quarter customers purchased on average 2.2 subscriptions per device compared to 2.1 in Q4 fiscal '14. Support and maintenance revenue, the second component of recurring services was $65.8 million, an increase of 61% over the prior year and 14% sequentially. Billings in Q4 were $393.6 million, an increase of 69% over the prior year and 30% sequentially. Total billings for fiscal 2015 were $1.2 billion and grew 58% year-over-year. Product billings were $496.7 million and grew 46%, accounting for 41% of total billings. Support billings were $342 million and grew 58%, accounting for 28% of total billings. And subscription billings were $380.4 million and grew 77%, accounting for 31% of total billings. Total deferred revenue grew to $713.7 million in Q4, an increase of 69% year-over-year and 18% sequentially, underscoring the power of our hybrid-SaaS model and increasing visibility into future revenue streams. Total gross margin for Q4 was 78.3%, an increase of 160 basis points compared to last year and an increase of 80 basis points sequentially. Product gross margin was 77.8%, an increase of 210 basis points year-over-year and 140 basis points sequentially. Fluctuations in product gross margin are due in part to product mix and the introduction of new products. Services gross margin for Q4 was 78.8%, an increase of 80 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially. Services gross margin continues to benefit in part from ongoing growth of our high margin subscription services. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was 2,637 up from 2,317 at the end of the prior quarter. We continue to add talent across the business as we scale to support our growth. For the quarter, research and development expense was 10.6% of revenue, increasing approximately $2.6 million sequentially to $30 million. The increase was primarily due to headcount. Sales and marketing expense for Q4 was 48.2% of revenue, increasing approximately $29.8 million sequentially to $136.8 million. The increase was primarily due to headcount and end of year commission expense. General and administrative expense for Q4 was 5.4% of revenue, increasing approximately $1 million sequentially to $15.4 million. The increase was primarily due to headcount additions. In total, Q4 operating expenses were $182.3 million or 64.2% of revenue. We achieved our near-term milestone of exiting Q4 fiscal '15 in the low teens for non-GAAP operating margin, with Q4 non-GAAP operating margin of 14.1%, representing growth of 600 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially. Net income for the quarter was $25 million or $0.28 per diluted share using 90.1 million shares compared with net income of $9.1 million, or $0.11 per diluted share in Q4 '14. For the full-year fiscal '15, we reported net income of $75.2 million or $0.86 per diluted share, compared with net income of $31.8 million or $0.40 per diluted share in fiscal '14. Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for Q4 and fiscal '15 was 38%. On a GAAP basis for the fourth quarter, net loss was $46 million or $0.55 per basic and diluted share. This compares with a Q4 '14 GAAP net loss of $32.1 million or $0.41 per basic and diluted share. For the full-year fiscal '15, we reported a GAAP net loss of $165 million or $2.02 per basic and diluted share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $226.5 million or $3.05 per basic and diluted share in fiscal '14. We finished July with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.3 billion. Cash flow from operations, free cash flow and free cash flow margin for Q4 were $111.3 million, $99.4 million and 35% respectively. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $12 million. The accounts receivable balance was $212.4 million this quarter, up from $150.5 million in Q3. DSOs increased sequentially by 3 days and decreased year-over-year by 5 days to 58 days. Turning to guidance. In Q1 fiscal '16, we expect revenue to be in the range of $280 million to $284 million, which represents 46% to 48% growth year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.31 per share to $0.32 per share using 91 million shares to 92 million shares. And before I conclude, I'd like to highlight a number of considerations for modeling purposes. Due to continued strong growth, seasonality has been difficult to forecast, but we believe that fiscal Q2 and Q4 will show our strongest sequential revenue growth. We continue to expect to exit Q4 fiscal 2016 at a 22% to 25% non-GAAP operating margin, which was the target range and date we set at the time of our IPO in 2012. To achieve this objective we currently expect sequential non-GAAP operating margin expansion with the majority of the acceleration into the back half of fiscal 2016. The effective non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2016 will be 38%. And with the completion of our fiscal 2016 plan, we now expect CapEx to be in the range of $85 million to $90 million for the year, which includes investments in infrastructure, cloud services and facilities to support the growth of our business. We expect free cash flow margin to be greater than 30% for fiscal year 16. And finally, our share count is expected to increase by approximately 1% to 2% per quarter. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray.
Andrew Nowinski: Just wanted to ask about the product growth and it's clearly probably the best we've seen in a couple of years here for you. And I was wondering if you could dissect that a little bit and give us some color on whether big deals may have influenced that product growth versus some of the market share gains you appear to be capturing? And then specifically on the market share side, I'd be curious as to where you're seeing the most gains from? Whether it's from a vendor or a specific market segment?
Mark McLaughlin: They're very related questions, and the answer is, on the second part is we're seeing gains everywhere competitively, so from the legacy firewall vendors, as well as a lot of the point guys who overtime are being subsumed into our platform from a services perspective. So we're seeing gains pretty much everywhere we compete and also now including on the endpoint side as well. And that plays into the product growth. So on the product growth side, yes, its very healthy numbers as you can see. And we're experiencing both of the things that you just mentioned. One is we are seeing larger deals. We're getting into the Global 2000 at accelerating rates, sourcing larger deals with larger customers. And our existing customer base has continued to buy more overtime as well, as you can see from the lifetime value. So it's winning larger deals with larger customers upfront and just a continuation of something we've been seeing for quite some time, which is customers continue to supply more from us.
Steffan Tomlinson: The other angle on that, Andrew, is we're getting deeper into the data center. So we're selling our 7050 chassis and our 5000 Series and we're seeing larger deal sizes as we get further into the data center. And that should continue as we get more traction with our 7080, which we just announced.
Operator: And we'll go next to Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse.
Philip Winslow: Just wanted to double click on the subscription side. As Steffan, you mentioned, you're up to 2.2 subscriptions per box. As you kind of think about the guidance going forward, how do you expect that to trend? And then, obviously, you're introducing some, call it, non-boxed attach should be a subscription. You already have Traps, you've talked about AutoFocus. Maybe some more color on just how Traps is doing? And how we should at least think about AutoFocus beginning to contribute once it's launched?
Mark McLaughlin: So a couple of thoughts on this, first, on the subscription side, you can see the attach rates continue to grow year-over-year. There is a lot of value in the subscription services that used to be point solutions. So as we subsume them into the platform, which we have over time, customers are finding a lot of value from that approach. So we like that a lot, of course. You can see our subscription services business, if you look at the fourth quarter is approaching like $480 million of billings run rate, so growing at over 75%. So you can just see very strong growth in attach, other subscription service. Then in addition to that as you correctly note, as we go forward, we have a number of new services, Traps is one of them, Aperture, AutoFocus both coming out here in the next few weeks time. And our services, they'll be billed as such more from a sales and revenue and deferred revenue perspective, but they won't have the concept of attach. So some of the attach rates commentary made in that past maybe able to hold up a less meaningful as we go forward with you bringing more services to market that don't have those attach rates. And on the Traps itself, we're very happy with Traps where it is right now. There is such a strong demand in the market for endpoint security, a 100% or close to 100% of the sales calls I go on, customers are talking about the need for something dramatically different to happen at the endpoint. And we think we have the answer for that. So we have a lot of interest in that. We think we've got a really great technology there that very importantly is part of the platform. So at the end of the day, we're selling the platform and that's what people find value in.
Philip Winslow: And then, just one quick follow-up for Steffan. You guys had another quarter of improving product gross margin. I know a lot of this has to do with mix sometimes and when product is introduced, but maybe give us some more color on what happened this quarter, sort of this year or two and then how you're sort of thinking about that going forward?
Steffan Tomlinson: Well, mix definitely plays a factor, and as we sell higher margin boxes, that plays to the favorability. But mix is only one part of the story. We also focus on COGS reduction and we have we think the best supply chain team on the planet and they are going out and trying to drive cost down. So we are looking at a favorable product mix environment, but also reducing COGS. And we have great manufacturing partners as well. So we have both of those dynamics going on, which is helping with product gross margins.
Operator: We'll go next to Rob Owens with Pacific Crest.
Rob Owens: First off, I want to talk about the renewal cycle. And your own renewal cycle, as you look at preexisting customers over last three and four years, is that beginning to influence and drive some of this product growth we saw? And then second, interim Traps, Mark, appreciate the color around the platform play, but maybe you can give us just a little more with regard to the technology? And are you actually getting technology wins? Is it driving new customer acquisition? And lastly, on the Traps front, what are you guys seeing in terms of relative price per endpoint?
Mark McLaughlin: So on the renewal cycle, I take that you mean like a refresh cycle on our own?
Rob Owens: A refresh of your own install base.
Mark McLaughlin: As we said before, we have a great customer base and we continue to add to that. We added over 2,000 customers since last quarter alone, so that's the gift that keeps giving on a long-term basis when you think about renewals and refresh cycles. So we talked before about seeing refresh cycles in our 2009 and 2010 cohorts, I would start to throw in that the 2011 cohort as well as the things get to the four to five year natural refresh cycles. And if you combine of '09, '10, and '11 together, it's like little over 4,000 customers out of 26,000, right, so our glass is not even tiny, but full yet from a refresh cycle perspective on a very large and growing customer base and we like that a lot. On Traps, the question of technology wins are what's working there. There are two things really that are going on. The first is on a pure-play technology or a head-to-head basis, I'd say, Traps is the only technology in the market that actually does exploit prevention, right. And then when you combine that with the WildFire to get real-time known malwares, prevention at real-time unknown malware detection and very quick turn on in prevention, that's a very serious technology difference, and not just on a standalone basis, best-of-breed against anything in the market, customers understand that that's real prevention as opposed to the other things that are in the market today. And when you have that in the platform, connected to platform through WildFire, you have the power of WildFire, plus the 7,000-plus WildFire customers where all that information is now being shared on a very, very, fast basis, to in essence automatically reprogram networks and endpoints is extraordinarily compelling. And on the price side from Traps, as we have said before, we're selling Traps on a per endpoint per month basis billed annually over one, two, or three year contracts.
Rob Owens: On the price side, I guess, the question is, are you seeing it at a premium relative to where traditional AV vendors were and that's where you're seeing TAM expansion?
Mark McLaughlin: So on the TAM expansion side, we naturally pick up TAM expansion, because we work the endpoint security business before, so its $4 billion-plus market and we didn't address before and now we have the opportunity to do that. And when we brought Traps to market, we intentionally priced it in the line with traditional endpoint security technologies, because we didn't have to really break any glass there or tread new directions. So we priced it at anywhere from $2 to $5 per endpoint per month on these multiyear contract, one, two or three year contract, so nothing dramatically different than what people are paying already.
Operator: We'll go next to Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.
Jayson Noland: I wanted to ask, Steffan, about the Q4 '16 target of 22% to 25% on margins, like you said that was set back at the IPO in your growth rate has accelerated this last year. Is that still the right target or how do you get comfortable with backing off on growth or doing what you need to do to get there?
Steffan Tomlinson: When we set the target model back at the time of the IPO, we had a philosophy that we want to be balancing growth and profitability. And over the last, call it, three years we have been delivering growth and profitability. And we find that as operating principle that we try to stay true to. So 22% to 25% is what we reiterated exiting Q4 fiscal '16. We believe we can deliver industry-leading growth and expanding profitability over that time period. We give that range for a reason. It gives us latitude to, if we wanted to be at the lower end of the range, we can invest more in the business. If we wanted to be at the higher end of the range, we would let more fall to the bottomline, but with, call it, single-digit market share and close to a $20 billion TAM, we are laser focused on growing both topline and profitability.
Jayson Noland: And then a quick follow-up. At VMware last week, the Palo came up a lot. Maybe, Mark, if you can touch on the relationship with VMware? And then, anything on the software-only side along -- software-only product alongside NSX from VMware?
Mark McLaughlin: I was up there a little while at VMware, which was very-well attended and had a chance to talk to a number of customers, and about NSX and what we're doing with VMware, which is very significant we think. And that there is lot of move into virtualized data centers, security is becoming a paramount concern. And one of the major used case is that the VMware continually talks about, because care about is, micro-segmentation, which is in essence a security used case. And Palo Alto Network for NSX is the answer for these as well as traffic protection in that regard. So we like that relationship a lot. It's opened a lot of doors for us. We're winning deals. We just talked about a seven-figure deal we won at the end of fourth quarter, run NSX, so we like the traction here a lot. And then on the software side, we had completely virtualized everything that we've done before years ago with our VM Series. And then the NSX relationship what we've done with AWS as well is to expand and extend that into the private and public cloud environments, so you can have complete software-based solutions in any of those cloud environments, which is pretty significant and is getting a lot of attention in the market.
Operator: And we'll go next to Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.
Sterling Auty: Mark, in your prepared remarks you talked about the reseller and reseller channels. Do they still have enough capacity with the group that you have to grow and hit all the targets that you have for fiscal '16 or how much channel expansion would you need to deliver your goals this year?
Mark McLaughlin: So couple of years ago, we were thinking about this a lot, which was there is a great opportunity in this market. With our platform approach, we believe that we could capture historic market share. We still continue to believe that. And with vendors, you get into the practicalities or pragmatics of lots of stuff, one of which is capacity for distribution, right. So we were intentionally thoughtful about trying to establish deeper and deeper relationships, not only with the channel partners we have today, but folks you have global reach and a lot of capacity. So we spent a lot of time and effort organizing around that principle as a company from a leadership and talent perspective and then go and work on these relationships, which are now bearing fruit, we were just talking about right now. So we think with the partner community we have today and some of the relationships we're continuing to drive that we've got a lot of capacity to grow and outsize market rates for quite sometime, which is our intent.
Sterling Auty: And then one follow-up, Steffan, you mentioned kind of the sales and marketing expenses in the quarter. You mentioned, both hiring and the commission. Can you give a little bit more detail, how much of the sales and marketing percent of revenue was more due to the overage in and bookings and the commissions that you generated? And the reason why I ask, just so we can get an understanding, why should we see the margin expansion be more backend loaded in fiscal '16?
Steffan Tomlinson: We're not going quantify the exact percentage. It's in the, call it, few percentage points that had an impact for sales commission expense that were related to end of year accelerators and that sort of thing. As we mature as a business, and we have our sales force that proportionately has more ramped sales people than ramping sales people, we achieve that in fiscal '15, we are going to see even more sales people who are fully ramped and that means they're going to be doing more productivity per person, which helps to drive leverage. We also have our reseller and channel infrastructure becoming more productive. And that will be an element that will help drive operating leverage in sales and marketing. And lastly, if you think about our land and expand strategy, the expansion value of our accounts are coming at a much lower cost of sales, because the initial customer acquisition has already been spent and when you look at the proportion of our business coming from our install base relative to new business, at our last Analyst Day, I believe it was about two-thirds coming from in the existing business. And that's a trend that we have seen to be consistent. So as those dynamics play out, we should be getting more leverage in sales and marketing overtime. And that's part of how we're getting leverage to get to the 22% to 25% exiting Q4 FY '16.
Operator: And we'll go next to Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.
Matt Hedberg: Mark, it sounds like you're career grade box doing well. I know you highlighted the PA-7080, as at strong early interest. Can you talk about the performance of your boxes versus other high throughput boxes? And how you guys hold up under increased traffic?
Mark McLaughlin: There is a very different architecture at play here and one that's been a very compelling for our customers, right. So let's use the PA-7080 for example, 200 gigs a second, that is very high performance just in and of itself, but way more importantly it's very high performance with the next generation security that's unique to Palo Alto Network, right. So what we're not doing is we're not trading off performance for turning on additional features sets, because we have an architecture with the single pass engine. So in 200 gigs, we're able to do that with all of the security capabilities that all of our customers have come to know and love, and not have them in a position where to say, you have to have higher and higher performance capability from a box perspective to get lower and lower rates of outcome as you turn on security features. So this is a true architectural difference here that's very compelling. I think pretty well understood by our customer base, when it comes to most importantly security, and then the total cost of ownership.
Matt Hedberg: And then maybe quick follow-up on Traps. 150 customers is a nice data point. I'm wondering, who the most likely buyer is of Traps? It would seem that WildFire would make a lot of sense given its deep integration. I'm wondering is that the right way to think about the next steps for customer additions?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, we've seen adoption in a couple of three different buckets, all of which are fantastic. And you're exactly right; the one that would seem to make the most sense would be people who are using WildFire already, because the integration into the platform is through a WildFire. So if you have a customer with the planned Palo Alto platform, running and using WildFire, the idea that you have endpoint prevention and also that's populating and receiving from WildFire, which then means you get 7,000-plus other networks working for you as well is a great value proposition. Interestingly we've also seen a number of customers who have purchased nothing yet from Palo Alto Networks, except Traps, the very first purchase that they are making, which is fantastic. It's another door opener for us. And then we think can lead to downstream further sales to those folks.
Operator: And we'll go next to Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.
Keith Weiss: As we look into FY '16, you guys do have a lot more products in the product portfolio, both in terms of sort of expanding out the core firewall or your Next-Generation Firewall portfolio, but also going to newer sort of solutions, Traps' distribution is expanding, but also with the new services. Any change in the distribution model or sort of the sales structure to account for the bigger part of portfolio or does everything just go into everybody's tool bag on a go-forward basis?
Mark McLaughlin: It's a good question, Keith. So what we've done historically and it's worked out well for us is when we're bringing something new to market, depending on what that is, and I'll use WildFire as an example of that, building a small overlay team that become experts and what that capability set is. And then having them learn the technology and see what the customer objections are for that, make sure we understand all the things, the technology, and then rolling it out to the entire sales force, depending what that looks like. So we did that for WildFire. We did that and are currently doing that for Traps. We have an overlay sales team, we build up over fiscal '15, and our sales kick off a few weeks ago. We've done a lot of training for the entire sales force for Traps. We quoted everybody on Traps for fiscal '16, now that we have worked out all the how do you solve this thing with that overlay sales team. So those are two areas where we've done. And for Aperture and AutoFocus, those will not have overlay sales teams. Those are great technologies. They're fairly self-explanatory in the sense of how it adds value to the platform. We're confident our sales people will get that.
Keith Weiss: And maybe if I could sneak in one last one just on federal business. From what we are hearing from Check, it sounds like federal spending around security is definitely ramping up again going into the federal fiscal yearend. I know Q1 is not typically a sort of one of your seasonally strong quarters, but how are you guys feeling about that federal business heading into their federal fiscal yearend?
Mark McLaughlin: I was talking about that. Given what the federal government has to do for a living, some of the challenges that are very evident that they are facing, can rebound the papers. And what our technology does, we always thought like that was some vertical we can add, provide a lot of value. Last year it was very tough. I mean the last government fiscal year was very tough, as everybody knew and we heard many times, sort of walking the hallways, as I do out in the Pentagon and places like that, that the next fiscal year for the fed government would be better than the last one and they're working their budget. That appears to be what's happening and that's fantastic for everybody, but for us in particular, given what our technology does and the problems we can solve for their customer base.
Operator: And we'll go next to Michael Turits with Raymond James.
Michael Turits: Different kind of questions about refresh. Historically, you've gotten a lot of opportunity in terms of displacing, let's call it, legacy vendors, Telco or if you like Cisco and Juniper. Is there any slowing of that opportunity or are you still replacing those guys with the same kind of rates and just plenty of roadmap for that runway for that?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, we are. So we haven't seen any changes there, except perhaps acceleration, as you can kind of see from the numbers here, as everybody continues to donate to the cause. And customers see that with their legacy technologies and their point products. What we are seeing is a recognition by the customer base, that if you are really trying to get prevention done, it's very important that, one, you can feel the traffic, which is why we went in the firewall space against legacy stateful inspection firewall vendors. And in addition to that, when you have that architecturally favored position, you should be able to do a lot of prevention with that, which is subsuming a lot of point technologies into URL platform. So that's what we're going to think from.
Michael Turits: So no slowing or shortening of the opportunity there?
Mark McLaughlin: Shortening of the opportunity, sales side do you mean?
Michael Turits: No. I'm sorry, wrong words, but no lessening in the opportunity that you see for displacing legacy vendors?
Mark McLaughlin: No. We continue displacement at very high rates.
Operator: And we'll go next to Brent Thill with UBS.
Brent Thill: Steffan, on the billings number, obviously one of the best numbers you've had in the last couple of years. Was there any change in the billing duration that you saw in Q4, are most of the billing terms pretty similar to what you've seen historically?
Steffan Tomlinson: Billing terms are very similar, and there was really no change in contract duration.
Brent Thill: And for Mark, you highlighted the move into the data centers is one of the bigger opportunities. Is there a way to frame where you're at whether it's a baseball analogy and other approach in terms of how you're thinking about the penetration that you see right now?
Mark McLaughlin: I think it's early. The data center use case for us is growing very rapidly. It's approaching 40% of the business from a sales perspective. And we like that a lot, those are larger devices, lots of subscription services go in there, so that's a great move for us. But when we look at some of the big picture items like the Global 2000, we're very fortunate right now to serve just about half of that. So glass half empty situation there. We got another 1,000 to and we haven't sold the dime till yet. Those are very large companies. All of them have big data centers. And just as a general matter, there is a lot going on in the data center space in general and security is a prime driver, as people think what they're going to do with data centers in the future. So I think we've got a lot of wood to chop in.
Operator: And we'll go next to Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.
Karl Keirstead: One for Steffan and one for Mark. Steffan, the October revenue guide was, I think, well above The Street, but implies sequentially flat revenues, which I don't think we've seen from Palo Alto in the quite some time. My guess is, it's simply a function of the incredible outperformance in the July quarter, which makes for a pretty tough comparison. But I just wanted to ask you, if there is anything else for us to keep in mind? And then, the follow-up for Mark. Mark, the world in August felt like slightly rockier place. My guess is, given your numbers and guide and the fact that you are in the security sweet spot, it had no effect on Palo Alto. But I just wanted to ask you whether you saw any trickle down from what looked like a tough macro into your business?
Steffan Tomlinson: You hit the nail right on the head. Given the 21% sequential growth in Q4, we just saw a very strong finish to the year. And when you look at our guide, while it does imply a flat quarter-on-quarter, we're looking at 46% to 48% year-over-year growth. So there's nothing else going on there, other than just extremely tough sequential compare.
Mark McLaughlin: And Karl, I think big picture for us on the macro, I mean, yes, August was very choppy right from at least from the market perspective. I'm not so sure about all the real macro drivers behind that. And so if you take this week, it feels better than the last week, right. So I wouldn't put too much into looking in the short-term things like that. One of the things I'm very confident of though is that security is here to stay. It's a very important thing for all companies. As I've said before, I think it's becoming a favorite item in every IT decision that's being made, and I don't think that's going to change overtime. As a result of that, we've seen security spending going up. I don't think that's going to change any time soon.
Operator: We'll go next to Fred Grieb with Nomura.
Fred Grieb: Two questions from me. First, on Traps, are you seeing any customers completely replace their AV or maybe move to free AV when they purchase Traps or is Traps largely being deployed as an additional solution kind of additional to existing AV?
Mark McLaughlin: We're seeing both and it's early here, using the baseball analogy, right. It's maybe the top of the first thing, right. And what's going to happen in next generation endpoint security. But in our customer base we sold through, we've seen both things occur. We see more of a compliment, meaning some of these legacy AV, and they're using Traps or another endpoint technology as a compliment to test it out and see what the difference is. Most of those who talked, they say that they are helpful that it's a very different technology, and then you can replace AV overtime, because that would be simpler for that, right. So the less complex networks and endpoint is a good thing for the customers. Some customers they just jump all the way down there, and said look, this does real prevention, because of that no longer need of the AV technology. So there have just been different mindsets right now about how faster when you get to that end state.
Fred Grieb: And then, I guess on that next-gen endpoint side. Who, if anyone, are you seeing in competitive deals, where customer are looking to purchase Traps?
Mark McLaughlin: It's a very crowded market out there right now. It's got the legacy vendors that they are by definition or every deal mean there is some legacy vendor there. We're very familiar with that dynamic, when you think about the firewall space and how to compete and win there. And then there is a lot of smaller players out there, who are trying to make a company on their endpoint technology. In those situations one of the things that we find to be very valuable for Palo Alto Networks is not only does our endpoint capability actually do prevention, but it's part of the larger platform. So particularly for an existing customer already at Palo Alto Networks, you get the value proposition of the platform, having an endpoint capability that does prevention and being tied seamlessly into that platform is a huge differentiator.
Operator: And we'll go next to Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company.
Gregg Moskowitz: Mark as part of the strength that you showed in Q4, are there any verticals that you would call out having done significantly better relative to your expectations?
Mark McLaughlin: No. There is not, Gregg. One of the things we love about this business and it's really just to prove the true platform aspects, what we're doing here is its extraordinarily horizontal in nature. I think last time we talked about, we did say that no vertical is more than 12%, 13% of the business and that continues to be the case. So this is high a degree of utility for all verticals and on a global basis. So to me that gives me great comfort. Everybody there talk about platforms. The truth about measurable platform is, does it have a lot of value very horizontally, and I think we've proven that's the case here.
Gregg Moskowitz: And then just one for Steffan. Your fiscal '16 CapEx guidance is significantly greater than '15, although your CapEx last year did come in roughly $10 million below the midpoint of your guidance. Was some of the expected spend deferred until fiscal '16? Really just kind of wondering, if you could provide some color around that? And if we should think about the fiscal '16 CapEx, as the new normal for Palo Alto or if you think it's a bit inflated for that reason?
Steffan Tomlinson: Sure, Gregg. When you look at what happened with CapEx in fiscal year '15, there is a little bit of timing and lumpiness to it. So some of the FY '15 CapEx ended up from a timing standpoint being delayed relative to projects we're dealing, so that's hitting in FY '16, so that's part of the increase. As we run the business, we will have capital expenditures that are running at different rates, given the projects that we're working on. So currently, we have a burgeoning cloud services business and infrastructure business. If you look at the subscription services growth rates, the WildFire traction we've had, we're processing over 3 million unique files per day, and the amount of traffic there is going there to build the infrastructures for that. So we can't necessarily call a new normal on CapEx. But when you look at CapEx and free cash flow, what we're saying is free cash flow for FY '16 should be greater than 30%, and that's about as far out as we comment.
Operator: And we'll go next to Ryan Hutchinson with Guggenheim.
Ryan Hutchinson: Questions on sales force productivity. I think last quarter you talked about it exceeding 50%. Where does it stand at the end of the fourth quarter? And then as you think about headcount additions and productivity levels 12 months out, just any common would be helpful there? And then any material changes to the comp plan at the beginning of the year that we should be mindful of?
Mark McLaughlin: Ryan, I'll take those in reverse. No material changes to the comp plan. We continue to have about an aggressive comp plan, and people make good money at Palo Alto Networks. You can see that they're doing well with all that they are selling. From the headcount perspective, we are adding a lot of sales heads, just from an absolute number perspective, I think that's obviously because the opportunity is in front of us. We continue to take down big numbers. We'll do that with a balanced approach. But we definitely want to get as much opportunity as we can and deliver on the bottomline as well. So very confident in the ability to balance the profitability and growth of the company.
Steffan Tomlinson: The first question was percentage of folks who are fully ramped. We don't give that specific percentage. We usually hold off until Analyst Day to give that. But we're north of 50%, and it's improving directionally, and which is part of the margin expansion story of the company.
Operator: And we'll take our final question from Jonathan Ho with William Blair.
Jonathan Ho: Just wanted to start out with Tanium partnership. What does this bring to the table in terms of the incident response side? And can this potentially help accelerate the Traps adoption?
Mark McLaughlin: We're happy to have announced that partnership and as with all of our strategic technology partnerships, we've built something first and announced it second, right. So what did we do is, we integrated Tanium capability set into WildFire. And the reason we did that was that when we see an indicative compromise in WildFire, the Tanium technology has the ability to query all the endpoints on an enterprise and see if it's out there. So an easy way to think about that is we're a security company saying we know to what to look for, right from a security perspective. And those guys have a fantastic capability to find things very quickly and demonstrate that scale. So bringing those two things together, allows us to deliver to the customers the detection capabilities, prevention capability and very fast isolation-defined capabilities that are moving into remediation beyond that, right, to the deliver on the roadmap that we laid out for endpoints, of which Traps is extraordinarily important around detection and prevention and to get to isolation remediation as well.
Jonathan Ho: And then European growth seems to always lag the U.S. and other regions. I guess, just want to understand maybe the dynamics there and what sorts of investments you are making towards that region in 2016?
Mark McLaughlin: EMEA has been a tough market for a while on a relative basis, primarily just because of all the macro issues over there and FX fluctuations, right. So we like the growth that we've seen in 30%-some in the fourth quarter, over 40% on a year-over-year basis. So it's a fast-growing market, despite the fact that it's got some challenges that we are not seeing in North America or Asia-Pacific as an example. We think along a long-term basis for all markets and what those opportunities are, one of the primary ways we think about it that is our market share. The market share just as a general matter on a global basis is still relatively low compared to some of the larger competitors and that's even lower, when you look at some of the non-North American region. So we think there is a fantastic opportunity for us to capture a lot of market share, which we intend we would do overtime, so we're investing accordingly. End of Q&A
Kelsey Turcotte: Great. That brings thing to a close. Mark, you want to end up.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. Thank you for being on the call everybody today. We appreciate it. Fiscal '15 was a great year. And I once again want to thank the entire Palo Alto Networks team for all of their hard work and support of our customers and partners. As we look ahead, we are more convinced than ever of our ability to continue to take market share and distance ourselves from the competition. We look forward to updating you on the next call.
Operator: And this does conclude today's conference, everyone. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Palo Alto Networks Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Kelsey Turcotte. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Kelsey Turcotte - Vice President-Investor Relations: Great. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Palo Alto Networks fiscal third quarter 2015 financial results. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed on the Investors section fiscal our website at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. With me on today's call are Mark McLaughlin, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer and Steffan Tomlinson, our Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon we issued a press release announcing our results for the fiscal third quarter ended April 30, 2015. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online on our website. We'd like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our revenue and earnings per share guidance for Q4 of fiscal 2015 and non-GAAP operating margin for Q4 of fiscal 2015 and Q4 of fiscal 2016, as well as our expectations regarding our growth, gross margins, seasonality, future investments, CapEx, leverage, profitability, cash flow, integration with recently acquired CirroSecure, new product and service releases, and competitive position. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future and we undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. For a more detailed description of these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on March 3, 2015 and our earnings release posted a few minutes ago on our website. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in the supplemental financial information that can be found in the Investors section of our website located at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. Before I turn the call over to Mark, we would like to inform you that we expect our fourth quarter fiscal year 2015 earnings conference call will be held after the market closes on Wednesday, September 9. In addition, we will be presenting at the Stephens Spring Investment Conference in New York City on Wednesday, June 3 and the William Blair Growth Stock Conference in Chicago on Thursday, June 11. In addition, at the conclusion of today's conference call, we will be posting our prepared remarks to our Investor Relations website under Quarterly Results. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Kelsey, and thank you, everyone, for joining this afternoon. I'm pleased to report that we had a great third quarter across all metrics with revenue of $234 million, up 55% year-over-year and billings of $302 million, up 56% year-over-year. We also continue to increase the leverage in our operating model with our non-GAAP operating margin expanding to 13.9% and Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.23. Security continues to be a top priority on a global basis and security spending remains strong. Our results demonstrate our market leadership with growth that significantly outpaced the market. We are achieving these results quarter after quarter because our customers and prospects are reacting favorably to our philosophy, strategy, and platform. First, our philosophy is one of breach prevention. We believe that the cyber security battle is a math battle where it's critical to alter the equation such that the odds of launching a successful attack are significantly reduced, which dramatically increases the costs for the attacker. Second, to implement that philosophy our strategy is to have a high degree of breach prevention capabilities at every step in the attack life cycle. And third, our platform is unique in the market in that it provides natively integrated and highly automated breach prevention capabilities that can demonstrably show the benefits of our approach. We know that we have the right platform at the right time in history as customers continue to turn to us to solve problems that legacy technologies, point products, and strategies based primarily on threat detection and remediation cannot. We saw this play out yet again in our Q3 results. During the quarter, we added well over 1,500 new customers, bringing our total number of customers to over 24,000. We also saw significant expansion in the lifetime value of our customers. For example, to make our top 25 customer list in Q3, a customer had to have spent a minimum of $8.2 million in lifetime value, a more than 60% increase over the $5 million required in Q3 of last fiscal year. As we mentioned at Analyst Day, we believe the potential upside lifetime value on our current installed base, assuming spending patterns consistent with our early customer cohorts, is more than $5 billion and growing every quarter. In addition, WildFire continued its rapid growth. We now have over 6,000 paying customers, up from approximately 5,000 last quarter and an increase of approximately 200% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2014. And, on the endpoint, we saw continued momentum in the field with Traps wins that included a U.S.-based oil and natural gas exploration and production company as well as an electric utility holding company in the Southeast. There's a great deal of excitement around Traps given the increase in targeted and complex attacks on the endpoint and the ineffectiveness of legacy products. Finally, we're very proud that Gartner positioned us in the leaders quadrant of the Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Network Firewalls for the fourth year in a row. We also see the power of the platform in the field with large new customer wins that included one of the world's largest multimedia and creative companies where we beat Check Point for a global data center project, one of Europe's largest electronics retailers where we replaced Cisco to secure more than 400 stores and 20,000 employees, a large North American financial services provider where we replaced Check Point and are implementing PA-7050s and Palo Alto Networks for VMware NSX in the data center, including WildFire WF-500 and all subscriptions. And a major win with one of the United States' largest local government authorities where we beat Cisco for an all-encompassing security re-architecture project. All of these wins are validation that our platform approach works and customer feedback is very positive. Our customer satisfaction scores are industry-leading, and our Net Promoter Scores are best-in-class. We had a huge turnout and great interaction with more than 3,000 customers and partners who attended Ignite, our annual user conference. Then, right on the heels of Ignite, we attended RSA where traffic at the booth was overflowing. As a result of these events and the continued scalability of our marketing efforts, our pipeline continues to strengthen because customers and prospects recognize that our platform delivers multiple benefits. It's flexible, allowing customers to utilize any part or all of the platform depending on the current budget, projects and requirements. It's networked, which means customers quickly get the positive impact of leverage and insight from across our customer base. This is important because no one customer alone can change the cost curve on the attacker. And it's extensible, meaning that we are constantly improving our capabilities at each part of the platform as evidenced by the introduction of the PA-3060 and PA-7050 for the data center, continued enhancements to WildFire, the addition of Traps, and the ongoing cycle of new innovation. For example, at Ignite, we announced AutoFocus, our cyber threat intelligence service and to-date more than 750 customers have requested participation in the Community Access programs for this new service which will be generally available in the fall. And today we announced the acquisition of CirroSecure, which is the foundation for a new service to be launched in the fall to provide the most advanced security capabilities in the market for SaaS applications. Our sales efforts continue to scale very well, driven in part by focused execution with partners like Westcon, the largest global security distributor. In fact, in Westcon's last reported quarter, we became their number one security vendor by revenue, surpassing Check Point and other legacy security players. At the same time, our relationship with VMware continues to expand nicely. During the third quarter, we closed several six-figure Palo Alto Networks for NSX deals and very pleased with our growing pipeline. All that we've been able to accomplish is further proof that we continue to differentiate ourselves from the competition with the only true breach prevention platform in the market. As a result, we are rapidly gaining market share and believe that, like in other markets that have historically been fragmented, a platform player can gain more market share over time than any other player has historically. Given our current scale and growth rates, we believe we're on the path to being a leading enterprise security provider. I'd like to end my remarks by thanking our employees and partners for their hard work and dedication. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steffan. Steffan?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Mark. And thank you for joining us on our call today. Before I get into the details of our results and guidance, I'd like to note that, except for revenue figures that are GAAP, all financial figures are non-GAAP unless stated otherwise. I'm very pleased with our Q3 execution as we continue to capitalize on a robust security spending environment with our highly differentiated strategy. Our breach prevention approach delivered by the only true end-to-end platform in the market gives us a competitive advantage you can see in our results. New customer acquisition and expansion in existing customers drove substantial growth across all components of our business, once again resulting in record revenue, deferred revenue, and billings. At the same time, we continue to deliver the operating margin leverage inherent in our quickly ramping hybrid-SaaS model with sequential and year-over-year expansion of non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS, and cash flow from operations. As we head into the last quarter of fiscal year 2015, we remain focused on executing against the market opportunity in front of us. Now let me turn to the numbers. Q3 total revenue grew 55% over the prior year and 8% sequentially to reach a new record of $234.2 million. The geographic mix of revenue for Q3 was 67% Americas, 20% EMEA, and 13% APAC. Compared to the prior year, the Americas grew 60%, EMEA grew 42%, and APAC grew 55%. As in previous quarters, we saw broad strength across a wide range of verticals and we did not have any end customer concentration. As I mentioned, the three components of our hybrid-SaaS model, product, subscription services, and support, all grew well in Q3. Q3 product revenue of $121.5 million increased 44% over the prior year and 5% sequentially. We saw healthy growth across our product portfolio on a year-over-year basis with the data center products growing nicely as we continue to capture share in that important part of the market. Our recurring services revenue of $112.6 million increased 69% over the prior year and 10% sequentially and accounted for a 48% share of total revenue. Looking at the two components of recurring services revenue, the first component is our SaaS-based subscription revenue of $54.8 million, which increased 71% over the prior year and 9% sequentially. Support and maintenance revenue, the second component of recurring services, was $57.8 million, an increase of 67% over the prior year and 11% sequentially. Billings in Q3 were $302.2 million, an increase of 56% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Growth in subscription attach rates and high renewal rates are driving recurring services billings, which positively impacts deferred revenue. Total deferred revenue in Q3 was $603.9 million, an increase of 64% year-over-year and 13% sequentially. Short-term deferred revenue increased to $365.4 million, an increase of 58% year-over-year and 13% sequentially. Total gross margin for Q3 was 77.5%, an increase of 140 basis points compared to last year and a decrease of 30 basis points sequentially. Product gross margin was 76.4%, an increase of 10 basis points year-over-year and a decrease of 70 basis points sequentially. The sequential decrease was due in part to product mix. Services' gross margin for Q3 was 78.6%, an increase of 270 basis points year-over-year and a decrease of 10 basis points compared to Q2. Services' gross margin continues to benefit in part from ongoing growth of our high margin subscription services. For the quarter, research and development expense was 11.7% of revenue, increasing approximately $1 million sequentially to $27.4 million. This is primarily due to head count growth and project-related expenditures. Sales and marketing expense for Q3 was 45.7% of revenue, increasing approximately $7.4 million sequentially to $107 million. This was primarily due to expenses related to our Ignite user conference and RSA as well as head count growth. General and administrative expense for Q3 was 6.2% of revenue, decreasing approximately $2 million sequentially to $14.4 million. This was driven in part by a decrease in outside services. Total head count at the end of the quarter was 2,317, up from 2,083 at the end of Q2 fiscal 2015. In total, Q3 operating expenses were $148.9 million, or 63.6% of revenue. Operating margin grew 480 basis points year-over-year to 13.9%, an increase sequentially of 150 basis points. Net income for the quarter was $20.5 million, or $0.23 per diluted share using 88 million shares compared with net income of $8.7 million, or $0.11 per diluted share in Q3 2014. On a GAAP basis for the third quarter net loss was $45.9 million, or $0.56 per basic and diluted share. This compares with Q3 2014 GAAP net loss of $146.6 million, or $1.96 per basic and diluted share. We finished April with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.2 billion. Our cash flow from operations, free cash flow, and free cash flow margin for Q3 were $87.2 million, $77.4 million, and 33.1%, respectively. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $9.8 million. Consistent with the strength we saw in the quarter, linearity in Q3 tracked better than the prior-year period. Our accounts receivable balance was $150.5 million this quarter, up from $135.3 million in Q2. DSOs increased sequentially by three days and decreased year-over-year by five days to 55 days. Turning to guidance. As we enter Q4, we feel good about the security spending environment and our ability to execute against that opportunity. In Q4 2015, we expect revenue to be in the range of $252 million to $256 million, which represents 41% to 44% year-over-year growth. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.24 to $0.25 per share using 88.5 million to 90.5 million shares. Before I conclude, I'd like to highlight a few considerations for modeling purposes. Due to continued strong growth, seasonality has been difficult to forecast, but we believe that over the longer-term, fiscal Q2 and Q4 may show our strongest revenue growth. We expect CapEx for the fiscal year 2015 to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million for the year. Total consideration for CirroSecure, which closed in the fourth quarter, was $18 million, of which approximately $16 million was cash. And as we said previously, we continue to expect to exit Q4 fiscal 2015 with a low-teens non-GAAP operating margin and to exit Q4 2016 at a 22% to 25% non-GAAP operating margin. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our first question from Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse.
Philip A. Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks, guys. Congrats on another great quarter. I mean obviously you still have good product sales but if I look at the services line and your deferred revenue, it's obviously the attach rate of additional subscriptions keeps trending positively here. I wonder if you can provide us some more color just sort of what you're seeing if there are any sort of – is there any particular subscription that's driving this? And if so, what is that or if it's not kind of just the mix that you're seeing? Thanks.
Steffan C. Tomlinson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: We see a broad strength across our threat prevention, filtering, and WildFire. Those continue to perform very well. Over the past year or so, we've seen modest uptick in GlobalProtect. So the power of the platform that we're delivering to customers is really resonating. So there's not one in particular that is shining more than the rest, but, over the last year, we have seen an uptick in WildFire in particular.
Philip A. Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. And then just one quick follow up. You guys mentioned the VM series product and the relationship with VMware there. Wondering if you could provide just some more color sort of is there any particular vertical that you're seeing this adoption in? Or is it more widespread? And sort of what is the pipeline you think look for that going forward?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Hey, Phil, it's Mark. We're seeing broad interest across the board. It's not vertically specific. We're definitely seeing it as customers are paying attention to virtualization in a big way, moving to the cloud, those sort of concepts are giving us a fantastic opportunity to enter conversations for something that's brand new, right, conceptually brand new for them and where they want to take the future of their networks. And it's a great entry point for us and having such a powerful partner like VMware who is almost always in those conversations with them really helps us a lot. So we like what we've seen so far from a selling perspective and every quarter the pipeline's getting stronger, so we like that a lot.
Philip A. Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Awesome. Congrats, again, guys.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Phil.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Fred Grieb with Nomura.
Fred T. Grieb - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hey. Thanks, guys. Two from me. One, could you give us an update on the demand you're seeing in the service provider segment, particularly for the PA-7050 and is this actually becoming a meaningful growth driver for you?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Fred, it's Mark. Generally, service provider's a good vertical for us and it's growing very well for us, partly that's because of the PA-7050. Generally, they're seeing, the service providers want to secure their own networks, the PA-7050 certainly helps in that and we are seeing them want to be more and more partner with us as systems integrators for other enterprises, all of our technology helps in that. But specific to the service providers is customers, that's been strong and growing very nicely for us and they really like the PA-7050.
Fred T. Grieb - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Great. Thanks. And just as a follow up, moving to Traps. Can you tell us where the budget for Traps is coming from? I guess, specifically, is this new budget that's being created specifically for Traps or is it actually cannibalizing existing endpoint budget?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think it's a mix of both. With what we've seen in the market so far, and what I mean by both is, is that as customers more and more come to the recognition and realization that the legacy AV technology is really not helping them much in today's advanced threat environment, a lot of them are starting to say, let me see what's in the market. So they create some budget to go test. Right? And they're bringing folks in. Traps is definitely on that list for them to run those tests. When they make a buying decision which is, I've made my mind up, what we've seen so far at least in the customer base we've sold to is either repurposing the AV budget and going with free AV and repurposing it to Palo Alto or repurposing a portion of the AV budget and they're just going to give a lot to the AV guys than they used to and taking that savings or remainder and putting it into the next-gen which is more and more us.
Kelsey Turcotte - Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question?
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Question for Steffan. You mentioned again on this call that typically 2Q and 4Q should have their strongest growth. But it feels based on your guide that, this year, the third quarter just reported will end up being the fastest growth, and you also mentioned earlier that the 3Q linearity was better than prior periods. So it feels like 3Q was a stronger quarter than you guys were expecting. So I just wanted to ask you if there was one or two areas where you saw particular growth and if there was any deal pull-forward from the fourth quarter, the July quarter. Thank you.
Steffan C. Tomlinson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Well, first on the seasonality part, what we've always said is – it's more of a prospective statement than anything else, because we've been able to blow through typical seasonality patterns, it's just been hard to call where seasonality really will land as we get bigger. We continue to think Q2 and Q4 will be seasonally stronger. As it relates to this fiscal Q3, we saw great strength across all geos. We saw Americas grow very nicely off of a very large base. EMEA grew 42% year-over-year. APAC grew 55%. So geographically, we saw broad contribution. When we look at product lines, our family of appliances and our chassis, they all sold very well. So there's really a broad strength. And it goes back to the power of the platform. We're going into customers and we have the versatility to sell to any enterprise security need both now on the endpoint and on the network and we're seeing that play out.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, (22:29), it's Mark. I don't think we saw any pull-in from a deal perspective Q4 to Q3. Pipeline's strong for the fourth quarter.
Karl E. Keirstead - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Good to hear. Congrats on the quarter.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Karl.
Steffan C. Tomlinson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.
Keith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you guys and very nice quarter again. I wanted to delve a little bit into the recent acquisition, CirroSecure. And maybe you could just sort of help us understand why this direction in terms of sort of all the adjacent technologies where you could have gone into? What made this one most interesting to you guys and what was it about this technology in particular, because it does look like it was a technology buy for you guys. What's differentiated? What about this technology in particular made you go out and buy these guys?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Well, Keith, as you know very well, part of what we're trying to do from a prevention perspective is to make sure that we can always safely enable the use of applications. That's been a guiding principle for us from the very beginning is to make applications that people want to use safe. So, of course there are lots of things going on in the technology land out there around security, but with that as a guiding principle we're really interested in this area because there's such an increasing use of SaaS applications. For a very long time, our platform has done a fantastic job of securing SaaS applications that come across the network, meaning from a threat perspective. What's interesting about this and the reason we really like the Cirro guys is the unique approach they've taken to go a step further in sanctioned, meaning applications that companies want to use. Right? Sanction SaaS applications, and this technology gives us – and it is a technology purchase plus people purchase as well. These are guys that are in the market, they have a handful of customers so we validated technology. It gives us a deep level of visibility into the applications themselves from a data and user perspective. So we can see actually what's happening with the data, what is the data, who's using it. And from that we can tell very, very quickly if it's being used or misused, either intentionally or unintentionally. So it's another strong, safe enablement play for SaaS applications, which is a really fast growing trend, as you know, for customers. So that's why we really liked it, and these guys have something really interesting.
Keith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And if I can ask one follow up on the distribution side of the equation, we've been talking for a while about the ramp-up of some of these distribution deals. You guys mentioned Westcon on the conference call. Where are we in that kind of cycle of ramping them up? How much further is there to go in getting on new distribution capacity, particularly from some of these larger agreements that you guys recently signed?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. We've very optimistic about the ability to continue to do that. We've highlighted it at Westcon a few times. The reason for that is they're the largest security distributer out there. And as you can kind of tell from the results we've talked about before, including now being their number one security provider, that's ramping very nicely. That's not the only thing we're doing. We're working with other distribution partners as well, who we've been working with for quite some time and are aggressively partnering with them in order to continue to ramp with them as well on a global basis. So there's a lot going on here in that regard. And it's important for our future to be able to get the capacity. As you can tell, people really want to buy our technology. Right? So we want to make sure that we have the capacity to fulfill that on a global basis.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Michael Turits with Raymond James.
Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Michael Turits. Thanks a lot. Hey, guys. A question on the discussion around the firewall spending cycle, if it exists. Obviously, firewall spending, network security spending has been strong in the last couple of years. Is there any sense that that has, in any way, peaked last year? Or there's any shifts in terms of priority of spend this year to other areas besides network security?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. You know, well, seems like (26:17) it's a really good question. I mean, across the board, security spending remains very strong, which is fantastic. I mean – and the reason it's great obviously for all security companies, with us in particular, is what the trending is we're seeing. So traditionally, you'd see people refreshing into – from a firewall perspective or other technology perspective, and that would be the opportunity to talk to somebody. Those refresh cycles continue to happen all the time. What's really good for us since we've got the platform, the customer can be inserted or onboarded at any point in that platform for whatever they feel like the most pressing use case may be. It might be the firewall. It might be IPS. It might be Advanced Persistent Threats. It might the endpoint. It doesn't matter in a sense that we can deliver the solutions they need at the time and grow from that. So we see cycles of buying being very strong as a general matter and, specifically, we're pleased with the ability to be differentiated to come in at any point in whatever those buying cycles are.
Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And just to follow up to that, if I can. Sort of similar question on cycles. Someone asked last quarter if you were beginning to see a refresh of your own base, and do you have any further visibility into that at this point?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, we watch that closely, of course. And what we said earlier on that is, we are seeing our own customers starting to refresh in the earlier cohorts. And that's not surprising given four-year to five-year refresh cycles. And we also like the fact that when we're seeing those folks come back to us that we've been able to, in a lot of cases, sell them larger devices because their needs have grown, more subscription services because they realized the power of the subscription services and we've brought more to market, as well. One of the most interesting data points for me on that when I think about it is, if you look at the 2009 and 2010 cohort combined, it's like 2,000 customers and we have over 24,000 now. So if that pattern holds from our own refresh in our customer base, there's a lot of buying in there in the future.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Matthew Niknam with Goldman Sachs.
Matthew Niknam - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Just a couple on CirroSecure. Any color you can share on how you plan on pricing the CirroSecure technology once that's rolled out later this year? And then maybe if you can talk to any sort of incremental spending, whether it's sales and marketing, R&D tied to rolling out that subscription. Want to get a sense of any sort of margin impacts we can expect in upcoming quarters. Thanks.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, so from a pricing perspective, we'll give more data around this when we get closer to the fall (29:01), but generally we're anticipating we'd price it on an application user basis and we'll get more specific about that when we bring that to market. And, Steffan, as to the margins?
Steffan C. Tomlinson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. So with the technology acquisition and a small team of people coming over, we plan to absorb this from an R&D standpoint. And from a sales and marketing standpoint, we're not going to be adding an overlay of sales team. This will be sold by our normal teams here. So the impact will be modest. And we've reiterated our low-teens operating margin exiting Q4 and also the 22% to 25% non-GAAP operating margins exiting Q4 of next year. So we feel good about the ability to execute without any dilution.
Matthew Niknam - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's great. Thanks.
Steffan C. Tomlinson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer.
Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Hi, good afternoon, guys. Congrats on another set of strong results. Two quick questions on my end. Thank you, guys, for the color on the VMware partnership, on the Westcon. But any color you can share with us on the Splunk relations at this point?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. We love Splunk; they're very good partners of ours and I think they feel the same way about us. I think you can see from Splunk results, as they continue down the path of their platform that security becomes an increasingly large use case for them, not surprising, given what they do with the data. And what we have found, and I think they found, from our joint customers consistently tell both of us is, when you put Palo Alto Networks data off of our platform through a Splunk platform, you get very actionable intelligence to use for security purposes and customers like that a lot. So we continue to work with them, not only in the technology side, but also in the go-to-market side as well.
Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. We've all heard that over the course of the past few quarters, board of directors have started to get involved in this security decision process, spending process. Mark, what can you tell us on that front? Are you meeting more with boards? Are you being called into those urgent board meetings?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I think boards are definitely becoming more involved. It's a total top of mind issue, right, and it's growing in nature. I do get the opportunity to speak with board members and boards. I would tell you, as I said before, it's not that they're the urgent meetings, meaning it's not the panicked meeting, it's more and more folks being very thoughtful saying, hey, we've got to think about this over a multi-year basis, not what we read in the paper yesterday. So how do we come up with a solution that is – takes care of us on a longer period of time, at the best possible way? And the way we speak to that is through a security reference architecture about what the next-generation reference architecture should look like from a security perspective, and obviously Palo Alto has a lot to bring to bear on that and we certainly talked through that with them. But it's more at the level of saying, here's what's happening in the world. You have to have a prevention philosophy, first and foremost. Doesn't mean you shouldn't do other things, but it means if you're not doing prevention, first and foremost, you're thinking that way, then you're going to be behind the curve in a way you can never recover from, and then here's what a reference architecture would look like that has that mindset. And then, obviously, Palo Alto has got an important part of that and we get the chance to talk about that too.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.
Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. Thank you. Wanted to ask about AutoFocus first. You mentioned 750 customer requests. Do you have a feel for the size of the market? And what the trajectory of adoption would be?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. So what we mentioned there, Jayson, was that when we – if we back up for a minute, at Analyst Day we said, we would do a Community Access program the first thing because that would give us the chance to put the technology into market, let customers play with it and give us fantastic feedback, which we are now getting. When we announced that and said, anybody who would be interested in being part of the Community Access program, we had over 750 of our existing customers show up for that WebEx to raise their hand and say, I want to be in that, which is fantastic. I think it's interesting – I think it's a sign of strong interest in the technology, and then also a sign of hopefully a strong pipeline for folks who may want to purchase the technology when we bring it to market. As far as what the market looks like for that, there is an increasingly high demand for intelligence and analytics in security. I've not yet met a customer that has told me if I'd just had some more data, I would be better off. All of them tell me that what I need is to make sense of what I have, frankly, whether it comes from Palo Alto or anybody else, right? And what AutoFocus does is it takes the data off of literally billions of pieces of information that we have across our very fast growing customer base, and it burns the haystack down. And it just leaves the needles. And it shows which of the needles are sitting on top of each other and which are separate. Right? And that is very actionable intelligence that people are finding to be very interesting. So we anticipate that there'll be a good degree of interest in this, and we look forward to getting it to the market in the fall.
Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, that makes sense. And then Steffan, any color you can provide on over-under performance by vertical? I think you'd said at the Analyst Day that high-tech is the largest vertical at 14%?
Steffan C. Tomlinson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: We saw a very broad distribution, again, across all verticals. High tech continued to perform well. Financial services, public sector, those are our top three. But when I say top three, the largest one lifetime-to-date is, call it, 14% individually. So we saw a very nice broad strength across all verticals, which again goes to the point that we underscore every vertical needs the platform solution, and we're in the business of helping every industry and every customer.
Operator: We have a question from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Co.
Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you. And congratulations on a very strong quarter as well. Steffan, I think last quarter you extended your product lead-times from two weeks to four weeks. Just wondering where that stands today? And what you expect going forward?
Steffan C. Tomlinson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Our product lead-times are, again, call it, standard two weeks. We've worked through some of the issues that we had, and we never had any customer satisfaction issues. So we were good on that front.
Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Perfect. And then on WildFire, Mark, are the paid users primarily coming from mining the installed base just looking over the past 90 days? Or are you seeing higher new customer attach as well?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We're seeing great attach on new sales as well as the existing customer base. I think the distinction there is no longer relevant between the two. We brought that to market. We gave it for free for a while in the installed base, just to get people to use it. And the free aspect is no longer relevant whatsoever. We're over 6,000 paid customers and growing very rapidly.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Rob Owens with Pacific Crest Securities.
Ben McFadden - Pacific Crest Securities: Hey, guys. This is Ben on for Rob. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start with the traction that you're seeing in the data centers? Maybe you can provide a little bit of color as far as where you're seeing the most traction. And are you – and what's the split between Internet-facing data centers versus the internal enterprise data center type market?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, we're seeing broad strength across the board in data centers. I think just fundamentally because there's so much increase in application usage, bandwidth and what folks are doing. So it's a very positive trend across the board. But between the two you mentioned, we're seeing a lot of the use cases in the internal side.
Ben McFadden - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay, great. And then on the Traps endpoint solution, is there any functionality that we should view as needed to increase the endpoint functionality up to a level that can completely replace the existing endpoint products that are out there? Or do you believe that where it sits right now it provides all of the functionality that is needed?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: That's a great question, Ben. A couple of things. At the very highest levels, the way we've viewed the roadmap from an endpoint perspective, and when we decided to buy Cyvera, we did it against this roadmap concept of saying a great endpoint would have real prevention capabilities. It would have good detection capabilities. And it would also have the ability to do some level of, I'll call it, automated remediation to find that stuff and remediate it. And when it did those things, it would not break the native application experience, and it would use as little compute and battery power as possible. So, before we bought anything, that was our roadmap that we had in mind. If you think through that, the highest order of bit in there is prevention. Of all the things that I just mentioned, the most important would be prevention. So that's why we focus very, very heavily on that. And that's why we bought Cyvera, because it brings real prevention capabilities into the market. And we'll fill out the rest of that roadmap over time. Now your specific question, though, is can you use Traps and replace AV, I think that's what you're asking, right? And what we've seen customers do is to say, they think of it a different way, they say I'm interested in security. Right? So I need secure endpoints. And that roadmap I gave you, gives you secure endpoints, and the most important part is prevention. So I think when they want to have security, they are saying give me something different. It can be different or complementary frankly to my legacy AV, but I need security not AV. Right? So we're seeing some customers, like I mentioned before, run them side by side. We're seeing some customers just say, I'm just going down the security angle, I don't really need the AV since it's not doing a lot for me anyway. It's really a mixed bag. It's a very dynamic market right now, meaning it's moving quickly, and I think it's moving in a direction of security, and that's where we're primarily focused.
Ben McFadden - Pacific Crest Securities: Great. Thank you.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.
Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Mark, I had a follow up to the prior question on Traps. You mentioned several wins in the quarter and obviously some of the features that customers are looking at here. But can you talk about maybe just the pace of business coming out of Ignite? And is there anything else you can help us with to help quantify the trajectory of that as we think to 2016?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. We like – so we like the market. It's a big, opportunity that held a lot of interest in it as well. We're selling well in there. We continue to close dozens and dozens of deals every quarter. We've sold multiple millions of dollars' worth of Traps to-date, and we would expect that we'd continue to have a good ramp as we go into 2016 and that 2016 will be a good selling year for us.
Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC: That's great. And then Steffan, your hybrid-SaaS model certainly is resonating. Can you remind us about the amount of in-quarter revenue you need to obtain in order to hit the midpoint of your guidance?
Steffan C. Tomlinson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: No, we don't get into that level of specificity. But what I can tell you is you look at just the mix from a revenue standpoint, and if you look at product revenue this quarter it was about 51.9% so that that product revenue number is typically the go-get number that we need in order to hit the overall guidance. Of course, there is some subscription services that we can count on as revenue in the quarter, but most of that's ratable in nature. So it's really focused on product revenue as the go-get. That's the primary driver. And we've been – we've seen very nice traction with our appliances. You look at the year-over-year growth rates, they've been very healthy. And then we have increasing subscription attach rates. And you're really seeing the power of the overall model when you look at the revenue results.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Brent Thill with UBS.
Brent J. Thill - UBS Securities LLC: Steffan, you mentioned the Q3 linearity was a lot better than the last year. Is that better sales execution just a sign of the overall demand environment being so good for your sector? Just curious if you could give a little more comment on what you saw in the quarter?
Steffan C. Tomlinson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, it's a combination of things. But as we get more quarters under our belt in sales execution, which is already very high, continues to excel, so that was a big boost when you do a year-over-year comparison. From a market standpoint, we see lots of great traction across all verticals. So there's – we've seen a healthy spending environment, and that's also contributed. So those two factors really help with the linearity.
Brent J. Thill - UBS Securities LLC: And just real quick, on the long-term deferred revenue you continued to see acceleration over the last several quarters. Can you maybe just walk through what you're seeing in that line item that is yielding that type of result?
Steffan C. Tomlinson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. So we see very good growth in both short-term and long-term deferred revenue. The dynamic that we're seeing in long-term deferred revenue is we have lots of customers. In fact some of our largest customers are looking to do multi-year deals with us. And that's great and that's goodness because we are now designed into their fabric and we can participate knowing that we have a long-term partner with those customers. The sales force is not – they're not more incented to sell long-term deals. They do have a little bit of skin in the game. They do get commission on long-term deals, but there's no extra incentive on that front, so we feel good about any time we can get long-term deals that are booked-in into the business.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Gur Talpaz with Stifel.
Gur Yehudah Talpaz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. So with CirroSecure, there are a lot of vendors out there trying to do cloud/SaaS security. Can you maybe talk about the advantages Cirro has versus players, like Adallom or Skyhigh or Alaska (43:12), that have been sort of well-funded and picked up a lot of steam over the last year? And then maybe going one step further, the advantages the customer might have by deploying a unified solution with a firewall as opposed to a standalone solution? Thank you.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Gur. Great question. Well, a couple thoughts in there. So there are a lot of players in the market. Just the one commonality I'd put at the very top of the list is enabling SaaS applications is an aspect that should be part of the platform. So just as a general matter, this is I think another example of the market of things that will be part of platforms over time, and as the leading platform provider, we absolutely intend to provide that capability so that customers are not forced to buy yet another point solution in the market. When you think about what those various vendors are doing, there's a whole mix of approaches. One thing they do is they take – they give visibility in the SaaS applications being used. Again and again and again when we talk to our customers, we hear them say, all they're doing is taking your log data from Palo Alto Networks and presenting it. Now they do that in a very nice manner, but that's one of the value props is take the value of the log data and present it to us. There's no reason we can't do that and we will do that. Another approach they've taken is doing reverse proxy technology, trying to get in the traffic flow to see things. We are extremely experienced folks from a networking perspective. That is not a great approach. It just doesn't scale over time, breaks applications. And then a third aspect of this is what we described in what Cirro has really cracked the nut on and that is actually having the hook into the applications themselves in order to see the data and the users of the data and having a really great analytics tool associated with that so you can see what's happening in the application itself with the data and users. We like that approach a lot. It's about safe enablement. It's scalable. It doesn't break applications. It's got a lot going for it and that's what we really particularly liked about those guys. So combining that capability set with us providing our own level of viewpoint off of our log data about SaaS applications is what you can expect us to do.
Gur Yehudah Talpaz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Awesome. Thank you very much. Great quarter.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Michael Kim with Imperial Capital.
Michael Wonchoon Kim - Imperial Capital LLC: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. You talked a little bit about customer adoption of Traps. Is it primarily new customers to WildFire including Traps, or existing WildFire customers adding Traps? And are you seeing it primarily in the Global 2000, or is it pretty much across the customer base?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: The good news is it's across customer base. So there's not a pattern there in a good way. Right? There's a lot of interest from customers, from smaller customers, larger customers. Doesn't matter in the vertical. I think naturally those customers who are already using Palo Alto technology tend to get the story faster because they have Palo Alto technology from a platform perspective. And those who are using WildFire already have seen the value and benefit of WildFire. And the combination of Traps and WildFire is a very powerful thing. So they get it even faster than others. But just as a general matter, we're seeing interest across the board.
Michael Wonchoon Kim - Imperial Capital LLC: Great. And then just briefly on AutoFocus, is your plan to continue to expand the program beyond the 750 customers before you go GA? Or do you feel comfortable with this kind of level of initial interest to really get you to a comfortable level in GA?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes. That's a really good question. Actually we would have less than 750 people in the Community Access program. So just to run a good program like that, that'll be measured in the dozens not the hundreds. We just mentioned the fact that 750 people wanted to be in it, this is an indication of interest. But just to have a really focused effort to get good feedback, it will be much smaller than that.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jonathan Ho of William Blair.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. I just wanted to get a sense of what you're seeing out there in terms of competitive win rates and whether you're seeing maybe continued improvement or whether it's become fairly stable at this point?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Competitive win rates are very high. We continue to take share from all the legacy providers that are out there. When we get into a deal, which we're able to do more and more given just the brand recognition, the size of the team that Mark's running, increased global coverage from a distribution and reseller perspective, we win a very, very high amount of the times. And I think that's not obvious, it's showing through from the results.
Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. And then as you broaden sort of the product base, are you seeing more sort of I guess tips of the spear or opportunities to get into accounts with now multiple touch points? And has that helped to sort of bring the platform in from a variety of different angles?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, there's two things that are really helpful there. The first is, is that our sales team is very quickly being educated and being able to have conversations, I'll call it the higher strategic level of folks. So it's a platform level conversation. The customer's going to say I have a need or I have a pain point. Right? The sales force knows that before you jump in on that, the right conversation to have with them is what is our philosophy and how do we bring that philosophy to bear with the platform? Because it shows how not only we're going to solve that pain point for you, but other pain points that are associated with that, maybe ones you're not even thinking of yet. And then of course we'll address specifically why they asked us into the room in the first place. We're just going to do it in the context of the platform.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Matt Williams with Evercore.
Matthew Lee Williams - Evercore Group LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I'm just curious if there's anything or any geos specifically in the international market that you guys are particularly focusing on? I know it's obviously a huge opportunity, so just curious if there's specific sort of sub geos that you're more focused on than others? Or any commentary around that would be great.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Two just real general comments around it, Matt. One is we like to go where the money is, that might be an obvious statement, but not all of the sub geos inside of theaters are the same from a wallet and spend perspective. So we're – I think we're educated about that. Like, Australia is a great market, for example, and APAC. The Middle East is a fast growing market. There's a lot of money there as well. And then we're also very focused on the Global 2000. And when you actually write them down on a piece of paper, who are they and where are they headquartered, that's pretty telling about where they are – more than 50% of them are in Asia for example. So we're trying to be thoughtful and educated about where we put our resources, and those are two of the just guides that I've given you about how we think about that outside the United States.
Matthew Lee Williams - Evercore Group LLC: Great. That's helpful. Maybe just one quick follow up, if I could. Are customers in that initial commitment to you guys, are you seeing much change in sort of the average initial commitment from a dollar perspective? Meaning, are they more comfortable committing a higher dollar value than maybe they were a couple quarters ago? Is that continuing to trend up in terms of the larger and larger commitments right out of the bat?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, two aspects of that. One, just as a general matter, I'll call it the ASP right across the board of all their customers is it continues to rise quarter after quarter. That's just a general deal comment regardless of size of the customer. And then more and more customers, again with a focus on larger accounts, we're definitely seeing folks sign-up to a larger initial purchases and larger follow-on orders as well if they're already using our technology. So the trends are very positive there.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our last question from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray.
Andrew J. Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just two quick questions. So, number one, will customers deploy CirroSecure as a subscription on your firewall or it can be deployed it as a standalone product like Traps, and then will it integrate with WildFire?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: It can be standalone. So it's possible to do it that way. I think the real power will be in using it in conjunction with the firewall, because if you think of what I said earlier we're already basically (51:09) enabling applications across the network from a threat perspective. So that's – there's real power in associating it with the firewall. And yes, it will be integrated with Traps. That's a very good point that I didn't mention before. Very much like we did with...
Steffan C. Tomlinson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: WildFire.
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: ...I'm sorry, with WildFire. So one of the things we'll do right away is we'll take the technology over the next couple of months and integrate it with WildFire. We'll take it off the market, like we did with Traps, we'll do the integration with WildFire, like we did with Traps, and we'll bring it back to market. And WildFire has shown a very compelling value in being able to look at traffic, so we'll definitely provide that capability set with the Cirro technology as well.
Andrew J. Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Great. And then I just want to go back real quick to one of the high-level spending trends that you mentioned because I think there's some concern that spending on firewalls maybe starting to peak. So I guess are you seeing customers trying to consolidate their security infrastructure? And is the firewall the most logical place for that? And if so, do you think vendors without firewall are at a disadvantage for growth over the next three-plus years?
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: What we see an inexorable trend toward is trying to do prevention and the best way to do it is with a platform that is very integrated with highly automated outcomes. So that's what's happening in the market and you can think about it as consolidation, but I think customers think it less about consolidation than you do is what's the outcome of the consolidation, which is a higher level of security because you have those integrated and automated outcomes. For that reason, over time, I don't know how long, but over time, I think if you're providing point solutions in a traditional legacy model, you have a real problem there because the solutions should be at the firewall level because that's the device that sees all the traffic in the first place. And that's why we started there and that's why we consistently natively integrated these capability sets into the firewall because it has the total visibility.
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mark McLaughlin, at this time, I'll turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks
Mark D. McLaughlin - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Great. Thanks, everybody, for being on the call this afternoon. As I said earlier, we're right in the right place to market at the right time in history with the market's leading breach prevention platform. And I really want to thank all the Palo Alto Networks team for their hard work and their support of our customers and our partners as we continue our march to becoming the global leader in enterprise security. Thanks a lot for your interest and we'll talk with you in September.
Operator: That concludes today's conference, and thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Palo Alto Networks’ Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Kelsey Turcotte. Please go ahead.
Kelsey Turcotte: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today’s conference call to discuss Palo Alto Networks’ fiscal second quarter 2015 financial results. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed on the investor’s section of our website at Investors.PaloAltoNetworks.com. With me on today’s call are Mark McLaughlin, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer and Steffan Tomlinson, our Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon we issued a press release announcing our results for the fiscal second quarter ended January 31, 2015. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online on our website. We would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements including statements regarding our revenue and earnings per share guidance for our fiscal third quarter, and non-GAAP operating margin for Q4 of fiscal 2015 and Q4 of fiscal 2016 as well as our expectations regarding our growth, gross margins, seasonality, future investments, CapEx, leverage, profitability, cash flow and competitive position. These forward-looking statements involved a number of risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward statements apply as of today and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future and we undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. For a more detailed description of these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 25, 2014 and our earnings release posted a few minutes ago on our website. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in the supplemental financial information that can be found in the investor’s section of our website located at Investors.PaloAltoNetworks.com. Before I turn the call over to Mark, we’d like to inform you that we expect our third quarter fiscal year 2015 earnings conference call will be held after the market closes on Wednesday May 27. In addition, we would like to invite institutional investors and sell side analysts to join an investor track at Palo Alto Networks Ignite Conference at the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas. Our program will start with lunch at noon on Monday, March 30th, formal presentations will kick off at 01:00 PM Pacific time. While the event will be webcast, guests who attend in person are invited to stay for the conference which will run through Wednesday, April 1st. To register, please e-mail me at kturcotteme@PaloAltoNetworks.com or call me at 408-753-3872. And with that, I will turn it over to Mark.
Mark McLaughlin: Thank you, Kelsey, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. I’m pleased to report that delivered very strong results in our second quarter across all metrics and I would like to thank our team and our partners for their support and hard work. In Q2, revenue was $280 million, up 54% year-over-year and billings were $283 million, up 51% year-over-year. We also continued to show the leverage in our operating model with non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 12.4% as well as Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $0.19. Our results continue to demonstrate our belief that our next generation enterprise security platform is highly differentiated and is the right approach to security at the right time in history. And that our business model is unique in allowing us to deliver industry leading revenue growth rates at scale while doing so with consistently increasing leverage. At the highest levels, it's more and more evident that the world has changed and that cyber security is now critical to the fabric of all things related to technology, business and national security. This means that cyber security has attained a status as a fundamental imperative for every company and organization in the world and that this paradigm shift is not abating but likely to continue for many years.  It is also becoming increasingly obvious that legacy technology solutions are incapable of protecting businesses in the age of sophisticated and aggressive cyber attacks. What is needed is a true enterprise-class integrated and automated platform, capable of not only detection but prevention as well.  Palo Alto Networks is delivering this platform and as a result we were able to capture more market share more quickly than other companies have been able to do so in the past. Our customers consistent feedback is that they are more secure when using our platform than they were with previous legacy architecture and as a side-benefit they're spending less on an integrated platform than they used to buy cobbling together desperate point products.  In addition to having the right platform at the right time in history, we have also been working very diligently to ensure that we can execute well against a large and growing addressable market opportunity. This requires continuing to develop our world-class sales and distribution capabilities, including doing some unique things like hosting our partner representatives in our sales and technical training as well as ensuring that all the other functions required to support the company's continued fast growth are scale well.  I'm exceptionally proud of the team in this regard and we continue to plan and invest for outsized market share gains while not losing sight of driving leverage in the model. As you can see from our results, the market is voting in favor of our philosophy approach and platform. And we are beating and displacing the competition at very healthy rate and quickly becoming the industry standard.  In Q2, we added well over 1,500 new customers, bringing our total customer count to over 22,500, more than 40% increase year-over-year. And our global and major account focus continues to pay off with us now serving 81 of the Fortune 100 and 916 of the Global 2000.  Examples of new customer wins this quarter include a CheckPoint and Cisco replacement at one of the United States’ largest energy providers that purchased high-end data center appliances in combination with subscription services, including WildFire; a global financial institution in Europe who replaced CheckPoint and Cisco and sold PA-7050s for the data center and working with our partner, VMware, also included Palo Alto Networks’ edition for NSX; and one of the world’s largest insurance companies where with our partner, Dimension Data, we’re replacing incumbent Cisco and a global firewall refresh and won a very competitive bake-off for an APT solution with WildFire.  On the expand side of the business, we know that satisfied customers make repeat purchases, and we’ve placed a great deal of emphasis on customer service and support. Our customer satisfaction scores are among the highest in the industry, and we continue to invest in the infrastructure and talent required to ensure that our customers are getting the most out of their technology investment.  As a result, we see significant expansion in the lifetime value of our customers. For example, to make our top 25 customer list in Q2, a customer had to have spent a minimum of $7.4 million in lifetime value, a more than 60% increase over the $4.6 million required in our Q2 of our last fiscal year. These customers typically make purchases quarter after quarter, as they you add new products and subscriptions. In fact, all of our top 25 customers placed a repeat order with us in Q2.  Additionally, we continue to widen the innovation gap with new products and subscription services, which address our customers’ greatest security needs and are driving a market share shift in our favor. In the high-end data center market, our 120-gig PA-7050 chassis continues to resonate with enterprise customers across all verticals. This quarter, we closed multiple seven-figure PA-7050 deals to protect north-south data center traffic including one with a multibillion-dollar North American media company. When coupled with our Palo Alto Networks Edition for NSX to secure east-west traffic, we have a very compelling and highly differentiated data center security solution.  In the mid range data center market, the PA-3060, which we launched in Q2, did very well further expanding our footprint in that segment of the market. WildFire had yet another strong quarter as well. We now have over 5,000 customers paying for WildFire, up from approximately 4,000 last quarter. WildFire is being purchased across all verticals with organizations including an international digital-based e-commerce and a large North American based public utility company making purchases in the quarter. Both are examples of businesses that bought WildFire for its ability to turn unknown threats into known threats in a matter of minutes and the benefits of its automated threat intelligence sharing over the entire customer base.  Q2 was our first full quarter in the market with Traps or advanced end point protection solution integrated with WildFire. Traps opens an incremental $4 billion endpoint market, which is yet untapped for us. Similar to what we saw in firewall market about a decade ago, we believe that legacy endpoint solutions have not kept pace with the threat landscape, leaving customers vulnerable to attack and the market right for disruption.  In Q2, we added dozens of new Traps customers and closed our first seven-figure transaction with a large healthcare organization. Although it’s early, we are pleased with our progress and are excited about the future in this market. It’s a very exciting time in general for Palo Alto Networks. I consistently tell our team that our platform is solving very hard problems for our customers and as a result, we believe that we have the potential to capture a historic market share in a very large addressable market and that we have only just begun.  We believe that our innovation engine, proven and scalable go-to-market capabilities and focus on scalable support capabilities will allow us to drive outsized growth, while standing profitability and generating significant cash flow with our model.  Before I conclude, I'd like to reiterate Kelsey’s invitation to join us for Ignite 2015 Conference and Investor Track starting Monday, March 30th at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas. I hope to see all of you there.  With that, I'll wrap it up and turn the call over to Steffan. Steffan?
Steffan Tomlinson: Thank you, Mark, and thank you for joining us on our call today. Before I get into the details of our results and guidance, I'd like to note that except for revenue figures that are GAAP, all financial figures are non-GAAP unless stated otherwise.  In Q2, we continue to execute well against our land, expand and retain sales strategy and are pleased with both the rate of new customer additions as well as expansion in our current customers. Growth in sales of products, subscriptions and supports drove double-digit sequential growth resulting in record billings, revenue and deferred revenue.  Additionally, with approximately 47% of total revenue coming from occurring services, our hybrid SaaS revenue model and ramping economies of scale continue to drive leverage in the business, resulting in strong non-GAAP operating margin and free cash flow this quarter.  I'm very pleased with the results in the first half of fiscal 2015. We believe we can continue to capitalize on macro tailwinds and security spend, the technological advantage of our next generation platform and the untapped spend in our large customer base, to drive growth and continue to take market share as we head into the back half of our fiscal year and beyond.  Now let me turn to the numbers. Q2 total revenue grew 54% over the prior year and 13% sequentially to reach a new record of $217.7 million. The geographical mix of revenue for Q2 was 67% Americas, 21% EMEA, and 12% APAC. Compared to the prior year, the Americas grew 62%, EMEA grew 35% and APAC grew 51%. As in previous quarters, we saw a broad strength across a wide range of verticals, and we did not have any end customer concentration.  The three components of our hybrid SaaS model – product, subscription and support – all grew very well in Q2. Q2 product revenue of $115.6 million increased 43% over the prior year and 14% sequentially. We saw healthy growth in our mid-range PA-3000 series, high-end PA-5000 series and PA-7050. In particular, the PA-7050 continued to show strength and is a catalyst to capture more market opportunity in the data center market. Our recurring services revenue of $102 million increased 69% over the prior year and 12% sequentially and accounted for a 47% share of total revenue. Looking at the two components of recurring services revenue, the first component is our SaaS-based subscription revenue of $50.1 million, which increased 74% over the prior year and 15% sequentially.  Support and maintenance revenue, the second component of recurring services, was $52 million, an increase of 65% over the prior year and 10% sequentially. Billings in Q2 were $282.8 million, an increase of 51% year-over-year and 18% sequentially.  Growth in subscription attach rates and high renewal rates are driving recurring services billings, which positively impact deferred revenue. Total deterred revenue in Q2 was $535.8 million, an increase of 65% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. Short-term deferred revenue increased to $324.5 million, an increase of 60% year-over-year and 13% sequentially.  Total gross margin for Q2 was 77.8%, an increase of 250 basis points compared to last year and 100 basis points sequentially. Product gross margin was 77.1%, an increase of 160 basis points year-over-year and 200 basis points sequentially. The sequential increase was due in part to favorable product mix. We expect there will be fluctuations in product gross margin primarily due to mix. Services gross margin for Q2 was 78.7%, an increase of 350 basis points year-over-year and 10 basis points sequentially, due in part to ongoing growth and the contribution from high margin subscription services.  For the quarter, research and development expense was 12.2% of revenues, increasing approximately $3.6 million sequentially to $26.5 million. This is primarily due to headcount growth and project related expenditures. Sales and marketing expense for Q2 was 45.8% of revenue, increasing approximately $9.6 million sequentially to $99.6 million. This is primarily due to an increase in headcount and sales commissions related to the first half sales performance.  General and administrative expense for Q2 was 7.4% of revenue, increasing approximately $2.1 million sequentially to $16.4 million. This was driven in part by headcount growth in outside services. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was 2,083, up from 1,900 at the end of Q1 fiscal 2015. In total, Q2 operating expenses were $142.5 million or 65.4% of revenue. Operating margin grew 340 basis points year-over-year to 12.4%, and increased sequentially 180 basis points.  Net income for the quarter was $16.9 million or $0.19 per diluted share, using 86.6 million shares compared with net income of $7.8 million or $0.10 per diluted share in Q2, 2014. On a GAAP Basis for the second quarter, net loss was $43 million or $0.53 per basic and diluted share. This compares with Q2 2014 GAAP net loss of $39.9 million or $0.55 per basic and diluted share.  We finished January with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.1 billion. Our cash flow from operations, free cash flow and free cash flow margin for Q2 were $76.8 million, $70.7 million and 32.5% respectively. Included in our cash flow results, is an approximately $12.8 million payment to Israel made in conjunction with transferring the intellectual property rights acquired from Cyvera out of Israel. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $6.1 million.  Consistent with the strength we saw in the quarter, linearity in Q2 tracked better than the prior year period. Our accounts receivable balance was $135.3 million this quarter, up from $116.2 million in Q1. DSOs decreased sequentially by 7 days and year-over-year by 5 days to 52 days.  Turning to guidance, as we entered Q3, we feel good about the security spending environment and our ability to execute against that opportunity. In Q3 2015, we expect revenue to be in the range of $219 million to $223 million which represents 45% to 48% growth year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.19 to $0.20 per share using 87 million to 89 million shares.  Before I conclude, I’d like to highlight a few considerations for modeling purposes. Due to strong growth, seasonality has been difficult to forecast, but we believe that over the longer term fiscal Q2 and Q4 may show our longest revenue growth.  As a reminder, in fiscal year 2015, we expect to invest approximately $25 million, or $0.17 to $0.18 per share in Traps, our advanced endpoint protection offering. We’re on track to hit this investment goal. We expect CapEx for fiscal year 2015 to be in the range of $45 million to $50 million for year. And as we said previously, we continue to expect to exit Q4 fiscal 2015 with a low-teens non-GAAP operating margin and to exit Q4 fiscal 2016 at a 22% to 25% non-GAAP operating margin.  With that, I’ll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we’ll take our first question from Matt Niknam with Goldman Sachs
Matthew Niknam: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question, and congrats on the quarter. Just a question on margin. So the margin guidance definitely, as you alluded to, the exit rate this year – fiscal year exiting in the low teens. You’re already just under 13% this quarter. Is it fair to assume margins remain fairly flattish in the next two quarters, and maybe if you can help us think to where you see the incremental spending going towards? Thanks.
Steffan Tomlinson: Yes. We remain committed to the low teens exiting this fiscal year and 22% to 25% exiting Q4 of 2016. And I do think it’s fair to say that we’re going to continue to balance top line growth with investing in the business.  And the incremental dollars that are being spent are primarily in our innovation engine, which is R&D and product management as well as our field marketing organization and field sales operations with a low percentage market share and very large market.  We are very much focused on taking as much share as possible but doing it profitably. So you look at operating margins and free cash flow margins, we are able to drive very healthy topline growth and increase profitability. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.
Keith Weiss: Hi. This is Melissa Goram calling in for Keith. Thanks for taking my question. Just a question on Traps, Mark, you mentioned dozens of Traps deals in the quarter. I am just wondering if you can maybe provide some color on the early customer feedback there and of those deals that you saw, are they taking spend from existing endpoint solutions, or is it just net new opportunities.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, good question, Melissa. Yes, so the feedback has been very positive. It’s interesting. And I think it also drives optimism for us in this business when we're talking to customers about this and saying this is what Traps does. It actually does real-time exploit prevention. That’s such a disruptive concept that sometimes you have to explain to them twice. And then show demo. But when they see it, the reaction is wow. That’s pretty disruptive technology and a big step forward.  And the second part of your question, we are taking business from competition and some of these deals. Some folks are buying to run side-by-side with their existing vendors. And some of these cases including a seven-figure deal that I discussed with the prepared script, we took that from a legacy vendor in a competitive win.
Melissa Goram: Okay, great. And then just one quick one for Steffan. One of the things that many of us picked up in the quarter was perhaps longer lead time's in terms of inventory. Was that an issue in the quarter? And if so, what have you done to maybe remediate that potential issue?
Steffan Tomlinson: Yes, due to high order volume, we extended our standard shipping lead time from two weeks to up to four weeks. The reality was we're able to ship most of all the orders that came in within a two week lead time. But it was really due to high order volume. So there's no supply chain issue and we're able to satisfy all the demand.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. 
Raimo Lenschow: Hey. Congrats on a great quarter. Two quick questions from me. First, it's maybe just me, but I'm hearing a lot more competitive replacements from Check Point. Can you talk a little bit about the environment that you're seeing there? It seems like it's slowly changing for you guys.  And then the second one is, obviously, we all hear about increased security spending. How do you see that in your conversations with clients in terms of, kind of, ad hoc, I need react to an emergency versus kind of more longer term planning which you guys should see? Thank you. 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. Good question, Raimo. This is Mark. So on the Check Point; we've been displacing Check Point for a very long time at good rates. So when you look at this quarter, well over 1,500 new customers for the quarter, last quarter 2,000. It's very, very hard to post those kinds of numbers from new logos if you're not adding everybody in the market be a donor to the pile up across. And Check Point donates quite a bit to us. And that is increasing over time I think as we become the industry standard there. I think that’s what's really happening as we continue to take this many customers and build a lot more relevance in the market, a lot more awareness in the market on a global basis.  And on your spend question, spending seems very healthy right now from a security perspective. Really no reason to believe that that’s going to change any time in the future. And particularly if you've got the enterprise class platform that solves a lot of customer hardest problems, we think we’re the big beneficiary of that.
Operator: And our next question comes from Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse. 
Phil Winslow: Hi. Thanks, guys, and congrats on a great quarter. I just wanted you to follow up on some of your remarks on WildFire. Obviously, you guys are having just continued success there. I wonder, if you could give us just more details on sort of win rates versus the competition, sort of you how you’re – who you’re seeing out there and how you’re comparing with them?  And then also from just an attach perspective, not just with WildFire but your other subscription offerings, maybe, you could give us a sense – I know you only give us metric once a year, but as sense of sort of how those attach rates are trending as well as renewal rates? Thanks. 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. Sure, Phil. Let me take those in reverse. So the attach rates for all our services are doing well. They’re all increasing. So that’s the trend that’s been continuing for quite some time, including WildFire, which is growing at a very fast pace. And if you come to Ignite, you’ll get some more detail around those things. On WildFire itself, everybody in the market from a network security perspective has some sort of APT offering in the space today. But from who we see in the market, we primarily see FireEye in the market. And we continue to win business where they don’t exist. We continue to win business where people put us side by side and ultimately choose our platform over a standalone product approach. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. 
Karl Keirstead: Yes. Thanks. My question is for Steffan. I just wanted to go back to your guidance around seasonality during the quarter. I think you said that you should see the strongest growth in 2Q and 4Q. If you could just clarify – I know it’s super preliminary, but are you suggesting that the July fourth quarter might see a growth rate higher than what Palo Alto put up in Q1 and would likely put up in 3Q? 
Steffan Tomlinson: That’s a good question, Karl. We guided one quarter out. But, directionally, you can think about our fourth quarter being typically very strong, but most companies’ fiscal year-end. We can’t really get into the details around what our fourth-quarter projection is going to be relative to last year's fourth quarter. But the way that the organization is set up where we are positioned for growth and the way the sales cycles work, at the end of the fiscal year, lots of people are in sales accelerator say, and you would typically see an increase in sales productivity and deal closure etcetera. So that's about all I can get into in terms of the fourth quarter.
Operator: And our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. 
Andrew Nowinski: Great. Thanks. Congrats on the nice quarter. I just want to know a follow-up question on WildFire. It’s clearly gaining traction and you added about 1000 customers this quarter and then 1500 total customers. I was wondering if you could give us any color on the mix of new customers that were deploying WildFire versus existing customers that deployed it. 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, Drew, we are doing very well in both regards. With well over 1500 new customers in the quarter we are seen nice win rates for new locals as they come in the door and having WildFire is the most advanced APT detection prevention capability baked into the platform, allows our sales team tell a great story for new local acquisition because we're able to talk about something that’s very important for all companies, which is advanced prescription [indiscernible] and malwares, so it’s good to have that as lead for somebody who is not yet using Palo Alto Networks.  With the existing customer base, we see very good adoption there as well because if you are only using a good portion of the platform, our story is what more customers are experiencing is the more platform you use the better you are from a protection, prevention prospective and WildFire is a very strong aspect of that. So we see a lot of demand from our existing customer base as well. So I want to add that portion of prevention into the platform I am already on. So both the cylinders are firing very well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi. 
Walter Pritchard: Hi. Thanks. Steffan, two questions for you. One, we've heard some of your competitors in the last three to six months talk about uptick in their level of spending and bringing down there profitability goals. You’re obviously sticking with your profitability goals as you stated them today.  How do you think about sort of the market dynamic there and just want to see where on the same space and the space been more, you may need to spend more. Do you feel for like you're adequately covered or is there anything that could happen in the market that could cause you to similarly uptick your spending more so than you're guiding to today? 
Steffan Tomlinson: So, on that front, what I've picked up around the competitive space is, a lot of folks are spending more in sales and marketing in order to try to get into the enterprise. Where you have historically companies who have been focused on the SMB or telco, trying to get into high-end enterprise so they’re building out their sales forces.  We believe that it starts with the differentiated product. So we have the best platform out there. And when you – when we start with that product and that platform, we've been building to scale under Mark Anderson's leadership the worldwide field operations that we're already at, call it, 45% of revenues for sales and marketing.  And over time, we're going to be getting leverage over that, but there's not some big reinvestment plan that we need to make in order to get the incremental growth. And additionally, if you think about this, the productivity of the sales force, we're going to have more ramped sales people than ramping sales people, very soon. And that increases the overall capacity that we're bringing into the model. So we don't envision any derailment from our track right now. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Brent Thill with UBS.
Brent Thill: Good afternoon. Mark, on Traps, you mentioned you added a couple dozen customers. I am curious what you saw on those deals with the rest of the portfolio from Palo Alto? And, perhaps, when you look at some of the new versus existing, if you could just maybe give us a little bit more color on what you’re seeing in that early adoption? And I had a quick follow-up for Steffan. 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. We’re seeing a lot of interest in the existing customer base, not surprisingly. So the question I answered a little while ago, I said the power of the platform is that the more of the platform you use, the better security you’d get and usually at a better total cost of ownership.  Traps with its integration of WildFire is a very compelling part of that story. So our existing customer base, particularly those people who were using WildFire already, are very enticed by what that brings to bear for their security posture. So we’re getting very positive feedback from the existing customer base.  Also, even though this is in the future for us as far as putting up the numbers against it, the ability to talk to customers who don’t own any Palo Alto Networks yet at all and just talking to them about Traps is another entry point for us as well. And, of course, we’re telling that story to our as yet signed on customers that you should just look at Traps, if you have an endpoint need, and then that can drive the adoption of more of our platform later to. 
Brent Thill: Okay. And, Steffan, you mentioned strengths in the 7050. I’m just curious, if you could maybe add a little more color on what you’re seeing in the data center market? 
Steffan Tomlinson: Well, we’re seeing more invitations to play in the data center market, and we see that in a couple of different ways. The first is just organically where with the 7050 we’re getting brought in but also with our partnership with VMware. We added a great use case where there was NSX, VM for NSX feel that was out there, we ended up selling not only the VM series for that engagement but we also sold the 7050 to protect the north-south traffic for that data center and that’s just one example of a number that we are working on where the 7050 is increasing our overall wall share for the overall data center market.
Operator: And the next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.
Matt Hedberg: Yes, thanks for taking my question guys. Congrats on the quarter as well. Mark, I wanted to ask about Westcon. I believe the hedge you initially in 40 countries, I wanted to get an update on that distribution channel versus some of your initial complications and then I have a quick follow-up for Steffan for that. 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, great question, Matt. So about a year ago Westcon did a little over 30 countries and today we are a little more than double that number. So in that last 12 months timeframe we increased that by 100%, which is important because with that relationship, the number of resellers under that umbrella has gone up very dramatically as well so just our distribution -- I mean the reseller capability below the distribution has grown a lot over the last 12 months and we are very pleased with that. 
Matt Hedberg: That’s great. And then maybe a quick one for Steffan, I know you guys priced in U.S. dollars but I curios are you seeing any evidence of the strengthening dollar and demand overseas. 
Steffan Tomlinson: Since we price in U.S. dollars, we don't really see any material shipped for the revenue. Where we do see a little bit of a benefit is as the dollar strengthens, we pay our foreign locations salaries, benefits and expenses in local currency. So that does help have a modest benefit. But outside of that, the real top line risk isn't there, because we do price in USD. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Daniel Ives with FBR Capital. 
Daniel Ives: Yes. Thanks. Mark, could you just talk about your deals getting fast tracked and maybe even more at the board level in terms of what you're seeing out in the cyber security, especially in terms of some of the high-level threats we've seen over the last three to six months?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. Dan, I think that we're seeing is that there's certainly a large and growing amount of attention at the Board level, the highest levels in companies in boards on these – the threats. What we’re actually seeing below that though is good spending, as you can see in the market in general, in order to try to solve those things.  But as far as that’s working out at the buyers, we're seeing more thoughtful and strategic purchases. Meaning that we're finding folks who are stepping back and saying, we want to think about something that is going to be very valuable for us for three to five years, not just the latest or that just came out last week.  We tend to do very well in that kind of environment, because we come in with solutions architects. We get to show them an architectural standard for security that covers all of their enterprise at every point of the kill chain, and how that can provide a very strong dose of prevention and that is resonating extremely well in the market.
Daniel Ives: Okay. In terms of – from the White House Summit that you had and obviously you're really involved with what you see on the government side. Do you think 2015 is an interesting inflection point on the federal side in terms of spending on cyber security or do you think we're still not there and there still needs to be some bureaucracy and red tape that need to tear there or cut through? Thanks. 
Mark McLaughlin: I think, generally, the government recognizes, like all organizations, they need to be at the forefront of cyber security. It’s not so much an inflection point in terms of acceptance of what has to happen from a technology perspective. I think it has a lot to do with budget. So if you recall, the fiscal 2015 budget for the government was a very tough one. It was kind of going into fiscal 2015 they were coming off of a lot of a belt tightening just generally in the government.  So I would just expect that the fiscal 2016 budget is actually just going to be a better budget. There is going to be more money in the budget in fiscal 2016 than there was in fiscal 2015. That’s a good thing for providers. And if you’re a provider like us who has got a really good solution for the government who needs to be at the very front of this, we think that bodes well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company. 
Gregg Moskowitz: Thank you very much, and I’ll add my congratulations as well on a strong quarter. A question for Mark. Mark, some security vendors held the view that or [indiscernible] that any APT solution that is effectively part of the firewall has some detection and prevention limitations just really because so much of the network traffic is being generated by mobile and other sources. I just wanted to get your perspective on that, if I could. 
Mark McLaughlin: Well, our view is that what you’re trying to accomplish under there or should be trying to be accomplish is not only great detection but a very, very strong level of prevention, and that’s got to be across the entire enterprise. Right.  So in order to do that, you need to be able to see the traffic everywhere, whether it’s mobile or data center. It doesn’t really matter. Right. And if you can’t see all that traffic and meaning you’re not in line, then you’re going to have a very, very difficult time doing anything from a security perspective, whether it’s APT or anything else.  So that’s the view that’s driven the importance of being in the – I call it – the architecturally favored position of being the firewall in the first place because the firewall is generally the only security device that is going to see all traffic in or out of the network. And if it’s off with a mobile device and you VPN it into your traffic flow, then you are going to supply the network security policies to that traffic regardless of what the device is coming off of which is exactly what recommend folks too and that’s what Global protect us for example. So I would completely agree with the statement that you have to see all of traffic in order to secure it and that you're going to be unable to do that unless you are in the firewall position. 
Gregg Moskowitz: Terrific. Thanks.  Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. 
Michael Turits: Hey, guys. A quick question on – the question earlier about 2014 versus 2015 in terms of spends, Mark, any shift at all in terms of security spending in terms of priorities that you see from 2015 versus 2014? 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, I think that as we've seen folks at the highest levels being paid more attention which I mentioned earlier, which is called, what is the security architecture? And more and more, we're the ones being invited in that conversation to say how should I think about this big picture across the board, top to bottom from an enterprise perspective as opposed to thinking about the point product or it’s time to refresh this product or refresh this product. And as a platform provider for prevention in that’s great for us because we have the ultimate answer for that for folks there in the market and it is resonating very well. 
Michael Turits: And then, obviously, a very strong quarter but you had a little slower than last quarter? Anything going on there, or the check [indiscernible]. 
Mark McLaughlin: We like Europe. It’s good market. You may recall last quarter we grew a little over 60% year-over-year in Europe and then we grow 60% sequentially after that, so that’s – we like those numbers. 
Michael Turits: Good. Thank you very much. 
Mark McLaughlin: Good. Thanks Mike.
Operator: Next we’ll go to Gur Talpaz with Stifel. 
Gur Talpaz: Great. Thanks. So there's been a lot of noise up in the endpoint market. Can you talk about what you're seeing out there competitively? And do you think customers are starting to understand the inherent advantages of an integrated offering with WildFire versus, let's say, a standalone offering? Thank you. 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, Gur. Yes, a couple of angles on that. The first is that, I agree with you, there's a lot of noise in the market on the endpoint side. The reason for that is it's becoming evident that the endpoints are very important from a solution perspective in order to secure an enterprise, right? Because it is the wild west in the end points. And the first thing we see for sure is customers recognizing that the legacy AB technologies are incapable of doing that, right?  The second thing is the rush of lots other players in the market say, well, we're going to fix that for you. Fixing it actually requires doing prevention. Right? That’s – at the end of the day, that’s what you have to do in order to have a good fix there. And we think that our approach with TRAPS and the customer feedback we're getting, as I mentioned a little earlier, is they agree with us that it actually does prevention at the end point and because of that it's very compelling. 
Operator: And next we’ll go to Jonathan Ho with William Blair. 
Jonathan Ho: Hey, guys. I just wanted to understand a little bit better, are you starting to see much revenue come from the installed base in terms of refreshes from four or five years ago, the initial customers? And how should we think about that trend for the course of 2015 and going into 2016? 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, Jonathan. So what we look at is we definitely see a refresh going on in our earlier cohorts. The first’s really measurable ones for us, so our 2009 and 2010 by numbers. So we’re seeing refreshes occurring there. To put that in perspective, the combined customer base for 2009 and 2010 is less than 2,000 customers. We’ve got over 22,000 customers now. So we continue to see refreshes into those larger cohorts, which we would expect to. That’s the tailwind. 
Jonathan Ho: Got it. Excellent. And then, as you start to think about the NSX and VMware relationship, can you maybe talk a little about how significant this could be from a selling perspective and just sort of the initial reception that you’re seeing? I know you talked about the wins, but just why customers would choose the solution and what potentially the alternatives are, if any? 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. We think of it in two regards. The first is that you definitely want to have relevance in the sense of there is a changing environment in the data center. It’s not just north-south. It’s got to be east-west.  So the first thing is can you adequately represent yourself in that conversation back to the strategic architectures and say, “I have you covered not only north-south but east-west as well.” We definitely have north-south covered, and we are uniquely integrated and working closely with VMware the east-west. And when we show that to customers and how tight that integration is and provide the same level of protections in north-south, they are very, very impressed with that.  And we can see that playing out through the numbers. NSX is selling very well, as you may have seen from VMware’s results. And as a result of that, we’re getting pulled into lots and lots and lots of conversations with customers that’s resulting in deals. And we have well over 300 POCs going right now, as an example with VMware customers. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Aaron Schwartz with Macquarie. 
Aaron Schwartz: Good afternoon. Thank you. On the Metro you gave for the top 25 customers, that increased quite a bit, and I’m sure a number of things are driving that. But was there anything in particular that stood out? 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. We’re seeing our relevance continue to grow in the market and particularly with the larger companies that they’re making larger purchases with us. So these are our largest customers, right? And then they continue to make larger purchases. And also we are seeing some customers on their first purchase, just right onto the top 25 list. So it’s a mix of those two things that’s driving that number up to the right. 
Aaron Schwartz: Okay. And secondly, if I could, on the attached you talked about that, direction moving higher as well. Can you just comment on the duration of what you're seeing now? Does that change at all relative to one or two years ago? Thanks. 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, relative to one or two years ago up for durations, they are basically in the same zip code relatively. They are up modestly. But there hasn’t been any real -- change in terms of duration. 
Aaron Schwartz: Great. Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question is from Jeff Kvaal with Northland Capital Markets. 
Jeff Kvaal: Yes. Hello. 
Mark McLaughlin: Hi, Jeff. 
Jeff Kvaal: Can you guys hear me okay? 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. 
Jeff Kvaal: Good. Thank you. I also have one of my [indiscernible] but I always wanted to ask you how you are doing in the service provider market. I know that you have been pushing into that round of this. And secondly, I think you opened the call a little bit Mark, talking about seeing a better run rate I think for the security market over a period of a few years, then, you might the quarter or two ago, I am wondering if you could delve into those comments a little bit more? 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, Jeff, good questions. Let me take those in reverse. So what I was saying in the prepared remarks in the security market is that the IT paradigm shift which is security becoming what I am calling fabric to all technology decisions that are being made by organizations, governments and companies. And that’s the result of all these attacks we're seeing and incredibly evident fact that the legacy technology cannot withstand that. Right. So I think that paradigm shift of that security fabric and will remain that way for quite some time. As the point I was trying to make is, that’s not it going to abate overtime. I think that’s going to continue to grow overtime.  And on your first question, on service provider market, we like that market a lot. We do very well in that market. As I’ve said before, we view that market a couple of – three different ways from an opportunity perspective. The area where we're doing very well right now is selling two service providers for using technology in their own networks. The 7050 as an example, has been a great boon for us there, because those are big networks, lots of throughput, lots of data center usage and we're seeing very strong demand in service provider industry for that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Gray Powell with Wells Fargo Securities. 
Gray Powell: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple. So, obviously, you have a lot going on with WildFire and TRAPS in terms of newer products. How do you feel about the level of internal innovation or R&D? And then, do you see any technology sets that can supplement your current offerings? 
Mark McLaughlin: Okay, great. There's one thing we never forget is that we're doing well in the market and Traps has been as successful as we have, because we've been very innovative and very disruptive. So we start everything with that. And as you solve that, we put a lot of time and effort, people, resources, into innovation and I think our track record is pretty good on that.  We have a number of things so if you just think back in the last 12 months what we've done around Traps, around the PA-3060, improvement to WildFire and we're going to continue to innovate as we go forward as we always have done every single year. If you come to Ignite we'll talk to you a little bit about that as well. So I feel very good about the level of innovation, our track record on delivering that and the pace in which we’re rolling out. 
Gray Powell: Got it . Thank you very much. 
Mark McLaughlin: Thank you. 
Operator: And our last question today comes from Scott Zeller with Needham & Company. 
Scott Zeller: Thanks. I just wanted to ask, if Steffan has any color he could share for the deferred seasonality, if there is an update on that please? 
Steffan Tomlinson: Well, yes, deferred seasonality would most likely trend towards what the revenue seasonality is. So Q2 and Q4, you would see – if those are the quarters in which we would see the most pronounced strength, then the subsequent quarter you would basically see deferred go up as well. I’d give you that as color commentary.  I can also say that both long-term and short term deferred revenue have also been growing just very well. And so we see a nice balance between customers who are signing up for a one-year deal but we are seeing proportionally more customers signing up for multi-year deals as well. And some of those multi-year deals tend to be skewed to our fiscal Q4. So you should definitely see some seasonality there. 
Scott Zeller: Thank you.
Steffan Tomlinson: Yes.
Mark McLaughlin: Great. Well, thanks, everybody, for being on the call this afternoon. We appreciate it. We had a great first half of our fiscal 2015, and we’re very excited about the second half of the year and beyond. As I said earlier, I think, we’re in the right place at the right time in the market with a market-leading protection and prevention platform.  I, once again, thank Palo Alto Networks’ team for all their hard work and their support for our customers and partners, as we continue our march to become the global leader in enterprise security. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today’s call.

With that, I’ll turn the call over to Mark.
Mark D. McLaughlin : I’m pleased to report that we had a very strong start to our fiscal year 2015 and I’d like to thank our customer, partners, and the Palo Alto Networks’ team for their contributions and support. As a leading provider of end-to-end enterprise class protection and prevention, we’re delivering growth rates well above the market and the competition by consistently demonstrating the differentiation and sustainability of our platform, the scalability of our model and our team, and our ongoing growth potential. This was evident in our Q1 results which exceeded our own expectations, and I’m especially pleased that we were able to demonstrate strong sequential growth off of our record fourth quarter. In Q1, billings and revenue reached records again with billings growing 52% year-over-year to $240 million and revenue growing 50% year-over-year to $192 million. In the quarter, we also expanded our non-GAAP operating margin to 10.6% and delivered Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.15 per share. Our growth is primarily being driven by three things: first, at the most basic level, security continues to be a critical business imperative that must be addressed by every business in the world and this is driving increased security spend; second, in the security battle, prevention is the ultimate objective and Palo Alto Networks’ integrated and automated next generation security platform is unique and delivers unparalleled prevention capabilities in the $16 billion addressable market opportunity; and third, we believe we’ve successfully scaled a global sales coverage model with a powerful sales team and key distribution relationships in every geographic theater providing our customers with security subject matter experts that are best in class both before and after an order. Our Q1 results reflect these long term factors at work and also reflect the power of our land and expand strategy. On the land side, we continue to acquire customers at a very fast pace and are now pleased to serve approximately 21,000 customers worldwide. Examples of new customer wins in the quarter included replacing CISCO, Bluecoat, and Websense for perimeter security at a Fortune 10 company, replacing Checkpoint and CISCO at an enterprisewide global deployment in one of Asia’s largest financial institutions and replacing Checkpoint and CISCO as the primary datacenter firewall for one of the nation’s largest insurance companies. The expand side of the business also continues to grow quickly. To make our top 25 customer list in Q1, a customer had to have spent a minimum of $6.1 million in lifetime value, up from $5.6 million last quarter and almost all of those customers made a purchase in the quarter as to replace legacy technology and point product solutions in favor of our next generation enterprise platform. Customers are switching to us and continue to make repeat purchases at a rapid pace because of our technology. We believe our platform provides customers with the most comprehensive protection and prevention in the market for all their security use cases, while each individual aspect offers best of breed capabilities. For example, in the datacenter use case, we continue to see broad adoption of our high end PA-7050 chassis. In the quarter, we saw sizeable purchases such as a global service provider buying more than a dozen chassis and one of the world’s largest oil and gas companies significantly expanding the current deployment with eight additional chassis. Also, to continue to provide the world’s best prevention capabilities at all points in the network, two weeks ago we launched our newest appliance the PA-3060 for our midsized enterprise customers’ datacenter use cases. In the advanced persistent threat solutions space, we believe we are now the largest provider by customer count with approximately 4,000 customers paying for WildFire’s integrated and automated prevention capabilities, and in late September we made real time exploit and malware prevention at both the network and the endpoint reality with the integration of Traps and WildFire. This is extremely compelling for all customers who understand how vulnerable endpoints are to attack. While it will take time for Traps to ramp into a meaningful revenue contributor, we’re off to a good start and closed multiple Traps deals in the quarter including a mid-six figure win in a highly competitive bake off within a large US based energy company. We are seeing a lot of enthusiasm for this disruptive offering. New product announcements like the PA-3060 and Traps place us at the forefront of solving some of our customers most complex security needs and we continue to innovate helping them to safely and securely embrace technology trends like Cloud and mobility. We continue to be pleased with the high degree of interest in the Palo Alto Networks’ addition for NSX and are engaged in a large number of POCs. Also in October, we expanded our partnership with VMware to provide our advanced security to VMware’s public Cloud platform vCloud Air. Enterprises can now apply the same rich set of security services available through VMware NSX and Palo Alto Networks across both public and private Cloud environments. We also enhanced our global protect mobility offering helping organizations control access to enterprise applications and data based on key policy criteria such as application, user, and device, and we announced the latest release of our VM series with support for Amazon AWS and KBM. Our customers can now take advantage of the productivity and cost benefits of the Cloud without compromising their security. We were able to achieve all this in the quarter while at the same time delivering bottom line results and cash flow generation that continued to demonstrate the leverage we have in the business and the ability to expand it over time. Given the strong start to the year, we remain confident in our continued growth and our ability to gain market share at a rapid rate. Security is the top IT spending priority across organizations of all sizes and our solutions to customers’ security problems is unique in the market. We believe our highly integrated next generation firewall, subscription services, and advanced endpoint protection deliver best in class security at each point of the kill chain and when used together provide superior security at a superior total cost of ownership. With that, I’ll wrap it up and turn it over to Steffan.
Steffan C. Tomlinson : Before I get into the details of our results and guidance I’d like to note that except for revenue figure that are in GAAP, all financial figures are non-GAAP unless stated otherwise. We’re off to a strong start in our new fiscal year. In the first quarter, we built upon the record billings and revenue we delivered in Q4 FY14 demonstrating the continued traction we have in the market with our powerful platform and we continued to drive leverage with both operating margin and free cash flow increasing on a sequential basis. The power of our hybrid SAS revenue model combined with our land, expand, and retain sales strategy are key components of our business model. Once again, we saw new customer acquisition and expansion at existing customers drive robust growth in both the products and services side of our business which led to outperformance in billings, revenue, and deferred revenue. Existing and new products are performing well in the market as our enterprise security platform continues to drive market share shift in our favor. Now, let me turn to the numbers. In Q1, total revenue grew 50% over the prior year and 8% sequentially to reach a new record of $192.3 million. The geographic mix of revenue for Q1 was 69% Americas, 20% EMEA, and 11% APAC. Compared to the prior year, the Americas grew 53%, EMEA grew 61%, and APAC grew 21%. As in previous quarters, we saw broad strength across a wide range of verticals, but we do not have any end customer concentration. The three components of our hybrid SAS model: product; subscription; and support all grew very well in Q1. Q1 product revenue of $101.5 million increased 34% over the prior year and 2% sequentially. We saw particular strength in the contribution from our highest end appliances, including the PA-7050 which continues to provide greater opportunity in the datacenter market. Our recurring services revenue of $90.9 million increased 72% over the prior year and 16% sequentially and accounted for a 47% share of total revenue. Looking at the two components of recurring service revenue, the first component is our SAS based subscription revenue of $43.7 million which increased 76% over the prior year and 16% sequentially. Support and maintenance revenue, the second component of recurring services, was $47.2 million, an increase of 69% over the prior year and 15% sequentially. Billings in Q1 were $240.5 million, an increase of 52% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Growth in recurring services billings positively impacts deferred revenue. Total deferred revenue in Q1 was $470.7 million, an increase of 69% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. Short term deferred revenue increased to $286.7 million, an increase of 67% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. Total gross margin for Q1 was 76.8%, an increase of 180 basis points compared to last year and 10 basis points sequentially. Product gross margin was 75.1%, a decrease of 150 basis points year-over-year and 60 basis points sequentially. The sequential modest decline was due in part to investments we’re making in manufacturing operations, and we expect there will be fluctuations in product gross margin primarily due to product mix. Services gross margin for Q1 was 78.6% an increase of 580 basis points year-over-year and 60 basis points sequentially due in part to ongoing growth in the contribution from subscription services. For the quarter, research and development expense was 11.9% of revenue, increasing approximately $2.1 million sequentially to $22.8 million. This was primarily due to headcount growth. Sales and marketing expense for Q1 was 46.8% of revenue decreasing approximately $2.5 million sequentially to $90.1 million. This was primarily due to a decrease in sales commissions related to our strong fiscal year ’14 year end performance. General and administrative expense for Q1 was 7.5% of revenue increasing approximately $5.4 million sequentially to $14.4 million. This was driven in part by consulting and outside services related to projects in the G&A organization. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was 1,900 up from 1,722 at the end of Q4 fiscal 2014. In total Q1 operating expenses were $127.3 million or 66.2% of revenue. Operating margin grew 310 basis points year-over-year to 10.6% an increased sequentially 250 basis points. Net income for the quarter was $12.8 million or $0.15 per diluted share using 84.7 million shares compared with net income of $6.2 million or $0.08 per diluted share in Q1 2014. On a GAAP basis for the first quarter net loss was $3.1 million or $0.38 per basic and diluted share. This compares with a Q1 2014 GAAP net loss of $7.9 million or $0.11 per basic and diluted share. We finished October with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.1 billion. Cash flow from operations, free cash flow, and free cash flow margin for Q1 was $74.9 million, $69 million and 35.9% respectively. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $5.9 million. Consistent with the strength we saw in the quarter linearity in Q1 tracked better than then the prior year period. Our accounts receivable balance was $116.2 million for this quarter, down from $135.5 million in Q4. DSOs decreased sequentially and year-over-year by four days to 59 days. Turning to guidance, as we enter Q2 we feel good about the strength in our business and our ability to capitalize on expected year end buying patterns. In Q2 2015 we expect revenue to be in the range of $200 million to $204 million which represents 42% to 45% growth year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.16 to $0.17 per share using 85 million to 87 million shares. Before I conclude, I’d like to highlight a few considerations for modeling purposes. Due to strong growth seasonality has been difficult to forecast but we believe that over the longer term fiscal Q2 and Q4 may show our strongest revenue growth. As a reminder, in fiscal year 2015 we expect to invest approximately $25 million or $0.18 to $0.19 per share in Traps, our advanced endpoint protection offering with the level of investment skewed to the back half of the year. Consistent with what we said last quarter, we expect cap ex for fiscal year 2015 to be in the range of $45 million to $50 million for the year and as we said previously, we continue to expect to exit Q4 2015 with a low teens non-GAAP operating margin and to exit Q4 fiscal 2016 at a 22% to 25% non-GAAP operating margin. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.
Raimo Lenschow: I just wanted to kind of talk a little bit about Traps. Can you talk a little bit about the – you mentioned some early wins there, a little bit about the reception you got from the market and also the opportunity you do have then when you combine it with WildFire and how the sales force is able to upsell and cross sell them?
Mark D. McLaughlin : Yes, we’re very excited about Traps. As you know, we brought that back to market in late September, so we had it in the market for about six weeks in the quarter, and the reception has been very strong. Just from an interest level, like we said, we closed a number of deals in the quarter in October and also one that I just wanted to note just because it was a good sized deal, mid six figure deal, it was highly competitive where the customer had already given the PO to somebody else, took it back and gave it to us once they saw that it worked. That customer, to your point about WildFire integration, was an existing Palo Alto customer running WildFire. When they saw that work together with WildFire, they were extremely impressed with that. So I think it’s a great completion to the platform concept that we’ve been talking about and selling for a while that’s primarily geared towards prevention and now we can demonstrate that on the endpoint as well, and like I said, the early indications seem very positive.
Operator: Your next question comes from Matthew Niknam – Goldman Sachs.
Matthew Niknam: Just a little more broadly, I just have a question on customer activity, can you talk about whether you’re seeing any pull forward of demand from calendar ’15 into calendar ’14? Then secondly, how are you starting to see demand among customers shape up as you head into the next calendar year?
Mark D. McLaughlin : I think it’s a little difficult to say if there’s pull in. The security market is very strong right now, you can see that in our results, other folks’ results, it’s a good market to be in. We span the end of the year in this quarter, so we don’t have an impact of folks trying to pull spending in, but as a general matter what we’re seeing is increased attention, increased spending from folks and definitely a desire to have prevention capabilities, and I think that’s why we’re selling so well.
Matthew Niknam: Then just one follow up on international, any color you can provide on what’s driving the acceleration in growth in EMEA and APAC this quarter?
Mark D. McLaughlin : If you look at how our revenue breaks down across the theaters, you can see that North America, our most mature theater, continues to grow at a very, very healthy rate, and as we’ve said in the past, we invested in the theaters outside the North America, after North America not surprisingly as we grew and matured the company, and I think some of those investments are paying off now over in Europe. We’ve done a lot of things there under Mark Anderson’s leadership with major accounts, global accounts, all the playbook we’ve been running in North America, he’s been running now in Europe with some good success. Also, I just wanted to note as well, we had talked before about increasing our distribution relationships with some of the best folks in the world, we mentioned Westcon before on a previous call where we expanded our relationship globally and the real focus of that to start off was in Europe, and early indications on that are really great growth well in excess of 300% in a short period of time on a year-over-year basis, so we’re happy with that relationship and other major global players like that that we’re working with on a global basis.
Steffan C. Tomlinson: One follow-on point Matt is with international being a little bit over 30% of our business this quarter, we see that there’s a very big continued growth opportunity across both EMEA and APAC, and we feel that we’re still in the very early innings of getting to that growth.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Keith Weiss – Morgan Stanley.
Keith Weiss: I am going to turn two questions into one, but if you could just talk about sort of how you’re doing with sales into existing customer base in terms of going back and getting existing customers to take on more product, whether it would be more subscriptions like WildFire or maybe using a virtualized appliance like where you have VMware? Then question number two, as you guys start to get more mature and you start to actually refresh your own customer base, maybe you could talk to us just a little about how those refreshers are going, how well you’re able to sustain value or add value on the refresh of guys already within your customer base?
Mark D. McLaughlin : Yes, they’re somewhat related. On the first point, and I’ll call that the wallet share question, we’re seeing a couple of things. The first is a continued increase in subscription rates and attach rates across the board as our customers continue to understand the value of using everything that the platform brings to bear in the battle for security. So, really healthy as you can see from our subscription services business, attach rates continue to go up. Then in addition to that, we also are bringing to market from a product perspective, things that can satisfy folks needle up and down the chain if you will and inside their enterprise so the PA-7050 at the high end selling well, we just introduced the 3060 for datacenter use cases for midsized enterprises, and then the addition of Traps as well to complete the platform. I think that’s all taking effect, but at the end of the day people are really buying into the platform concept and the prevention capabilities that it brings. On the second portion of your question, on the refresh opportunity we watch our customer very, very closely and all of our customer cohorts are growing in lifetime value overtime and in the earlier ones which we look at in 2009 and 2010, we can see the indication of refresh cycles beginning there and the ability to upsell those folks as well when they’re usually buying a bigger piece of hardware to upsell them on more subscription services because they’re understanding that platform story. I think all of that is working very well for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from Shaul Eyal – Oppenheimer.
Shaul Eyal: Two quick questions on my end, Mark just your thinking about FishNet and Accuvant’s recent [teaming] up, how does that impact your business?
Mark D. McLaughlin : I think we’ll continue to see consolidation in that part of the industry. I don’t think it’s a bad thing for us, both of those are very good partners of ours and have been increasing their business over time. A combination brings more to bear from what they can do for us as a large vendor in the market so I think that’s probably a good thing.
Shaul Eyal: Thanks for reaffirming the operating margin targets as you exit fiscal ’16 but as we think about further means of lifting up EPS down the road, what’s the current thinking about tax rate? How could that maybe lowered down and in turn lift up EPS?
Steffan C. Tomlinson: Well currently we have a static non-GAAP tax rate of 38%. What we’ve done over the past couple of year is we’ve committed to an international cost sharing structure for our IP and with that type of structure in place as we become a full taxpayer longer term down the road, we would expect to see our tax rate most likely be in the high 20% range which would be a lift to EPS. As it relates to non-GAAP in the near term over the next year or so we’ll evaluate the static tax rate of 38% and we’ll probably revisit that a year from now and at that point we’ll have had that static tax rate for about two years.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brent Thill – UBS.
Brent Thill: Just a question on the relationship between product and services. You had good upside on services and on the product side you were just a little bit [indiscernible]. I’m curious what you’re seeing there as it relates to the services side? Another question as it relates to that, is you look at the manage the fence as a service and how you think you’ll benefit as that seems like it’s early, but there’s a bit opportunity for you in that segment of the business?
Mark D. McLaughlin : On the product services side we came off of a screaming fourth quarter as you may recall and we’re very happy to see sequential growth across the board Q4 to Q1. We’re very happy with how that turned out. The services side of our business is about 47% of our business right now, continues to grow over time. We like that a lot, the services show stickiness with the customers, it has higher margins so we really like that trend. At the same time we continue to grow the product revenue at a very high rate as well. I think both of those cylinders are firing very well on our hybrid model. On the services side, your managed services question, we love services obviously, it’s 47% of the business and growing. We really like the idea of providing what used to be a hardware based security as subscription services and we like that model a lot. We’re not in the MSS business today, lots of people are in that business and they’ll have to run our products and provide it on a managed services basis so we think we understand that segment of the market pretty well.
Operator: Your next question comes from Karl Keirstead – Deutsche Bank.
Karl Keirstead: I’ve got a question about the cash flow performance which was extraordinary in the quarter and the operating cash flow margin tracked way above what your non-GAAP operating margin was. I’m just wondering if you could give us a little bit of guidance in how to model cash flow? If you look out a year let’s say fiscal ’16, or you can pick the period, what should the relationship be between the operating cash flow margin and your non-GAAP operating margin?
Steffan C. Tomlinson: Well, first of all our cash flow is benefitted this quarter by a great billing cycle in Q4 and very good linearity in Q1. The fact that we drove 35.9% free cash flow margin in the quarter was great. Longer term we’ve been giving folks a guideline around at our target model of 22% to 25% non-GAAP operating margin. Free cash flows we estimate should be 5% to 8% above. We’ll continue to refine that down the road but that’s something where we believe free cash flow margin will be above operating margins mainly because operating margins candidly are a lagging indicator of profitability because we have the hybrid SAS revenue model where we take revenues ratably for a large swap of the business but we also take in period expenses for sales commissions. So, free cash flow is a very meaningful indicator or profitability for us. We believe it’s a differentiating factor from a business model standpoint and the fact that we’re able to post great positive free cash flow while growing top line revenue and billings way above market rate of growth, we feel very good about the power of the business model.
Karl Keirstead: If I could ask my follow up on another metric and that’s the attach rate for the subscriptions. Obviously, that was a big growth engine in the October quarter. Are you able to bracket for us what the attach rates are for some of the more mature subscription modules?
Mark D. McLaughlin : Yes, we’ve reported overall attach rates every six months. The last time we talked about this during the last quarter we said on an overall basis it’s 2.1 up from 1.9 the prior previous time we had spoken about that, and attach rates continue to grow for us. That’s because all the subscription services continue to grow very nicely. Some of the more mature ones, [indiscernible] prevention are in the 80 something percent category of attach and we think a number of these services can reach high maturity rates.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rob Owens – Pacific Crest Securities.
Rob Owens: I’m curious, as we’re seeing security clearly accelerate here the last couple of quarters not only for you guys but the industry in general, what do you guys think the budget is coming from? What other areas are seeing less spend at this point?
Mark D. McLaughlin : You know, it’s hard to say what might not be getting funded. We definitely see an increase in security budgets across the boards and that’s on a global basis as well. The reports that I’ve looked at are pretty clearly indicating that people are figuring out that they have to spend money here and it sounds like they’re going to continue to do that in the future with security being one or two of the top priorities. I don’t actually track all the other stuff close enough to know who might be shorted for that but somehow people are figuring out how to spend here.
Rob Owens: Then as we look at your strong customer acquisition numbers the last couple of quarters showing some acceleration here, who are you seeing most from a displacement standpoint? With everyone kind of adopting a next generation firewall marketing campaign, who are you seeing most competitively these days?
Mark D. McLaughlin : It really hasn’t changed in quite some time. I know everybody has jumped on the marketing bandwagon for next generation but there’s a few things that I think become increasingly evidence in the market. The first is when it’s time to show up and really prove that to folks we’ve consistently been the only ones who have been able to show true next generation firewall capabilities. Even more importantly now is the concept of next generation security platform that does prevention. So not only just next generation firewall but really, really distancing ourselves from everybody else in the market who don’t even have that first capability set and continue to fall further behind on the whole platform concept in prevention. That is across the board. When we look at our win rates across the board, we’re taking business from everybody in the market today and that looks like that will continue for quite some time.
Operator: Your next question comes from Philip Winslow – Credit Suisse.
Philip Winslow: You guys talk about pretty good success in getting larger and larger deals, what’s really driving that here? Is it really the attach rates of just more and more subscription services? You mentioned the 1.8 to 2.1 that you guys talked about last quarter, [indiscernible] appliances so you can actually go into more and more datacenter deals, or how do you just think about the mix of that? Then, just one quick follow up.
Mark D. McLaughlin : It’s actually a mix of a number of things. The first and probably most important is the acceptance of Palo Alto Networks as a major player in the enterprise security market and understanding that platform capability set as having end-to-end protection prevention capabilities. As a general matter, people are more inclined to just buy more from us in size and scope and do it on an earlier basis than they have in the past. Then for the existing customers that have been working with us for a while, the ability to march them up from an attach rate perspective has been demonstrated over time. So it’s really a combination of those few things that are just driving higher – more times at bat, higher initial sales, and then increasing the ability to sell subscriptions in there so the lifetime value continues to go up.
Philip Winslow: Then just one quick follow up for Steffan, the exit rate for fiscal ’16 that you talked about, maybe if you could just remind us about what sort of that model looks like, sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue and gross margins, etc., so we kind of have an idea of how the model evolves in your mind?
Steffan C. Tomlinson: Well it starts with gross margin, our forecasted range exiting Q4 of fiscal ’16 is 73% to 76%, sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue is 33% to 36%, R&D is 13% to 14%, and G&A is 5% to 6% leading to a range of 22% to 25% non-GAAP operating margin. When you look at where we are today as a business we are either at or within sniffing distance of all those line items except for sales and marketing and as practitioners of the business, we constantly evaluate growth versus profitability and the fact that we’re growing at 10 times at the rate of the market and much faster than the rate of the competition we are committed to delivering profitability over time but we don’t want to strive to get to be as profitable as possible because we would be leaving a great opportunity on the table. That’s our viewpoint on it and we’ve been pretty consistent – we’ve been very consistent since the time we went public around the target model exiting Q4 of FY16.
Operator: Your next question comes from Walter Pritchard – Citigroup.
Walter Prichard: Can you talk about on the attach of subscriptions, you mentioned the threat prevention where it is in the approaching 80%, we can kind of do the math on WildFire, as we think about WildFire and other subscriptions that you have, could they approach the 80% or how should we think about the potential peak of attach on those?
Mark D. McLaughlin : Yes, I think particularly WildFire as an example is a close first cousin to threat prevention when you kind of think about what it does and then particularly when those two things work together, so I think we can see pretty high attach rates on the WildFire. The other ones are already selling very well at very high attach rates and we have Global Protect which is doing nicely. It’s still our smallest one, as I think the market works through what mobile security is going to look like in the future. We like that one a lot but we think it’s going to take some time for folks to come to the understanding of how mobile security should be done. Then on top of that, we have Traps as well which is not – it’s not an attach rate as you know, but I think of it as our fifth service from a financial perspective and we have great expectations for that.
Walter Prichard: Just a follow up to that, should we think about Traps as kind of the next driver here in terms of attach so to speak or do you have in your back pocket other subscription services that might start becoming meaningful that we don’t have released or maybe sort of fledging in beta or something like that over the next couple of years?
Mark D. McLaughlin : I think about Traps as a fifth service here even though it won’t have an attachment rate concept to it and we’re always evaluating additional subscription services and we have a high bar [indiscernible] those folks have had value in in the past, ideally they’re delivered with hardware, can be assumed into our platform in very elegant, graceful, and a highly integrated way so we’re constantly evaluating things that could fit that bill and I would expect us to have more services in the future.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gray Powell – Wells Fargo.
Gray Powell: Just a couple if may. Maybe starting off with a bigger picture question, I think in about four maybe five years, you’ve been able to take a high single digit share of the network security market and a much higher flow share of new growth. How should we think about the opportunity in endpoint security and what do you see as the gaining factors of driving share gains in that market?
Mark D. McLaughlin : We’re still single digit players in the close to $19 billion addressable market opportunity if you look out a couple of years from today as far as the size of the market, and that is for enterprise security of which the endpoint is a portion of that. For us, that’s a completely untapped portion of that addressable market opportunity and I think we have two things going for us there. The first is that Traps itself is high disruptive. It is truly doing prevention on endpoint, something nobody has seen before and it’s very, very effective. In addition to that, when it’s working with the rest of the network security platform it really gives you end-to-end protection prevention across the entire network. So, we think it’s the combination of those two things that will help us drive penetration into the endpoint market and be able to do so at high growth rates. On the flip side, we love Traps as well because it also is a great benefit to our existing customers or folks who would look at us just for network security so we think it’s also going to benefit us from a sales perspective on the network side of the business. So, those two things working in tandem are pretty nice for us.
Gray Powell: One more if I may, can you help us just think about the scalability of Palo Alto’s management console as we think about the potential for you guys to do larger deals? Along those lines, how many appliances can customers manage in some of your largest deployments today?
Mark D. McLaughlin : On the management platform which we call Panorama is very, very scalable. I think a few years ago some of our competition would like to say that it was somehow a limiting factor for us. We put a lot of time and attention to that over the last few years both on the software side and also we introduced a hardware platform that Panorama can run on as well the M-100 so that we can have lots of scalability around that. I have not heard a customer in years bring up management platform as any buy in objections. As far as the capability set, it can manage thousands of devices right now and the deployments out there today are 500 plus devices usually running on Panorama so I don’t think there are any limitations at all.
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Zeller – Needham & Company.
Scott Zeller: I just wanted to go back to the budget question from earlier. Could you tell us how often you’re now seeing line items called out for cyber security when you’re competing for deals? If you do see that in opportunity, does that typically mean a larger deal I’m assuming?
Steffan C. Tomlinson: I think we’re seeing the transition that is in play, and this will take some time, into hearing the word cyber security generally used by C suite executives on the technology side so CIOs, CISO, conversations. But at the same time dealing with people who are actually rolling up their sleeves in operating technology who talk in terms of the network and things that have to run in the network so that’s an evolution of those two things over time. When people are talking about cyber security, we like that a lot of course because we say, “In cyber security prevention should be your ultimate objective and if you want to future proof your organization in order to do protection and prevention all the way from the network down to the endpoint, then we’ve got the answer to that.” When they bring the operating guys into the room, to really dig into that we’re also able to have very fantastic conversations with them about each aspect of that so they might want to talk about the firewall, we can talk about the firewall, if they want to talk about the endpoint, we talk about the endpoint, talk about IPS, we can talk about IPS, we can talk about all the capabilities after that at both a C suite executive level as well as people who actually have to run stuff at the end of the day, so it’s working well.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Nowinski – Piper Jaffray.
Andrew Nowinski: I think last quarter you had about 3,000 WildFire paying customers, I’m just curious to know if that changed this quarter and whether Traps can be driving some of that demand for WildFire? Then I just have a quick follow up.
Mark D. McLaughlin: We were just shy of 4,000 paying customers so a great quarter for us in customer addition on paid WildFire. I think Traps has not been in the market long enough to be influencing WildFire sales, probably the opposite as some of the deals we saw were around Traps in the quarter, but those two things working in conjunction should help each other out over a long term basis.
Andrew Nowinski: Then can you just talk about whether WildFire is predominately having success when the customer is already a Palo Alto customer or whether it’s drawing you into some new deals where the customer doesn’t already have a Palo Alto firewall?
Mark D. McLaughlin: It’s both. Both situations. We’ve found that if you’re an existing Palo Alto Networks customer not yet using WildFire, the idea that you can do real time malware prevention for known threats and then very, very fast detection and downstream kill chain impacts for malware that is zero day, is a very compelling conversation and of course, we also get to say, “You already bought the infrastructure to support that capability set so you should use WildFire.” In addition to that, when we go into new opportunities and they’re not using our technology at all yet, we very much talk to the platform and the prevention capabilities of the platform and when people hear that, if they’re going to purchase Palo Alto Networks for the first time, they’re inclined to buy WildFire along with that first purchase because they want that advanced persistent threat detection right up front.
Operator: Your next question comes from Aaron Schwartz – Macquarie.
Aaron Schwartz: On the target operating margins, I know you just mentioned and you talked about it before the sales and marketing is really the area for leverage, the question I have is how do you think about the mix between indirects and direct sales, presumably indirect is going to play a part there in the greater leverage and historically a lot of channel partners might be a little bit more network centric with security. Are there things or what are the milestones to continue to ramp the indirect side to get to your target margins or are the target margins just a factor of top line growth and you can get there independent of any mix in the channel?
Steffan C. Tomlinson: There are definitely two things that play there, two of which you just said. The first is we are continuing to build out our channel infrastructure. We have a great partner Ecosystem, and as we invest in the channel, train the channel, the percentage of deals that the channels can close with as little touch from Palo Alto Networks as possible, that will be more leverage for us in the model. We will be getting more revenue growth by virtue of having more channel partners out there. We’ve always described our sales model as a high touch indirect fulfillment type model so literally close to 100% of deals get fulfilled through the channel but we have a great direct touch sales force that sells side-by-side with the channels. So what we’ve done in the past, under Mark Anderson’s leadership, is we’ve done account segmentation with looking at global 2000 accounts and major accounts, and in those instances we have very nice high touch direct sales folks, sometimes working in concert with the channel partners as well doing those deals. For deals that are outside of the very large enterprises, we’re going to be looking more towards our indirect partners to take more of that business from beginning to end. Additionally, how we get to that target sales and marketing line is we’ll have more tramped sales people than ramping sales people over time. That’s a key component and the fact that we have such a great lifetime value concept where once we acquire a customer and we’re able to sell more to the install base, those repeat sales that happen come at a lower cost of sales to the company. So strategically we have the direct and indirect function but we also have more ramped people than ramping and other elements that I just covered.
Operator: Your next question comes from Hendi Susanto – Gabelli & Company.
Hendi Susanto: A question for Steffan, your R&D was 11.9% in Q1 and 12.3% in fiscal year in 2014 which are below your midterm target of 13% to 15%. Could you give some insight on whether we can expect R&D as a percentage of revenue to be below that target in the near future? Additionally, services gross margin was very strong, I’m wondering whether we are seeing the uplift of favorable mix towards subscription and operating leverage in service business that we can expect to continue?
Steffan C. Tomlinson: Well, for R&D we keep the filter very tight around the folks who are bringing into the company and we are committed to making the best investments that we can. Our commitment to innovation within R&D has translated very well into new production introductions really changing the game on competition. Overtime, we feel like in order to sustain the innovation engine we should be around call it 13% or 14%, so there’s going to be some lumpiness as we get there. Additionally, on R&D we’re starting to really build out the Traps team in Tel Aviv, that was prior to our Cyvera acquisition so we are going to see more investment in that business as well. So, I can’t really comment on the specific near term but we feel good about our target model and we feel like to adequately be committed to innovation you have to be in call it the 13% to 14% range. On the topic of services gross margins, there are two elements to services gross margins. The first is we are definitely getting the benefit of increasing attached rates to subscriptions and remember, subscriptions are software type gross margins so as we get more subscription revenue that will definitely translate into higher services gross margins. The other part of the services gross margins is the customer support organization and that’s really people and systems intensive. What we are starting to see are early days of getting some scale in that group and you can imagine with the sheer number of customers we’ve acquired, we’ve been adding well over 1,000 customers per quarter now for 12 quarters in a row, we need to be investing in that customer support organization but we’re doing it prudently. So we believe pound-for-pound we have the best customer support organization on the planet and now we’re starting to see some leverage. We’re getting two positive tailwinds in services gross margins.
Operator: Your next question comes from Erik Suppiger – JMP Securities.
Erik Suppiger: On Traps, I was wondering can you give us a sense for how that might scale and maybe give us a sense relative to WildFire? You’ve talked about that market size as being significantly bigger but I think you had a different sales model for that so you’re starting to see the elements there, when could we see Traps maybe start to exceed the customer base that you have for WildFire?
Mark D. McLaughlin: A couple of thoughts around that. The first is that by having Traps in the first place and entering into the endpoint security market, the additional to the addressable market opportunity is anywhere between $4 billion to $5 billion depending on who’s numbers you look at. Though the endpoint security market is a larger market than what we’ve seen folks who have tried to triangulate on the market called [indiscernible] where WildFire specifically may fall into which have seen anywhere from $1 billion to $2 billion market opportunity. They’re just different addressable market opportunities in the first place with Traps being a broader one just as far as what the market looks like in terms of size. Given that, we like that market a lot and as I said a little bit earlier when those two things are operating together it’s a killer offering for folks because you’re getting real time exploit prevention, you’re getting real time malware prevention for known threats, and you’re getting very, very fast turnaround for unknown threats both at the network and on the enterprise so we’re thinking about those two things together. As far as what we expect to see from Traps, we like the early interest in the market, we like the fact that we’re closing deals already. We think given the subscription model and the time it will take to ramp the sales and a few other things, that we’ll see meaningful revenue contribution in fiscal ’16 and sales billing throughout the back half of fiscal ’15 but we’re very excited about this opportunity.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Turits – Raymond James.
Michael Turits: Just on WildFire and Traps, in each of those two products who are you specifically going up against in deals with each of those products?
Mark D. McLaughlin: On the WildFire situation, when people think about that they usually think about advanced persistent threats and there are some folks who would position themselves in the market as more comprehensive so that way all the standard network security competitors, we’re seeing CISCO, Juniper, Checkpoint who have offerings in that space as well, so that’s more our platform will beat them on a head-to-head basis relative to any of their point solutions that they have. Then the most direct competition we see as far as the standalone player there would be [Fire Ring]. On Traps, the big players in that market are the legacy folks in [Nantech] trend, and MacAfee and ultimately a big part of the market opportunity is in that legacy space. There’s a host of next gen endpoint folks out there today as well that we’re competing with who are trying to land next to, as a complement to some of those legacy guys as a first step so we’re competing in both cases legacy – but probably today more and more on the next gen guys who are competing for the space on the endpoint to do something new.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Kvaal – Northland.
Jeff Kvaal : I have two questions and Steffan they both may be for you actually. I’m wondering if you could comment on number one, the linearity in the quarter, it looks like it was great, could you talk about why linearity is improving and should we expect it to revert to last year’s level at some point? Then secondarily, if you wouldn’t mind, could you tell us more about what was in the consulting element of the G&A uptick and particularly if it’s going to be recurring?
Steffan C. Tomlinson: Linearity in the quarter was very good. Why it’s happening is we are getting a broader pipeline heading into each quarter which is nice and the close rates have been very robust so we’re able to close deals earlier because of the technological differentiation and the power of the platform that we have in addition to great sales execution. So we’ve had the differentiation that we’ve always had but now we have more feet on the street, more firepower, and we’re able to close deals earlier. It’s too soon to tell whether or not the linearity will continue to be at these levels, but certainly in our fiscal Q2, one of the interesting things about a company like ours that has a quarter end in January is December typically is a strong month because of calendar year end budget flush so we’d expect to do a very good portion of our business through month two and we’ll see if that holds up this year and there are no indications that it won’t. As far as consulting services, at the end of the last fiscal year we had a couple of consulting projects roll off and in Q1 we had some come back on mainly in the tax area that we started to make some investments in. As we build out that organization we’re relying on some external consultants and then also we got some other, I’ll call it discreet projects, that we’re working on all with the intent of helping us get more scale going forward so think of it as finance and accounting projects as well in order to get more future leverage. So there’s a little bit of quarterly [indiscernible] around projects rolling off and some projects starting and that’s what you really saw. As far as will it increase at the same rate, certainly not over time because we’re looking at a target model of 5% to 6% for G&A so directionally over time that should go down but there will be quarterly [indiscernible].
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our question and answer session. I’ll now turn the call back over to Mark McLaughlin for closing comments.
Mark D. McLaughlin: Thanks everybody for being on the call this afternoon. We had a great start to the year and we’re really energized for the opportunity we see as we move into fiscal ’15 and beyond. We think we’re at the right market, the right time, with marketing leading protection and prevention technology. We would like to thank Palo Alto Networks’ team for all their hard work and support, for all of our customers and partners as we continue our march to be the leading enterprise security provider in the world. I wish everyone a happy and healthy Thanksgiving holiday. Thanks for being with us.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today’s conference and we thank you for your participation.

Mark McLaughlin - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Kelsey and thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. I am happy to be here today to share with you our results for our fiscal fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2014. We continue to see a large amount of momentum in the business and Q4 was strong across the board. We delivered record billings in revenue, with revenue for the fourth quarter growing 18% sequentially and 59% year-over-year to $178 million along with Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.11. It was a great end to a very good year for us and I would like to thank the Palo Alto Networks team for their hard work and our customers and partners for their ongoing support. Our results continue to demonstrate our ability to significantly outgrow both our competitors and the market and we are more confident than ever that our platform architecture and strategy is unique, compelling and far ahead of the competition. In addition to our strong financial performance, we also celebrated the number of milestones and highlights. In Q4 we added a record number of new customers by a wide margin and we are now privileged to serve more than 19,000 global customers, up from 13,500 at the beginning of the fiscal year. This customer base is highly diversified across verticals and geographies and includes more than 850 of the Global 2000 and 75 of the Fortune 100. On this list are some of the largest high-tech, financial services, government, manufacturing and service provider organizations in the world who entrust their security to our unique platform and superior solutions. New customer wins this quarter include a large U.S. retailer where we replaced Cisco to become their enterprise wide security platform, a Canadian government agency where we beat Check Point and replaced Juniper to become their agency wide security provider and a substantial expansion of our footprint and one of Check Point’s largest global customers in financial services. In addition to continued acceleration and the pace of new customer acquisition the size of commitments from our customers is growing underscoring a momentum in the market and the power of our platform. To make our top 25 customer list in the fourth quarter a customer had to have spent a minimum of $5.6 million in lifetime value, a good measure of the power of our land and expand model. This threshold is more than 10% increase over last quarter and more than 50% increase over the last year. And if I expand this list to our top 100 customers each has spent a minimum of $2.3 million on our solutions, up 20% sequentially and 75% year-over-year. Customers across our install base continue to make larger and larger commitments to us as they remove legacy technologies and point products in favor of our next generation security platform. On the products side we generated significant traction with our newly introduced security offerings. Sales of our PA-7050 chassis significantly exceeded our internal forecasts as our customers moved to adopt Palo Alto Networks as the platform of choice in high throughput environments like the data center. We also see a strong pipeline for our Palo Alto Networks for NSX offering with our partner VMware. And we are happy to close a number of deals in the quarter around this solution including a new opportunity with one of the most highly recognized brands in the world. The data center is one of our fastest growing use cases, as enterprises realize the need for the most advanced security at the highest levels of enterprise performance for both north/south and east/west traffic protection. On subscription services side, we had another great quarter with WildFire, the market’s only advanced persistent threat detection and prevention offering. In Q4 we added a record number of paid customers bringing our total paid base to over 3000. We achieved this footprint in just under two years making us one of the largest APT solution providers by customer account in the market. WildFire attach rates and devices shipped grew to over 40% in the quarter and we are not resting on laurels. To further extend our technology leadership in the APT solutions space, we have recently reduced the average time from APT detection to prevention to approximately 15 minutes down from approximately 28 minutes last quarter. We will continue to aggressively compress this timeframe to provide the best prevention capabilities to our customer base which is clearly voting for the power of the highly integrated and automated capabilities in our platform versus standalone point products. The newest addition to our platform is TRAPS the advanced endpoint protection offering we acquired with Cyvera in the spring. We have ambitious and aggressive plan for TRAPS and we are very happy to report they were hitting all the milestones. Integration of the two companies is going well. We have completed proof of concepts with major customers who have very strong interest and unique exploit prevention capabilities in the offering especially with the added integration with WildFire. We will make this new version of TRAPS generally available in the market by the end of September and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout our new fiscal year. Our sustainable growth is not only driven by unique and differentiated technology but also by highly productive and meaningful distribution partnerships. I would like to thank our global partners for the dedication and support in fiscal 2014 as they are key to our success. We will continue to focus on increasing distribution and expanding routes to market with strategic partners like Westcon Group. In fact in August we announced that we will now be doing business with Westcon in over 40 countries. Our unique and differentiated offerings combined with their global distribution capacity and logistics capabilities will generate significant opportunities for both companies. And we also recently announce the creation of Unit 42, our new threat intelligence team which provides actionable security related context to our customers and further enhance our ability to prevent future attacks. And finally we took advantage of a market window to complete a convertible debt offering on very favorable terms. The net proceeds of just over $525 million as additional resources to our already strong balance sheet, in hindsight this was a very productive quarter and year for us. Our market leading consistent growth is due to superiority of our unique platform approach to security. Unlike other providers in the security market we have a true platform that is designed and built from the ground up. We provide tightly integrated and automated detection and prevention capabilities at enterprise class performance levels and are proven to be extremely flexible and have proven to be extremely flexible and extensible from the face of every change of security needs. We do this for all users on all devices, on all parts of the network all the time. And we believe that our results demonstrate that the market is quickly adopting Palo Alto Networks as the leading enterprise security platform. With that, I will wrap it up, and turn the call over to Steffan.
Steffan Tomlinson - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you Mark, and thank you for joining us on our call today. Before I get into the details of our results and guidance, I’d like to note that except for revenue figures that are GAAP, all financial figures are non-GAAP unless stated otherwise. Now, let me start with an overview. The acceleration of customer acquisition, billings, revenue and adjusted free cash flow underscore the power of our land, expand, and retain strategy. The enterprise security market is $16 billion growing to over $19 billion in 2017 and we’re substantially outpacing the growth rates of both our competitors and our addressable market. We continue to balance investment and growth with profitability and our hybrid SaaS model plays a key role in our success with increasing revenue visibility, leverage and cash flow generation. Our results highlight the differentiation of our solutions in the power of our financial model. Turning to the numbers, Q4 total revenue grew 59% over the prior year and 18% sequentially to another record of $178.2 million. For the fiscal year, we reported revenue of $598.2 million, a 51% increase over the prior year. The geographic mix of revenue for Q4 was 68% Americas, 21% EMEA and 11% APAC. Compared to the prior year, the Americas grew 74%, EMEA grew 54% and APAC grew 7%. As in previous quarters we saw broad strength across a wide range of verticals and we did not have any end customer concentration. Product, subscription and support, the three components of our hybrid SaaS model, all grew very well in fiscal 2014, with particular strength in Q4. Q4 product revenue of $99.7 million, increased to 52% over the prior year and 19% sequentially. We saw a strong demand across our entire product family, with particular strength in the contribution from our highest end appliances, including the PA-7050, which is providing greater opportunity in the data center market. When we ship a product, we typically bill and recognize all of the revenue at the time of shipment. Our recurring services revenue of $78.5 million increased 67% over the prior year and 18% sequentially and accounted for a 44% share of total revenue. Recurring services are billed at the time of shipment and revenue is recognized over the duration of the contract. Looking at the two components of recurring services, the first component is our SaaS-based subscription revenue of $37.6 million, which increased 74% over the prior year and 18% sequentially. We currently have four subscription services each priced at 20% of the appliance list price per year. In the fourth quarter, customers purchased on average 2.1 subscriptions per devices compared to 1.9 in Q2 fiscal 2014 and 1.7 in Q4 fiscal 2013. As they continue to move to our integrated platform approach versus standalone offerings. Support and maintenance revenue, the second component of recurring services was $40.9 million, an increase of 62% over the prior year and 18% sequentially. Support and maintenance is priced at approximately 16% of the appliance list price per year. Billings in Q4 were $232.9 million, an increase of 64% year-over-year and 20% sequentially. From an annual perspective, total billings for fiscal 2014 were $771.4 million and grew 51% year-over-year. Product billings were $340.2 million and grew 40%, accounting for 44% of total billings. Support billings were $216.7 million and grew 59%, accounting for 28% of total billings. In subscription, billings were $214.5 million and grew 65%, accounting for 28% of total billings. Growth in recurring services billings positively impacts deferred revenue. Total deferred revenue in Q4 was $422.6 million, an increase of 70% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. Short-term deferred revenue increased to $259.9 million, an increase of 69% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. Total gross margin for Q4 was 76.7%, an increase of 220 basis points compared to last year and 60 basis points sequentially. Our target operating model gross margin range is 73% to 76% as we exit Q4 of fiscal 2016. Product gross margin was 75.7%, an increase of 50 basis points year-over-year and a decrease of 60 basis points sequentially. We expect there will be fluctuations in product gross margin primarily due to product mix, which was the case this quarter. Services gross margin for Q4 was 78%, an increase of 450 basis points year-over-year and 210 basis points sequentially due in part to ongoing growth in the contribution from subscription services. For the quarter, research and development expense was 11.6% of revenue increasing approximately $2.1 million sequentially to $20.8 million. This was primarily due to the addition of Cyvera. Sales and marketing expense for Q4 was 51.9% of revenue increasing approximately $21.5 million sequentially to $92.6 million. The primary driver of sales and marketing expense was sales commissions and end-of-year accelerators attributable to very strong top line performance in Q4. It is worth noting that we incur the full commission expense when the order is booked, but recognize revenue for the majority of an order ratably over the term of the contract, which does not match the expense with the revenue in the quarter. General and administrative expense for Q4 was 5.1% of revenue, decreasing approximately $2.3 million sequentially to $9 million. As a reminder, non-GAAP G&A expense does not include the final IP litigation expense of approximately $2 million related to the settlement announced for Juniper earlier this quarter. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was 1,722, up from 1,556 at the end of Q3 fiscal 2014. In total, Q4 operating expenses were $122.3 million or 68.6% of revenue. Operating margin grew 10 basis points year-over-year to 8.1% and decreased sequentially 100 basis points. As I mentioned, momentum in the business drove especially strong performance this quarter, which amplified the typical commission related seasonality we anticipate at fiscal year end. We expect to see sequential improvement in non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 fiscal ‘15. Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for Q4 and fiscal 2014 was 38% and net income for the quarter was approximately $9.1 million or $0.11 per diluted share using 83 million shares compared with net income of $5.5 million or $0.07 per diluted share in Q4 2013. For fiscal 2014, we reported net income of $31.8 million or $0.40 per diluted share compared with net income of $18.2 million or $0.24 per diluted share in fiscal 2013. On a GAAP basis for the fourth quarter, net loss was $32.1 million or $0.41 per basic and diluted share. This compares with a Q4 2013 GAAP net loss of $15.8 million or $0.22 per basic and diluted share. And for the full fiscal year 2014, we reported GAAP net loss of $226.5 million or $3.05 per basic and diluted share compared to GAAP net loss of $29.2 million or $0.43 per basic and diluted share in fiscal 2013. The increase in GAAP net loss was primarily driven by settlement expenses. We finished July with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $974.4 million. This includes the $527.7 million of net proceeds from our offering of convertible senior notes due in 2019, which priced at a 0% interest rate in June. Excluding the $75 million cash settlement payment related to Juniper, our adjusted cash flow from operations, free cash flow and free cash flow margin for Q4 were $48.9 million, $44.1 million and 24.8% respectively. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $4.7 million. For fiscal 2014, adjusted cash flow from operations and adjusted free cash flow were $163.4 million and $127.3 million respectively. Capital expenditures for the year totaled $36.1 million. And consistent with the strength we saw in the quarter, linearity in Q4 tracks slightly better than both Q3 and the prior year period. Our accounts receivable balance was $135.5 million this quarter, up from $114.8 million in Q3. DSOs increased sequentially by three days to 63 and declined year-over-year by 9 days. Turning to guidance, in Q1 2015 we expect revenue to be in the range of $178 million to $182 million which represents 39% to 42% growth year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be approximately $0.12 per share using 83 million to 85 million shares. Before I conclude I would like to highlight a number of considerations for modeling purposes. While seasonality has been difficult to determine due to strong growth, we believe that the longer term – over the longer term fiscal Q2 and Q4 may show our strongest sequential growth in revenue. And as we have said previously in fiscal year 2015 we expect to invest approximately $25 million or approximately $0.18 and $0.19 per share in TRAPS, our advanced end point protection offering which we acquired with Cyvera. Pricing for TRAPS will be on a per end point basis and we expect billings and free cash flow to ramp in the back half of fiscal 2015 and meaningful revenue contributions to begin in fiscal 2016 given the subscription nature of this offering. We expect CapEx for fiscal year 2015 to be in the range of $45 million to $50 million for the year and we expect to exit fiscal 2015 with a low-teens non-GAAP operating margin and we continue to expect to exit Q4 of fiscal 2016 at 22% to 25% non-GAAP operating margin. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 will be 38% on a non-GAAP basis and our share count is expected to increase by approximately 1% to 2% per quarter. With that I will turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse: Hi. Thanks guys and congrats on another just great quarter. You guys provided some commentary on gross margins and obviously gross margins were quite strong this quarter, I am wondering if you can give us a sense of just what you are seeing in the pricing environment out there just broadly speaking versus actually just sort of the mix and how that’s impacting your gross margins and how can you think about that going forward here? Thanks.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. Phil thanks for joining our call. As a general matter what we are seeing from a pricing perspective is our ability to maintain premium pricings due to the premium nature of our offering, we have seen a lot of pricing competition in the market as we continue to gain share from other folks but it hasn’t apparently affected our ability to hold the line in that. And I think you can see that across the line in the margins side, so with nice increase in margins and discounting for us has been very disciplined and consistent over time. So that’s generally what we are seeing in markets today.
Steffan Tomlinson: The other thing Phil is when you look at our increasing attach rate for subscriptions the overall total gross margins are benefiting from the tailwind that we are getting from increased subscription attach rates. So the fact that WildFire increased sequentially and we have very high attach rates for threat and URL filtering. Those are all benefits for gross margin.
Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse: Great and then also just switching gears for a sec to the relationship with VMware, you guys have been talking about it for a couple of quarters but it seem like you start to see some traction in that with the VM series, wondering if you can just provide some more details and what the feedback you are getting from potential customers there? Thanks.
Mark McLaughlin: The feedback has been really strong. So what we have seen in the early previous of this about six months ago was extremely high level of interest from folks across the board when we talk about it and be able to show them by the POCs. We are in the market this quarter with the solutions that we actually we sold things in this quarter including very nice large deal with one of the largest brands in the world who was one of the first customers for the joint solution which was fantastic. From the VMware perspective my understanding is that within the next 45 days this solution will be on their price list as the SKU as well. So the entire VM sales forces will have the ability to bring this to market as well. So we feel this is very positive momentum for this – for the technologies specifically. And then just as a general matter advanced security in the data center space and it’s great to be working with the leader there VMware.
Kelsey Turcotte: Next question please?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, it’s actually Ted on behalf of Karl. Given that you said that you had strong performance in the PA-7050 appliance this quarter, can you talk about the ASP trends? Did you see a meaningful improvement in the ASPs in this quarter?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, as a general matter Ted, from an ASP perspective, which we look at it from an initial sale, those have been going up every quarter very consistently on a modest basis. So we spend a lot more time and attention on with the life-time value the customer looks like, because from a buying kind of perspective, customers tend to – they tend to test us, they tend to find a place in the network. Their first purchase is to put us in a network somewhere and see that it actually works, and then the repeat purchases are come faster and consistently higher. But just as a general matter, ASPs continue to uptick every quarter, which is nice.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. And then just one follow-up. Then you had a strong lead quarter on top line billings and revenues are really strong. But as I look at the guidance for next quarter, you’re guiding almost flat revenues for Q1 versus Q4, which is quite a bit lower than your seasonal growth from Q1 to Q4 – actually Q4 to Q1. Are you just being conservative here or whether deals that you thought got pulled forward in this quarter?
Steffan Tomlinson: First, our guidance methodology is to always to give one quarter out guidance and exiting Q4, we look at a number of things, including pipeline and pipeline is very strong heading into Q1. When you look at year-over-year growth rate in Q1, we are looking at 31% to 40% year-over-year growth, which is much higher than a lot of the models that were out there. Additionally, you think about seasonality in our business and we feel like fiscal Q2 and fiscal Q4 will be the stronger quarters for us from a seasonal standpoint. And most companies of our size actually see sequential declines in revenue from Q4 to Q1. So, with that as the backdrop, we feel good about the quarter, the pipeline is good and we have a lot of momentum and visibility heading into fiscal Q1.
Kelsey Turcotte: Next question please.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley, please proceed.
Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley: Thanks on that. Thank you guys for taking the question and very nice quarter. It’s somewhat unusual for a company of your scale to see this type of acceleration in your overall business. Particularly, if you look at the billings growth going to 64% this quarter from sort of 50% growth last quarter. Anything in particular driving that acceleration, is it new products turning on, is it a better acceptance within the marketplace, anything that you could point us at sort of explain how business is actually getting better as you guys get there?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, thanks, Keith. Yes, it’s all the above. I think what we’re seeing here is, just as a really big picture is from a security perspective, it’s very apparent that I think security spending is growing, that enterprises around the world are recognizing that cyber securities are very lasting, an important and probably permanent line item from a spend perspective. They’re seeking out the best possible solutions for that from the most advanced technology providers. And I think that’s what our reputation in the market is perceived at today and growing very quickly. So when you think about – you think about that, you think about the size of the addressable market in order to have the right technology at the right time and history to take care of all these problems for enterprises, it’s really driving some fantastic growth and we had a very nice year. We had a fantastic quarter and as Steffan said, we’ve got a very nice pipeline going into Q1 as well, but I think we’ve got a lot of momentum here.
Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley: Got it. And then as a follow-up on the flip side of the equation for Steffan, you went – you reiterated sort of the targets for operating margins, exiting FY 2015 and exiting FY 2016. And if I’m not mistaken, that’s still not reflected in sell-side models and at least – or at least in the consensus expectations, so there is some scepticism about that operating margin leverage. So maybe you can walk us through some of the key components of where we should be expecting that leverage and sort of how you guys push that extra margin out of the business?
Steffan Tomlinson: Well, margin expansion is going to come primarily from sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue. When you compare where we are today versus what our target is, we are at 51.9% ending in Q4 and our target exiting Q4 FY 2016 is to be 33% to 36%, and how we bridge, where we are today to where we will be in the future, it comes out of having more productive sales folks that are in the mix and given the great performance in Q4 and we’ll have more ramped sales people than ramping, exiting Q4 FY 2015 and Q4 FY 2016, that will be very helpful. From a partner standpoint, we have Westcon in the mix that will help with global distribution and we will look to get more leverage out of our partner infrastructure. The other part of the equation is going to be contribution from other partners, such as VMware and other partnerships like that that will strike. And when you think about a sales person and what they can contribute to the company, it’s all about adding more tools to the tool bag. And with these partnerships in the global distribution capacity and the great sales and marketing leadership that we have in the company, we feel comfortable that we can get the leverage out of that line. Every other line in our operating margin structure is at or near our target model. So, we will have a very strong focus on sales and marketing leverage over these next eight quarters and we feel like we are setup to do it. The final point I will make is we always take an eye towards balancing growth with profitability. And the fact that we are able to reaccelerate top line growth at these levels and you look at the billings performance, we are able to take down lot of business on the street in a profitable manner and we will continue to look to take share. And we have 5% market share, 5% to 7% market share in a $20 billion market. There is a lot of wood left to chop.
Mark McLaughlin: Keith, one other point I would make as well as I think you have written about this couple of times, but it is – when you look at our installed base of the repeat purchasing patterns, our installed base, what repeat repurchase has come at a lower cost of sale for us. So, the power of that installed base and that LTV numbers we are looking at every quarter will also drive reduced cost of sale over time.
Kelsey Turcotte: Great. Next question?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed.
Walter Pritchard - Citi: Hey, thanks. Just had a question around I think you talked on the call in your prepared remarks about 70% of each of the – even the Fortune 100 or Fortune 500 are customers and I note that your largest store, I guess your second largest competitor, Checkpoint has a similar staff, although a bit higher, I am wondering if getting to this point with the 70%, could you sort of compare and contrast, you must co-exist in lot of accounts and there are some accounts I am sure where you had success in displacing incumbents. Can you talk about sort of in those large accounts, how you co-exist, when did you co-exist?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, sure. It’s a great question, Walter. I think what we have seen consistently and is really picking up is Palo Alto Networks is becoming I think the more recognized leader here from the most advanced security is that everybody started somewhere right, everybody has got a legacy vendor in a lot of cases, those are Checkpoint. So, in almost every situation, we come into as we have said we are displacing it. So, we are coming into the network. We often co-exist for a while in the network with whoever the legacy vendor and then over time we gradually displaced them and that’s what you are saying through all the TV analysis and the customer acquisition. So, it’s not surprising to be in a network for somebody else, but I think it’s a very clear trend that we are taking people out of the network every quarter more and more.
Walter Pritchard - Citi: And then just one follow-up on I think you mentioned that Asia was – I mean, great performance in U.S. especially, I think you noted that Asia was up 7%, I think it was year-over-year. Can you talk about just that territory, I know it’s not that large from a revenue perspective, but what’s going on there and is there any change in terms of leadership or something that’s driving that?
Mark McLaughlin: Now, on the APAC basis is a great market for us and we think a fantastic growth opportunity. It’s the last of the markets that we entered from an entrance perspective a number of years ago. So, as far as coming up the curve on getting distribution capability straight on the street, it’s the least mature of our theatres. And in the quarter, on the 7% growth, you have to look back to last fourth quarter had a really great Q4 last year. So, the compare was pretty tough there, but we really like that market.
Kelsey Turcotte: Great. Next question please.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Rob Owens with Pacific Crest. Please proceed.
Rob Owens - Pacific Crest: Great, thank you. I was wondering if you can touch a little bit on the acceleration that you saw in customer acquisition and is this a function of the Juniper lawsuit being behind you, are you guys coming to the market now to much broader product set with the 1,750 or is this a function of replacement cycle and where we are there? Thanks.
Steffan Tomlinson: Yes, Rob. Yes, I don’t think I need to do the Juniper thing, I think that what’s happening and we saw it consistently every quarter. So, our customer count grew every quarter very nicely and by a wide margin in the fourth quarter. So, it was fantastic. I think what we are just seeing is the recognition of Palo Alto Networks, particularly on a global basis as not only the technology leader here, but also with the company the ability to execute against that. So, when you think about our – everything else is going on in the company outside of technology from all the work that Mark and his team have done from a very mature repeatable sales process, all the discipline we are bringing the channels organization, the fact that we have made the distributors who are now agreeing to distribute us on a global basis. We just can’t ignore it anymore from that perspective. We have I think the highest customer satisfaction scores in the industry. All those things are very important. And from your reputation perspective, customers talk to each other and what they are hearing is that Palo Alto actually solves very hard problems, the installations get done, the deployments work, the technology works and that the customers continued to buy more and more from us and that’s a self fulfilling thing for us which we discontinue to grow off of our really, really high customer satisfaction. We have rapidly positive fans, which is our customers which is great to have that kind of fan base and they do a lot of selling for us.
Rob Owens - Pacific Crest: Great. And can you talk a little bit about the revenue model in around the NSX solution and if you look at micro segmentation, are you moving for more of a subscription base model for your traditional firewall?
Mark McLaughlin: It’s been, but we have two we have well just for NSX we have two models there. One is perpetual license and the other is per use license. So we have given the customers the option to go either for server or for both – I am sorry for term or for perpetual and then we will see what happens as they plays out. Some of that will come down to whether they are more interested in CapEx models or OpEx models but both and time will tell which of those will be might be more popular.
Kelsey Turcotte: Great. Next question?
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed.
Brent Thill - UBS: Mark, in EMEA you have seen several quarters of sequential growth on a year-over-year basis. And I know you mentioned back at the Analyst Day that you are making good progress in converting some of the distributors over that were on legacy solutions to your platform. I am just curious if you can give us an update and what’s happening there is that what’s happening with this conversion and you are seeing in terms of acceleration of growth and I have had a quick follow-up for you?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, that’s part of it, Brent. So, we have focused in the past and we mentioned to you guys about distribution being very important from a capacity perspective. When you think about the size of the company right now we are actually pretty large player and growing at excessive rates relative to any of the competition. And what that’s resulted in I think is from a distribution and partners perspective is folks that may have had a concern about maybe they are going to wrap Palo Alto Networks because they are going set one of their existing vendors. They just have to get pass that we are just too big to not be on everybody’s line card at this point and that’s what we are seeing. And the announcement with Westcon we announced recently is a perfect example of that. It increased our capabilities with them over 40 countries, a lot of those are in Europe. They have been a great partner in the U.S. already, so this is expansion outside of our core market with one of the best in the world. So that’s a perfect example of what is happening with distribution which is the recognition and desire to want to work Palo Alto as and live with Palo Alto because that’s what the customers clearly want.
Brent Thill - UBS: Okay. And just from a federal government perspective we are obviously coming into an important close for their fiscal year, I am curious if you can maybe just highlight what you are seeing there this year versus perhaps what you saw last year if there is any contrast in the overall environment?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. The fed market has always been a good one for us. It’s a good vertical I think if you think about what those folks need and what we provide from a solution perspective, it’s match made and haven’t and from a customer perspective they buy at good rates from us. No vertical is more than 12% of our business. So we are not really dependent on any single vertical, but we have experienced good growth in the fed space and we would expect with their year end being in our first quarter, we would see a nice quarter with this federal space as well. I think if you look historically call two years ago, a year ago I think it seems to be set settling out. There was all kinds of things from budgets and sequestration all those sorts of things it has substantially subsided in that market over the last year which is a benefit not only to everybody but us as well.
Kelsey Turcotte: Great. Next question.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Please proceed.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair: Good afternoon and strong results, congratulations. Just wanted to dig in a little bit into the spending environment, I mean clearly it looks like things are – came back up again I just wanted to get a sense from you guys around the magnitude of the as you can maybe quantify what the spending environment strength looks like. And number two primarily where you are seeing that strength in terms of verticals?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. I think Jonathan on the spending environment side what I have witnessed over the last couple of years is that security as a line item in the IT budget I think has increased just as a budget line item. And I think there is a growing realization that with that increase is going to stay there, right over time because security is very real, it’s very lasting, it’s global in nature and everybody has to deal with that. And I think that’s in that positive for everybody. From a vertical perspective as a general matter you usually see some verticals out of ahead of other ones on being a cut of edge of technology. I think we’re beyond that at this point for cyber security as a general matter meaning we’re seeing Middle America at least these are from our own results. Middle America, very large companies in the Fortune 500 that they’re never the first to go to newer platforms are quickly adopting Palo Alto Networks as a platform of choice. I think that’s an example of what you’re going to see across the board where the recognition of cyber security is very important and you have to spend on it, this is going to be persistent over time.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair: Got it. And then just regarding the TRAPS in cyber opportunity, I mean, can you guys maybe talk a little about sort of the initial customer reception. I think you mentioned a lot of interest there and the potential to integrate with WildFire, but maybe just talk to what is it that’s differentiated and sort of the initial reception from customers based on that differentiation?
Mark McLaughlin : Yes, the thing that I think the customers are desiring and we hopefully will be delivering for them is that the end points are the Wild West cyber security wise right now. So I think we’ve done a nice job on the network and with our cloud-based services from a detection and prevention perspective, but unless you have better protection of the endpoint that’s very porous and a lot of that stuff gets in there. Almost everything in the market today there is really focused on just detecting bad things and then you’re going to sort of all of the forensics remediation mode. And what’s Cyvera has and where we have now in bringing to market is something that it’s actually preventative in nature is true real-time exploit prevention, and that’s a extremely disruptive technology and concept, I think is disruptive is what we did with firewalls in next generation firewall space is what we’re bringing to market with the – in the endpoint space with this TRAPS technology. So you have this real-time exploit prevention and then we integrated it and this is what we are bringing to market at the end of September into WildFire. So now you have all the fantastic benefits of WildFire from a malware detection prevention capability, and all those thousands of customers that are on WildFire right now and growing, it leaps and bounce every quarter. And we’ve connected that, we’ve connected the power of what’s happening on the network. And now we have the same advanced disruptive capabilities on the end point. And that’s where customers are reacting to very positively in our POCs with them and the early looks that we’ve given them, so it’s very positive feedback, which is great.
Kelsey Turcotte: Thanks. Next question?
Operator:  And your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.
Raimo Lenschow - Barclays: Thanks for taking my question. If I can stay on the Cyvera case here, how does it – how will it change your sales setup, because if you look at like if the last organization is probably a different buying center or how do you need to specialize sales force for that or how does that going to work for you? And then I have a follow-up here.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, good question, Raimo. So traditionally, network and security, our network and endpoint are different buyers and that is the case today, and I expect that to continue to for some time, although I think when you get to CIO, CSO, CTO level, more and more they’re talking about securing the enterprise, and not drawing a technology distinction between those two things. They’re just saying hey we need to protect the enterprise, right. So when we come in with a solution that says here’s the network cloud-based services and the endpoint, they are all highly integrated and highly automated, they have worked well together, that resonates extremely well at the C level. However, there are still different buying centers and even though that may change over time, we want to be cognizant of that. And what we’re doing from a sales force perspective is building an overlay team for our endpoints that our specialist and they know how to sell to that buying center. So all of our sales people will be able to tell the story about the strategic solution and from a customer perspective of interest about endpoints, we have people coming in primarily on the SE side plus some sales expertise. They know how to talk to that buyer. So that will be a joint call to go get that close for hopefully the entire solutions that we sell.
Raimo Lenschow - Barclays: Okay. And the follow-up question I had is, if you look at WildFire and obviously having gaining really good traction there. But if you look at the market, there’s obviously some of our big players in there that’s having some momentum. What do you see in terms of the customer use cases? How are you getting deployed? Are you kind of the starting point for guys and then kind of they can go up market for some extra stuff or how are you fitting in that kind of competitive environment there? Thank you.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, we’re seeing a couple of things here Raimo. The first is that our very large and quickly growing installed base when we – what we’re selling is a platform play. So this is a strategic solution that can take care of all your cyber security needs across your entire enterprise and WildFire is a very important part of that. So if you’re an existing Palo Alto Networks’ customer and you see the technology as highly integrated and automated into this platform, that is a good sale like you want that technology and we’re seeing that from the installed base. The other thing we’re seeing which is fantastic and you saw by a wide margin this very high customer acquisition in the quarter is that’s a fantastic selling point for us for new customers. So if the top of mind issue for a prospect is Advanced Persistent Threats, we’re able to come in and do with a WildFire and say this is the markets only detection and prevention capability, I’ve got thousands of customers using it to prove it to you from a reference perspective, and when they take a look at WildFire as the entry point, they are often extremely interested in that and that’s what they want to buy and in the process of that they’re often taking more of the platform. So, we are – it’s not that we’re indifferent about how we get into account, but we can serve any use case and this is a very compelling use case for folks in the top of mind issue, so it also works on the prospecting side for new customer acquisition.
Kelsey Turcotte: Great. Next question.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.
Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray: Alright. Thanks a lot for taking the question today and congrats on the great quarter. Maybe just a follow-up on the gross margin side, I think you said product gross margin was down this quarter due to product mix, though you noted the PA-7050 significantly exceeded your internal forecasts. Given the significant revenue upside, can you just provide more clarity with regard to what products negatively impacted your product gross margins?
Steffan Tomlinson: Sure. Andrew, we’ve been pretty clear with the street around every time we introduce a new product, it’ll take several quarters to get up to scale in terms of volume and as volume scale, COGS come down, gross margins go up. With the PA-7050, we’ve been shipping it for about a quarter and half, so we still aren’t yet – we still are not yet at scale for the PA-7050. So while it’s great for – from a top line revenue standpoint, it’s not at scale yet from a gross margin standpoint. So over time, we should be getting more gross margin benefit out of the PA-7050, that’s probably the biggest driver. So when we refer to product mix, we had more PA-7050’s sold and that’s great for top line revenue, it had a slightly depressive impact on gross margins, but we’re talking about 60-basis point sequentially, year-over-year we’re up. So we feel very good about the discipline around gross margin management and COGS reduction efforts.
Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray: Got it. And then can you just talk about the competitive landscape and whether you’re anticipating any changes going forward by way of perhaps new product refreshes coming from some of the legacy firewall vendors? Thanks.
Mark McLaughlin: Andrew, it’s Mark. Yes, I don’t see anything on the market front that’s changing the game at all except us. We continue to innovate, I think every year we’ve brought out a number of really nice product innovations, new product lines like PA-7050, WildFire enhancements, what we are doing with VMWare, the TRAPS, I think we are pretty far ahead technically and I haven’t seen the competitors do anything other than revise the traditional legacy technology they have and that to me doesn’t appear to be working in the customer base as you can kind of see from customer acquisition and our growth rates.
Kelsey Turcotte: Great. Next question, please.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Bowe with Northland. Please proceed.
Jeff Bowe - Northland: Yes, thank you all for taking my question. I’d like to follow-up on Raimo’s a little bit from my entry and that is when we hear from some of the other APT players, they talk about how they like to win in the high-end. They do acknowledge that they are not as strong in the low-end. I’m wondering if you feel as though your own wins place yourself generally in the low-end of that market or is that generally across your customer base?
Mark McLaughlin:  Hey, Jeff, it’s Mark. It’s across the customer base we are seeing ever increasing strength there. So when I look at customers we’ve sold into from an installed base perspective, it’s a very high percentage of those Fortune 100 and Global 2000 customers we mentioned earlier. When we look at new customer acquisition, some of the largest brands in the world are buying WildFire right out of the gate; we’re closing lots of six-figure deals there, even bigger than that. So I think that’s a myth.
Jeff Bowe - Northland: Okay, great. And then secondly, Mark and Steffan, you both talked about the data center market as being a very strong one for the PA-7050. Can you bring us up-to-date on the service provider side, is that an area where you are seeing some success?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. So, it’s still early form a PA-7050 perceptive in a service provider market in a sense of those folks buying it for other purposes than for their own networks, right? So as large enterprises, they could go different than other folks about wanting the most advanced security and high-throughput environment. So they’re good customers for that technology. So from a sell-through perspective, we have been able to – now that we have the offering to sit down and start working our roadmaps with them about new opportunities to work with them to sell-through where they are using that technology in order to provide services say to SMBs and that’s a good opportunity for us in the future, but that’s in the roadmap planning phases.
Kelsey Turcotte: Great. Next question?
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Gur Talpaz with Stifel. Please proceed.
Gur Talpaz - Stifel: Great, thank you. What we saw there, is there a placement sale, can you actually operate in similar fashion to the core Firewall market where you can come in behind a pre-existing AB solution than sort of eventually displace them down the road?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. Gur, I think it’s exactly like that, right. I mean, what we are seeing from a customer perspective is folks very willing to take a look at a complementary technology that they have with an idea that perhaps it could be displacement down the road, but our initial selling motion is very much like you did in the early days in the Firewall, which is we have something disruptive, we have something better, you don’t have to. It’s not a binary decision. You don’t have to take somebody out for us to come in. And we like that approach, because when we get in and solve a really hard problem for the customer, we have a much better chance over time of growing inside there and displacing the legacy provider, but we don’t try to make the sale harder and it is by saying this is a binary thing.
Gur Talpaz - Stifel: Great. And with WildFire, can you talk about how many total customers you have and then with regards we have the new paid customers, are these sort of unpaid customers being up-sold to a paid subscription? Thank you.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. So, from our total paid customers right now, is over 3,000 we said from a total base, which includes the free customers, usually runs about 1,000 ahead of that or so. We have been – and you can kind of talk to those numbers we have been focused very much from a conversion perspective of taking free to paid and installing those to all new customers. So, I would say this is we will continue to have the free offering, because there is really no downside to that for us to get somebody to test the technology and then convert to paid. So, we will continue to have that free offering, but I think you can tell from the momentum here we are much more focused on the paid customers.
Kelsey Turcotte: So, in an effort to try and get through everyone’s questions, we would ask that you limit yourself to one question now. It would be great. Thanks.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Niknam with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Matthew Niknam - Goldman Sachs: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. Obviously, customer growth remains really strong. I am wondering if you can talk about how much of your revenue growth is coming from the existing base and maybe the opportunity for incremental up-sell you currently see among your customer base? Thanks.
Steffan Tomlinson: Yes, with over 19,000 end customers and we have been adding over 1,000 customers now for well over 10 quarters, it’s been a dynamic where once we land into a customer, it’s all about the expansion value. And Mark had mentioned earlier on around the lifetime value metric, we feel like we are, call it, less than 1% penetrated across the entire installed base of customers as we continue to sell more appliances, subscriptions and maintenance. That opportunity will only grow over time. The other thing is with Cyvera coming into the mix, we will have 19,000 customers in our installed base to go after in order to cross-sell and up-sell the opportunity there. So, we feel like we are in the very early innings of a nine-inning game around customer expansion opportunity.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. And I would say as well Matthew, we mentioned this back at the Analyst Day when you start to think about the power of the installed base and you look at the momentum around the LTV metrics, we anticipate there are multiple billions of dollars in the installed base right now without adding another customer that over time we can unlock.
Kelsey Turcotte: Great. Next question.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company. Please proceed.
Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Company: Thank you. Mark, it’s very clear that you are continuing to benefit from all of the sales investments that were made last year. Just wondering if there are any notable changes that you would point to over the last six months or so with regard to sales cycles?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. Sales cycles tend to be fairly consistent for us, which some are really short, some are really long right and we have said over the past that they generally average out about 90 days. And that really hasn’t changed for us. And I don’t anticipate the change either, because sometimes you have a customer who is in dire need of something right away and then a lot of our customers that we bring down, we might have worked with for two years over the course of the many tests and projects and then they make out a large purchase, but generally 90 days is about the average.
Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Company: Okay, thank you.
Mark McLaughlin: Thanks, Gregg.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please proceed.
Michael Turits - Raymond James: Hey, guys. Mark, obviously the huge move have been brought severe to get you from network into endpoint, how are you feeling about strategic positioning and whether or not there are other meaningful market segments that you need to get into possibly through acquisition whether or not they are attractive targets out there?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, I had never felt better about our position in the market Mike particularly with the addition of TRAPS to bring the end point. And with that we often show customers a try and go sort of picture of the network cloud based services and the end point I don’t anticipate that becoming a rectangle. I think that we have all the coverage we need from an enterprise security perspective. With that said, we look at the product roadmap, it’s very aggressive if we saw things that could accelerate us on that we would be interested buyers in those sorts of things. But from addressable market opportunity it’s massive right like $19 billion, $20 billion and single-digit percentage we don’t have to buy market share, we don’t have to buy customers, we don’t have to buy distribution capabilities. We are in a very good spot.
Kelsey Turcotte: Great. Next question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Catharine Trebnick with Dougherty & Company. Please proceed.
Catharine Trebnick - Dougherty & Company: Thanks for taking my question. I hope you can hear me. I have a quick one on managed services Mark, it seems like first if you want you sort of you said that there is an uptick and mid-sized companies wanted to outsource due to the complexity and the number of threats, then what led your product roadmap met to a managed service offering? Thanks.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. There is couple of ways on that Catharine. One I mean right now what’s happening in a lot of situations is there are service providers who run things on an outsourced network basis. So I mean the simplest form of that is managed service offering where like a large telco for example is running a network on behalf of another company. Sometimes not even small companies, sometimes pretty large companies and we do very well there. So all those large systems integrators and service providers are very familiar with our technology and there is a lot of cases where they are running that technology on behalf of the customer. Usually they are running probably the entire network of their customer on behalf of their customer and we are the security solution in there.
Kelsey Turcotte: Great. We have time for one question please.
Operator: And your final question comes from the line of Daniel Ives with FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Jim Moore - FBR Capital Markets: Great. Thanks guys. This is Jim Moore in for Dan Ives. Just wondering if you can talk a little bit about any changes that you might have seen in customer sentiment over the last quarter (indiscernible) litigation behind you?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. Jim this is Mark. We said in the past with the litigation that was really we hadn’t seen in the market that people were not going to buy from Palo Alto Networks as a result of that litigation. And I think our numbers historically have shown that compared to the customer acquisition, LTV, revenue growth I think everything supports that statement. And then when you look today really no evidence that we are wrong about that. So I don’t think that really had any impact at all.
Kelsey Turcotte - Vice President, Investor Relations: Great. Thanks everyone. I will turn it over to Mark for a few ending thoughts.
Mark McLaughlin - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Great, thanks. Thanks for being on the call this afternoon everybody. We had a really great quarter and a great year and we are energized by the opportunity as we move into our fiscal 2015 and beyond. I wanted to take one more opportunity to thank the Palo Alto Network’s team for all their hard work and the support of our customers and partners as we continue our march to become the global leader enterprise security. Thanks for your time.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. You all have a great day.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Third Quarter 2014 Palo Alto Networks Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Denise and I will be the operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-on mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now turn the conference over to your host for today, Kelsey Turcotte. Please proceed.
Kelsey Turcotte: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Palo Alto Networks’ fiscal third quarter 2014 financial results. This call is being broadcast live over the Web and can be accessed on the Investors section of the Palo Alto Networks’ Web site at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. With me on today's call are Mark McLaughlin, Palo Alto Networks’ Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Steffan Tomlinson, Chief Financial Officer. This afternoon, Palo Alto Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its fiscal third quarter ended April 30, 2014, and its settlement of litigation with Juniper Networks. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at the Company’s Web site. We would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, Palo Alto Networks’ management will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our revenue and earnings per share guidance for our fiscal fourth quarter, target operating model gross margins range, accelerating growth for all of our subscription services, expectations, plans and strategies relating to our acquisition and integration of Cyvera, demand and adoption of our products and services including demand for both our higher end appliances and WildFire products as well as our subscription services and our competitive position. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future and we undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. For a more detailed description of these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on February 24, 2014 and our earnings release posted a few minutes ago on our Web site. Also, please note that certain financial measures we use on this call are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain charges. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in the Investors section of our Web site located at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. Before I turn the call over to Mark, we would like to inform you that we expect our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2014 earnings conference call will be held after the market closes on Tuesday, September 9th. And with that, I will turn the call over to Mark.
Mark McLaughlin: Thank you, Kelsey and thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon. I am pleased to report another strong quarter of growth. In Q3, revenue grew by 49% year-over-year to approximately $151 million. Billings grew 46% year-over-year to approximately $194 million and we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.11. These results were driven by continued strong product demand, robust services growth and a rapid market share gains in the large and growing strategic enterprise security markets. We also announced this afternoon that we have settled all existing litigation with Juniper. I’ll provide some more details about that later in my remarks. The enterprise security market has been changing rapidly in the last few years due to a number of factors; the increasing number and sophistication of attacks has shown enterprises everywhere that cyber-attacks are a global, growing and lasting phenomenon. This realization has led enterprises to focus on the negative consequences of relying on legacy thinking, legacy technology and point products to try to secure their networks, and it is driving the demand for disrupted platform solutions that do not just detect and remediate but those that can protect and prevent. We believe that the solution for this challenge is a highly integrated and automated platform that enables enterprises to safely use all applications on their networks and to quickly turn unknown threats into known threats thereby protecting the enterprise from today’s most sophisticated attacks. We built this platform, starting with our next generation Firewall then continued with our next generation threat intelligence cloud that allows us to quickly add high value services to the platform and now with the addition of Cyvera we will provide complete protection for the enterprise by extending prevention technology to the endpoint. This next generation enterprise security platform approach is driving our success as each of the technically disruptive capabilities we bring to the market are superior to conventional point solutions and when combined provide a truly unique solution to address modern security requirements. And we saw multiple proof points to the value of our platform in the third quarter. We reported record financial results; we achieved the highest rate of new customer acquisition in the Company’s history; we held a highly successful Ignite User Conference with close to 2,000 attendees, a 100 plus percent increase from last year; we closed the acquisition of Cyvera, for the third year in a row Gartner positioned us in the Leaders quadrant of the Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Network Firewalls; we added more than 600 paid WildFire subscribers and now have over 2,000 paid subscribers; we were named technology partner of the year by VMware for integration with their NSX platform and we saw very high interest in our new PA-7050 chassis as well a large number of inbound request for demonstrations of our Cyvera endpoint protection technology. It was a very busy quarter and I am really proud of all that the team accomplished. More important our continued success momentum in the third quarter positions us well for the future as we rapidly take market share in the global enterprise security market. At the end of the day we’re winning in this market because our enterprise security platform is disruptive and solves very complex and important problems that customers face today. A few examples of what we did in the third quarter around this are a seven figure deal to secure the entire network of one of America’s largest airports where WildFire was a key differentiator, a win at a premiere sports network production company to secure video traffic where we sold PA-7050s into the data center and PA-5000s into every stadium. And strategic wins for distributed Firewall projects at a large electric utility in Japan as well as Asia’s largest casino. These are just a few examples of how we’re serving our customers’ needs. Our customer base grew to well over 17,000 in the third quarter including continued growing penetration rates into the Global 2000. This high rate of new customer acquisition plus demonstrated repeat selling in the installed base is the basis for a land and expand growth model. On the expense side of the equation in Q3 our top-25 customer had to have spent a minimum of $5 million with us in lifetime value to make our top-25 list, and our life time value is measured by the increase from their first purchase grew to 24.5 times. This compares to $4.6 million and 21.3 times last quarter. One of the fastest growing areas for us both in landing new customers as well as expanding in the installed base is with WildFire, our subscription service for detection and prevention of sophisticated cyber-attacks. On any given day we typically analyze more than 280,000 unique files with WildFire and often find over 10,000 new instances in malware, over 70% of which is not detected by traditional security technologies. Importantly we then quickly deliver preventive signatures to protect against newly discovered malware through content updates every 30 minutes to paid WildFire subscribers. This not only provides very fast prevention from future attacks to the customer where the new attack originated but it also provides proactive protection and prevention from future attacks to the entire paying customer base. No other company in the security market can provide this level of detection and prevention and we will soon provide additional and unique prevention capabilities at the endpoint with the integration of the Cyvera endpoint protection technology. Endpoints are currently the most exposed part of an enterprise to threats and often times the entry point on to the network for the most damaging and sophisticated attacks. Legacy endpoints security technology is very far behind the curve on solving this problem and newer endpoint technologies focus primarily on detection and forensics. However customers want to be proactive rather than just reactive in this battle and we see time and again they are hungry for prevention capabilities, that’s why we spent more than a year looking at the endpoint security market and ultimately chose to acquire Cyvera due to its unique ability to prevent endpoint attacks at the critical exploit phase. We are moving quickly to integrate the Cyvera product into our platform by calendar year-end and we believe this endpoint capability will be as disruptive to the endpoint security market as our next generation Firewall and cloud-based subscription services are today in the network security market. In addition to customers wanting our prevention platform approach at the endpoint, we’re also seeing increasing demand in the data center which is our fastest growing market segment, that’s why we recently introduced the PA-7050 our high-end chassis which is designed to serve the data center and service provider markets. Early demand for the chassis is high and we anticipate this being a strong contributor for our future growth. On the go-to-market front we have been able to attract and develop career paths for some of the best sales talent in the industry, and we continue to optimize our distribution channels globally. Our customer satisfaction scores are well above industry average and we know that satisfied customers buy more, which you can see from our lifetime value numbers. We will continue to refine territories and add to our major account team to constantly improve the focus that enterprise customers receive from their sales teams and our value-added partners. Before I turn the call to Steffan I want to provide some details around the settlement we reached with Juniper. Under the terms of the agreement the parties have dismissed all existing litigation against each other, have licensed the patents and dispute to each other for the life of the patents and have entered into a covenant not to sue each other for patent infringement for eight years. In addition we will pay Juniper a one-time settlement amount of $175 million of which $75 million is in cash and $100 million is in shares of our common stock. There is no royalty being paid as part of the settlement. As we said from the beginning of this case, we do not believe that we infringe on any Juniper patents and we still believe this to be the case. However over the course of last 2.5 years, we’ve spent a large amount of time, money and other resources on this litigation. While we’re confident of our position in the case, we believe that this outcome will allow us to continue to focus our efforts in what we do best. Innovating and developing new products, servicing our customers and the growth that results from that. And with that I’ll wrap it up and turn the call over to Steffan
Steffan Tomlinson:  Thank you, Mark. Before I get into the details of Q3 results and Q4 guidance, I’d like to note that except for revenue figures that are GAAP, all financial figures are non-GAAP unless stated otherwise. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in our press release and on our investor relations Web site. Q3 results once again underscored the power of our land, expand and retain strategy and our hybrid SaaS model. We added a record number of new customers in Q3 and continue to expand within our existing customer base where we drive repeat purchasing through sales of our products and recurring services. Every time we sell or renew a subscription service its equivalent to selling a new product, except that we have chosen a SaaS model to deliver and monetize it. In addition to better visibility into future revenue streams, growth in our subscription services has contributed to ongoing gross margin improvements. All of these factors were catalyst for record billings, revenue and deferred revenue in Q3. Q3 total revenue grew 49% over the prior year and 7% sequentially to another record of $150.7 million. The geographic mix of revenue was 66% Americas, 21% EMEA and 13% APAC. Compared to the prior year, the Americas grew 56%, EMEA grew 40% and APAC grew 32%. We saw broad strength across a wide range of verticals and we did not have any end customer concentration. Product, subscription and support, the three components of our hybrid SaaS model all grew well in the quarter. Product revenue of $84.1 million increased 38% over the prior year and 4% sequentially. We saw a nice adoption across a number of our different appliance families in the quarter with particular strength in the contribution from our higher end appliances including our newly introduced PA-7050 which is providing greater expansion opportunity in the high-end datacenter market. Our recurring services revenue of 66.6 million increased 64% over the prior year and 11% sequentially and accounted for 44% share of total revenue. Looking at the two components, our SaaS-based subscription revenue of $32 million increased 71% over the prior year and 11% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, we expect that subscription revenue will continue to grow at a faster pace than product revenue. Support and maintenance revenue of 34.6 million increased 58% over the prior year and 10% sequentially. Compared to the prior year, billings in Q3 grew 46% to 193.9 million. Total deferred revenue increased 68% to 367.9 million. Short-term deferred revenue increased 73% to 231.2 million. Total gross margin was 76.1%, an increase of 200 basis points compared to last year and 80 basis points sequentially. Our target operating model gross margin range is 73% to 76% as we exit Q4 FY16. Product gross margin was 76.3%, an increase of 200 basis points year-over-year and 80 basis points sequentially. The sequential increase was due in part to contribution from our higher-end appliances and cost reduction efforts. As a reminder, we expect there will be fluctuations in our product gross margin primarily due to mix and the timing of new appliance shipments. Services gross margin was 75.9%, an increase of 220 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points sequentially due in part to increased contribution from subscription services. Our results continue to demonstrate the power and leverage of our hybrid SaaS model as we scale our business. For the quarter, research and development expense was 12.4% of revenue, increasing approximately $0.8 million sequentially to $18.6 million. Sales and marketing expense was 47.2% of revenue, increasing approximately $5.3 million sequentially to $71.1 million. New headcount additions, commissions and expenses associated with both RSA and our Annual Ignite User Conference contributed to the increase. General and administrative expense was 7.4% of revenue, increasing approximately 1.4 million sequentially to 11.3 million. As a reminder, this does not include our IP litigation expense with Juniper which was 4.7 million in Q3 ’14. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was 1,556, up from 1,375 at the end of Q2 ’14. This includes the addition of 47 members of the Cyvera team. In total, operating expenses were 101 million or 67% of revenue. Operating margin increased approximately 60 basis points year-over-year to 9.1% and increased sequentially 10 basis points. Our effective tax rate for Q3 was 38%. Net income for the quarter was approximately 8.7 million or $0.11 per diluted share using 80.2 million shares, compared with net income of 5.3 million or $0.07 per diluted share in Q3 2013. Turning to our GAAP results and the Juniper settlement, as Mark mentioned we will pay Juniper a one-time settlement amount that is valued at approximately $175 million. This consists of a cash payment of 75 million, stock issuance of $70 million or approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase $30 million or approximately 450,000 shares of common stock at a nominal exercise price. The warrant will be subject to mark-to-market accounting beginning in Q4 FY14 and continuing to renew later than Q2 FY15, and we will exclude this non-cash expense from our future non-GAAP results. The accounting for the 175 million value of the settlement is as follows. A 113.7 million is a one-time expense reflected in our Q3 ’14 GAAP results. In Q4 ’14 the remaining 61.3 million is an intangible asset on the balance sheet which will be amortized ratably over a five-year period into product cost of goods sold because this is a non-cash charge, we will exclude the amortization expense from our future non-GAAP financial results. On a GAAP basis, net loss was 139.1 million or $1.86 per basic and diluted share for the quarter, which includes the 113.7 million expenses associated with the settlement with Juniper. This compares with a Q3 ’13 GAAP net loss of 7.3 million or $0.10 per basic and diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, we finished April with cash, cash equivalents and investments of 471.9 million. This takes into account the 82.6 million of cash consideration we spent to acquire Cyvera which closed during the fiscal third quarter. Cash flow from operations, free cash flow and free cash flow margin were 34.3 million, 28.4 million and 18.8% respectively. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled 5.9 million. Q3 attracted typical linearity was more backend loaded than Q2. Our accounts receivable balance was 114.8 million this quarter, up from 86.1 million in Q2 which resulted in DSO increasing to 60 days, up from 57 days in Q2. Let me now move to modeling assumptions and our guidance. I’d like to highlight several assumptions. First, our strong performance has yielded expected seasonality in the business, going forward we would expect Q1 and Q3 to reflect a more typical seasonality pattern. Second, as we stated previously we are making the necessary investments in Cyvera and we anticipate spending 3.5 million in Q4, ’14 and 25 million in FY15. Third, from a cash planning standpoint, we expect full year capital expenditures to be in the range of 42 million to 47 million in FY14. And as a reminder the cash payment of 75 million to Juniper in Q4, ’14 will impact both cash flow from operations and free cash flow. Finally, our guidance excludes expenses related to the Juniper IP litigation. Given our settlement with Juniper, after Q4, ’14 we no longer expect to incur IP litigation expenses related to this matter. Turning to guidance in Q4, ’14 we expect revenue to be in the range of 158 million to 162 million, which represents 41% to 44% growth year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be approximately $0.10 to $0.11 per share using 81 million to 83 million shares. This includes shares issued in the acquisition of Cyvera as well as the equity component of our settlement with Juniper. With that I will turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.
Kelsey Turcotte: Operator?
Question: 
and: 
Operator:  Yes. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Raimo Lenschow, Barclays. Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst:  Hi, this is Saket here for Raimo. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on getting the settlement behind you. Question for Mark, now that the settlement is behind you, do you see any changes to your product roadmap may be over the next one to two years?
Mark McLaughlin :  Hi Saket thanks for being on the call. No, our roadmap is fairly well set right now for the next 12 to 18 months. We are really focused on the 7050 which we just launched the next edition of WildFire getting NSX out the door which is already GA but there will be improvements out later on with the VMware with the NSX Palo Alto edition and also probably some more device changes we will make in the next 12 to 18 months as far as introducing some new parts to the family and devices. And then the big picture obviously is getting the Cyvera integration done, so that we have the Cyvera as part of the platform that will be done by calendar year-end and so we like the roadmap we have right now for about next 12 to 18 months.
Unidentified Analyst:  Great, that’s helpful. And then for my follow-up, apologies if I missed it but Mark, can you just talk about the subscription attach rate on WildFire in the quarter? And is there any reason to think that that subscription rate couldn’t approach may be the rates that you see on your other three offerings?
Mark McLaughlin:  Sure. The subscription attach rate in the quarter was well over 35%, so good growth in attach rate. We added over 600 paid WildFire subscribers, so the paid base is over 2,000 subscribers now and I think about that in a number of ways. The paid subscribers against the total base of our customers which is well over 17,000 is more than 10%, right of the customer base using the paid for portion of this technology today. And we think that will continue to grow overtime or different way to think about it is, there is no reason to think that WildFire can’t grow to the size of your web filtering business or threat prevention business overtime and it looks like it’s heading in that direction.
Kelsey Turcotte:  Next question please.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Keith Weiss : I just want to thank you guys for taking the question and very nice quarter. I want to check a little bit about WildFire and you guys mentioned WildFire being a key differentiator and getting into some large deals. Can you talk to us a little bit about the competitive environment around WildFire? It seems like a lot of vendors coming into this space with a master is the right or a sandboxing solution, how do you see that competitive environment putting out and where you are doing best in terms of against competitors?
 Morgan Stanley: I just want to thank you guys for taking the question and very nice quarter. I want to check a little bit about WildFire and you guys mentioned WildFire being a key differentiator and getting into some large deals. Can you talk to us a little bit about the competitive environment around WildFire? It seems like a lot of vendors coming into this space with a master is the right or a sandboxing solution, how do you see that competitive environment putting out and where you are doing best in terms of against competitors?
Mark McLaughlin: Sure, Keith. Thanks for being on the call. Yes, WildFire is very important to us as a differentiator and I think it’s moving through phases. The first phase for us was as a door opener in order to be able to speak around cyber security, advanced persistent threats at the highest levels in companies and we’ve got a lot of traction from that. It’s into the selling phase now meaning that it’s selling very-very nicely. Attach rates are high. The reps really like to talk about it. The customers are very interested in it and I think is where it’s settling out now is its part of our platform. And just like the other components of the platform, it’s the entire platform working together that’s really unique and disruptive in the market and that is what differentiates us from all of the competition not just WildFire. It’s all those components working very-very well together in one automotive platform approach and soon to have Cyvera in that as well, but the highest level the difference between us and everybody also in the market who’s got a solution like this is the difference between detection and prevention. Everybody either has or say there is advanced detection capabilities for advanced persistent threats. We’re unique in having the most advanced detection capabilities but because we are the Firewall the ability to do prevention is well and that’s absolutely critical for companies as they think above protection and prevention.
Keith Weiss : Got it. And then just a follow-up on that in terms of sort of partnerships around WildFire you do have sort of talk about detection and prevention, but remediation is different part of the equation, can you talk something about somehow your partnerships are evolving around sort of fill out that type of equation?
 Morgan Stanley: Got it. And then just a follow-up on that in terms of sort of partnerships around WildFire you do have sort of talk about detection and prevention, but remediation is different part of the equation, can you talk something about somehow your partnerships are evolving around sort of fill out that type of equation?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, sure. We are very open for partnerships across the Board because the way we think about the business not just WildFire is what’s right for the customers, right. And customers definitely want the ability to do detection, which we do. They definitely want the ability to do prevention, which we’re unique and some stuff will get through, right. So the idea that you’d want to have some forensic capabilities and remediation capabilities, its true there is nothing, there is nothing wrong with that. Overtime that should abate as prevention capability gets better, but that’s definitely a need in the market today, and we’re very open to partnerships across the board with folks who can do those sorts of things for customer even if some competitive examples we have Cyvera where we’re partnered with some of the endpoint technology providers and other folks in the markets because that’s customers are asking for and we’re going to deliver the solution they’re looking for it.
Kelsey Turcotte: Great, next question please?
Operator: Our next question comes from Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Karl Keirstead : Hi, thank. One for Mark and maybe one for Steffan and Mark, first of all congratulations on getting that IP litigation risk off the Company and the stock and actually that’s where I wanted to ask you you’ve disclosed in the press release the financial settlement but I just wanted to ask you what it means more broadly for Palo Alto Networks in terms of potentially getting management focused 100% on the business now to the extent that you had workaround team in place. I presume those resources are freed up maybe it takes away an issue that your competitors are throwing at customers in bid situations, can you give a perspective on may what some of the indirect benefits might be for getting this out of the way?
 Deutsche Bank: Hi, thank. One for Mark and maybe one for Steffan and Mark, first of all congratulations on getting that IP litigation risk off the Company and the stock and actually that’s where I wanted to ask you you’ve disclosed in the press release the financial settlement but I just wanted to ask you what it means more broadly for Palo Alto Networks in terms of potentially getting management focused 100% on the business now to the extent that you had workaround team in place. I presume those resources are freed up maybe it takes away an issue that your competitors are throwing at customers in bid situations, can you give a perspective on may what some of the indirect benefits might be for getting this out of the way?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, sure, Karl. I think there is the very tangible benefits of we’re not spending millions of dollars of quarter in legal expenses on a go forward basis and from a management perspective the burden of all this is primarily fall on myself, Steffan, and our General Counsel Jeff True who did job in all this by the way and not much beyond that. So we have had a lot of focus on litigation that frankly has been primarily from the investors and I understand why, you know, it’s an important thing, but that’s where a lot of our time and attention was put from management perspective and then from our legal teams perspective obviously they have been spending a lot of time in this as well. You know, below that or around that in the sales side, we have very-very few questions about the litigation from the minute it was filed up until today even less so in overtime it doesn’t appear to or have impacted our selling whatsoever. If that happened, it’s behind us now but it doesn’t look like it’s the case. From an engineering perspective, the team has been very just hedged on the product roadmap really not worrying about the litigation aspect of trying to do engineering work around that because the outcome was always uncertain and we don’t think we infringe in the first place. So the team, the engineering team hasn’t been really focused since then.
Karl Keirstead : Okay, great color. And if could follow up with Steffan. The maintenance support growth 58% still tracking at a very healthy cliff and well above what the product revenue growth is growing or is so I am just curious what are the factors propping up that support maintenance line, is your renewal rate increasing perhaps a little color there? Thank you.
 Deutsche Bank: Okay, great color. And if could follow up with Steffan. The maintenance support growth 58% still tracking at a very healthy cliff and well above what the product revenue growth is growing or is so I am just curious what are the factors propping up that support maintenance line, is your renewal rate increasing perhaps a little color there? Thank you.
Steffan Tomlinson: So maintenance has been performed at a very high cliff. It grew 10% sequentially, 58% year-over-year. It’s a differentiated product that we have and you can’t really buy a platform and an appliance without buying maintenance services and the value added engineering that we’re putting into releases and fixes et cetera, customers have to have maintenance. So the attach rate on maintenance has historically been very high as we sell larger appliances down the road, we will have an incremental dollar benefits, all our contribute benefit from maintenance revenue as well. So we have a great customer support team. Our customer satisfaction scores continue to be best in class and we knew that that line has a competitive differentiator. 
Kelsey Turcotte: Next question please. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse, please proceed. 
Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse:  All right thanks guys, congrats on a great quarter and the settlement as well. Just two quick questions, first on just on the price environment out there, you guys had another gross margin quarter coming ahead of our numbers in the street. Just wondering if you could comment on just the price environment that you’re seeing out there and then just one follow-up after that. 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, sure Phil. The competition has been pretty aggressive on pricing for quite some time in response to our success. So it’s not any news that they continue to price very, very aggressively. We’ve been able to hold the line on that for a long time now. As we’ve reported every quarter as you can see from the gross margin discounting, this is the premium security technology in the market today with a platform approach and people understand that and they’re willing to pay for that. On the gross margin side, on the product side, we had a real nice lift from our higher end appliances and the 7050 and the 5000 and even the 3000 series, which carry nice gross margins. So that’s what we saw in this quarter. 
Steffan Tomlinson:  And just an add on point to that, we really look our product portfolio as a platform and when you have a hybrid SaaS model with high attach rates on subscription services and you look at the benefits of a total gross margin, we are seeing a tailwind around the benefit that we’re getting from subscriptions. So we’re holding the discounting line on product. We’re selling more higher end appliances and the power of the subscription model is coming into play here. 
Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse:  And just a quick follow up, with Cyvera, just hoping to get some early feedback from customers, as you’ve been talking to them, about the product. 
Mark McLaughlin: It’s really great. We have a lot of in-bound requests from our existing customer base, particularly the large customers, wanting to understand how the technology works. I think they got a good sense of what our description was, in it being very different. Now they want to touch it, they want to test it. There is a lot of interest in doing POCs with them, and we’re going to manage that very carefully so that we can get those done within a very quality manner from getting the technology to where it needs to be and also the ability to support and sell it in the field. So we have a plan around all that. You’ll see a lot of activity in the fall around this product coming to market.
Kelsey Turcotte:  Great, next question please. 
Operator: And also to limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company. Please proceed.
Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Company:  Mark for me, demand driver standpoint, just wondering if you have an updated view that you can share with us regarding magnitude or timing of a possible network refresh cycle. 
Mark McLaughlin: Gregg, it’s hard to tell right now. Those are inexact things. Our best way to gauge that kind of thing as it turns out I think is coming from our major accounts team. So we’ve put a tremendous amount of effort as you’ve heard into major accounts in the last 18 months or so and our uptick in the G 2000 accounts, we’re adding a couple of dozen or more every quarter right. So we got over 800 and some G 2000 accounts now. We keep adding more every quarter and we get visibility into those accounts on a long term roadmap perspective and these are really big companies, long term roadmaps. So we’re getting our own sense of what they’re thinking about doing and the level of interest in moving to next generation technology I would say is very high generally. Specifically the things we’re doing on the virtualization side, almost a 100% hit rate into our openers and conversations around that and then obviously cyber security’s top of the mind for everybody as well. It’s again back to the platform approach. We do all those things in the platform. So instead of thinking about things as firewall refresh cycles, I think people are thinking about moving to the next generation of technology in the face of the really complex things they have to face today and I think we’re a big beneficiary of that and are going to do that in the future.
Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Company:  Okay, that’s helpful and then a follow up for Stephen. You mentioned that you have now over 2000 paid users of Wildfire. Just wondering how many total Wildfire customers exist today encompassing both free and paid. 
Mark McLaughlin: Hey Greg, it’s Mark. We have close to 4000 total customers today and like I said we added over 600 paying customers in the quarter. 
Kelsey Turcotte:  Great, next question please. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Owens with Pacific Crest. Please proceed. 
Rob Owens - Pacific Crest:  A couple of questions. You mentioned this was the higher, highest rate of customer acquisition in the Company’s history. Just maybe a little bit more color there, security’s obviously being a spotlight, there’s been speculation around what this refresh could look like and coming off the quarter with the highest customer acquisition in history and maybe just some color on what the full pipe looks like. 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, sure. So, well, well over a 1000 customers. This is like the 9th to 10th quarter in a row, I am losing track here, over a 1000, but well over a 1000 in this quarter and like you said the highest one we’ve had. Very importantly around that Rob as well as it’s great to feed the funnel off the top under the LAN part of this but the expand side is equally as interesting for us. So you know the number we share with the quarter on the LTV of the top 25 just continues to go up into the rate. This is the second quarter or third quarter, I have to go back and look at the data, but every top 25 customer purchased again in the quarter. Right so, with the way we think about that is over 17,500 total customers today, all of which continue to do repeat purchasing patterns that following the trends of those top 25. So just a lot of existing additional sales to be made to the existing base and then throwing in 1,000 plus new customers every quarter is just a great model.
Rob Owens - Pacific Crest: And then as we approach Q4 here and I know you’re guiding for Q4, any high level thoughts around 2015 and maybe just where we should see product revenue at a minimum?
Steffan Tomlinson: We’re going to be updating folks on modeling assumptions for FY15 at the end of the Q4 call. But I can tell you that our goal is to continue to outpace the market in terms of growth rate in the competitive landscape. We’re definitely committed to continuing to prudently and consciously invest in parts of the business that have a good ROI and you can see the results that we’ve been posting. So our plan is to continue to grow at a very brisk pace in FY15.
Mark McLaughlin: Including on the product side.
Kelsey Turcotte: Great. Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Please proceed.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair: Just wanted to get a sense from you, as you’ve released this new VMware product, can you give us a sense of maybe what that opportunity looks like and what type of contribution you’re looking for, maybe not for this fiscal year but just it is sort of in the short run and how that would potentially scale over time?
Mark McLaughlin: Yeah, hey Jonathan. Definitely a tailwind for us to think, just from own my experience of talking to prospects about this and existing customers and what I hear from the field. It is, like I said close to 100% hit rate on when you’re having this conversation with folks that you are definitely invited back for the next meeting if they are VMware customers today. VMware has put a lot of time and effort into the NSX platform itself, which certainly helps us since the -- we’re integrated into that platform. They have trained up a specialized sales folks who are training their entire sales team on this as well. The product is now GAA [ph] and as far as all of the field work that needs begun with their folks, comp plans, all that kind of stuff, my understanding is that’s all completed and they will be bringing that to market in an organized way in June. So I would expect just from the pipeline we’re seeing, an interest level that this is going to be a good thing for us as it plays itself out through the end of this calendar year and into our -- into calendar ’15. It’s a fairly complex sale, right. This is virtualized datacenter stuff. So these are not 30 days sales. These are longer sales. And we definitely have the benefit of having VMware really organize and rallied around this as well in addition to our own sales team. So I think good things should come from this.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair: Great. And just as a follow up. In terms of your international distribution opportunity; clearly, the Americas region is showing some strength here. How do you guys think about sort of seeing similar growth materialize in terms of the international components over time?
Mark McLaughlin: The international markets are great markets for us. As you can see from our numbers, I would say at pretty good scale. When you look at the Americas, which is the largest contributor there from a revenue perspective and its growth rate is fantastic. And then you look at the international side, which is less mature in a sense of when we team to market with that, the development of the teams and territories and all the things you do to grow markets, all growing at very nice rates as well. But I think on an absolute dollar basis, if you get outside the United States here and look at just how many dollars we bring in the quarter say in APAC for example versus what all the companies in that region spend on security technology, it’s just the tip of the iceberg. So we’re committed to the international markets. They are performing well for us and we think they’re going to be great contributors over the long haul for us.
Kelsey Turcotte: Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Erik Suppiger with JMP. Please proceed.
Erik Suppiger - JMP: First off, just how much of a factor has the litigation been with Juniper in terms of your sales execution and how much do you think that getting that settlement behind you will change your sales prospects going forward?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, Erik, as was saying a little earlier, it doesn’t appear that we really had any impact from a selling perspective from those litigation. The number of times that I got asked about it, by somebody in the field who talked to customers, Steffan or maybe [indiscernible] in 2.5 years. So the bottoms up feedback from the field is this has not been a significant issue from going to market. The numbers wouldn’t suggest it is either. So -- but if there were, in a way that it was not visible to us, that’s now removed and that’s a good thing for us.
Erik Suppiger - JMP: Okay. And then Steffan can you give us a little sense for what we can expect from a cash -- cash from operations outlook for next quarter what we should think about for CapEx?
Steffan Tomlinson: Yes, so what we ended up giving was some guidance on CapEx, which for the full year we’re looking at $42 million to $47 million in CapEx. And to-date we spent around, call it, $31 million - $32 million of CapEx. So there will be some additional CapEx in Q4. As far as cash flow from operations or free cash flow, we would expect to deliver healthy free cash flow, cash flow from operations but you’re going to have to exclude the $75 million payment to Juniper, kind of looking at pro forma cash flow for that. So we expect to continue to drive healthy free cash flows in it. Part of that hybrid SaaS model that we have has been a differentiator for us from a business model standpoint. Our free cash flow margins tend to be -- call it anywhere between 8% to 12% higher than our operating margins, and that’s because how we license and how we go to market. So we think that free cash flow and cash flow from our office will continue to grow hopefully.
Kelsey Turcotte: Great, next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gray Powell with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Gray Powell :  Can you talk about the integration of your Morta acquisition with WildFire? I believe Morta’s capabilities were going to be introduced into the next version of WildFire. And can you just update us there on the timing and the additional functionality that Morta brings?
 Wells Fargo:  Can you talk about the integration of your Morta acquisition with WildFire? I believe Morta’s capabilities were going to be introduced into the next version of WildFire. And can you just update us there on the timing and the additional functionality that Morta brings?
Mark McLaughlin: So the Morta acquisition for us was about getting two things; one was an extremely talented group of guys who have a lot of expertise and a built technology. The second thing, which is really the subtle -- some of these have lateral movement of APTs and malware through networks, and which is becoming more and more important in the data center where things kind of find their way in there. So they’re moving quietly through the network into the data center. So when we use the terms like detection and prevention, this would fall really into the detection side of if something was in your network, being able to see it was there, so that you can then protect against it. And that technology is well along in its path in integration into the whole platform, including WildFire. And by the end of this calendar year -- we should see that in next release of WildFire early next year. But we’re excited about the technology we got there and it does a lot of great things around very sophisticated detection.
Kelsey Turcotte:  Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Please proceed.
Walter Pritchard - Citigroup:  Steffan, wondering, you talked about strong sales of the 7050. Can you talk about if you had any supply constraints or any troubles fulfilling demand on that product during the quarter?
Steffan Tomlinson:  No, thankfully we didn’t --we had very good product demand planning cycles that we go through. We have a stellar operations and product management team. They are we are able to forecast. And we have very close customer intimacy. So we had a good handle on what the demand was coming into the quarter. So we were well situated to fulfill that demand.
Walter Pritchard - Citigroup: Got it. And then just on the attach rate, you talked a bit about the WildFire attach rates. I’m wondering, looking at some of the more mature subscriptions like URL and IPS and GlobalProtect, are you at a point there where those have sort of steadied out and plateaued in terms of the attach you’re seeing coming in on new purchases, or are we still seeing those escalate as the quarters go on?
Steffan Tomlinson: Interestingly enough, each of the subscriptions that we had this quarter, all grew sequentially which was nice. As we have mentioned before, threat prevention are filtering are already at very high rates, kind of the sequential growth rate, will by definition be just a little bit less. But as you point out, it’s really the power of the platform and the subscriptions that are big differentiator and we’re selling integrated appliance which is a big differentiator for us.
Kelsey Turcotte: Great, next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Ives with FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Daniel Ives - FBR Capital Markets:  Obviously you guys are doing great job in larger deals. Maybe you could sort of talk about, are you seeing a difference strategically in terms of recent attacks on Target and eBay in terms just going up to a C level [ph] or Board level in terms of fast track on some of these cyber security initiatives?
Mark McLaughlin: I think it’s definitely the case because of these high profile very well publicized attacks that folks are seeing, that the ability to have a conversation around cyber security advance persistent threats and then very importantly, the high differentiation of a platform that can do protection or prevention doesn’t hurt us at all. So these things all play to our favor. Our sales guys, they definitely understand how to take advantage of that and they have been doing that very successfully in the field.
Kelsey Turcotte: Great, next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Zeller with Needham & Company. Please proceed.
Scott Zeller :  Is there any color you can offer us on the number of opportunities where customers are standardizing on Palo Alto as a platform?
 Needham & Company:  Is there any color you can offer us on the number of opportunities where customers are standardizing on Palo Alto as a platform?
Mark McLaughlin: I would say lots and lots of cases of standardization. The reason for the pause there for a second was that when companies standardize on Palo Alto, particularly large companies, that is the beginning of a multi-year process of putting Palo Alto all throughout the enterprise, all throughout the network and that takes time. Interestingly, that’s one of the reasons you see on the LTV the top 25 our ability to come on the phone every quarter and say that number goes up, everybody is buying every quarter, that those companies began with an initial purchase for something and then ultimately, in a lot of cases say we’re going to make Palo Alto networks the backbone of our enterprise network security. And then that manifests itself through all these repeat purchases. Only the customer knows about the date picture, roadmap of how those things look like. We get the visibility into that in our strategic planning sessions with them, and then what we see on a quarterly basis, when they’re making -- putting in orders against what they have shared with us from those decisions, but I think when you just think about -- over 60% of our base today is using us as a firewall. Over 75% of our initial sales there is a firewall. That’s a great indicator of standardization when you become the firewall for an enterprise.
Kelsey Turcotte: Great, next question please. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed.
Brent Thill - UBS: Mark, you mentioned the data [ph] is the fastest growing segment in the business. I’m curious if you could just give us a mile marker, where you think you are and if you had some achievements you’d like to put on the board in that segment. How would you look at that over the next year?
Mark McLaughlin: I think its early innings around that Brent; for two reasons. The first is that for the datacenter itself, having the next generation capabilities we bring to that has been very interesting for customers for some time and then the ability in the North-South traffic to now do that at a 100 gig plus just opens of tons of possibility for existing customers, who are already using us and new customers, whether they’re looking for that throughput requirement and then the Greenfield opportunity in the datacenter is really in the virtualization space with our own VM-series, with the NSX technology for East-West protection. That’s a use case that is fairly new for companies, really starting to understand they have to provide that same level next-generation security to their own traffic in a datacenter. That’s not something that they had to do before ABTs became so [indiscernible] for example. So it’s a combination of those two things, which is very high throughput North-South, East-West Greenfield opportunity, but being the only Company that can do the next-generation platform capabilities in both of those instances is a tremendous opportunity for us. Like I said, I think its early innings in all that for us. 
Brent Thill - UBS: And for Stefan on the subscription attach -- just more to Walter’s question on, if you look through into the big buckets, is there a simple attach rate you could give us on each of those to just give us a sense of where each of those are at or are you not going in that level?
Steffan Tomlinson: Historically what we have done is, semi-annually we give the total metric. And we don’t get into each specific subscription. So as of Q2 we had an attach rate of about 1.9 as an average across the four subscriptions. And that metric has increased over the last several periods. And the reason why it is increasing is customers are continually looking for an integrated solution so they don’t have to have a proliferation of devices behind the firewall. So the elegance of the platform with the subscriptions provide the big differentiator.
Kelsey Turcotte: Great, the next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.
Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer:  Congrats on good quarter and the settlement. You had a very solid quarter in APAC. Have you been displacing anyone, as some of your peers have been seeing some softness in that region?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes Shaul, just it’s a general matter, you should assume that regardless where we are, that almost 100% of our sales are displacement sales. So generally somebody is losing for us to win, and we do that at very high rates and it doesn’t matter around the geography. I mentioned just a few things we did in APAC in the last quarter. The largest Casino in Asia, for example, like Kabukicho in Japan, both are displacements in those cases. But then almost everything we do is a displacement.
Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer: Fair enough. Steffan, are you looking any different on capitalization in light of the settlement? Obviously you’ve got plenty of cash even when embedding the settlement. Currency is probably about to get stronger near-term. Any view that you can share with us on that point?
Steffan Tomlinson:  We feel great with our cash position right now and I think as a differentiator to our business model, relative to some other folks out there, we’ve been able to generate over $8 million of free cash flow fiscal year-to-date. And yes, we look to keep our options open. But we feel comfortable with our cash position and our ability to continue to generate cash. 
Kelsey Turcotte: Great. We have time for one last question, please.
Operator: Last question comes from Fred Grieb with Nomura.
Fred Grieb - Nomura:  I hopped on a bit late. So I apologize if this has already been asked, but could you give us some update on the Cyvera acquisition? I’m curious whether this is having any impact on customer conversations of bringing more customers potentially to you.
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, Fred. Yes, it has been very positive for us. So as far as selling the product, we’ll be doing that in a very organized approach in the fall of this year; meaning, having it integrated into the platform, having the sales people know how to sell it and the support personnel who can support that. Putting that aside for a second though, this is another instance of being able to really strategic conversations with folks in companies. So great door opener for us right now. We are definitely talking about that. We’re talking about how it fills up the third corner of our enterprise security platform. So we have the firewall, we have the cloud and now we have the endpoint as well and that’s resonating very well. As a result of that the interest level, like I said earlier in the call, is very high. The request for POCs are off the charts. So we have got more inbound interest than we can handle at the moment. We want to make sure we do that in a very organized way. So we bring this to market as Palo Alto Networks quality.
Operator:  We have no further questions. I would now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Please proceed.
Mark McLaughlin:  Thanks, operator. Thanks everyone for being on the call this afternoon and I want to say a special thank you to all the Palo Alto Networks team for all the hard work and support, our customers and partners as we continue to redefine the next generation of enterprise security. We appreciate your interest in the company. Thanks.
Operator:  This concludes today’s conference. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Mark McLaughlin:  Thank you, Kelsey. Thank you everyone for joining us this morning. Given that it's the start of the RSA Conference, we want to ensure that everyone has time to make the event, so we appreciate you joining us pre-market this morning. I'm pleased to report that we had a very good second quarter. Strong customer demand for our integrated and automated enterprise security platform drove Q2 results that exceeded our guidance. Revenue grew by 46% year-over-year to a record $141 million and billings grew 50% year-over-year to approximately $187 million both driven by strong profit demand, continued acceleration of our fast growing subscription services and expansion of our global direct and indirect distribution capabilities. Along with this strong top line growth, we delivered expanding operating margins in non-GAAP EPS of $0.10, as we continue to demonstrate our ability to scale the business quickly and profitably. Security spending remains a top and growing priority for customers across organizations of all sizes and across all geographies. There's a growing understanding among security professionals, C-Suite executives and Boards that traditional security approaches limit their business agility and are not keeping up with the new wave of cyber threats. As a result, these legacy approaches and point products create unacceptable business and security risks. With this in mind, enterprise customers globally are adopting our enterprise security platform, resulting in continued market share gains against the competition. We see this demonstrated in customer acquisitions, where we now have over 16,000 customers; continued growth in customer lifetime value; and increasingly strong subscription service adoption, as our customers take advantage of the power of our integrated and automated platform. Examples of wins for us in last quarter include one of the world's largest oil and gas companies, where we implemented our full platform to protect their data center and SCADA systems in the Middle East; a global consumer goods company, where we replaced Cisco and beat Check Point for a full data center security refresh; and one of the largest cruise lines in the world, where we replaced Cisco in the data center and have been selected as the sole provider for network security on their ships. Our expanding product portfolio, innovative approach to delivering subscription services and focus on Global 2000 accounts continue to increase our lifetime customer value. In Q2, a top 25 customer had to spend a minimum of $4.6 million with us in lifetime value to make the top 25 list. Our lifetime value measured by the increase from their initial purchase rose to 21.3x. This compares to $4.1 million and 19.6x last quarter. Mainstream enterprise customers are facilitating this growth by repeat purchases and larger deal sizes, as we’re being adopted as the go-to technology in the battle for enterprise security. Not only are customers buying more devices but they are also increasingly unlocking the power of our platform with subscription services that often take the place of a competitor's device. Enterprises are doing this because of the highly integrated and automated capabilities inherent in our platform that deliver superior security while reducing their operational burden. That's the winning formula for the future of enterprise security and is an accelerating growth for all of our subscription services. The power of this integrated and automated platform is evident in success we are seeing with WildFire, which is our powerful subscription service for unique detection and prevention capabilities for increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. Over 1,400 customers are now on the paid version of WildFire, up from approximately 1,000 customers in Q1. In Q2, we saw a significant lift in the WildFire attach rate for paid subscriptions to over 30% of devices shipped up from 20% in Q1. WildFire continues to act as a driver and differentiator for our enterprise security platform, attracting both new and existing customers. WildFire is also an example of the continued disruptive innovation that causes widening of the gap between our platform and the competition. To extend that leadership and security, we acquired Morta Security in December, bringing us a highly experienced team of experts in cyber security, as well as technology that will enhance our platform. This past quarter, we continued to deliver on disruptive innovation with the release of the 6.0 version of our Palo Alto Networks Operating System and enhanced WildFire functionality, including protection for many more file types, zero-day exploit detection and access to our global database of compromised domains and infrastructure. Also, two weeks ago, we announced the availability of the PA-7050 chassis and we continue the beta testing for our virtualized offering that tightly integrates with VMware's NSX platform. We are very pleased with this partnership and honored that VMware presented us with their Technology Partner of the Year Award ago two weeks ago at their partner conference. Early demand for the PA-7050 and for VM series appears to be strong and we look forward to reporting on adoption throughout the rest of the year. In addition to the innovation engine, we are also scaling the capacity and productivity of our sale teams around the world while expanding our partner footprint with large-scale service providers, global systems integrators and direct manufacturing reps, all of whom are interested in helping their customers displace point products that are ill-equipped to address the threat landscape today. The combination of our highly differentiated offerings, strong pipeline and increasing global distribution capabilities sets us up well for the second half of our fiscal year and beyond, as we continue to demonstrate our leadership position in enterprise security. Lastly, I wanted to touch base on the Juniper litigation. As many of you know, the trial starts today. We remain confident in our position in this case and are pleased with the judge's pre-trial decisions. The Palo Alto Networks' team look forward to seeing many of you at our booth at the RSA Conference in San Francisco this week. And as Kelsey mentioned, we invite you to participate in the special investor track at our Ignite user conference in Las Vegas at the end of March, where you will see our technology firsthand and get a sense of the enthusiasm of our customers and partners.  And with that, I'll wrap it up and turn the call over to Steffan.
Steffan Tomlinson:  Thank you, Mark. Before I get into the details of the Q2 results and Q3 guidance, I'd like to note that except for revenue figures that are GAAP, all financial figures are non-GAAP unless stated otherwise. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in our press release and on our investor relations website. Growth in the quarter was driven by new customer acquisition and continued expansion within our existing customer base, where we continue to sell our suite of products and recurring services, including our subscription services. Structurally, our business model continues to benefit from higher attach rates of our SaaS-based subscriptions. Every time we sell or renew a subscription, its equivalent to selling a product except that we have chosen a SaaS model to deliver and monetize it. Increases in subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue will improve our gross margins, as well as increase visibility into future revenue streams. All of these factors, new customer acquisitions, success in our land and expand strategy and continuing momentum in our subscription services were catalyst for record billings, revenue, deferred revenue and free cash flow. Q2 total revenue grew 46% over the prior year and 10% sequentially to another record of $141.1 million. The geographic mix of revenue was 64% Americas, 24% EMEA and 12% APAC. Compared to the prior year, the Americas grew 51%, EMEA grew 37% and APAC grew 42%. We saw broad strength across a wide range of verticals. We do not have any end customer concentration. Product, subscription and support, the three components of our hybrid SaaS model all grew well in the quarter. Product revenue of $80.8 million increased 30% over the prior year and 7% sequentially. We saw nice adoption across a number of our different appliance families in the quarter. Our recurring services revenue of $60.2 million increased 74% over the prior year and 14% sequentially and accounted for a 43% share of total revenue. Looking at its two components, our SaaS-based subscription revenue of $28.8 million increased 76% over the prior year and approximately 16% sequentially. Growth was driven by a higher attach rate for our subscription services, in particular WildFire. On a year-over-year basis, we expect that subscription revenue will continue to grow at a faster pace than product revenue. Support and maintenance revenue of $31.4 million increased 73% over the prior year and 13% sequentially. Compared to the prior year, billings in Q2 grew 50% to $186.7 million. Total deferred revenue increased 72% to $324.6 million. Short-term deferred revenue increased 72% to $202.3 million. Total gross margin was 75.3%, an increase of 30 basis points sequentially. Product gross margin was 75.5%, an increase of 210 basis points year-over-year and a decrease of 110 basis points sequentially. The sequential decline was due in part to product mix. As a reminder, there will be fluctuations in our product gross margin primarily due to product mix and the timing of new appliance shipments. Services gross margin was 75.2% increasing 240 basis points sequentially due in part to increased contribution from subscription services. Moving on to operating expenses, research and development expense was 12.6% of revenue, increasing approximately $1.3 million sequentially to $17.8 million. Headcount additions and project-related expenses, supporting our development activities, contributed to the increase. Sales and marketing expense was 46.6% of revenue, increasing approximately $5.5 million sequentially to $65.8 million. New headcount additions, commissions and the expenses in marketing contributed to the increase. General and administrative expense was 7.1% of revenue, increasing approximately $0.1 million to $9.9 million. As a reminder, this does not include our IP litigation expense, which was $2.7 million in Q2 2014. Total headcount at the end of the quarter was 1,375, up from 1,264 at the end of Q1 2014. In total, operating expenses were $93.6 million or 66.3% of revenue. Operating margin increased approximately 180 basis points year-over-year to 9% and increased 150 basis points sequentially. Our effective tax rate for Q2 was 38%. Net income for the quarter was approximately $7.8 million or $0.10 per diluted share using 78.2 million shares, compared with net income of $4.1 million or $0.05 per diluted share in Q2 2013. On a GAAP basis, net loss was $39.9 million for the quarter or $0.55 per basic and diluted share compared to a Q2 2013 GAAP net loss of $2.6 million or $0.04 per basic and diluted share. Our GAAP net loss as well as our cash flow from operations and free cash flow reflect a $20 million payment we made in the second quarter to extend an existing mutual covenant not to suit with Fortinet for six more years. Turning to the balance sheet, we finished January with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $501.3 million, including the impact of our acquisition of Morta. Cash flow from operations, free cash flow and free cash flow margin were $41.4 million, $31.6 million and 22.4% respectively. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $9.8 million and were primarily related to facilities purchases. The accounts receivable balance was $86.1 million down from the prior quarter balance of $91.4 million. Linearity in the quarter improved which helped improve average day sales outstanding to 57 days down from 63 days last quarter. Let me now move to our guidance and as a reminder, guidance excludes IP litigation expenses. In Q3 2014, we expect revenue to be in the range of $143 million to $147 million, which represents a 41% to 45% growth year-over-year and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be approximately $0.10 to $0.11 per share using 79 million to 81 million shares.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, please limit your question to one question and one follow up. Your first comes from the line of Phil Winslow representing Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
Phil Winslow – Credit Suisse. : Hi, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. One of the things that really jumped out at me was your comments on WildFire. I wonder if you could provide more detail there and then also, you know, maybe just an update of how you think it's positioned out there versus the competition. Thanks.
Mark McLaughlin:  Thank, Phil. Good morning. Yes, so we had a very nice quarter again on the WildFire. As you can see, we've added over 400 paying customers so we've got about 1400 paying customers over 3,000 total customers using WildFire. And I think what's going on there is that customers are continuing – the existing customers and new logo customers are continuing to see the value of having a very, very sophisticated detection and prevention, which is critically important capability in a platform that they already own with their existing customer or the opportunity to have it very simply from the subscription service model, if they're a new customer. And when you look at not only just the capabilities of WildFire but then also the total cost of ownership, you know, of that very advanced platform versus what's out there competitively. It's a big difference, right? So I think people are voting with their pocket books and saying, “We'll go for very advanced, very sophisticated detection,” and prevention critically important and in addition to that we get it with the platform if you're an existing customer you already owned and with a TCO that's a big difference just like all of our subscription services are and so we're very happy with the adoption we're seeing.
Phil Winslow – Credit Suisse. : Got it and then just a follow on to that. Obviously, you're seeing a better attach of more subscriptions, you know, call it per appliance but wondering if you could give us some comments on renewal rates that you're saying across the subscriptions? Thanks.
Steffan Tomlinson: Renewal rates continue to remain very high. They're in line with what we disclosed in the past. On support in particular, it's close to 100%. For subscriptions, it's trending north of 85% so we feel very comfortable about the recurring nature of our business model.
Phil Winslow – Credit Suisse. : Great. Thanks, guys, and congrats again.
Steffan Tomlinson: Thank, Phil.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gray Powell representing Wells Fargo. Please proceed. 
Gray Powell – Wells Fargo Securities: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So maybe just kind of following up on the WildFire theme. Over the last few months you've had a few developments on the APT side with the acquisition of Morta and the partnership with Bromium. How do you see your APT capabilities expanding and do you see the potential to more closely tie WildFire with an end point solution or offer incident response type services at some point?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, sure, and Gray, it's Mark. Just generally on WildFire we continue to improve WildFire pretty much every quarter to make it market leading so we put out a big release with our PAN 6.0 Operating System recently at the same time some improvements in WildFire, which I mentioned in the script about covering more file types, giving some access into corrupted domains, things that customers really wanted to see with that so we think that, you know, doing that adds continued value and we're going to keep doing that.  We bought a small Company called Morta Security in December. This is a team of really sophisticated folks who are from the NSA US Air Force kind of background, who have been involved on playing offense, you know, at cyber security and because of that, we are developing some really interesting technologies that are looking at like subtle lateral movements sort of things from a malware perspective so you'll see that materialize in the next versions of WildFire and obvious [inaudible] continue to keep that service as market leading around that.  On your end point question, you know, we've talked with lots of customers for a while and about is there a value proposition of I'll call it connecting the network to endpoints from a security perspective under the belief or growing belief probably that endpoints are considered part of the network more and more just because of [inaudible] mobility and [inaudible] it’s pretty positive. So they test that out in the market. We’ve done a number of integrations. You’ve mentioned Bromnium. We’ve done Bit9, Symantec, so with some folks in the market where we connect WildFire in the endpoints and then, you know, see if that's providing value - the customer feedback and that has been pretty positive so we expect to do more of that kind of work in the future. And then your last question on incident responses, we're not going to be in the response business, I don't see us doing that and the reason for that is we just philosophically believe that incident response is kind of a necessity because of the technology is not stopping things in the first place. You have to have [business in response] [ph] to human – you know a very, very capital intensive human remediation effort and we think our job is the technology provider of detection and prevention is to reduce the need for that over time, we think that's exactly what's going to happen as we continue to advance the platform.
Gray Powell – Wells Fargo Securities: Understood. Okay. That's very helpful. Congratulations.
Mark McLaughlin: Thanks, Greg.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Rob Owens representing Pacific Crest Securities. Please proceed.
Rob Owens – Pacific Crest Securities: When you talk about the higher attach rate of subscription services just wondering if you could give us some color in terms of which services you're contributing the most revenue at this point and obviously you're seeing great growth with WildFire but just curious on the others.
Steffan Tomlinson: Well we have threat prevention and URL filtering, which both have been very nice sellers for us and our threat prevention is for IDS/IPS, URL filtering is for filtering obviously. Those two continue to be work horses for us. They’re big competitive differentiators in the market and then of course WildFire, which has really posted very significant growth sequentially and year-over-year. And then lastly we have GlobalProtect which with the advances that we're making, the innovations we're making in our global protect solutions we're seeing an uptake from customers.  So this quarter really marked a very strong quarter for us from a overall subscription attach rate. All four subscriptions increased in the quarter sequentially with WildFire albeit growing off a smaller base grew the fastest so we’re very pleased with that. And you know as we’ve talked about before, every time we sell a subscription service it's the equivalent of selling a product but we’ve decided to monetize in a SaaS way.
Rob Owens – Pacific Crest Securities: Okay, great and then you mentioned the new customer acquisition helping drive results. Just wondering any change in terms of who you're displacing or the rate at which you're displacing them?
Mark McLaughlin: Hey, Rob. We continue to do well against all [competitors] [ph] competitively at the highest level where our main competition will be enterprise firewall vendors such as Check Point, Juniper and Cisco and our win rates continue to be very healthy against anybody regardless who the competition is.
Operator:  And your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss representing Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Keith Weiss – Morgan Stanley: Thank you guys and thank you for taking the question. I wanted to dig into the announcement you guys made with VMware and also getting the Partner of the Year Award with VMware, because we've been hearing a lot more about you guys going to market together and hearing a lot more evidence of garnering success in there, so maybe you could sort of mark-to-market for us what you guys have been doing thus far with VMware; where there's new integration where you think that’s going to be able to take you guys?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, sure Keith. We're excited about this so as we've described in the past the highest level of what's going on is our data center [inaudible] changing fairly rapidly both from a throughput perspective and also virtualization.  So, if you think about just a data center use case for next-generation security you've got north/south traffic going in there and those throughput rates continue to grow. That's one of the primary reasons we introduced the 7050 and it’s been a big use case for that.  On east/west, which is a use case that's becoming more and more important to folks because as malware and malicious activity find its way into a network it's trying to get into the data center because that's where the crown jewels are and the idea of moving around inside the data center is more of a concern for folks than it used to be so you want to have the same kind of next-generation security capabilities in the data center there, because that's becoming a highly, highly virtualized environment – all that has to be virtualized. So working with VMware over the last year at their request, taking our virtualized technology, everything we have physically is also been available for virtual context.  What we've done is we've integrated that with their new platform NSX and what that's going to mean is that VMware customers adopt the NSX platform if they would like to have the best and most advanced next-generation security of highly virtual environment in the data center, they’re going to be able to purchase at the same time something called the Palo Alto Networks [addition] [ph] for NSX, which is our virtualized capabilities but really integrated at the orchestration layer so that when you're, say, provisioning or deprovisioning virtual machines inside that data center, security is just going to automatically follow up so this is not to throw the SDN word around but sort of SDN-ish nature about you don't have to do anything now that you used to have to do from a security perspective. Your policies are just going to automatically follow along with those virtual machines. That's important mostly for security and then also for ease-of-use and that reduces the selling objection for VMware when they're trying to get people to adopt, you know, NSX when they say, “Well, what about security? What about this new wave of threats inside data centers and virtualized environments? What are you going to doing about that?” This gives the answer to their customers to say, “We have the best next-generation technology very tightly integrated [across] [ph] networks.”  And last thing – and I know I'm going on for a minute – is from an availability perspective, this –and addition for NSX is available in just a few weeks time. From a go-to-market perspective with VMware, their salesforce and partner base will be able to and start to sell this in late spring or early summer so that's when we expect to see adoption begin is when VMware's – the power of their sales machine and partner community falls in behind us. So sorry for the long answer but that's it.
Keith Weiss – Morgan Stanley: I love the long answer. If I could perhaps sneak one last one in. Just on the new 7050 appliance that you guys rolled out. Could you give us some early indications, where are you seeing the early adopters, the early demand there and how broadly do you think this will open up data center opportunities for you? Does it get you into some incremental service provider business as well?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, so we think that demand there is coming from what I just said which is the data center use case just because of increasing throughput requirements and we have evidence of that from our 5060 so our 5050 series is selling very well into that use case and the assumption there from customers telling us was, “Well, if you like the 5060 you'll love the 7050, right, just because of – you know it's a bigger in chassis.”  So we expect that that's going to be true in that the data center requirements grow over time you know that's a fantastic answer for customers to grow in with others through the requirement. And in addition to that it gets us the ability to have the conversation from a new customer set or a news case for customer set, which is in the service provider market where in the absence of having 100 gig-plus chassis, you know, using our technology for sell-through into the SMB base is – was a short conversation just from a throughput requirement so this gets us the ability to start to have that conversation with us the service providers.
Keith Weiss – Morgan Stanley: Excellent. Great quarter guys.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Greg Dunham representing Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Greg Dunham – Goldman Sachs: Mark, I guess first one for you. You mentioned last quarter, at least when you looked at the pipeline and when you’re talking together customers you saw anecdotes of perhaps a little bit higher refresh in 2014 and ‘15 than in previous years. Can you just give us an update on that?  And then a second one for Steffan. How should we expect the 7000 series or 7050 series to impact product gross margins going forward?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, I’ll start, Greg. Yes on the refresh cycle comment, we heard anecdotally that's a possibility that there might be a larger refresh cycle coming than, you know, say, in the last couple years and that's based on a few data points.  One is conversations with our partner community. The second is with our major account focus it's our own guys who are now more and more the Fortune 100 Global 2000 accounts, having longer term road map conversations and more visibility in architecture and so the commentary around that was that might be possible. I mean it happens every number of years and it might be possibly a time, where we might see a larger refresh cycle. It's anecdotal. I think it's hard to say for sure one way or the other.  The way we look at it is if that is the case and we have seen the industry generally reporting decent numbers, you know, in the last quarter for – even our competitors that looks like, you know, they're doing better than you had in the past, so maybe another data point around that. But if that is the case with their out sized market share gains that's only beneficial for us if this were in fact there.
Steffan Tomlinson: Greg, on the product gross margin question as it relates to the 7050, with our chassis and one line card that's for very much in line with our standard product gross margins, as we add line cards to a chassis, the gross margin profile actually improves and it gets above our standard product gross margin targets internally. So the more fully built out each chassis we sell is, it will be a positive tail wind for product gross margins down the road.
Greg Dunham – Goldman Sachs: Great, thanks guys.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland representing Robert Baird. Please proceed.
Jayson Noland – Robert W. Baird :  Steffan, I wanted to ask about international plans for expansion in calendar ‘14.
Steffan Tomlinson: Certainly. Our international – it's growing off a smaller base but we're posting very solid year-over-year growth rates in EMEA, APAC and the emerging Markets. When we look at productivity and the opportunity that's there, the resources required we're still dividing territories there. We're adding major account folks. Mark Anderson has done a very nice job in terms of building out an international presence from where we were so we're continue to invest in APAC and EMEA on – because we're seeing very strong returns there.
Jayson Noland – Robert W. Baird : And would you continue to push into emerging markets? There had been some challenges there, you know, more broadly and I assume that's still an area of opportunity for you but is that still full speed ahead or do you pause there?
Mark McLaughlin: No – it's Mark, Jason. Now, we’re going to be full speed ahead there. We've seen in the emerging markets, even though it's a small base for us outsized returns even greater than what we're seeing in the – and as you would expect in the established markets so we're not pausing on that and we expect that we continue to do very well in.
Jayson Noland – Robert W. Baird : Thanks guys.
Mark McLaughlin.: Thanks.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line Walter Pritchard representing Citi. Please proceed.
Walter Pritchard – Citigroup: Hi, thanks. Back in July, you had product revenue decelerate back into the lower 30s and you indicated that you expect it at the time it would reaccelerate. I’m wondering, any sort of guidance around product revenue? But should we expect product revenue growth to pick back up or should we expect it to accelerate down into the 20s? 
Mark McLaughlin: Walter, it's Mark. So on the product growth side, we've got a pretty good product growth here 7% sequentially, 30-plus [ph], you know, close to 31% year-over-year and we would expect to be able to continue product growth rates at these numbers – north of these numbers, so that expectation would be set before and that's the plans we had.  I think just at a big picture level on this too, the way we think about this is we're trying to grow the total revenue base of the Company. Actually, there's a number of things that Steffan went through that are in the mix of that and ones you can see on the subscription services side grows extremely well and that's because customers buy those generally in lieu of buying products, right?  So we're very happy with very strong product growth of at 30% – close to 31% at the size and scale we have there. And then we're extremely happy with the subscription services revenue. When you look at it – we're running close to $120 million run rate SaaS business in this Company growing it close to 75% year-over-year and that's because people are choosing those in lieu of other people’s products. So it's the combination of those things that's the powerhouse here from model perspective and we're not going any further than billings deferred – all the things, wonderful things happening, from the model to see how powerful that is. But specifically in your question yeah, we have strong product growth at a very high run rate right now and scale and we expect that to continue.
Walter Pritchard – Citigroup: And then just, Mark, one follow-up on the subscription side. Some of your competitors and [inaudible] has more aggressively bundled subscription in the product sales. I know you bundle support in. Have you guys played with potentially bundling in subscription and trying to – obviously, growth has been great but trying to drive the growth potentially faster to more attach group to those types of tactics? 
Mark McLaughlin: The approach that we've taken which was really based on market feedback early on was the first thing was to try to sell the subscription services as services instead of just bundling it into the product. That was obviously a good idea a number of years ago from a model perspective. And related to that was simplicity.  So when you look at the competitors and feedback that we've heard years ago from the customer base is it was very complicated pricing models, you know, pricing sheets go on for pages and pages and pages and we just took a different approach called this 20% of the list price of the device and people reacted very well to that because it's – one, it’s simple and the TCO is very, very obvious around that. You know we have for the subscription services.  Now in the future if we were to add additional services and our intent would be that we would do that, yeah, we'll think about how we price all those – when you start to add up some numbers or subscription services at, you know, a 20% of list pricing that might get you to think about why we would change it later on but right now the market was reacting very well to the way we've packaged this. So…
Walter Pritchard – Citigroup: Great, thanks.
Mark McLaughlin: Thanks, Walter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill representing UBS. Please proceed. 
Brent Thill – UBS : Good morning. Steffan, in Q1 I think you mentioned it became a little less back end loaded with the DSO. This quarter DSO dropped again. I think it's the lowest you've seen in last six quarters. Can you just walk through the linearity and what you're seeing in the business and it feels like there's a bigger tail wind from some of these high profile bridges that perhaps are offsetting maybe some of the historical seasonality. Can you just comment on that?
Steffan Tomlinson: Certainly. On linearity in the quarter, remember our fiscal Q2 encompasses December, which has a calendar year and budget flush component of it and we definitely participated in that. So we had a very good month one and month two of the quarter where a lot of the sales came in November and December and so that definitely helped with linearity in the quarter and we came in with a tail wind as well, so DSOs did come down sequentially. You are very pleased with that. And when you look at, you know, the construct of calendar year and budget flush we really saw it across-the-board in nearly every vertical, which we were very pleased with, given the nature of the advanced persistent threat landscape out there and also just the struggles that many companies are going through trying to do a fork lift upgrade of existing legacy technology to our platform, its created a lot of disruption, a lot of opportunity for us. So those call it macro dynamics have played to our strength and that shows up in our billings and revenue and business momentum.
Brent Thill – UBS : And just a quick follow-up for Mark. I know you mentioned the 7050 will give you a nicer tail wind with the service providers but can you just give us a sense of where the current state of business is with some of the service providers that you're engaging with, you know, Periva 7050? 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, so the way we look at certifiers, Brent, is three opportunities. One is the most simple, which is service providers are enterprises so they are likely customers for our own technology to protect their own networks and we’ve actually – that's been our first penetration point with all the major service providers is just having them buy our technology to protect their own networks and that's a good business for us and continues to grow.  The second area we looked at is many of the large service providers run pretty good sized systems integration business and their systems integrators for large enterprises and often do outsourcing for networks and in that case having them resell our technology as part of those offerings is an area we focus on and we've actually done very well there with them as well.  The third area is service providers using our technology on a sell-through basis like as a service. Sell-through basis – we offer a security – usually into the lower end markets. That's an area where we haven't penetrated service providers yet intentionally just because of the technology requirements and some of the support requirements around that. We're very focused on the enterprise market as we continue to be right now because we're in enormous growth in the enterprise.  But the 7050 is a throughput device that allows us to begin the conversation with the service provider to say, “If we wanted to attack that third opportunity with you, now that we have the chassis can we do that?” And the answer to that has been, “Yes.” There are different requirements for different service providers you have to get to other than just throughput and we'll engage with those guys as we've started to on what those would look like and road map around this. But that's how we think about service providers is it's not just a one trick pony. There's multiple ways to interact with them.
Brent Thill – UBS : Thank you.
Mark McLaughlin: Thanks, Brent.
Operator:
Jonathan Ho – William Blair: Hey, guys. Just wanted to understand a little bit better about sort of the EMEA region starting out. Are you seeing sort of improvements there or any impact to the macro environment and sort of your thoughts around the ability to continue improving the growth in that region?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, hi Jonathan. It's Mark. So EMEA has been challenging for us and for others for quite some time, given all of the macro environment over there but it seems to be improving, you know, on a quarter-by-quarter basis from a sentiment perspective and then I think sentiment leads to spending as well. So this last quarter, we’re very happy with what we saw from a selling perspective and revenue perspective and a selling perspective in EMEA. And, you know, for the first time for us, I'm not sure about other folks but every sub region in EMEA that we organize around did very well for first time in a long time, which was fantastic. We've been seeing you know, some regions do much better and some regions do less better like Southern Europe but even Southern Europe performed very well for us in this last quarter so we like EMEA. It's only about as we said before 23%, 24% of our revenue base so we have a lot of head room to get over there.
Jonathan Ho – William Blair: Got it and can you talk a little bit about sort of where your revenue coming from today relative to refresh of your existing customers versus competitive displacement and potentially at what point we start to see more of the lift from refreshing existing customer which is theoretically should be a bit easier?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, we would expect that from a refresh perspective, given what Steffan said about extremely low churn and higher renewal rates for the Company that we would do well in refresh cycles. I think for us in refreshing, if you think about the history of the Company and size or magnitude of the revenue base of the Company and a refresh cycle generally being three to five years, call that, you know, 2010, 2011 is when the Company actually of any size from a revenue perspective that a refresh would matter one way or the other for us, so anything prior to that I think has been refreshed but it's small numbers off a small base. It's after that where the numbers get bigger and we would expect that we would do extremely well from a refresh perspective with our existing customers because all our indications, customer satisfaction reports, things we hear from the channel, things we heard from the customers are very, very high satisfaction rates with our technology. That's also obviously an opportunity for us to have a further conversation with a lot of customers about additional services that they may not be using when we have the chance to talk about refreshes. But as a general matter, you know, our growth has been and continues to come from displacing competitors when they're up for refresh so refresh for us is a positive thing whenever that's going to come upon us.
Jonathan Ho – William Blair: Great, thank you.
Operator: And we now have time for one audio question. The question will come from the line of Scott Zeller, Needham & Company. Please proceed
Scott Zeller – Needham & Company: Thanks. Steffan, could you just give us some color around your expectations for seasonality of the deferred again please, just review that?
Stefan Tomlinson: Well, seasonality in the business in general has been a little bit hard to call. We historically said that our fiscal Q2 and fiscal Q4 will set out to be a bit the strongest from a seasonality standpoint. Q3 is effectively calendar Q1 for many companies because we have call it February, March, April, and we've seen some – you know, if you’ve seasonality in Q3 last year, although we grew total revenue by 53% year-over-year. We saw a sequential decline in product, so when you get to the seasonality of deferred revenues heading into fiscal Q3, I would say you can follow normal seasonality patterns that we've seen in the past. We are guiding 41% to 45% year-over-year total revenue growth and deferred revenues and billings will usually follow the same seasonality patterns that we've seen in the past so I would look to our prior historicals for that.
Scott Zeller – Needham & Company: Thank you.
Operator:  We do have time for one more audio question. It comes from the line of Karl Keirstead representing Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Karl Keirstead - Deutsche Bank: Well, great. Thanks for setting me and my question is to Mark. Mark, clearly, this APT or anti malware focus – this inside the firewall focus is probably going to be the topic here at RSA. And I just wanted to ask you a big picture question about how this changes your – the model this – the Palo Alto Networks salesforce and M&A focus this year, does it tilt you towards doing additional M&A besides the Morta deal you just did? Do you need to pivot the sales force focus a little bit? Any kind of model shifts as the customer focus on APT that ramps as much as it has it seems in the last few months.
Mark McLaughlin:  Yes, Karl. Well big picture the answer would be no, so from an APT perspective as a threat that – a kind of threat that has been highly discussed and vocalized in the last year or two and I also expect this would be a big topic at RSA – it's very well from us because what we're selling is a platform – and the platform is able to address from a detection prevention standpoint APT.  The reason for that and the interesting thing about the platform architecture and hence some of the business model that flows from that is of the aspects of our platform, the people have been using for quite some time to combat threat, we're all native, you know, to the platform. We've chosen to monetize it from a service perspective but it's when they're operating together is that’s the real – at the juice, that’s the power. So we like the fact, for example, that wildfire is selling very well from a subscription perspective but it's the – it’s wildfire is part of that overall platform with all of the other technology now that's really delivering the value from an APT detection and prevention standpoint for customers. So the reason I mentioned that is that our salesforce is very conversant on how to talk to the platform itself and what that could do from a security perspective. And now if you want to talk about the newest thing called APT, here is how that fits into that security landscape and the platform all do for you. So from a selling perspective, where the team has been able to discuss any subscription service in the concept of the platform for quite some time and has been doing that pretty successfully.  You know from an M&A perspective, we've said for awhile that we've got a very large addressable market opportunity here in enterprise network security of, you know, big kind of these numbers you look at $13 billion growing to $15 billion in the next few years and that the product we have today and the road map we have today organically allows us to address the vast majority, if not the entire total addressable market there but if we saw opportunities where we could accelerate the product road map by, you know, buying a small Company along the way, we would be interested and we demonstrated that with Morta, which brings us an acceleration of the road map on things related to wildfire and then also if there was team expansion opportunities outside of that were interesting over time but they were very close in from what we do for a living and we’d be interested in that as well. So I think you're right. I think you'll hear a lot of APT at RSA. We like that since we have a fantastic answer and solution for that. The place – and it’s a much bigger picture answer from a platform perspective and everybody else who were –we're hopeful that you're correct on that and it gives us a chance to get more potential customers.
Karl Keirstead - Deutsche Bank:  Got it. Thanks for the color, Mark.
Mark McLaughlin: Thanks, Karl. 
Operator:  I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Mark McLaughlin for closing remarks.
Mark McLaughlin:  Okay. Thanks, operator, and thanks, everybody, for being on the call this morning. I also want to thank the entire Palo Alto Networks' team for all their hard work and support, and as well as customers and partners to help us continue to find the next generation of enterprise security. We appreciate your time this morning. Take care.
Operator:  Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2014 Palo Alto Networks Earnings Conference Call. My name is Britney, and I'll be the operator for today's conference. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today, Ms. Kelsey Turcotte. Please proceed, ma'am.
Kelsey Turcotte: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Palo Alto Networks' fiscal first quarter 2014 financial results. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed on the Investors section of the Palo Alto Networks website at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. With me on today's call are Mark McLaughlin, Palo Alto Networks' Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Steffan Tomlinson, Chief Financial Officer. After the market closed today, Palo Alto Networks issued a press release announcing the results for its 2014 fiscal first quarter ended October 31, 2013. If you would like a copy of the release, you can access it online at the company's website or you can call The Blueshirt Group at (415) 217-7722, and they will e-mail you a copy. We would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, Palo Alto Networks management will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding continued revenue growth, increases in market share and overall momentum in Palo Alto Networks' business, trends in its business and operating results, including customer growth, its services revenue, gross margin, services margins and DSOs. Expectations regarding investments in research and development and the introduction of new products and Palo Alto Networks' revenue and non-GAAP estimated earnings per share for the second fiscal quarter of 2014 ending January 31, 2014. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. These forward-looking statements apply as of today, and you should not rely on them as representing our views in the future, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements after this call. For a more detailed description of these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on September 25, 2013, and our earnings release posted a few minutes ago on our website.

We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in the Investors section of our website located at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. Before I turn the call over to the team, I would like to inform you that Palo Alto Networks will be participating in the CSFB Annual Technology Conference on Wednesday, December 4, in Scottsdale, Arizona. And with that, I'd like to introduce Mark, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Palo Alto Networks. Mark?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Thank you, Kelsey, and welcome to the team. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Q1 was a strong start for our fiscal 2014. Our results continue to prove that our next-generation enterprise security platform is quickly becoming the mainstream market choice for enterprises around the world. And that it uniquely positions us as a leader in the fast-growing cybersecurity market segment. The combination of these market drivers, our land and expand strategy and the power of our fast-growing subscription services model drove record revenue and strong bottom line results in the first quarter. Revenue in Q1 grew by 49% year-over-year to over $128 million. And we delivered high gross margins, significant operating leverage and non-GAAP EPS of $0.08 per share. We are very pleased with what we have accomplished this quarter and believe that the reasons for such high growth positions us well for continued growth. Today, global enterprises are facing an extremely difficult environment in which protecting their networks against ever-increasing threats is paramount. The risks are very high and include lost revenue, loss of customer data, loss of intellectual property and loss of customer trust. At the same time, it's more and more evident that the legacy security technologies that enterprises have relied on for a long time are incapable of addressing their security needs. This has led to a major market disruption in favor of Palo Alto Networks. Our platform is at the forefront of next-generation enterprise security and is now being rapidly adopted by the Global 2000 as their mainstream solution at the expense of the legacy vendors. In addition, we're uniquely positioned as a firewall, the main protection point for network security with the next-generation platform, which provides a highly integrated and automated level of visibility and intelligence around detection and prevention. This allows us to benefit from the drive for advanced cybersecurity solutions. The mainstream adoption of our platform as the firewall of choice, as well as our unique ability to provide the most integrated and automated cyber threat detection and prevention capabilities in the market is fueling our growth. And we can see this playing out in the numbers. Our adoption as the primary network security platform by global enterprises continues to grow. In the first quarter, we saw continued penetration of the largest companies in the world, with over 65% of the Fortune 100 and 35% of Global 2000 customers, and we saw larger initial orders and deployments from our bigger customers. Also in the quarter, our wins against legacy competitors included: One of the largest oil and gas companies in the world, where we're replacing Check Point and Cisco; a major Canadian bank; a large health care organization that we'll be deploying our full solution, including WildFire and other subscriptions; one of Russia's largest oil transporters; and a leading international credit card company, where we are deploying the largest virtual firewall in Europe. In addition, we demonstrated last quarter that we are well positioned to rapidly expand within our customer base. For example, we expanded within a Fortune 50 manufacturer based in the United States with a 7-figure deal to be their primary firewall. And we also expanded within a U.S. federal agency, where our platform is displacing large amounts of legacy technology. These results show that we continue to rapidly move into the mainstream with the largest companies in the world. This trend is further evidenced by the climb in our lifetime customer value. For example, in Q1, our top 25 customer had to spend a minimum of $4.1 million with us in lifetime value to make the top 25 list. And our lifetime value, measured by the increase from their initial purchase, rose to 19.6x. This compares to $3.6 million and 15.4x in the immediately preceding quarter and $2.1 million and 9.5x at the beginning of fiscal 2013. If I expand this list to our top 100 customers, they have all spent a minimum of $1.5 million on our solutions, which is double from what it was a year ago. We believe our continued increase in wallet share will enable high growth over the long term. Our position as the firewall and our innovative approach to increasingly sophisticated attacks also sets us up well for high growth in the market for cybersecurity solutions. This has been a big factor on our platform adoption that I mentioned earlier, and we can also see it in the rapid growth in WildFire, the market's most highly automated and integrated detection and prevention solution. In Q1, WildFire customer adoption grew to approximately 2,400 customers, up from about 2,000 in the prior quarter, with approximately 1,000 paying customers using the platform, up from around 600 customers in Q4. The WildFire attach rate was over 20% in the quarter, and WildFire continues to act as a driver and differentiator for our core network security platform. WildFire is an example of our high growth, hybrid revenue model, where we leverage our unique hardware platform to sell SaaS subscription services to meet our customers' evolving enterprise security requirements. The hybrid SaaS business model means that we're able to benefit over time with recurring revenues as we build our installed base. In a constantly evolving and complex threat landscape, we continue to deliver solutions that solve our customers' toughest security problems. This is an approach that makes sense, as our core platform sits in the single-most-important spot for network security is the firewall. And of course, we continue to invest in innovation and aggressively grow our go-to-market capabilities. On the innovation front, in early calendar 2014, we expect to introduce our high-end 120-gig chassis for the data center and service provider market, deliver significant enhancements to our WildFire service, release our next major OS revision and bring our joint virtualization solution to market with VMware. Expect more innovation throughout the year as the technology gap between Palo Alto Networks and our competitors continues to widen as it has every year since we began providing solutions to our customers. In terms of our go-to-market focus, the growth of our sales force, continued growth in investment in channel partners, penetration in emerging markets and building out our alliance ecosystem are accelerating the delivery of our solutions to the market and growth in the business. We'll continue to pursue all these focus areas to grow into our large addressable market. Before concluding, I want to mention that we completed the summary judgment and claims construction hearings in our litigation with Juniper on November 15. We remain confident in our position in that case. To wrap up, our first quarter results continue to demonstrate that we're on the right track. We've reached over $0.5 billion in annualized run rate revenues and continue to grow at almost 50% as we rapidly gain share in a very large addressable market. We will stay focused and do what we do best, delivering highly differentiated enterprise security solutions that solve our customers' most difficult challenges. I'd now like to turn the call over to Steffan for a detailed look at our financial results. Steffan?
Steffan C. Tomlinson: Thank you, Mark. I'm pleased to report that first quarter results for fiscal 2014 exceeded our guidance. We continue to demonstrate rapid revenue and billings growth, solid bottom line performance and healthy free cash flow generation. Before I get into the details, I'd like to note that except for revenue figures that are GAAP, all financial figures are non-GAAP unless stated otherwise and exclude IP litigation expenses for both the first quarter and historical comparisons. New wins from customers in the quarter, our expansion within our existing customer base and our hybrid SaaS revenue model were the catalyst for revenue, billings and deferred revenue growth. In Q1, total revenue was a record $128.2 million, growing 49% over the prior year and 14% sequentially. The geographic mix of revenue was 67% Americas, 19% EMEA and 14% APAC. All theaters posted solid growth year-over-year, led by the Americas, which grew 58%. From a vertical and customer standpoint, we saw broad strength across a wide range of verticals, including federal, and we had no end customer concentration. All 3 components of our hybrid SaaS model grew well in the quarter. Product revenue of $75.5 million increased 36% over the prior year and 15% sequentially. Growth was driven in part by demand for our midrange 3000 and high-end 5000 PA series of appliances. Our recurring services revenue of $52.7 million increased 73% over the prior year and 12% sequentially, and accounted for a 41% share of total revenue. Looking at its 2 components, support and maintenance revenue of $27.9 million increased 75% over the prior year and 10% sequentially. Our SaaS-based subscription revenue of $24.8 million increased 71% over the prior year and approximately 15% sequentially. As a result of our land and expand strategy and the recurring nature of our support and subscription businesses, we expect the services revenue will continue to grow at a faster pace than product revenue as we continue to monetize our incumbent position in the network. Every time we sell a new subscription or renew an existing subscription, it's equivalent to selling a product, except that we've chosen the SaaS model to deliver and monetize it. Increases in services revenue as a percentage of total revenue will improve our gross margins, as well as increase visibility into future revenue streams. The strength of our business model was evident in the growth rate in billings, deferred revenue and free cash flow. Compared to the prior year, billings in Q1 grew 43% to $157.9 million. Total deferred revenue increased 74% to $279 million and short-term deferred revenue increased 69% to $171.6 million. Turning to gross margin, total gross margin of 75% increased 50 basis points sequentially. Product gross margin was 76.6%, increasing 140 basis points sequentially, due in part to favorable product mix and continued focus on material and manufacturing cost reductions. As a reminder, there will be fluctuations in our product gross margin, primarily due to product mix and the timing of new appliance shipments. Services gross margin of 72.8% declined 70 basis points sequentially, due in part to investments in our customer support organization as we continue to add systems and personnel to accommodate the rapid growth of our customer base. Moving on to operating expenses. As Mark discussed, we believe there is considerable opportunity for us to drive growth and capture market share, and we continue to invest in both product development and our sales and go-to-market organization. Research and development expense was 12.9% of revenue, increasing approximately $2.1 million sequentially to $16.5 million. Headcount additions and project-related expenses supporting our development activities contributed to the increase. Sales and marketing expense was 47% of revenue, essentially flat with the prior quarter as a percentage of sales and increasing approximately $7.3 million sequentially to $60.3 million. New headcount additions at the beginning of the fiscal year, partner conferences, and our worldwide sales event that we held to kick off the new fiscal year contributed to the increase. General and administrative expense was 7.6% of revenue, increasing approximately $2.5 million sequentially to $9.8 million. The sequential increase is attributed to higher personnel and infrastructure-related costs as we continue to support the growth of the business. On a GAAP basis, IP litigation expense in our G&A line was $1.9 million in Q1 '14, $0.6 million in Q1 '13 and $1.4 million in Q4 '13. We've provided a supplemental schedule on our IR website that shows the historical impact of the IP litigation costs. In total, operating expenses were $86.6 million or 67.5% of revenue. Operating margin increased 70 basis points year-over-year to 7.5% and declined 50 basis points sequentially. Our effective tax rate for Q1 was 38%. Net income for the quarter was approximately $6.2 million or $0.08 per diluted share, using 77.2 million shares, compared with net income of $3.3 million or $0.05 per diluted share in Q1 '13. On a GAAP basis for the first quarter, net loss was $7.9 million or $0.11 per basic and diluted share compared to a Q1 '13 GAAP net loss of $3.5 million or $0.05 per basic and diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, we finished October with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $470.4 million. Cash flow from operations, free cash flow and free cash flow margin were $38.9 million, $23.2 million and 18.1%, respectively. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $15.7 million and were related to facilities purchases and acquiring intellectual property. The accounts receivable balance was $91.4 million, up from the prior quarter balance of $87.5 million. Linearity in the quarter improved, which helped improve average days sales outstanding to 63 days, down from 72 days last quarter. This is below our DSO target range of 65 to 75 days. Let me now move to our guidance. As a reminder, guidance excludes IP litigation expenses. In Q2 '14, we expect revenue to be in the range of $132 million to $136 million, which represents 37% to 41% growth year-over-year. And we expect non-GAAP EPS to be approximately $0.08 to $0.09 per share using 77 million to 79 million shares. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Greg Dunham representing Goldman Sachs.
Gregory Dunham - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I guess Q4 was a good quarter for you guys. You improved your execution, but this quarter actually jumps out as better than that with accelerating product revenue growth. How -- can you decipher between how much of that is just increased tenure of the reps that you hired last year versus just a generally improving macro? Any way to distinguish that?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Greg, it's Mark. Yes, the answer is more likely or not all of the above, which is, I think the security market continues to be very robust. You can see that not just from ourselves, but other folks that reported. The needs out there are very strong. Customers are buying to solve those needs. And then on top of that, we have a unique platform. So we're benefiting disproportionately from that. As you know, we put a hell of a lot of focus into the major global accounts and the sales organization over last year, and I think that, that's paying off very well as you can see from the numbers, too. So I think a lot of these things are moving in our direction. Some are macro and some are about the solution. And some are about the things we're doing on an execution base at the company.
Gregory Dunham - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then one quick follow-up, if I may. Where are we in terms of customers migrating to 5.0 on an OS basis?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Yes, a bit over 60%.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss representing Morgan Stanley.
Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I was wondering if we could talk a little bit about -- going into any Q1, there's some level of sales changes that take place. Maybe you can mark-to-market for us the level of changes that were enacted this year compared to prior years. And how comfortable do you feel with everybody kind of marching to order for the rest of the year from where we're standing today?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Yes, sure, Keith. Well, as you know over the last year, we made a number of changes in the sales organization, about 18 months ago, with Mark Anderson joining us under an assumption that he would do a certain number of things that he's done very well from a team perspective, starting with leadership. And then also getting the reps who know how to service and close large accounts. That's really worked itself out through the better course of the last year and all those changes have been made, and we think people are really humming now. And we mentioned at the last call that this will be the first year, by the end of the year, where we'll have more ramp than ramping salespeople in the organization, which we think is a good thing for us as we continue to march down the field.
Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Excellent. Excellent. And then maybe on the -- from a potential overhang perspective. If you could get to your comments on 2 aspects. One, just in terms of litigation, we are sort of into the thick of it past the Markman hearing. Anymore foot [ph] in the market in terms of tying up sales cycles? Any impact from the actual fundamentals from that litigation?
Mark D. McLaughlin: It doesn't appear to be the case. We said before that we haven't seen any impact in the market that we can discern from a selling perspective. We continue to grow at extremely healthy rates. So we continue to beat all the competition handily whenever we face them. So I don't see it really playing out in the market.
Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Excellent. Then one last one, just in terms of the competitive environment. Cisco, obviously, made a pretty big acquisition of Sourcefire. What's the initial indications on sort of how that's impacting you guys in terms of the competitive environment? Are people taking Cisco more seriously or is it just disruption in the near term?
Mark D. McLaughlin: I think to the extent there's any impact at all, it's been positive for us. And that's primarily because we handily beat Cisco when we face them. We've beat Sourcefire in head-to-head competitions as well. And taking an IPS technology and bolting it on a stateful inspection firewall is not a fundamental disruptive technology change. So I don't think it changes anything from a technical solution perspective. We've also seen confusion in the market from the Sourcefire customers about what that means. What's going to happen to them over time. And we've been able to develop hundreds and hundreds of leads from dissatisfied or confused Sourcefire customers. So at least from our perspective, it's been a positive.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Rob Owens representing Pacific Crest Securities.
Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Mark, you mentioned how the spending in security markets were robust. And I think if you go back a couple of quarters, it was a little more choppy. So maybe just talk about general demand. How the space is firming. And are we in front of that perceived firewall replacement cycle that I think a lot of folks have been talking about for the last year?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Yes, Rob. It's a little hard to come by hard data around the refresh cycle, as far as anybody who would know for sure. But I've heard a number of anecdotal points that a big refresh cycle is upon us in the next 12 to 15 months. And we think we can see that from what we're seeing from a pipeline perspective, close rates. I mean, it all points in that direction. That there is a big refresh cycle in front of us. On the big picture about security, I know that there was a 1 quarter bump in the road before, not just security, but all of networking. There are various reasons for that. But it appears as though at least from a security perspective that, that's rebounded very nicely, and that security is a top-of-mind issue and is likely to remain that way for some time.
Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Great. And then as we look at some of your incremental services and those SaaS capabilities in WildFire or the URL filtering or threat prevention, any sense of where renewal rates are running on those services?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Yes, we had said earlier that the renewal rates were better than 85%, and more likely than not higher that. One of the reasons that we were less exact on the higher number was, is that when a customer upgrades from an equipment perspective, for us, it looks like a new sale, not a renewal. So we're highly confident it's higher than that, but that's what we reported last time.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Just wanted to start out with the EMEA and APAC regions. What typical opportunity do you see to sort of accelerate growth there? Are there any sort of things that restrict the growth from maybe being a little bit faster than what you're seeing, especially relative to your North American results?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Yes, so if we look at the results in EMEA and APAC. On the EMEA side, we saw good year-to-year -- year-over-year growth and a slight sequential decline of about 2%. We like EMEA as a market. We think that's a big growth opportunity for us. There continues to be some concern in Southern Europe. I think that's going to last for a while from a macro standpoint. But we're investing there, and we think that, that's a good growth market for us. Also, just as a general matter coming from a Q4 to Q1, it's not surprising to see a sequential decline there. And in APAC, we had a 2% sequential decline as well, but we had very strong year-over-year growth in APAC. And we're coming off a extremely high comp last sequential growth quarter-over-quarter in APAC. So it's across the board, generally pleased with all the performance in the regions.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Got it. And just in terms of the latest products that you're seeing released, what type of opportunity do you think that's going to drive in terms of accelerating growth? Particularly relative to the high end of the market and the midrange, and what could that mean in terms of your growth expectations?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Yes, so the ones that we've talked about from a roadmap perspective coming up in relatively short order fall in the category of a new version of WildFire coming out, which is going to help us to continue to even faster accelerate the need for cybersecurity solutions. We've talked about our 120-gig chassis, which is coming out, which will help us expand even faster than we are today in the data center environment and it will open up a new part of the addressable market for us, which is the service provider market. And we've also talked about a joint technology offering coming to market shortly with VMware, which is going to allow us to even penetrate faster into the virtualization space. So those are a couple of 3 we've discussed a lot. There's more, obviously, and we're not going to get into laying out the entire roadmap. But we think those allow us to get bigger opportunities in different deployment models like virtualization and also get more than our fair share of the real fast-growing cybersecurity subsegment of the enterprise security market.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow representing Crédit Suisse.
Philip Winslow - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just wanted to focus in on your comments about improving attach rates and renewal rates of your subscription offerings, and particularly WildFire. Just what are you hearing from customers as far as the sort of the ability to adopt more subscriptions from you all? And in particular, WildFire, what are you hearing from customers about why they're choosing WildFire versus some of the other offerings that are on the market?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Sure. So from an attach rate on subscription services, they continue to go up for us, which is great, as we've expected they would. And as a reminder, the reason for that is that these subscription services are generally taking the place of what a customer used to have to buy from a standalone product. So this is best-of-breed functionality in a highly integrated, highly automated fashion at a much lower cost than what they would have to get by buying a standalone product. On the WildFire side, that's a very fast grower for us. And the reason for that is, it's just solving a real important problem for customers right now in this whole advanced persistent threat space. And the reason they're going with WildFire is primarily 3 things. The first is, is that because we are the firewall in most customers' cases already, not only can we do advanced detection capabilities, but we can also do prevention. Because ultimately, you have to be the firewall in order to do that. The second thing is from a deployment standpoint, we're doing this primarily in the cloud. So there is -- it's got infinite compute capacities. And it's wicked fast as a result of that. As an aside, we also have a private cloud solution with our WF 500 series. And the third reason is, you get the network impact because we do it in the cloud. And we have thousands of customers in all verticals in every geography, we're able to share in a highly leveraged basis what we're seeing across the customer base. So you don't have to be attacked yourself in order to see something from an attack perspective. You're getting the benefit of what we're seeing across the entire customer base that's using WildFire today. So those are really driving the adoption.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Catharine Trebnick representing Northland Securities.
Catharine Anne Trebnick - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division: Quick question is on WildFire. You have 2 solutions, the cloud-based solution and then the appliance. Is there any pushback from your clients at all regarding security in the cloud and not wanting security in the cloud? And could you pretty much give us more color around that, if that's the case or not the case?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Catharine, yes, so primarily, what we have been providing to customers, which they like, is cloud-based. And the reason for that is, it's easy. It's very fast. You get the leverage of the network and the sharing that goes on with that. However, there's a subset of customers that can't or won't, for various reasons, send files to the cloud. And because of that subset of the customer base, we developed the WF 500, which in essence, allows you to create a private cloud solution. So if you have those concerns, you can still have all the power of this technology without worrying about the public cloud aspect of it.
Catharine Anne Trebnick - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division: Are you -- also, in some of your customers, you also share, FireEye's also a customer, can you talk a little bit about how the difference is between your solution and maybe perhaps their pure play?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Yes, what I was just mentioning a little while ago, which was, first of all, you've got to start with the ability to do highly integrated and automated detection and prevention. And as the firewall, we can do both of those, not just the detection capabilities. We have the cloud aspect, which allows for a very fast ability to process files and get answers back. And then we're highly leveraged because we use the network. So that all the customers can get the benefit of what other customers are seeing. So generally, those are the high-level architectural differences that allow us to put these kind of growth rates up.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill representing UBS.
Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Steffan, on your comment on linearity improvement, I'm curious if you could just give us a little more color, typically Q1, you wouldn't think you would see that. What do you think caused that linearity improvement in Q1?
Steffan C. Tomlinson: There are a couple of factors, Brent. When you think about the sales mechanisms we put in place around large account selling, we saw some nice traction from some of our larger customers in the first half of the quarter. So that was one thing. And then we have the other part of our sales engine, which is keep-the-lights-on business. And we have a very robust, high-touch and direct fulfillment model with our channel partners helping. So we had a very nice quarter from a linearity standpoint. It helped drive DSOs down nicely quarter-over-quarter. So we felt really good about the quarter.
Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, and can you just comment on the impact of the federal market?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Yes, so we were pleased with the fed business in the first quarter. We saw the end of the year fed spend -- I mean, their end of the year. As we expected we would, despite all the sequestration anxiety. And just I think that's primarily the continued validation of our solution for a very discerning customer base. We like that vertical a lot. And given what their needs are, and what we do for a living, we think that, that will continue to grow nicely for us.
Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. So that, in your perspective, exceeded your expectation or met or was below? How would you characterize that business?
Mark D. McLaughlin: In the first quarter, our expectations were met as we expected with the end of the year flush.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits representing Raymond James.
Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: I'm Michael Turits. One question on APAC, which was up strong year-over-year. Any impact from the NSA/political issues in China? And how much China exposure do you have? So could this be an issue going forward?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Yes, Michael. Not that we can tell. So I understood from Cisco's reports that they were seeing -- had some anxiety around that. At a big picture for us, our emerging market opportunities grew very, very well in the quarter, on a sequential and year-over-year basis. So we haven't seen any of that kind of impact. We have a smaller base of business than those guys do, but it performed very well for us.
Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then kind of a high-level question about the security market. Obviously, you did well overall, and you did well with WildFire. Some people question what the impact is of APTs on budgets, on security budgets? In other words, is there any -- and taking oxygen out the room relative to next-gen firewall with APT or do you view this -- especially, since it's not a pre-budgeted line item, or is this something which is therefore, expanding what you think the IT security budgets are like in the next 12 months?
Mark D. McLaughlin: I think it's a good thing for us. The way we think about this is, is that we have -- we have a platform, right? And that years ago was considered just primarily a next-gen firewall, but it's really a platform that has multiple solutions that are highly integrated from the firewall and IPS and filtering and others. And when additional security needs need to be met, we have a unique ability to add services into that platform. So that platform, I think, is really in a mainstream adoption phase of getting taken in by Global 2000, Fortune 100 and companies across the globe. And that's just starting, of displacing all that legacy firewall plus the disparate other pieces of technology. In addition to that, we've got something that's popped up in a relatively recent term on the APT or cybersecurity threats. And that for us is a feature set of our platform. So we get to wrap that in there as well. And the next thing that's coming after that, whatever that may be, we have the ability with our platform architecture to bring that to bear as well. So we've got the mainstream adoption of our core platform plus another accelerator called APT, which is a feature of us on that platform, so we think it's an additive opportunity.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland representing Robert W. Baird.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: First for Steffan, we didn't really see seasonality in F Q1, Steffan, should we think about the rest of the year as F Q3 soft relative to a more positive F Q2 and F Q4?
Steffan C. Tomlinson: That's a good question. We've highlighted this in the past where our growth rates are -- have been so robust, it's hard to call the ball in seasonality. So what we originally thought was, our fiscal Q2 and Q4 may be strongest in terms of year-over-year and sequential growth rates. Q1, obviously, we saw no seasonality, which was a good thing. So what does that portend for the rest of the fiscal year? I would still say that, we would think that Q2 and Q4 would be very good quarters for us. We think Q3 would be, too. But if there's any historical pattern that's shaping up last fiscal Q3 more from a macro standpoint had hurt us. In that quarter, we were still able to grow 50% year-over-year. So we -- it's still too soon to call the ball on seasonality, but we feel good about the prospects of growth for the rest of the fiscal year.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then just a follow-up from me on U.S. fed gov, was the growth there a specific deal or broad-based? And Mark, can you continue to grow in this vertical given the challenges that likely remain?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Yes, Jayson. No, it's broad-based. The fed's a unique vertical in that it takes a long time to get yourself established in there, but when you do, it really starts to pay off for you. So I think this is a specific example of the focus we put into the major account program that we've been running for a while. This is a very, like I said, discerning customer, but once they start to adopt your technology, they can start -- they do that in a broad basis, and we're seeing that happen. So it's across-the-board. It's good growth in that vertical. And we think that could continue in time. Of course, we're keeping our eye on the ball, like everybody else, about sequestration and all the budget swirl that's going in Washington, D.C. That's not a helpful thing for anybody, ourselves included. And obviously, as we go into Q2, you don't have the end of the year fed flush that you have in our Q1. But that's all baked into our guidance.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Gray Powell representing Wells Fargo.
Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: So I think you touched on this earlier. But I guess I'll ask it again. So I mean, network security spending has been somewhat constrained in the last couple of years. How do you feel about the potential for improved refresh cycle for the industry as a whole? And then do you think that provides you a better opportunity to displace incumbents and take share?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Yes, Gray. Yes, a couple of thoughts on it. The first is that the addressable market opportunity we're playing in is $13 billion going to $16 billion, $17 billion in the next 3 or 4 years. Lots of studies out there suggest that, that grows anywhere on a 5% to 7% CAGR. So just from a greenfield opportunity or new opportunity, 5% to 7%, not a huge growth rate, but it's on a really big number, right? So that's hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars that gets created every year. And we think we do very well there. More importantly than that though is the installed base that you just mentioned and the refresh opportunities that come with that, that are measured in billions of dollars of addressable market opportunity. And we can see just in the displacement of the competitors across-the-board, it doesn't matter who it is, we displace them at very high rates, that we continue to win these refresh opportunities. You've heard from -- like I said a little earlier, it's hard to be mathematically exact in this, but a number of sources of the refresh that comes up every 3 or 4 years, really big ones. And then we think we're at the beginning of one of those.
Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then just one more, if I may. Can you help us think about the opportunity with WildFire longer term, do you see that subscription being as meaningful as some of the other early ones like IPS? And then just -- I don't know, like sort of in life to date, how would you benchmark it versus some of the other subscriptions?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Yes, so the one that is probably closest akin to just from the way it might be thought of in the market is the threat prevention. So I'd expect over time that we could achieve rates in that zip code, which is pretty high. And then from just a growth perspective, it's been growing at the rates that we saw some of the earlier subscription services grow at over time. It takes time to get them going. The customers have to adopt 5.0. That's why I think it was Greg who asked before, what the percentage of the customer base is on 5.0? Right now, that's a bit over 60% and growing every quarter. So that's good just for our installed base. Yes, so there's a number of moving parts around that, that would lead that to grow over time, but we have very high hopes for that.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Scott Zeller representing Needham & Company.
Robert Scott Zeller - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: I wanted to ask over the -- just as a trend anecdotally over the last few quarters, how have the deals in the pipeline shaped up as far as breadth of service, point solution versus broad deployment of firewall? Can you give us some anecdotal color please?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Yes, a couple angles on that, Scott. First is, recently, we had said that over 75% of the deals that are coming through the pipeline for us that we're winning, we're the primary firewall in those deals, a bit over 60%. This is the number that we gave a couple of quarters ago. But over 60% of the installed base is we're the primary firewall. So those continue to rise. I said, we take that as one angle on the question. And then the second thing is, our attach rates continue to rise as well, meaning every time they get a product in there, we continue over time to attach more and more services to it. So the combination of those 2 things bodes well for us.
Steffan C. Tomlinson: One follow-on point to that. It really goes to the versatility of our platform. We can sell into any enterprise network in a security need that exists. It could be for firewall. It could be for IDS/IPS, filtering, you go down the list. And the platform approach that we have really gives us a unique position against all the other vendors that are out there.
Robert Scott Zeller - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Just a follow-up, is that 75% -- we've heard that previously, has that been a consistent number?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Yes, we said we're going to update that. It's on a semiannual basis. That was the last time we gave that number. That's what it was. And that's up from the last time we talked about that.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Hendi Susanto representing Gabelli & Company.
Hendi Susanto - Gabelli & Company, Inc.: I have one question for Steffan. Management is targeting exiting the fourth quarter with operating margin in the low double-digit. Considering the current investment, how should we expect the timing of margin expansion and operating leverage in the current fiscal year?
Steffan C. Tomlinson: Well, we think that exiting Q4, we'll be in the low double-digit operating margin on an exit rate basis. And given the size of the market that we're going after, our -- if you look at our revenue growth, our customer additions, if you look at the power of our hybrid SaaS model, we've always said that we want to have more of a slow and steady approach to operating margin expansion throughout the fiscal year and towards our overall long term target model. So we feel like there's going to be room for incremental investment, but we're doing it in a disciplined way where we're generating positive operating margin right now. You look at positive cash flow and free cash flow generation. So the model is working. And when you combine all that together, exiting Q4, we feel pretty comfortable that we'll be in the low double-digit operating margin.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Shebly Seyrafi representing FBN Securities.
Shebly Seyrafi - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division: So your product gross margin has increased for about 3 quarters in a row. And it's 76.6% non-GAAP. And your total gross margin is 75%, above your previous long-term target of 70% to 73%. So I'm just wondering with this 120-gig product coming out next year, should we think about the product gross margins staying at this level or potentially even increasing? Or do you think that it's above where you think it should be longer term?
Steffan C. Tomlinson: There are a couple of parts to that question. The first is, remember any time we introduce a new product, we typically see a little bit of pressure on the product gross margin line because we haven't achieved full scale and volume in that product line. So depending on the early level of traction, there's usually a little bit of a negative fluctuation for new platforms that we introduce. To your broader point, we have a target gross margin range of 70% to 73% total. We've been operating above that, which is great. It goes to the -- how we're operating our business in terms of the disciplined approach. Once we get to our target model of 22% to 25% non-GAAP operating margin, we're going to look at all the elements of that target model, including the gross margin. And we'll revisit at that point. But in the interim, we think there's going to be some fluctuation. We're still making investments in our services organization as an example, so you're going to see fluctuations there. But directionally over time, we feel good about the targets, and we'll revisit once we get to the target operating margin.
Shebly Seyrafi - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And your IP litigation expense ticked up again, the $1.9 million as you're past the Markman hearing, et cetera. Where do you see that going over the next few quarters?
Steffan C. Tomlinson: Unfortunately, we see it going up as we get closer to the trial. We will definitely see increases in IP litigation expenses. We're not calling the ball specifically on the specific dollar amount. But in order to provide full transparency, we are -- we'll break it out every quarter, both on the call and in the supplemental documents that we post on our IR website.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani representing Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Eric A. Ghernati - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: This is Eric Ghernati for Tal. Just on the refresh cycle opportunity that you have ahead of you in the next 12 to 15 months. Is the service provider included in that? And if so, can you just give us a sense of what you're seeing there from a customer interest in your upcoming platform? And how soon you can convert that into this meaningful revenue from the time you introduce the product?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Yes, so on the refresh that's specifically just, call it, the standard enterprise, meaning this is a firewall that's used in a standard enterprise environment. That's where the majority of the money sits today. And that's what I meant from a refresh cycle perspective. In the service provider market, as we mentioned before, other than working with the service providers and systems integrators and also the distribution channel, we've had decent penetration with them from a technology perspective in selling our technology to them, meaning they're an enterprise using our technology to protect their own environment. And also an increasing opportunity where they're using our technology to provide a service to their customers, specifically enterprise customers. So we think the 120-gig chassis that we're coming out with is really going to go to that last one I mentioned, which is, the ability to use our technology to provide services to their customers as a service. And that's a new portion of the TAM for us, as far as serviceability. And we expect good things from that over the future.
Eric A. Ghernati - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And then just on your EMEA business. Basically if the math is correct, have been kind of within a tight range the last 3 quarters. Certainly, up this quarter, albeit off of a easier comp? Just give a sense on what you think is needed there aside from a good macro, of course, to drive the growth rate a little faster in that region?
Mark D. McLaughlin: What's needed is a good macro environment. Unfortunately, that's the answer. I mean, we're doing very well on a relative basis competitively in the market. But in the absence of, I'll call it, a more normalized selling situation, the macro environment, it's tough sledding for everybody.
Operator: We are taking our final question from Erik Suppiger representing JMP Securities.
Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: First off, the 20% attach rate you said for WildFire. I think you said that it was consistent with that last quarter. Where do you think that attach rate could go? And can you also comment as to how much of that is going into your existing customers versus how much is going into new deployments?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Erik, yes, a couple of things, it's over 20% in the first quarter is what I just mentioned. And as I mentioned a little while back in a different question, we think that the attach rates can approach the ones that we have today for like threat prevention, particularly in filtering. So much higher than they are today. So we have a lot of hope for that as a driver for us and a tailwind for us in the future.
Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: In new customers versus existing?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Yes, on that, we don't break that out specifically, but we're doing well on both places. So we've got about 2,400 total customers on WildFire today. That's up from over 2,000 last quarter. So we're growing the total customers well. And the paid customers are close to 1,000 -- close to 1,000, which is up nicely from last quarter as well. So the more that we continue to grow the free customer base, the more opportunity we have to penetrate that base. And we are doing that. The other thing is just given all the concern about advanced persistent threat in cybersecurity today, we find that WildFire is also a great appointment getter for us just from a prospective on getting into accounts in the first place, and then being able to sell them the full solution, not just that feature set about APT.
Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then last one, on the WildFire 500, do you think that can become a meaningful revenue stream? Or do you think that's still going to stay a minority kind of customer base that's just looking to not use the cloud?
Mark D. McLaughlin: It was designed and it's continued to be designed to solve the needs of customers who don't want to send or can't send files up to the public cloud. So I think that's a -- it is a minority segment of the customer base. So our main driver for WildFire is not going to be WildFire 500. But of course, we want to make sure we have total market coverage for anybody who wants a private cloud solution as well.
Operator: At this time, we have run out of time for Q&A. I will now hand the call back over to Mark McLaughlin for any closing remarks.
Mark D. McLaughlin: Great. Thanks again for being on the call today. I want to reiterate my appreciation for the hard work of the Palo Alto Networks team in support of all of our customers and partners as we continue to define the next-generation of enterprise security. And we look forward to updating you next quarter. Thanks, everybody.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the presentation for today's conference. You may now all disconnect and have a wonderful day.

Now I'd like to introduce Mark McLaughlin, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Palo Alto Networks. Mark?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Thank you, Maria, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'm happy to be here to discuss Palo Alto Networks' 2013 and fiscal fourth quarter results. 2013 was a very good year for the company with record growth in new customers, revenue, subscription service revenue, penetration of G2000 accounts and the launch of multiple new offerings. During the year, we continued our rapid displacement of legacy network security vendors and enterprise customers across all business verticals around the world. Our lifetime value on our customer base continues to grow quickly, and our focus on customer satisfaction is best in class. In 2013, we continued our aggressive global go-to-market expansion, and we rapidly took share on our large $12 billion addressable market. We continued our investment in R&D, maintaining our clear technology leadership over the competition as we have every year since Palo Alto Networks came to market. We were able to accomplish all these achievements while growing operating income over 50% during the year. I'm proud of the results and even more proud of our team and world-class partners who deliver them. And we're very aware and appreciative of the confidence that our customers place in us each and every day. We have grown such significant rates relative to the market and relative to all of our competitors and we expect to continue to do so because we've established ourselves as the clear leader in next-generation security at the time when enterprises, governments and service providers face increasingly more frequent and sophisticated cyber attacks. These organizations had realized that legacy network security technology cannot protect them and as a result are switching to Palo Alto Networks as a strategic partner in the site. Our growth strategy as we continue to establish our position as the global leader in next-generation security is to continue to rapidly grow our market share and the number of new customers, expand our wallet share within our customer base, leverage our hybrid SaaS revenue model to grow the percentage of business that's recurring and demonstrate increasing operating leverage while investing to capture the significant market opportunities still in front of us. I am proud to report that our performance in our fourth quarter and fiscal 2013 offered clear evidence of our progress in all these areas. Let me start with customer growth. In Q4, we once again added over 1,000 new customers, representing the seventh quarter in a row that we've added over 1,000 customers. For the fiscal year 2013, we added over 4,800 new customers, including leading government organizations, large healthcare organizations, technology leaders and some of the largest Fortune 100 companies in the world and almost always doing so by displacing our competition in the account. And we are honored today to service over 13,500 enterprise customers. Our customer additions are driven by our demonstrable ability to provide substantially better network and cybersecurity solutions than the competition. We expect our customer growth trend to continue. Some examples of customer wins in the fourth quarter include us replacing Check Point as the main firewall in a major semiconductor equipment company in Silicon Valley and replacing Check Point as the data center firewall at a global provider of business software and solutions in the legal, educational and government space. We also replaced Cisco as the data center firewall of one of the largest insurance companies in North America. And we expanded our footprint to the data center of one of the largest European broadcasting companies after landing it with an initial sale in Q1 of fiscal 2013. Also, we beat SourceFire to become the cybersecurity platform at the Asian operations of a Fortune 10 company. Winning new customers is an important part of our growth strategy. Just as important is our expansion capabilities in our existing customer base. As an indicator of our ability to significantly increase wallet share in our customer base, in the fourth quarter, our customer had to spend a minimum of $3.6 million with us in lifetime value to make the top 25 list. This is up from $3.2 million in the fiscal third quarter and $2.1 million at the beginning of fiscal 2013. Our top 25 customers have now purchased over 15.4x their initial purchase compared with 14.1x in the third quarter and 9.5x at the start of fiscal 2013. The combination of our rapid acquisition of new customers and our ability to grow our wallet share within our customer base resulted in another record quarter for Palo Alto Networks. Revenue increased 11% sequentially and 49% year-over-year in Q4 to $112.4 million. Demand was strong across all our major geographies and verticals. Our strong fourth quarter performance capped an impressive year with 55% revenue growth to over $396.1 million. While product sales increased strongly during the fourth quarter in the year, our services revenue grew at an even faster clip, demonstrating our expansion potential into customer base and the power of our hybrid model. As Steffan will articulate in more detail, the rapid adoption of our subscription services is a significant driver in the overall services revenue growth. The attach rate of our subscription services was 1.8 in Q4, up from 1.5 at the end of our second quarter in fiscal 2013. The success of WildFire, which is the market's only detection and prevention cybersecurity offering, is a driver in this trend. Currently, we have more than 2,000 total WildFire customers. Over 630 of them pay for the premium solution, and over 20% of the devices shipped in the fourth quarter included the paid premium version of WildFire. During the quarter, we announced that WildFire is capable of analyzing Android applications to identify advanced threats in Android applications running on smartphones and tablets. In addition to revenue growth, we continue to demonstrate the operating leverage in our model. For fiscal 2013, operating profit grew approximately 50% while EPS grew by 50%. We will continue to make investments in our sales organization and R&D to rapidly capture the significant market opportunity, most of which is still ahead of us. As we enter our fiscal 2014, we are laser focused on our land and expand strategy. Our technology lead remains the foundation of our success, and feedback from the field is that our technological differentiation continues to increase. We plan to continue to widen this gap and expect to introduce new products in 2014, starting with our high-end 100-gig-plus chassis in early calendar 2014. This innovation is important and will allow us to expand our adoption to the data center space as well as to penetrate the service provider space. To summarize, we delivered a strong fourth quarter that capped a very strong fiscal 2013. I'm pleased with our progress in all fronts, and we entered 2014 with good momentum. I'd now like to turn the call over to Steffan for a detailed look at our financial results. Steffan?
Steffan C. Tomlinson: Thank you, Mark, and thank you all for joining us. As we conclude FY '13 and look towards FY '14 and beyond, I'll provide a brief refresher on our hybrid revenue model and highlight the positive impact it's having on the business. Then I'll discuss our results and conclude with guidance. First, our revenue model is comprised of 3 components. The first and largest component is our PA series of appliances and other products. When these products ship, we bill and recognize all the revenue at the time of shipment. The second component is maintenance and support services, which is priced at approximately 16% of the appliance list price per year. The third component is subscription services, which is the recurring SaaS-based revenue element of our business. Currently, we have 4 subscriptions, each priced at 20% of the appliance list price per year. For both maintenance and support and subscription services, we have annual and multiyear options. For either option, we bill the entire amount upfront, and it goes on to the balance sheet and deferred revenues and revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract. All 3 components of our model grew well in fiscal 2013. Product growth was strong in Q4 and the fiscal year, and we expect that to continue in FY '14. Services growth was also strong, and this has had a positive impacts on billings, deferred revenue, the visibility of future revenues and free cash flow. With that context outlined, I'll now turn to our results. In Q4 '13, total revenue grew to a record $112.4 million, an increase of 49% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. For the fiscal year, we reported record revenue of $396.1 million, a 55% increase over the prior year. Our results were driven by our land and expand strategy. The geographic mix of revenue in Q4 was 62% Americas, 22% EMEA and 16% APAC, with all theaters posting growth on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Our revenues were diverse, as we did not have any vertical or any customer concentration. Looking at the different components of revenue in Q4, product revenue was $65.5 million, an increase of 32.4% year-over-year and 7.7% sequentially. Growth was driven by sales of our mid-range 3000 and high-end 5000 PA series of appliances. Our services revenue totaled $46.9 million, an increase of 79.1% year-over-year and 15.9% sequentially. The growth in services revenue can be attributed to strong billings in previous quarters and to the increasing adoption of our subscription services. Services revenue accounted for a 41.8% share of total revenue, which is a 720-basis-point increase year-over-year and 180-basis-point increase sequentially. We expect strong contribution from our services business to continue. Well, of course, there may be some fluctuations in services as a percent of total revenue due to a relative stronger product growth in any given quarter. The support and maintenance revenue component of services in the quarter was $25.3 million, an increase of 85.6% year-over-year and 15.9% sequentially. The renewal rate on maintenance is currently greater than 95%. The recurring subscription component of services revenue in the quarter was $21.7 million, an increase of 72.1% year-over-year and 15.9% sequentially. The renewal rate for our subscription services is currently greater than 85%. As the attach rates for subscriptions increase and the renewal rates for both subscription and maintenance remain high, billings has become an increasingly more meaningful metric for our business. Billings in Q4 were $142.3 million, an increase of 50.1% year-over-year and 7.5% sequentially. To provide some annual insight, billings for FY '13 were $509.5 million and grew 57.4% year-over-year. Product billings were $243.8 million and grew 43% year-over-year, accounting for 48% of total billings. Support billings were $136.2 million and grew 75% year-over-year, accounting for 27% of total billings. Subscription billings were $129.6 million, which grew 71% year-over-year and accounted for 25% of total billings. Additionally, the length of our services contracts has been increasing over time. The dynamics we've outlined for billings naturally impacts deferred revenue. Total deferred revenue in Q4 was $249.2 million, an increase of 83.5% year-over-year and 13.6% sequentially. Short-term deferred revenue was $153.9 million, an increase of 14.9% sequentially. Turning to gross margin. Total non-GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 74.5%, an increase of 260 basis points year-over-year and 40 basis points sequentially. Q4 non-GAAP product gross margin was 75.2%, an increase of 40 basis points year-over-year and 80 basis points sequentially. The sequential increase was primarily due to product mix and cost reductions. And as a reminder, there will be fluctuations in our product gross margin, primarily due to when new appliances are shipped. Q4 non-GAAP services gross margin was 73.5%, up 690 basis points year-over-year and down 20 basis points sequentially. We're pleased with the leverage we're demonstrating in our services business, as evidenced by the year-over-year increase. The sequential decline was primarily due to investments in our customer support organization as we continue to add systems and personnel to accommodate the rapid growth of our customer base. Longer term, provided subscription attach rates continue to increase and renewal rates remain high, it should be a positive tailwind for services margin expansion. Moving on to operating expenses. In Q4, we continue to execute our investment plan of focusing on product development and expanding our sales and go-to-market organization. In Q4, non-GAAP research and development expense was $14.3 million, an increase of $1.5 million from the prior quarter, due in part to headcount additions and project-related expenses. And as a percentage of revenue, R&D expense was 12.8%, an increase of 10 basis points sequentially. Q4 non-GAAP sales and marketing expense was $53 million, an increase of 7.4 million from the prior quarter. The cost drivers in the quarter were primarily due to a very strong end of year performance, which resulted in increased sales commissions and accelerators, as well as increasing our go-to-market headcount prior to the new year in order to get maximum impact on productivity in 2014. As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing was 47.1%, up 210 basis points sequentially and up 20 basis points year-over-year. It is worth noting that all sales and marketing expenses are incurred upfront, but services revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which doesn't match the expenses with the billings in the quarter. Q4 non-GAAP general and administrative expense was $8.7 million, a decrease of $0.6 million from the prior quarter. As a percentage of revenue, it was 7.8%, a decrease of 140 basis points sequentially. While the cost of setting up our international structure decreased in Q4, G&A was impacted by increased expenses related to the IP litigation with Juniper. In total, Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses were $76 million or 67.7% of revenue. Non-GAAP operating margin was 6.8%, up 370 basis points year-over-year and down 40 basis points sequentially. Free cash flow margin was 31.9% compared to 21.6% in Q4 '12, which is a result of the evolution of our model to increasingly higher services components. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for Q4 was 38.7%, and for the fiscal year, it was 40.1%. These rates give effective tax adjustments in Q4 related to the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets and interim tax costs associated with the implementation of our international structure. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was approximately $4.7 million or $0.06 per diluted share using 76.7 million shares, compared with non-GAAP net income of $4.5 million or $0.06 per diluted share in Q3 '13 and non-GAAP net income of $1.9 million or $0.03 per diluted share in Q4 '12. Non-GAAP results for Q4 included $1.4 million of expenses related to IP litigation with Juniper. If we had excluded IP litigation expenses from our non-GAAP results in Q4, then our non-GAAP EPS was $0.07 per diluted share. To provide transparency, on our IR website we provided a supplemental schedule that shows the historical impacts of the IP litigation costs. Beginning in Q1 '14, we'll be excluding the IP litigation expenses from our non-GAAP results and guidance, as we believe the expense is not indicative of the underlying business. For fiscal 2013, we reported non-GAAP net income of $16 million or $0.21 per diluted share compared with non-GAAP net income of $14.7 million or $0.14 per diluted share in fiscal 2012. Non-GAAP results for the fiscal year 2013 included $3.6 million of expenses related to IP litigation, which on a tax effective basis was $0.03 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis for the fourth quarter, net loss was $15.8 million or $0.22 per basic and diluted share compared to Q3 '13 GAAP net loss of $7.3 million or $0.10 per basic and diluted share and a Q4 '12 GAAP net loss of $4.6 million or $0.18 per basic and diluted share. For fiscal year 2013, we reported GAAP net loss of $29.2 million or $0.43 per basic and diluted share, primarily related to a stock-based compensation expense, compared with a net income of $0.7 million or $0.00 per basic and diluted share in fiscal 2012. Turning to the balance sheet. We finished July with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $436.9 million. In Q4, cash flow from operations was $41.7 million, and free cash flow was $35.9 million. Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $5.8 million. For fiscal year 2013, cash flow from operations and free cash flow were $114.5 million and $92.1 million, respectively. In Q4, the accounts receivable balance was $87.5 million, down from the prior quarter balance of $91.5 million. The quality of our receivables remains excellent. Average days sales outstanding were 72 days, up from 71 days last quarter. We are updating our DSO target range to 65 to 75 days, reflecting the changing nature of our revenue stream, as recurring services revenue continue to increase as a percentage of our business. Let me now move to our guidance. In Q1 '14, we expect revenue to be in the range of $118 million to $122 million, which represents 37% to 42% growth year-over-year. In Q1 '14, we expect non-GAAP EPS, excluding the impact of IP litigation expenses, to be approximately $0.07, using 76 million to 78 million shares. I'd also like to highlight a number of points for modeling purposes. While seasonality has been difficult to determine due to our strong growth, we believe that over the longer term, Q2 and Q4 may show our strongest sequential growth in revenues. We expect to increase operating margin throughout the year, exiting Q4 in the low double digits. And we remain on track to achieve our non-GAAP operating margin target of 22% to 25%, exiting Q4 FY 2016. CapEx for FY '14 will be in the range of $45 million to $50 million, with the majority of the spending occurring in the first half of the year. The effective tax rate for FY '14 is anticipated to be in the range of 38% to 40% on a non-GAAP basis. This rate is dependent on a global pretax profit mix. Finally, the share count is expected to increase by approximately 1% per quarter. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss.
Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I was wondering if we could start off on just your guys' view of the macro environment. You talked last quarter about seeing something about a stalling in the purchasing behavior. Maybe you can give us an update on what you guys saw through the end of your fiscal year in that regards.
Mark D. McLaughlin: It's Mark. We think things are looking better across the board in this quarter. You can see that from other companies' reported and ourselves. And I think particularly last quarter, folks were a little worried about what the growth rate of the security market was. And I think it shows this quarter sort of remains very healthy. And I think that's going to continue to grow over time, as far as I can tell. The attention that you've seen in the cybersecurity has been with us a long time. It's with us now, whatever happened in the last quarter, it applies -- it appears to have -- we've moved beyond it, at least in this quarter.
Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Got it. And if I could throw in one follow-up. There's been a lot of rumors, speculations about changes going on in your sales force, changes with sales management. Maybe you can give us an update on what exactly is going on in terms of changes in sales management. And heading into this next fiscal year, are there any big changes in the sales structure, sales comp plan or sales management that we should be expecting heading into FY '14?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Yes. So last quarter, people had asked about the changes in the sales leadership. And as I mentioned last quarter, when Mark Anderson joined us, he's been here more than a year now, he has gone through in the sales leadership ranks. He's made a number of changes to get folks who have the experience to scale very rapidly to $1 billion and beyond. He's got a pretty big appetite for that. We want people to know how to do that. So over the course of the last 6 or 9 months, he's made a number of changes in the leadership team there, which we think have gone very well. All those folks who are on board seem to be gelling very nicely. The team is executing really well. And I think you could see some of that in the -- is coming through in the fourth quarter results.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland with Robert Baird.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I wanted to ask about the major accounting ramp. I think we were at about 40 in F '13. Maybe Mark, if you can talk about how successful that's been and how many account teams you would expect to add in this new fiscal year?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Jason, yes, that's going very well for us. We put a big, big focus on major and global accounts about 18 months ago. I did, and when bringing Mark on board, he adopted that immediately. He knows how to do that from his previous life. And he has done a great job in recruiting for those teams. So we're seeing bigger and bigger deals. We're getting in front of more deals on a global basis. So that's working really well. And particularly, with a really targeted approach into G2000 where the penetration is going up really nicely for us, winning new logos plus, importantly, selling into the accounts we already have. We'll continue to push on that in fiscal '14 and beyond, as -- there's a lot of money in those accounts and around the world. We want to make sure that we're getting more than our fair share.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS.
Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Mark, if you could just give us a sense of how the WildFire 500 appliance are sold in the quarter. I know it was a relatively new joiner to your family. What you're seeing in that trajectory? And I had a quick follow-up.
Steffan C. Tomlinson: Sure. Just as a reminder on WildFire -- when we come to market with WildFire, there's really 3 ways to buy that service. And it's the only detection and prevention service out there. The first and foremost is the cloud offering, which has the most impact because it's got the network effect of all customers seeing from our network perspective what other customers have seen. There was a number of customers who came to us, depending on the verticals and said, "We really liked the WildFire technology, but because of our industry, we have some concerns about sharing those samples into the cloud. So we don't think we can do that." So because of that, we developed the WildFire 500 appliance, which allows for the creation of a private network for those folks -- they could also buy and use it as a standalone appliance, although that's not what we're attempting to get folks to do because those appliances tend to be very expensive -- so that you can get more benefit from going into the private or the public cloud approaches, bang for your buck. So with that kind of background in mind, the WildFire 500 is designed for that private cloud number. But the private cloud folks who are in the verticals have really wanted that capability. And in the quarter we met our expectations and naturally we expect that to be nice for us in the future to serve that part of the market.
Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then maybe for Steffan, on the government you're obviously coming into a critical period here. And I know it's probably too early to call, but what's embedded in your expectations for the current quarter in terms of the government follow-through?
Steffan C. Tomlinson: With the government year end coinciding with our fiscal Q1, we're anticipating to see decent growth in the federal business. And we should participate in the year-end budget flush if there is one.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Dunham with Goldman Sachs.
Gregory Dunham - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Billings again was another very strong quarter and I appreciate the further detail you provided from the mix of billings from product support and subscription. Can you remind us how salespeople are comped and if you think this trend is going to continue, I guess, what are your plans -- the margin target or [indiscernible]?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Greg, it's Mark. So yes, subscription is doing very nicely for us. And that's the reason we wanted to put a little more highlight on that about -- at the end of the year and give kind of a year-over-year view on that. As you can see that it is really powering the business. And we really love that recurring revenue because it goes into the deferred, it gets more visibility into the business. So there's lots of things to like, and it's growing at a very outsized rates. So very happy with the performance of that. We'd expect that to continue over time as well. From a compensation perspective, our sales folks are comped on selling products. You've got to remember that you can't fill a subscription until you get a product in the account, right? So they are primarily comped on putting products into the account, expanding the footprint of products. And in addition to that, they get compensated for services. And the amount of that depends on the term of the contract for which it's sold.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Mark, I'm wondering if you could talk about -- it sounds like you're having some more success in the data center. You gave a couple of examples in the script. And then you have a high-speed product coming in towards the fee beginning next calendar year. Could you talk about maybe what percentage of your sales today are into the data center? How many of those are a primary firewall in the data center and how you expect what you're releasing here in the next 12 months to impact your success rate in that market?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Walter, we're doing really, really well in the data center space, which is great. When we came out with the 5000 series, the adoption rate on that for data center usage was very strong. And you see now -- if you don't know that the 50, 60 runs at 20 gigs right now with full-on, next-gen capabilities. So folks have adopted it very rapidly there. So if we kind of go look back historically, the data center space for us is around the 30-ish percents right now and growing nicely, and we expect that to tick up even more seeing when we came out with the 100-gig chassis, which customers have been saying, "We love everything about this technology and if you can make it faster, we'll love it even more." So we're going to do that. Also, that's an entry point for us into the service provider space. As you know, those guys demand very high throughput devices as well. And we've been working with a lot of those service providers to secure their networks. And now they'd like to work with us with this new appliance to help them secure other people's networks as well because of the throughput capabilities.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And are you generally a primary firewall in the data center or are you -- I know you started out obviously in the perimeter as not a primary firewall, became a primary firewall. What would you say the role is at this point in the data center?
Mark D. McLaughlin: We're winning the vast majority of deals when we go into the data center right now as the primary.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond.
Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: I'm wondering if you could just give us your headcount and also maybe just reiterate what the margin guidance is.
Steffan C. Tomlinson: For headcount, we ended the year at 1,147. And that was an increase from the prior quarter, over 113 heads. And as far as operating margin guidance is concerned, we remain steady towards -- steady progress towards our target model on a non-GAAP basis of 22% to 25%, exiting Q4 FY '16. We had also provided some prepared comments around operating margin expansion within fiscal year '14. And we anticipate exiting Q4 in the double-digit -- low double-digit operating margin. I'll also just take a moment to note that free cash flow is becoming a more meaningful metric to our business as the profile of our billings has been morphing more positively into a hybrid SaaS model. And you can note that free cash flow margin this last quarter was very robust, exceeding 30%.
Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: And this one is a follow-up on the headcount issue. You mentioned the sales adds. What -- the sales management seemed to be stabilizing. But where are you in terms of attrition? Has attrition turns been stable, increasing, decreasing?
Mark D. McLaughlin: We're good on that, Michael. We're better than industry average on attrition. And we manage some folks out over time as folks do, but really, we're doing really well on the market. The winners want to be with the winners, so it's not a hard place to stay.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.
Philip Winslow - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I just got a question on the pricing side. Obviously, there's been a lot made across the market about just how the pricing dynamics are across this quarter firewall next-gen, these add-on services. Just comment, if you could, what you saw this quarter, maybe if you compare that to recent quarters.
Mark D. McLaughlin: Phil, it's Mark. We've maintained for quite some time that we have something really different and unique in the market relative to the legacy competitors. And as a result of that, we've been able to charge a premium price for a long time and that was the same in the last quarter. You can see some of that reflected in our product gross margins, which were up. Discounting is stable. So we were able to power through the competition's reduction of prices in order to make up for shortfalls in technology and expect that's going to continue.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Rob Owens with Pacific Crest Securities.
Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: I guess along the lines of Phil's question around competition, are you seeing more aggressive behavior around customer acquisition, given the massive share gains that you guys are currently seeing? And then also given the discussion right now around APT protection that's out there, where do you think points of differentiation are in this market?
Mark D. McLaughlin: So on the competition front, it's been very competitive for a really long time for us. I can't remember where it hasn't been. So none of that's changed. As we've said in the past, we think that their customers buy primarily for security. They wanted it to [ph] make sense from an enterprise perspective. And then they want to create value. So we nailed all 3 of those value propositions for the customer. And as a result of that, we continue to sell very nice even in the face of the competition, pricing their stuff aggressively, which -- but they've been doing that for a long time now. So it doesn't seem to make much difference. On the APT front, lots of attention, as you know on that. When we think about that, we think about detection and prevention. So the APT angle is in the detection space. Our offering is detection and prevention, which is unique. And the amount of attention that goes into the detection space helps us in -- we are the only folks out there who can do detection and prevention. I think from a differentiation standpoint, the things to watch for are cloud offerings. Can you analyze all files, can you analyze everything application wide instead of just e-mail and web? Can you do that at a very fast speed to make enterprise class performance? And are you going to be able to share, for lack of a better term, what you're seeing in your environment with other folks, that they're seeing in their environments, so you can get the benefit of network effect out there. That's how we base our WildFire offering. We think that's why we're doing so well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I just wanted to understand a little bit about some of your plans to scale the business next year now that you've added about 4,800 customers this year. Can you talk about where you intend to make the investments in the P&L and just trying to support scaling of the enterprise over that timeframe?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Jonathan, well, it's kind of a both category thing, which is we've added over 4,800 customers last year. We would anticipate the ability to continue to add customers at a very rapid clip. So in customer acquisition, obviously, we'd be investing from a sales and marketing perspective. And then also in servicing those customers as well, we're making continued investments into the services organization to do that. Running -- we're running a world-class services organization here today, and we intend to keep in front of that because we know that you don't have -- customers don't purchase things. As you can see from our expansion in LTV [ph] and wallet share, customers appear to be very happy and buying a lot. And we want to keep them that way, so we keep making investments there. It probably goes unsaid, but I'll say it anywhere. You have the rest of the company out there, right, supporting the point of the spear. We have to continue to invest in this company to maintain this very rapid growth performance services for our customers, internal customers, external customers in a world-class manner, so we'll be doing that as well.
Steffan C. Tomlinson: One additional follow-on point, Jonathan, is relative to scaling the business, we are looking to get operating leverage out of sales and marketing over time. When you look at FY '14, this will be the first year where a percentage of ramped versus ramping heads eclipses one another. So the percentage of ramped heads are higher than the ramping heads in FY '14. And so we should be starting to get more leverage in the business in sales and marketing.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gray Powell with Wells Fargo.
Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: On the WildFire products, specifically the appliance side, how do you see that impacting your addressable market? And then do you think that WildFire and similar products could potentially cannibalize traditional IPS offerings over time?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Yes. That's a fair question, Gray. So I think it's unclear right now still where the addressable market is coming from, from a wallet perspective for the things that are going on in the detection space around APT. I've heard a lot of folks think that, that might be IPS budget, maybe it's a new budget. For us, we've been winning in the IPS market with our threat prevention for a very long time, so we know how to do that. If that budget is shifting into the APT market, it's good for us. We continue to take the IPS budget, and we'll take that budget as well. If it's new budget, then it's additive. So -- but the win rates are very high and we like the fact that the addressable market is big, even though it may not be exactly clear yet where that might come from.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Schwartz with Jefferies.
Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: I had a follow-up question on WildFire. You gave -- I know you're giving the metrics on the total sort of customer count there as well as the paid customer count. On the paid side, is that primarily new customers coming into Palo Alto? Are you actually seeing conversion of sort of existing customers on the paid WildFire version?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Aaron, it's actually both. So we're doing nicely in both. A lots of new customers are buying the service when they're buying the products for the first time. And then with that large of an installed base, the folks who are using the free services are fantastic place to go mine and upsell them to the paid for service. So we like the results in both categories.
Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then a quick follow-up question maybe for Steffan. On the deferred revenue, I know it's very minor, but the mix shift, it ticked a little bit to the shorter term, and you had been seeing a trend of multi-year service engagements. I would have thought that would have been a little bit concentrated towards your Q4. Was there anything to read into there? I know the mix shift between short and long term and I know that that was just a very modest shift there, but it can shift back towards short term.
Steffan C. Tomlinson: Every quarter, there's going to be fluctuations between the short-term deferred and long term deferred revenue growth. If you look at long-term deferred revenue growth on an annual basis, it grew north of 90% year-over-year. So we're very happy with that. The length of the services contracts has been increasing over time, but there will be some fluctuation.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we only have time for 2 more questions. Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz.
Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Mark, just wondering if you can comment on the linearity in the quarter. And then Steffan, there was a fairly large increase in CapEx that was guided for fiscal '14. I know some of that is due to the relocation of your headquarters. I was just wondering if you could put a finer point on the nature of the increase versus '13.
Mark D. McLaughlin: Gregg, on the linearity basis, we saw a back end-loaded quarter as we would expect, particularly at the end of the year. As we're getting bigger, we see more and more of that going to the back end of the quarter, but not in line with what you'd expect across the industry.
Steffan C. Tomlinson: And from a CapEx standpoint, we did guide $45 million to $50 million in annual CapEx. We're assuming roughly, call it $5 million to $7 million per quarter in typical CapEx. And then we have a couple of discrete projects that we're working on. The biggest one is the move to our new facility. And from a timing standpoint in putting a finer point on it, in the first half of the fiscal year, we'll be spending the majority of the $45 million to $50 million as we conclude the move to the new facility. So hopefully that gives you a little bit more insight.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: My question is actually a follow-up on the previous question about quarter linearity and understanding. I'd like to understand if you have information on how much of this quarter growth -- sequential growth is attributed to the weakness last quarter. When I look at April the previous years, I see pretty robust growth. And last quarter was much weaker, which I believe is the macro. But how much of the growth this quarter, in the July quarter, is reversion to the mean, and that means that the growth going forward may be slower than what we are seeing now? So maybe you can speak about what you've seen this quarter that is spillover from previous quarter or whether it's the macro that is driving it.
Mark D. McLaughlin: Tal, it's Mark. A couple of things, I guess. The first is, last quarter we did mention a number of deals that had slipped to the right of -- we closed the majority of those already, which is great. On the macro side, we discussed that in EMEA last quarter, both of those did really well for us in the fourth quarter, so that's great as well. I think the rest of the industry has done pretty decently, so that maybe the concern about macro and security growth slowing down seems to be an aberration. So I put a lot of perspective and say, we grew very, very nicely, 8% sequentially, 55% for the year. We think we're going to maintain some very respectable growth as we look forward, and doing a hell lot better than all the rest of the competition. So we're pretty confident that we've got a really good baseline here for growth.
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Zeller with Needham & Company.
Scott Zeller - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Just a question about sales cycle, if you could. As you're increasingly being considered as the primary firewall on accounts, what does that do to the length of sales cycles since it's probably more often that you're considered a replacement for a competitor? Any commentary about changes in sales cycles?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Sales cycles have been being fairly steady for us for quite some time because we're always proposing our technology as a firewall. And more and more and more -- much more than majority of the time, it's being adopted as the firewall. So there can be some very long sales cycles and some really big deals. And then there can be really short ones, where we are literally selling a lot over the phone here. When we look at that on the aggregate, we said in the past sales cycles is up 90 days or so, and that seems to be the case as we go forward.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark McLaughlin, CEO, for closing remarks.
Mark D. McLaughlin: Thanks, operator. Thanks, everybody, for being on the call today. I want to reiterate my appreciation for all of the hard work of the Palo Alto Networks team, support of our customers and partners as we continue to revolutionize the cybersecurity market. Thanks for all our shareholders as well. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Third Quarter 2013 Palo Alto Networks Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Taheesha, and I'll be operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Maria Riley, Investor Relations with The Blueshirt Group. Please proceed.
Maria Riley: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Palo Alto Networks' fiscal third quarter 2013 financial results. This call is also being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed on the Investor section of the Palo Alto Networks website at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. With me on today's call are Mark McLaughlin, Palo Alto Networks' Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Steffan Tomlinson, Chief Financial Officer.

We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in the Investors section of our website located at investors.paloaltonetworks.com. Now I'd like to introduce Mark McLaughlin, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Palo Alto Networks. Mark?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Thank you, Maria, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. In our third fiscal quarter, we saw good revenue growth of 54% year-over-year, surpassing $100 million per quarter for the first time in our history despite challenging macroeconomic conditions, particularly in the federal vertical in Europe. During the quarter, we had strong gross margin improvement, achieved non-GAAP EPS of $0.06 per share and grew deferred revenues by 17% sequentially. Also in the third quarter, we continued to demonstrate that we are aggressively capturing market share against all of our competitors and establishing Palo Alto Networks as the global leader in the next-generation enterprise network security. This is the case because while security is not immune to macroeconomic factors, it is increasingly critical to enterprises. Threat landscape is not getting any better and it seems nearly impossible to pick up the paper without reading a story about a criminal organization hacking into ATMs, or possible foreign government-sponsored attempts to steal secrets from large companies. In this environment, our leadership position is driven by our high-value disruptive technology, which we believe provides the highest level of security available in the market. We now have over 12,500 customers using our next-generation security platform, and our customer acquisition has continued for the sixth consecutive quarter at a pace of over 1,000 new customers added during the quarter. In addition to landing new customers, we also continue to grow our revenue with the installed customer base by expanding our device footprint through the enterprise and extending our value to customers with multiple services on the devices. One view of our success in implementing this strategy is the lifetime value of our customers. For example, during the quarter, the lifetime value of our top 25 customers averaged 14.1x their initial purchase. This is up substantially from 11.4x last quarter. And to make the top 25 list in the third quarter, a customer had to spend a minimum of $3.2 million with us, which is up from $2.8 million last quarter. This metric illustrates our ability to capture more wallet share once we penetrated an account. Some specific examples of the success of our land, expand and extend strategy in the third quarter, include us closing a seven-figure deal with a very large industrial manufacturer in the United States, in which we beat Check Point and replaced Juniper as the new [indiscernible] firewall. This deal also includes the paid-for WildFire service as part of the offering. Also, we post a seven-figure data center firewall deal with one of the largest banks in Japan, where we replaced Cisco. In addition, we closed a large perimeter firewall deal with the leading German cable company, in which we beat Check Point in functionality and performance. And we also continued our expansion strategy into one of North America's largest financial services companies where we started in mid-2011 and where we now have replaced all Check Point firewalls in our network perimeter. The reason why we're able to win so many new customers and expand so significantly within our customer base is that our technology is fundamentally different than all of our competitors, and this differentiation continues to grow. Customer traction has been significant across all of our new products and services. In the third quarter, our PA-3000 series sold very well, as expected. And we now have more than 1,700 customers using our WildFire service, up from 1,200 from last quarter, with the attachment rate on the paid version of that service comfortably in the double digits in just 5 months from launch]. In addition, next week, we'll start the marketing campaign for the WildFire 500 appliance, a key new element of our WildFire cybersecurity offering that implements on-premise APT detection as a private cloud service for use by customers that cannot share data in public clouds. We will continue to aggressively distance ourselves from the competition as we further extend our technology lead. Looking forward, while the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, we enter the fourth quarter with a strong pipeline and competitive momentum. Our land, expand and extend strategy continues to fuel our growth. And we're pleased to have reported a strong third quarter of growth, continued strong new customer acquisition, accelerating repeat buying from our installed base and increasing operating leverage. I'm also delighted to welcome Carl Eschenbach, President of VMware, to our Board of Directors. Carl's experience and expertise is highly valued and we look forward to his input and his advice. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steffan for a more detailed look at our financial results. Steffan?
Steffan C. Tomlinson: Thank you, Mark, and thank you, all, for joining us today. I'll first review our results for Q3 '13 and then conclude with our outlook for Q4 '13. In Q3, total revenue grew to $101.3 million, an increase of 54.2% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Looking at our 2 main components of revenue, in Q3, product revenue of $60.8 million grew 39.7% year-over-year and decreased 1.9% sequentially. The sequential decrease was primarily in Europe and in our federal vertical. Services revenue of $40.5 million, which represented 40% of total revenue, grew 82.6% year-over-year and 17.2% sequentially, driven in part by an increase in the attach rates of our subscription services. This growth in services revenue underscores the power of our hybrid revenue model. The geographic mix of revenue was 62% Americas, 23% EMEA, and 15% APAC, with all theaters posting growth on a year-over-year basis. On a sequential basis, Americas and APAC posted solid growth, while EMEA declined by approximately 4% following 2 quarters of 23% sequential growth for both Q1 '13 and Q2 '13. Total non-GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 74.1%, ahead of our target range of 70% to 73%. Non-GAAP gross margin increased 220 basis points year-over-year and 190 basis points sequentially. Putting a finer point on gross margin, Q3 non-GAAP product gross margin was 74.3%, an increase of 70 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points sequentially. The sequential increase was primarily due to cost reductions and product mix. Our non-GAAP service gross margin was 73.7%, up 510 basis points year-over-year and up 360 basis points sequentially. The sequential increase was primarily due to increasing services as a percentage of total revenue and higher attach rates for our subscription services, as well as leveraging our customer service organization. Having added over 1,000 end customers in the quarter, we'll continue to invest in customer support and services gross margins will fluctuate depending on the timing of the investment ramp of our service organization. Moving on to operating expenses. Q3 non-GAAP research and development expense was $12.9 million, a decrease of $0.7 million from the prior quarter, due in part to the timing of expenditures related to certain projects. As a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP R&D expense was 12.7%, down 130 basis points sequentially. Q3 non-GAAP sales and marketing expense was $45.6 million, an increase of $3.7 million from the prior quarter, due to the addition of quota carrying headcount and commission-related expenses. As a percentage of revenue, it was 45%, an increase of 160 basis points sequentially. Q3 non-GAAP general and administrative expense was $9.3 million, an increase of $1.5 million from the prior quarter or 9.1% as a percentage of revenue, up 110 basis points sequentially. G&A was impacted by expenses related to setting up our international corporate structure, ERP implementation and litigation costs. In total, Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses were $67.7 million, an increase of $4.6 million from the prior quarter, or 66.8% of revenue, up 140 basis points sequentially. Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 7.2%, an increase of 40 basis points sequentially. The sequential improvement this quarter can be primarily attributed to the gross margin improvement. As we stated previously, given our leading position in the market and the fact that we're growing revenue at a much higher rate than both the market and our competitors, our goal is to continue to invest while growing operating margin in a slow and steady manner, noting there may be near-term fluctuations in operating margin. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for this quarter was 38.5%. This rate will continue to fluctuate throughout the fiscal year, as it's dependent on our global pretax profit mix and potential discrete events, such as the removal of our domestic valuation allowance. Non-GAAP net income for Q3 was approximately $4.5 million or $0.06 per diluted share using 78 million shares. And this compares to non-GAAP net income of $3.9 million or $0.05 per diluted share in fiscal Q2 '13, and non-GAAP net income of $4.7 million or $0.07 per diluted share in fiscal Q3 '12. On a GAAP basis, net loss was $7.3 million or $0.10 per basic and diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet. We finished April with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $391.5 million. In Q3, cash flow from operations was $15.2 million, free cash flow was $8.8 million and free cash flow margin was 8.7%. While cash flow from operations and free cash flow were impacted by the quarter's linearity, deferred revenue and billings grew strongly, giving us increased visibility on future cash flows. Capital expenditures in the quarter were within our anticipated range of $5 million to $10 million and totaled $6.4 million. As I mentioned previously, in fiscal 2014, we'll see an increase of approximately $10 million to $12 million in CapEx related to the relocation of our headquarters facility. Most of this increase will be in fiscal Q1 of 2014. The annual operating expense starting in FY '14 for this new facility will be approximately $13 million for the year. We ended Q3 with $91.5 million of accounts receivable, up from the Q2 '13 balance of $68.6 million. The quality of our accounts receivables is excellent. Average days sales outstanding were 71 days, up from 58 days last quarter, reflecting both a back end-loaded quarter and a higher mix of subscription and multiyear deals. Moving down the balance sheet, total deferred revenue was $219.3 million, an increase of 88% year-over-year and 16.5% sequentially. Short-term deferred revenue was $134 million, an increase of 14.1% sequentially. We're continuing to see an uptick in multiyear deals. Billings were $132.4 million, an increase of 56.8% year-over-year and 6.5% sequentially. Let me now turn to our guidance for Q4 '13. We expect revenue to be in the range of $106 million to $110 million, which equates to 40% to 45% year-over-year growth, and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be approximately $0.06 per share using 78 million to 80 million shares on a diluted basis. While we're mindful of the current macroeconomic uncertainty, we're continuing to invest in product development, sales and go-to market functions, as well as discrete projects and G&A and have factored all this into our guidance for Q4. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to open the Q&A session.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Dunham from Goldman Sachs.
Gregory Dunham - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I guess I wanted to start on the macro and try to get a sense of how much that was an impact on the business. Revenue growth was 54% versus your closest peers that are flattish to down 20% or close to 20% in this quarter. So clearly, a strong outperformance there, but I just want to get a sense of, do you feel that you guys are more sensitive to some of the macro shifts going on in terms of the growth numbers? How much did they play a role in terms of this quarter? And can you talk about the trend in the quarter? You mentioned it was a back-end loaded quarter. Can you talk about how it progressed throughout the quarter and maybe what you've seen thus far this month?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Hi Greg, it's Mark. Let me take those in a couple of parts. So the first thing is, I think there's no doubt that it's a challenging market right now and we're seeing that as our quarter progress, for us, we saw that play out towards the end of the quarter than the beginning of the quarter, as sentiments sort of changed beyond -- I'll call it on a big picture basis. I think you're correct. You noted that other folks have seen this as well and had some underperformance. Despite that, we grew 5% sequentially, 54% year-over-year, so we're pleased with that in light of those macro economic conditions. Particularly for us though, the areas where we saw the impact around that were really in Europe, specifically in Central and Southern Europe, and then in the fed sector, with the continued sequestration. So in those cases, we saw -- in each one of those cases, we saw a few million dollars worth of deals in each one of those sectors getting pushed, deals that we'd be select for, but getting pushed to the right and we saw that occur as the month -- as the quarter played itself out. So I think it's no doubt that it's a tough environment out there. But given all that, we're pretty pleased with where we ended up.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from UBS.
Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Just a follow-on federal, just in terms of what you're seeing in the back half of the year, are you getting any more sense in terms of how those budgets are coming together? And just a quick follow-up on Europe, did you believe that's more macro, or is there anything you're seeing from a execution or competitive issue?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Yes, so let me start with the second one, Brent, just big picture. On a competitive basis, we haven't seen any change in the competitive market except us continuing to pull ahead, and I think the results show that, our results relative to everybody else in this sector. We've done very well, particularly in a relative basis, so we're not seeing that at all, not in Europe or anywhere else. On the fed side of it, the sequestration thing is real. This is the first quarter anybody's had to live through that. And on a second half, from a second half of the year basis, I would expect that sequestration would last through at least at the end of the fiscal fed year, which is at the end of October. There's really no reason to believe at this point that that's going to change. I think that will be with us through at least that long.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits from Raymond James.
Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Two questions. First, again, when we look at the guide for next quarter, which is a little bit below consensus, what's in that guide in terms of your assumptions regarding both fed and Europe? In other words, is that the source of the lower number there that you continue to expect those to be weak? And also just wondering if you could comment on the deferred, which was actually particularly strong as I calculate your billings all in. I know some of it came from long term but still grew faster than revenues, were there any rev-rec issues where you would declare more than expected?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Michael, so on the -- from the guide perspective, I think we have to assume that the sequestration continues, like I just said, so we'll take that into account. And then on the Europe side, I don't think there's any reason to believe right where we're sitting today that the sentiment over there is going to change in any big picture regard from what we saw, I think, particularly towards the tail end of our quarter. So we're thinking about those 2 things in particular as we look forward. So we're cautiously optimistic. The guide does provide a 5% to 8-point-something% sequential growth and 40% to 45% on a year-over-year basis, but we have taken those things into account as we look forward. I'll let Steffan take the second question.
Steffan C. Tomlinson: On the deferred revenue piece, if anything, it underscores the power of our hybrid revenue model. We've been selling lots of subscriptions, the attach rates have been going up. We've had very nice traction with WildFire. And when you look at the mix between short and long-term deferred, short-term deferred revenue grew 14.1% sequentially, long-term deferred revenue grew 20.6% sequentially. And that long-term deferred, there's no rev-rec issue in there, it's just more -- we've seen an uptick in multiyear deals, which is a big vote of confidence from our customer base who are designing us into their networks for a long period of time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Just wanted to get a better sense of some of the deals that maybe got pushed out. Would you expect those to subsequently get potentially recognized this quarter or do you feel like there's just going to be sort of an increasing rate-captious environment throughout the rest of the year?
Mark D. McLaughlin: That's a good question, Jonathan. So for the deals that we saw that got pushed to the right there in those 2 sectors, our situations where we technically won, the customer wants Palo Alto. So we're confident that ultimately, we're going to get these deals. The win is a little harder to gauge because, like I said, the sentiment hasn't changed. Or if it does change, maybe that helps us. But we would expect it, at some point, we get these deals. But it's just really hard to say whether we get in the fourth quarter, Q1. I just really can't nail that down right now.
Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: Got it. And just in terms of your overall pipeline, are you taking -- with the guidance a more cautious approach or across-the-board, or does this reflect only sort of concerns in the fed and Europe ongoing?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Well, 2 separate things there. So from a pipe perspective, we've got a strong pipe as we come into the fourth quarter. We had a strong pipe coming into the third quarter as well. But we got a nice pipeline as we came into the fourth quarter. I think for us, where we particularly saw things, like we said, was in those sectors -- those 2 places in Europe and the fed space, I think there's a general matter, there's macroeconomic concern. Maybe it's stemming from those 2 sectors, not really sure. But as a general matter, it feels like there's a macro concern. But for us, that's where we particularly saw the impacts.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.
Melissa Gorham - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: This is Melissa Gorham calling in for Keith Weiss. I know that you mentioned federal being weak, but was there any other verticals that came in below expectations? I know some of your peers have cited the service provider segment being sort of weak in the March quarter, and I know that it's relatively smaller for you all. But just wondering if you saw weakness there as well?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Service provider is a much, much smaller vertical for us than a lot of our peers in there, so we saw a little bit of softness there. But it's a rounding error in absolute dollar terms. So I'd say it was consistent with what other people saw, but it's just not nearly as impactful for us as other folks. In other places, we saw really good growth, so like in the -- not in the federal space, but in the state and local government education space, we saw very nice increase sequentially in that space. So it's really, there were puts and takes across all the verticals. But the 2 that we were impactful to us really were the Europe and fed.
Melissa Gorham - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, great. And then previously, you've cited an attach rate of 1 -- 1.5 subscriptions per appliance. Was there any change to that in the quarter? And where do you see that going over the next year or so?
Steffan C. Tomlinson: The attach rate did increase; we're not giving specific numbers on the attach rate. We're going to be doing that on an annual basis, anchored around our Analyst Day. And at the last Analyst Day, we said it was right around 1.6 for the prior quarter. So you can expect, and I would say, it's a reasonable expectation that as we add more subscription services, like a WildFire, we should be able to see growth in that attach rate.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow from Credit Suisse.
Harris Heyer: It's Harris Heyer. I'm calling on behalf of Phil. I was hoping you could comment on the price environment just in general versus the last couple quarters.
Mark D. McLaughlin: We actually haven't seen much change in price environment. The things that we've said in the past is that the competition has been, for quite some time, continues to be aggressive on pricing. That's expected, I think, when we have the, we believe, the superior technology. That's a card that they can play. We've been looking at that for quite some time and have extremely high win rates against all the competition. That hasn't changed, so we didn't see any impact in that.
Steffan C. Tomlinson: One other thing, Harris is our product gross margins have increased sequentially. And that demonstrates the value of the differentiated technology that we're bringing to the table.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays.
Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Quick one, if I look at the run rate, it looks a touch lower than we have modeled and potentially what you thought given the reasons you discussed? And will that cause any change in the -- thinking in terms of investment on the build-out of distribution capabilities or the company as a whole?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Ray, the answer the short answer is no. We're taking a very long view here on the business, and our goal has been and we've demonstrated the ability to grow the business way ahead of the market growth and way ahead of any of the competition. So we view this as a market share gain opportunity for us and we intend to be aggressive about that]. You have -- might have a quarter where you have some tough macro conditions and other ones there won't be that way, so we're taking a long approach on that. So we'll continue to invest, we'll invest aggressively. And as long as we're able to post significant market share gains, we'll keep on doing that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Owens from Pacific Crest Securities.
Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Wondering if you can provide some color on just what your renewal rate on these subscriptions have looked like and how that's been trending over the last couple of quarters?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Renewal rates in general have been very robust. From a subscription standpoint, they vary by length of time that the subscription has been out. So WildFire is our newest one obviously, and we just started selling that. But threat prevention in URL filtering have been around the longest. They have the highest attach rates and the renewals on those are very high. We haven't gotten to specifics on what the exact renewal rates are but they're very robust. And then, the renewal rates on maintenance is extremely high. You can't really have -- you can't see the position that we're in -- in customers not renewing their maintenance because you need to have access to the updates and the upgrades that come through on the support side of the house.
Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: So if I -- kind of not the maintenance side but the subscription side, just drilling in a little bit. I mean, is this consistent with where other people would put blade renewals, since you're not giving specific comments? Or is it in excess of some of those kind of industry numbers that we see out there?
Mark D. McLaughlin: I would say it's either consistent or slightly better than what a typical blade renewal would be.
Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: And then number two, with the new facility, I think you said annual operating expenses of $13 million a year, is that an incremental $13 million or was that a total number?
Mark D. McLaughlin: It is a total number. But it is incremental because it's a new facility. And we had flagged that back in October when we let everyone know that we had the facility, that we leased it. So that's not new news, it's just putting a finer point on it for you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen.
Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: It sounded as though things really did tail off at the end of the quarter. And as we're essentially wrapping up the month of May, just wondering if you had any anecdotal commentary on how this past month has perhaps compared to the month of April. Would you kind of characterize it as status quo or has it sort of gotten a little bit better or a little worse? Just curious if you had any color there.
Mark D. McLaughlin: Gregg, we did see as the last quarter tailed off the sentiment was changing or eroding as the quarter progressed. We thought about that as we looked forward in the guide and from a month of May perspective. May is where we thought it would be right about now, sort of from a linearity perspective, so we're on track with where we thought we'd be and in line with the guide given.
Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. And then Steffan, how many heads did you add in the prior quarter? And going forward, should we still expect roughly 75 to 100 per quarter?
Steffan C. Tomlinson: Last quarter, we added 85 heads with a ending headcount of 1,034. And the net additions of 85 are right in line of the range of 75 to 100, which we've been talking about. There could be fluctuations, both on the top end and the bottom end, but as a directional guide that's consistent with what we said before.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Zeller from Needham & Company.
Scott Zeller - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: I wanted to ask about the evolution of deals and maybe the size of deals that you're competing for. Is there any change in the field that you're seeing where perhaps there are fewer opportunities that are point around application control, and perhaps they're larger -- sort of like a network security refresh-type project that would be more complex and take a longer cycle. Is this happening in the field?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Generally what we've seen from a deal perspective is the continued realization from customers that the staple inspection technology they've been riding on for a long time just doesn't cut it anymore because of the explosion of applications. So it's really the basis of the application technology we have here and that's driving the continued growth and interest in the company. And as more and more customers realize it -- that that is something they need. So actually, Mark Anderson is sitting right here with me, so I'll turn that over to him to see if he can add any more color on that. Mark?
Mark F. Anderson: Thanks, Mark. And Scott, so I'm just amazed continuing what I see from customers in terms of how receptive they are to our technology. We did see some cautious spending, primarily in Europe and certainly saw some projects get pushed in federal. But really I think the worst thing that we saw was large quantity deals. Maybe 8-unit deals were cut down to 4-unit deals. So it cut down our overall PO size, but we really didn't lose any business and I don't think our proposition has ever been stronger than it is today.
Scott Zeller - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: I guess just a follow-up on that. Are you saying that the average scope of a deal is larger and more complex than previously?
Mark D. McLaughlin: What we're seeing is, is that -- well, there's a number of factors you pay attention to. They're all positive, of course. What we're seeing is, is that we're better known, and generally, and what our value proposition is, we get to see larger deals at first as opposed to smaller deals that build over time. So we get to see bigger deals, we're running bigger deals. And then with our existing customers as well, the repeat buying patterns, as I noted in the top 25, continue at an accelerating pace, which is great, which means our follow-on orders get to be bigger as they rely on us more across their enterprise.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Schwartz from Jefferies.
Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Probably a question for Steffan. But with the deferred revenue outperformance here over the last couple of quarters, I know we talked about this historically, but it does seem like the revenue mix should change a little bit here going forward with the higher mix on services. Is that sort of a fair statement as we build out our models a little further out? And then secondly, with the trend in multiyear deals that you've seen, presumably, there is a pull forward in cash flow there, do you have any sort of directional trend of how cash flow should look next year?
Steffan C. Tomlinson: On a higher mix of services going forward, you can see just in terms of how revenues have played out. This quarter, services as a percentage of total revenue was 40%, last quarter, it was 35.8%. I don't expect to see that type of sequential increase in the near term. The fact that we are], call it 5% to 10% penetrated in the largest accounts, we expect to be selling a lot more boxes. And so with that as a dynamic, we should see nice growth in both product and services. But with the subscriptions that we are selling, the attach rates are going up. And directionally, services as a percentage of total revenue, should be increasing, but I would just caution to say, it's not going to be increasing, it shouldn't be increasing at the same rate it did over the last quarter. And as far as future visibility on cash flows is concerned, we are seeing an uptick in the multiyear deals. All of our deals that are multi-year in nature are build upfront, the cash is collected upfront. So that will be a benefit to cash flows. We're not guiding on free cash flow or cash flow from operations, but we certainly should be seeing a benefit to cash flows. How much that is, we're not going to be getting to the specifics.
Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: A quick follow-up, if I could. Are there any concessions in the multiyear deals?
Steffan C. Tomlinson: On the multiyear deals, there is a discount for multi-year and that's kind of in line with industry practice.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Cummins from B. Riley.
Daniel T. Cummins - B. Riley Caris, Research Division: I'll actually ask a follow-on to the last question before I get to what I wanted to ask about. I'm curious if the over performance on gross margin -- is that helped at all by being a little bit short in federal or in any large deals in any region in particular?
Steffan C. Tomlinson: The over performance on gross margin had very little to do with being off on federal or EMEA. The over performance on gross margin was really driven by the -- both line items. When you look at the product gross margin, we had nice cost reduction and favorable product mix. And on the services side of the house, we had a benefit from higher attach rates and those were the primary drivers as a basket. And it really had nothing to do with being light in federal or Europe.
Daniel T. Cummins - B. Riley Caris, Research Division: Okay. I wonder -- maybe it'd be helpful, I think some of us on the call tend to view some of your peers, at least right now in the current era, as maybe 2 or 3 stories. When we look at commercial businesses versus federal business versus global or EMEA business, are you able to tell us a little bit more about your growth rate, your all-in growth rate in commercial markets? And just helping us kind of isolate some of these temporary effects, modeling-wise, I think would be helpful. And also curious if there were any 10% customers for the quarter? I'm struck by -- a lot of companies said, "Well, things got very weak in March." And you had an April quarter, you had DSOs that were very, very high. So I'm just trying to reconcile all that.
Mark D. McLaughlin: Let me try to work through that. So first, the easiest one is there are no 10% customers in the business, so hasn't been, wasn't last quarter. So that's not a factor at all around this.
Daniel T. Cummins - B. Riley Caris, Research Division: And does that include federal?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Yes it does. We had mentioned before, no vertical at all represents more than 13% of our business. It's a pretty well-diversified business, right? That's a general statement. The first part of your question, I'd say, specifically, what we saw in, like I said in Central and Southern Europe and then fed as well, in each of those situations, we saw a few to $4 million in each one of those deals that we push out of the quarter. So that is the majority of the impact from where we expected to be to where we landed, and that's not broader than that across the entire market for us. So as I said a little earlier, in the number of verticals, we saw very good sequential growth across verticals. We hadn't broken a lot of those down, not because they're unimportant. Just as I said there's no single vertical that represents more than 13% of the business. So there were puts and takes and a lot of verticals generally, generally strong, generally good quarter except in those 2 places.
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up question from Jonathan Ho from William Blair.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Just wanted to ask about the linearity of legal expenses. Would you expect the legal expenses to peak around now during the discovery phase? Or should we expect it to move up or move down over the next several quarters?
Steffan C. Tomlinson: Thanks, Jonathan. This is Steffan. We expect that legal expenses will increase as we have get closer to trial. So we're largely through the discovery phase and that did come at a cost. But as we've said previously, as you approached trial, which is scheduled for February of next year, legal costs related to Juniper will be increasing.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shebly Seyrafi from FBN Securities.
Shebly Seyrafi - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division: Can you quantify your government or federal exposure? I think in the past, it was around mid-teens percentage of revenue, EMEA is around 23%. So it looks like combined, you're faced with headwinds from segments consisting of basically 40% of revenues. I think this last -- through the end of the October quarter. Can you talk about whether you agree with that, that the October quarter itself is going to have a lot of challenges, particularly related to the U.S. federal? And then, what are the catalysts to look out for over the next few quarters to cover some of these forces you're faced with?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Shebly, its Mark. So I'll take that in 3 parts, if I can. The first part is, just to make sure we're all talking about the same facts and figures, EMEA represents, in the last quarter, 23% of our revenues, so that's Europe, Middle East and Africa. What we're saying from a sales perspective, what we saw in Europe is not that percentage. We saw, like I said, about $3 million or $4 million in -- mixed between Central and Southern Europe from a sales perspective, from weaker than where we thought it would be. So I just want to put that all in context. On the federal side of our business, we said no vertical is more than 13% of our business in total. Fed for us is a high single-digit percentage revenue vertical for us, so put that in the context as well. So all that said, it's nowhere -- what you were saying, it is nowhere near 40% of revenue the way you just described it. The second thing on the sequestration in October, specifically the federal government, they're on a fiscal year that ends in October, so my guess is that we probably wouldn't see anything change in sequestration. I don't see any event that would dictate a change prior to the end of that fiscal year. It could go longer than that, but I think it would go at least until October. And then on the driver side, the drivers for us are generally -- continue to be very positive, meaning customers really like our value proposition, the differentiation of our technology. Security is a really big deal and getting to be a really deal every day of the week when you see constantly stuff going on. And cybersecurity around that all plays to our favor. So I think that the macro trends for us are very, very favorable about what we do for a living and at the time we do it.
Steffan C. Tomlinson: And let's not forget, we're growing much faster than the market and our competitors. So we're going to continue that path.
Operator: Your next question comes of the line of Gray Powell from Wells Fargo.
Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Just had a couple here. So how should we think about the market opportunity with WildFire, particularly now that you have an appliance available? And then do you see that product cannibalizing the traditional antivirus market longer term?
Mark D. McLaughlin: So generally -- so look, if we back up for a minute say WildFire is meant to serve the market. It's dealing with detection and prevention of advance persistent threat, which is a very big deal today. And there's a lot of concern about that. So we think that's great, that's good opportunity for us and it's incremental opportunity for us, as people are spending on that, which kind of goes to your second question, which is, it's a little hard to tell where the budgets are coming from in there. They could be coming from antivirus, it could be coming from IPS, some of them could be new budgets. I'm not sure anybody really knows that yet other than that there's a good amount of money being spent on that today. And we're very well-positioned with WildFire, with the cloud service, a private cloud service and now an appliance as well, take after our fair share of that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Ives from FBR.
Daniel H. Ives - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Look a lot of questions I'm getting from account. I guess I just wanted to basically know, do you think -- I mean that in some of these larger deals, obviously, you guys carved out a great next-gen firewall product. But in some of these larger deals it's tougher as you guys get into some of these sort of end-to-end deals? I mean, is that accurate, not to mischaracterization?
Mark D. McLaughlin: I think that's secure -- network security has been for a long time, and I think it will continue to be well into the future, a fairly discrete line item from a purchase perspective. I know, I mean -- what I'm saying is, I know there are other providers out there that are network providers that have a broader suite of services than we do, because they have networking services and network security services. The buyers of these things don't -- they don't think that way about this. And that is becoming more pronounced with the worst situation with cybersecurity and all these threats. They're coming in our networks. So I think it's a very hard sale, if you're a network service provider, to say, "take my so-so network security product because you're buying my networking gear." They're just different buyers and the level of interest around that is off the charts. You just can't get by with that anymore. You got to buy the best stuff.
Daniel H. Ives - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Okay then, as a sort of follow-up, do you feel like competitors, such as Check Point, that they have maybe we'll say, a year ago sort of took the eye of the ball from a competition standpoint. But you've seen more fierce competition, some of the bake-offs maybe then you saw a year ago now that they've kind of aggressively focused on this area of the market?
Mark D. McLaughlin: No, I think -- well, a couple of things. The first is just from a technology differentiation standpoint. We've been at this for going on 7 years, so it's not new that we're doing something disruptive and fundamentally different than what everybody else is doing. I think it's also fairly obvious that none of the competition, including Check Point, has done or indicated any desire to be able to compete with us really based on the technology. So when you're in those situations, the things that you do competitively as you tend to be very concerned about keeping your existing customer base, you get very aggressive on pricing. You do things that are really kind of marketing-driven as opposed to technology and value-driven for the customer. And I believe at the end of the day, that doesn't work out for companies. Because like I said a little -- a minute ago Dan, the level of concern and anxiety over security is really high and getting higher and price doesn't get it for you anymore, right? Bundling doesn't get it for you anymore. You better just have the best network security solution to market, and that's what we think we have.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Catharine Trebnick from Northland Securities.
Catharine Anne Trebnick - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division: You -- talking with several of the carriers, it looks like you're ramping up staff for that area. I know that was one area you discussed quite a bit at the Analyst Day. Could you talk about some of the use cases that you would be looking to win at the carriers?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Yes, so we view the carrier market as really like 3 opportunities. One is to sell to the carriers as enterprises, meaning we're protecting their networks. And in that regard, we're doing very well, that's a direct sales effort, it's major account stuff. Mark and his team are very focused on doing that. And some of the investments we're making that space from a people, personnel standpoint are going towards that opportunity. The second opportunity is to have those carriers use our technology; provide them on a managed services basis. That is, 2 angles to that, one is managed services to enterprise, which we're doing well with the number of the carriers on developing technologies -- developing the roll out plans for them to use our technologies, to service enterprises that way. And the second space is the SMB market, which we're not penetrated in with the carriers yet. We believe we will be over time. There are some different products -- software things we need to do there, but that opportunity. And the third one that we view is -- they're large system and integrators in a lot of cases. And some of our largest commercial customers are using some big service providers as their systems integrators. And in those cases, we are working with those service providers because the customer has chosen us for network security. That's allowed us to start relationships with them on large-scale distribution partnerships that, over time, we think can pay dividends for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ruykhaver from Stephens.
Jonathan B. Ruykhaver - Stephens Inc., Research Division: So half the customer base uses Palo Alto as the primary firewall. And looking at the 5-year depreciation cycle on a firewall, what that implies from a growth standpoint, is there any concern that greater participation in that cycle potentially prolongs sales cycles and weighs on activity?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Yes, Jonathan, so actually just want to correct those statistics, because we gave some new ones out at Analyst Day, which we said we would do every year. Right now, 60% of our customers or more than 60% of our customers across our whole base are using us as the primary firewall. And the other statistic we updated at the Analyst Day was in our fiscal year '13 so far, 75% of all of our new sales are going to us being the primary firewall. So just want to start with the right numbers. And I'm not sure I understand the actual question though; could you give me that again?
Jonathan B. Ruykhaver - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Just that if you look at the network firewall market, it's a single-digit-type growth market and we know that the process around displacing incumbents can be somewhat of a long sales cycle historically. So if you're being baked into more of those potential firewall refresh cycles, does that impact in any way your sales cycles relative to what you've seen historically as we move into the future?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Okay, I got that. So yes, so generally, sale cycles for network security, in particularly the firewall can be decently long because it's a really important piece of technology and you take your time to make a decision on that]. So when we think about the addressable market, it's in the multibillion dollar range, just for firewalls, let alone network security, but that doesn't all happen at once. So there's always refresh cycles going on across this global buying base and every one of those is the opportunity for us to come and compete and win as we have been in those buying cycles. Now once we're in as well, it's very sticky, right? We know how hard it is to throw the incumbent out, and you better have really, really different disruptive technology if you're trying to do that. So once we're in the door, we know how hard it is to take us out and you can kind of get a sense of that as well from the expansion that we've seen across the customer base. So -- and the last thing I mentioned is that our largest customers continue to tell us that, like penetration levels in their accounts are maybe 10% of what we could possibly earn over time inside those accounts. So we're pretty bullish on what the opportunity here is.
Operator: We will take our last question from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan.
Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Mark, you mentioned in your prepared remarks the success of the 3000 series, just curious where you're seeing the adoption, if it's helping you expand your market presence or if it's going into branch offices of existing customers?
Mark D. McLaughlin: It's actually -- it's gone and gone left and right, meaning that the 3000 series is right up the middle for us, so that is something that you probably see more and we are seeing more in the perimeter than you'd see in the branch office or in a data center. And as I think you and I talked about at one point, we'd said at the Analyst Day that we saw an opportunity there to put something in that point in the market which would help us upsell off of the 2000 series for folks who just had higher throughput requirements as throughput needs continue to grow at the perimeter. So that seems to be working very well.
Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And when you look at the quarter, any segmentation in terms of where you saw the weakness, whether -- I think Mark talked about some of the bigger deals being segmented. But any sense if the weakness as the erosion, as the quarter went on was uniform? Or particular end of the market, meaning larger deals versus smaller customers?
Mark D. McLaughlin: Generally on the larger sets, again we saw just in Europe and particularly Central, Southern Europe and in the fed space, the things that we saw that added up $3 million or $4 million in each one of those across maybe like a dozen deals. So they tended to be larger in nature. I think that's not surprising given the sentiment that was changing over time. Larger purchases would be the ones that either get downsized or pushed to the right.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Mark McLaughlin for any closing remarks.
Mark D. McLaughlin: Thank you, I appreciate that, operator. I want to thank everybody for taking the time to be with us today and also want to reiterate my appreciation for the hard work of all the Palo Alto team and support of our customers and partners as we continue to revolutionize the enterprise network security market. We look forward to updating you all on our next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect, have a great day.

In addition, a live audio webcast of the meeting will be accessible from the Investor Relations section of the company’s website. Now I would like to introduce, Mark McLaughlin, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Palo Alto Networks. Mark?
Mark McLaughlin: Thanks, Maria and thanks everyone for joining us. I am delighted to be here today to share with you our achievements in our fiscal second quarter of 2013. We had a strong second quarter and our results continue to demonstrate Palo Alto Networks recognition as the global leader in next-generation enterprise network security. This leadership position is driven by our high value, disruptive technology which we believe, provides the highest level of security available in the market today. As customers rapidly adopt our technology as their strategic enterprise network security platform, we continue to demonstrate the ability to drive growth, bar in excess of any other competition and with continued improving leverage. In the second quarter, we continue to see enterprise investment and security as a top of mind issue, strong end of calendar year purchasing, improving customer sentiments in EMEA and continued adoption of our technology as the primary firewall by new and existing customers. As we've discussed in the past, our growth model is based on our ability to land in new customers that are best-in-class provider for any enterprise network security use case, expand across that customers network with additional devices and extend our value to the customer with subscription services that provide great performance and total cost of ownership advantages. And looking at the LAN component of our growth in the second quarter, we added over 1,000 new customers in the quarter. This is the fifth consecutive quarter where we have added over 1,000 new customers. We now have the privilege of servicing over 11,000 total end customers around the globe, most of which are choosing us over the legacy common firewall provider. On the expand and expense side of our business, we continue to see strong increased buying and loyalty from our customers. Our business coming from services continues to grow at impressive rates as our existing customers buy additional services and for longer-terms. For example, in the second quarter our top 25 customers’ follow-on purchases averaged 11.4 times of initial purchase. This is up from 9.9 times last quarter and to make the top 25 list in the second quarter our customer had to spend minimum $2.8 million with us, which is up from $2.5 million last quarter. This is all translated in the second quarter results where we posted $96.5 million in revenue which is a 70% year-over-year increase and 12% sequential increase along with non-GAAP EPS of $0.05 per diluted share. Demonstrating our continued ability, the substantially outpacing competition and with continue growing leverage in the business. Our results are driven by our ability to provide demonstrably and substantially better network security than the competition. Some examples of this over the quarter include us replacing the Check Point as a datacenter firewall in the distributed network environment of one of Europe’s largest broadcasters. We also replaced Check Point in the datacenter of one of the biggest insurance companies in the U.S. after starting our first appointment with them in December 2011. And replaced Juniper one of the largest electronic component vendors in the world based here in California. And [Cisco] one of Australia’s largest retirement funds. And as we have discussed and demonstrated in the past, we continue to displace all the legacy firewall providers at a rapid pace while growing our market share.  The reason why we are able to win so many new customers and expand so significantly within our customer [Technical Difficulty] and this differentiation continues to grow. Just a few days ago, I was pleased to see that Gartner once again recognized all the networks as a leader in their latest metric quadrant for enterprise networks firewalls and they reiterated they believe that by year-end 2014 the majority of new purchases will be next generation firewalls. I am also very pleased with the rollout of the four new products introduced in November at our Ignite User Conference; customer attraction has been significant across all these products most notably for PA-3000 Series and WildFire subscription service. We now have more than 1200 customers using our WildFire service and are ahead of our internal forecast for the pay the tax ratio service. In summary, we are pleased to report another strong quarter of growth, new customer acquisition and continued increasing operating leverage. Our solutions address the fundamental network security issues that are facing enterprises across the globe and we enter the second half of our fiscal year with big momentum.

Steffan Tomlinson: Thank you, Mark and thank you all for joining us today to cover our results for fiscal Q2, ‘13. In Q2, total revenue grew to a record $96.5 million, an increase of 70.2% year-over-year and 12.3% sequentially. Looking at our two main components of revenue, in Q2, product revenue of $61.9 million grew 60.3% year-over-year and 11.6% sequentially driven by sales of our series of appliances. Services revenue which is comprised of both subscription and support was $34.6 million, an increase of 91.5% year-over-year and 13.6% sequentially. Services revenue accounted for 35.8% of total revenue, an increase of 40 basis points sequentially and this is in line with our expectation and underscores the power of our hybrid revenue model as it provides enhanced visibility. The geographic mix of revenue was 63% Americas, 25% EMEA and 12% APAC with all theaters posting growth on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Total non-GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 72.2% in line with our target range of 70% to 73%. Non-GAAP gross margin has decreased 70 basis points year-over-year and 40 basis points sequentially. Putting a final point on gross margin, Q2 non-GAAP product gross margin was 73.4% down 10 basis points year-over-year and 80 basis points sequentially.  The sequential decrease was primarily due to product mix and the impact of the launch of our new PA-3000 Series. As I mentioned in the last earnings call, product gross margins will fluctuate when we introduce new products as they have a higher initial cost of goods sold.  As volumes increase per new products, we expect reductions in cost of goods sold which will result in an improvement of gross margins over time. Our non-GAAP services gross margin was 70.1%, down 140 basis points year-over-year, and up 60 basis points sequentially.  The sequential increase was primarily due to the benefit of more subscription sales in the quarter and services gross margin will also fluctuate depending on the timing of the investment ramp of our services organization.  Moving on to operating expenses, we continue to invest primarily in product development and our sales and go-to-market organization. Q2 non-GAAP R&D expense was $13.5 million, an increase of $1.9 million from the prior quarter primarily related to program spend in headcount addition.  As a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP R&D expense was 14% up 50 basis points sequentially. Q2 non-GAAP sales and marketing expense was $41.9 million, an increase of $3.6 million from the prior quarter. As a percentage of revenue it was 43.4%, a decrease of 120 basis points sequentially demonstrating operating leverage.  Q2 non-GAAP G&A expense was $7.7 million, an increase of $500,000 from the prior quarter or 8% as a percentage of revenue, down 40 basis points sequentially. In total, Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses were $63.1 million, an increase of $6 million from the prior quarter or 65.4% of revenue, down 110 basis points sequentially.  Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 6.8%, an increase of 70 basis points sequentially and the sequential improvement this quarter can be attributed to continue natural leverage as we scale and timing of headcount additions.  As we stated previously, given our leading position in the market and the fact that we are growing revenue at a much higher rate than both the market and our competitors, our goal is to grow operating margin in a slow and steady manner while noting there maybe near-term fluctuation.  Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 41.5%. This rate will continue to fluctuate throughout the fiscal year as its dependent upon our global pretax profit mix and potential discreet events such as the removal of our domestic valuation allowance.  Non-GAAP net income for Q2 was approximately $3.9 million or $0.05 per diluted share using 77.5 million shares. This compares to non-GAAP net income of $2.9 million or $0.04 per diluted shares in fiscal Q1 ’13 and non-GAAP net income of $2.5 million or $0.04 per diluted share in fiscal Q2 ’12. On a GAAP basis, net loss was $2.6 million or $0.04 per basic and diluted shares.  Turning to the balance sheet, we finished January with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $368.3 million. In Q2, cash flow from operations was $34.5 million, free cash flow was $28.3 million and free cash flow margin was 29.3%.  Cash flows benefit from our hybrid revenue model in which we build for our services at the beginning of the engagement and we collected the cash shortly thereafter. We ended Q2 with $68.6 million of accounts receivables, up from the Q1 ’13 balance of $56.4 million.  Average DSOs were 58 days up from 53 days last quarter reflecting a slightly more backend linearity to the end of the quarter.  Moving down to balance sheet, total deferred revenue was $188.2 million, an increase of 92.2% year-over-year and 17.3% sequentially. Short-term deferred revenue of a $117.4 million increased 15.8% sequentially. The majority of our service engagements are in annual basis but we're continuing to see an uptick in multi-year deals.  Billings were a $124.3 million, an increase of 81.6% year-over-year and 12.4% sequentially. Let me now turn to our guidance for Q3 ‘13. We expect revenue to be in the range of $100 million to $104 million, which equates to 52% to 58% year-over-year growth and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be approximately $0.05 per share using 79 million to 81 million shares on a diluted basis. We're continuing to invest in product development, sales and go-to market as well as three projects in G&A all of which has reflected in our guidance for Q3.  With the, I will turn the call over to the operator to open the Q&A session.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line Greg Dunham, Goldman Sachs.
Greg Dunham - Goldman Sachs: I guess first up, can you talk about the impact of Mark Anderson’s kind of emphasis on strategic account? And the opportunity improved sales productivity from here. Thank you.
Mark McLaughlin: Mark has been focused on a number of things. And I mentioned this on a few of the other calls. One is on the strategic account side. So not surprisingly as the company continues to grow into the size, we are in the size we intend to become, large strategic major accounts are more important for the company. So we have been very focused on the Global 2000, we got very good penetration and we continue to increase penetration and we continue to do really well our large accounts on follow on purchases as well. Mark is putting a lot of discipline in place, talent in place, he know how to sell and who and in service because larger accounts so we expect to continue to get gains from that overtime and as you know it takes time in order to develop sales forces like that, so far directly.
Greg Dunham - Goldman Sachs: One follow-up if you permit. The billing numbers or is just a number? Were there anomalies in there? Was that, I mean, is that mainly due to the WildFire release? How should we think about that?
Mark McLaughlin: Yeah. Sure I would like to give Steffan a little more detail. Just generally on the billing side, we had a nice quarter as you can see we have a nice increase in services revenue side of it, it start flowing through the end of… 
Steffan Tomlinson:  That’s right when we look at the composition of billings what we are seeing is a very nice up tick in our services line both subscription and maintenance. And we are pleased with the number.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joel Fishbein, Lazard. 
Joel Fishbein - Lazard: Just a follow-up on that guys, in terms of the take rates on the subscriptions, can you give us any more indication on the numbers that people are taking and what is particularly driving the deferred revenue in terms of the subscription base?
Mark McLaughlin:  So as we said in the past, attach rates on the services are good, how do you like they need to be that way and in addition to that as you know, we continue to launch more services in particular WildFire back in November end and we like the attach rates we are seeing on that, it's early days there but they are higher than what we internally forecasted in the last 90 days of selling.  So that’s we think that contribute uplift for the company. I mean at the end of the day, what is going on here is that when you got really disruptive provides the first place to firewall and the ability to easily add very valued services for folks at a much lower cost, I would say rather obnoxious to really possibly coming off in the market we keep seeing our customers take advantage of that and increasing rates in the longer term.
Joel Fishbein - Lazard: This is the follow-up to that, I mean, you know, the big talk was malicious threat protection, can you just talk about how Alto is positioned in that market and maybe that’s the better question to ask relative to what’s driving the subscription growth?
Mark McLaughlin: Yeah, sure, it’s a great question. You know, something [Technical Difficulty] yesterday there is definitely a big focus on a key malware, not surprising and their security changes a lot and there is always something new that's important to take care of, so it’s a general matter I think what is going on there is that company, a enterprise is very concerned about that and they question what do you do about it, and you are bringing the services like [Technical Difficulty] is really important in itself because it is the only one out there that can protect and prevent, malware. But importantly a big picture I think is what is happening architecturally is that the enterprises once the ability to have device and services provide a security and do so rapidly with the architecture as big since capital expenditures with the best of three points (inaudible) right so what we have done as we have said in lot of cases, majority cases were already a firewall [Technical Difficulty]. So from the peer security perspective what you would like to have is the (inaudible) of technologies forced to get in different boxes today actually we integrated in a creative way because that's the best possible way to detect and then really quickly prevent that malware that is what we have in the market. So I think just generally it’s an architectural matter, that's the way the world’s going.
Operator: Your next question is from Michael (inaudible) Raymond James.
Unidentified Analyst: Just a sort of housekeeping question, anymore precision you can give us on the number of customers out and then the customer count and how much hiring you did this quarter and what was the net headcount adds and what would expect going forward still looking in the 75 to 100 range.
Mark McLaughlin: That's right Michael. So on the first question the customers, you know we continue to add customers that have a very nice space of this third quarter with over 1000. We haven't gotten into the numbers about what they are over a 1000, the reason for that is there's really no magic to a 1000, I mean it’s a great number thinking to put out there but this is a really great quarter from a customer ad perspective very high numbers and we hope to continue that for quite some time, just as importantly as adding new customers which is land part of the model is the expand part and once we get into the door the way we've been able to demonstrate (inaudible) does that is really important. We see that driving, you know driven through our service line of deferred revenue there. So all the cylinders are firing for us.
Steffan Tomlinson: And just a follow on point to that you can also see that in the LTV metric that we talk about which has increased very nicely sequentially to 11.4 times repeat order value for the top 25 enterprise customers that we have.
Mark McLaughlin: And we added 100 head this quarter we said we'd do anywhere from 75 to 100 on a quarter basis, as far as the target, that's obviously going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter [hiring] patterns and when people show up about a 100 in this quarter (inaudible).
Unidentified Analyst: And if I could just ask you about the accounts receivables was more backend loaded, what was going on there that happened.
Steffan Tomlinson: It was typical of many companies in terms of the January month; the first couple of weeks are always a little bit slow because the majority of corporations are on a calendar year budget. So once those budgets are finalized we saw a very nice pick up at the end of the month and that's a normal pattern that we've seen in January and past Januarys. We also did see a good calendar year end December month. We don't break that out specifically but we did participate in a nice December month as well.
Operator: Your next question is from Jayson Noland with Robert W. Baird.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird: Mark at RSA there was talk of the perimeter being porous and ineffective and I guess part of answer there is wild fire for APT and malware but do you see any change architecturally where the PA appliances would be in more locations in the network or virtual in GFWs I guess what are you seeing more broadly.
Mark McLaughlin: The answer is going to be yes, you see it everywhere which is you want to protect the perimeter, you want to protect the branch office so the perimeter doesn't get it back. You would definitely want to protect the datacenter. Those are the three main areas we generally enterprisers focus on that where we have offerings for all three of them. Again like I said a little earlier, because of that, because of the move to virtualization and datacenters, flexibility from how you are able to provide security its very important and ideally you would want your firewall to be very selectable with service in order to do that in all those places in the network and even want a virtualized version of that as well and we have all of those.
Operator: Your next question is from Phil Winslow, Credit Suisse.
Harris Heyer - Credit Suisse: Hi, this is Harris Heyer on behalf of Phil. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping if you could comment on the pricing environment in the last quarter versus three quarters and also if you can just comment briefly on your tax rate [renewables]?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, sure. Your first question is on pricing, Harris?
Harris Heyer - Credit Suisse: Yeah.
Mark McLaughlin: Okay. You know, this has always been a very competitive market and it's not unusual for players to tend to makeup for lack of functionality by an aggressive pricing that we definitely seen that. But we found it in the past we continue to see as our technology is dully disruptive and it's solving really strategic issues. As a result of that, we're not immune to pricing pressure but we've been able to maintain premium pricing for premium technology for quite some time. 
Steffan Tomlinson:  And on the tax rate description, what we’ve said in the past still holds up. We are typically selling one or two subscription with initial sale and then we also sell maintenance and the tax rate is extremely high. As we said, its well north of 90%. The renewal rate for maintenance again is very high. You can’t really deploy enterprise network security without being on maintenance because you get [rough] fixes and patches as part of that maintenance program and the renewal rate on subscription are high as well. We haven't put a final point on that and that should cover both of your questions.
Operator: Thank you and your next question is from Jonathan Ho, William Blair.
Jonathan Ho - William Blair: The first question I have is around the primary firewall adoption. Can you talk a little bit about the trend there and whether you are seeing, just roughly you said over 50%. Are you seeing an acceleration there in terms of relative to Gartner’s comments?
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, Jonathan, we are. So what we said in the past is that over half of our news deals and half of our existing customer base use primary firewall and that number continues to go in the right direction for us. And I think what Gartner is saying here is that enterprises are have been coming around roughly coming around, you really need an next gen firewall in order to have the best level security in the market today. So their expectation is that as those purchases occur most of them meaning more than half of those are going to be for next gen firewall so that will point to (inaudible).
Jonathan Ho - William Blair: Got it. Just in terms of PA3000 line, just wanted to understand a little bit about how much an impact that product set is having. I know it’s been out for a little while, but just driving some of the new extension opportunity or has achieve more market acceptance just want to get sometimes (inaudible) 
Mark McLaughlin: If we got a lot of input from customers (inaudible) that they liked to see a device in that range, so we delivered it at the end. I mean it's sold very well from the first day we introduce that and we expect to do that (inaudible) so we are very pleased with it. 
Operator: Thank you and your next question is from Carl [Kirst] from BMO Capital Markets.
Unidentified Analyst : Hi this is Shakeel (inaudible) for Carl Kirst. Two questions can you talk a little bit more about demand environment you mentioned strong enterprise demand in your prepared comment and I just wanted more color on that? You also talked about enterprises wanting to consolidate to more of a single architecture are you seeing an uptick in one demand and also just that kind of trend of kind of more consolidated architecture? And then also my second question just are you able to give a little more color around 50% new customers that are buying primary firewall, are they in terms of anything you can give us there would be helpful. 
Mark McLaughlin: Now we’ll get reverse (inaudible). On the new ones we say 50% of the new customers (inaudible) primary firewall that’s across the board meaning that it’s all crossing entire customer based. We are really focused as we said before on the Global [2017] to those folks as well, and as we are continually rapidly accepted in the market as enterprise networks firewall provider with the technology what we have seen that deals get done quicker and the initial deals get bigger and then the follow on purchase gets faster and the follow-on purchases get bigger, so that’s generally what we would continue to see.  And in first question was kind of place that which is the demand has been and continue to be very high for this technology and again your partners echoing that just a few weeks ago, but we (inaudible) from the demand standpoints for our technology and then on the other question around what I was saying architecturally, I mean you guys you can call consolidation, we think about it as more latest integration of the technologies required to combat what you are seeing on the security and secured today. We believe that overtime architecturally customers want demand and will get more and more of the functionality needably from the firewall, but simply I mean (inaudible) cost wise but way more importantly that that is a better security solution. I use Malware and everybody is focused on that. We use Malware as an example. If you want to see the Malware coming in, so that would be traditionally a malware device, seeing the malware coming in when the malware is in you would want to see its trying to talk outside the network of the malware device want to do that, your IPS device would be the one listening for the command and control to see if its communicating out, and then if it was and you are able to put a signature on it with your [AB] device then you would want to communicate it back to your firewalls so that you could be ready to have a signature to enforce it, that's kind of what mismatch actually looks like out there and that's not very convenient or secure. So that's why we continue to see customers striving and pressing for better security in a daily integrated fashion which is focused by the market.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question is from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.
Walter Pritchard - Citigroup: Mark, just on the product side I am wondering if you can compare and contrast sort of the pressure to move on with a higher end box even higher than where you are today versus moved down into the low end and I am wondering just kind of branch versus datacenter where you've been called more so as you see incremental demand?
Mark McLaughlin: Well, both directions, so I think on this let me talk about the smaller side first, I think you know customers would like to see us have even smaller boxes than the PA-200 with all of the functionality right with the next-gen firewall and that's challenging just from how do you do it for all that at the right cost of profitability to do that. So we thought about that continuing about ways, we get that done and then in the higher end there is a set of the customer base that not everybody does, they don't and I'll tell you why, but not everybody would see a higher throughout box and higher end doing all the next-gen functionality that we do in the boxes we have today. Those tend to be large, large datacenter deployments or carrier or folks like that, so we definitely are paying attention to that and taking that input very seriously and I think you could expect to see us do something in that area in the future. Generally though, one of the things that the market is used to for really long time is saying if I want to get X throughput, protected throughput with everybody else in technology if you want 2 gig, the protective throughput you probably have to start with a 40-gig box to get it because of all of the performance degradation and we don't have that problem. So you get 2 gigs and 2 gigs operation so you get what you paid for as opposed to having to start with something very expensive and we've been able to serve it a lots and lots of throughput because of that.
Walter Pritchard - Citigroup: And then just, I have been wondering on just a clarification on the deferred revenue; you did have a very strong quarter, I am wondering if there was any sort of abnormal seasonality, lots of going on in the government and things like that any pull forward in maintenance in longer term, maintenance deals that or do you think that because the seasonality here looks much more pronounced than it was in last year?
Steffan Tomlinson: Our deferred revenue grew nicely and we have seen an uptick in multi-year deals both on the subscription side and on the maintenance side, so nothing too out of the ordinary is happening there.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Tal Liani, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ron Zember - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, guys, this is Rom Zember, on for Tal Liani. Just a couple of housekeeping questions; headcount, should we think of the same run rate for the (inaudible)……
Steffan Tomlinson: We talked about a range of 75 to 100 and timing of heads on board sometimes there are some variances, but we still feel comfortable with that range. This past quarter we added exactly a 100. And I think going forward the 75 to a 100 range makes sense for us for the balance of the fiscal year, for the quarter.
Ron Zember - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And then how about investment in channel; how many partners you guys added this quarter?
Mark McLaughlin: We haven't broken out what we have done on a quarter-by-quarter basis. We said in the past we've got about 800 [Technical Difficulty] and over about the last year’s we've added 200 to 250 and we expect to do that on a continued rate that's sort of the benchmark. We are very interested in the quality of those, over the quantity of those, just because when you have the newer or relatively newer disruptive technology having highly trained partners being able to sell into accounts major almost probably doing displacement; very important to since we focus a lot on them.
Ron Zember - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And how is the ramp been on the refinance?
Mark McLaughlin: Great, it's in line with our expectation.
Operator: [Technical Difficulty] Erik Suppiger, JMP Securities. 
Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities: I had two questions. First, just curious if you have seen any change in the competitive landscape coming from other next generation firewall vendors? And then secondly on the WildFire, the subscribers, I think, you said around 1,200. Was there any pent up demand? Is that something that was kind of just because of the initial release or it might we expect that to continue growing at a similar rate?
Mark McLaughlin: So first one, a competition I would say. The answer is no. So we believe this to be true that we are the only real next generation firewall provider in the market. Lots of folks are doing marketing around application identification trial --- they can block application and then they try to call that Next Gen firewall but we're the only offering in the market that can truly safely enable applications and that’s the difference.  So we have seen a lot of competitive marketing but we haven't seen any catch up from a competitive technology standpoint. I don't think we really care about it at the end of the day. On the WildFire side, yes, I should have been more clearer a little earlier. So we had a free version of WildFire in the market for over a year and we’ve had a really good customer adoption on the free versions. So we have 1,200 total customers today using WildFire and then off that base to the customers when we released our paid-for version at WildFire in November, we saw some new customers buying and existing customers starting to pay from attach rate perspective. So I want [Technical Difficulty] we don’t have 1,200 paid-for subscriptions to suggest that the total base of customers (inaudible) WildFire and attach rates on these numbers are good so far for us.
Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities: Do you have attach rate for the paid version?
Mark McLaughlin: For the paid version, yes.
Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities: Okay, any details on how that performed in the quarter?
Mark McLaughlin: Better than better we [Technical Difficulty].
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Brent Thill of UBS. 
Brent Thill - UBS: Thanks Mark. Just on WildFire, how do you think of ASP list if you just used may be simple numbers to help us understand what you are seeing initially in those paid for customers?
Mark McLaughlin: Yeah, Brent we are trying to keep it really simple and like we have for all our subscription services, so all of our subscription services are the same and that when you buy a device cost X right and it has a list price on it and the subscription service is 20% of list price. That's true for WildFire as well so you are going to attach the paid for subscription of WildFire get 20% of the list price of the box you are putting in.
Brent Thill - UBS: Okay that’s great. And if you just give us your thoughts on the government what you are seeing in your pipeline? How you think about the potential upcoming impact of things going on there right now? That would be helpful, thanks.
Mark McLaughlin: The government market has been a good market for us and I think we continue to be just be by the nature of what we do for living. With that said, no verticals more than 14ish percent of our business today. So we have to keep that all in context. I think your second question is really or a part of that is around sequestration, so there is a lot of speculation and anxiety general about whether that’s going to occur, I guess why don't tomorrow right. And if so what's that going to mean impact wise, I think it's too early to tell but there are few things that remain, the one is the type of security is a national priority you can see that as lately its just a couple of week to go at the President, executive board of Cyber Security, and then second thing in general is as enterprises and to some degree the government so more than an enterprise if you consider that way they are being forced to do more with flash from a budget perspective, but we got a better solution [Technical Difficulty] I think that’s a really desirable offering that’s what we have and I think that government has and we will continue to find it attractive things and all that nobody really knows what the impact of sequestration [Technical Difficulty].
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen.
Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen: Just to follow onto one of Walter’s questions, how is demand this quarter across your current set of low, mid and high end appliance was it strong across the board or to one area for example, pro forma a little better than the other? 
Mark McLaughlin: Its strong everywhere Gregg and what I was saying a little earlier was the 3000 is selling very well higher than what we thought it would selling which is always great. So I call that everything is selling well that's a good (inaudible) in the selling better than we thought it would but everything continues to improve. 
Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen: Okay, great and then for Steffan your services gross margin tapping on a nice upward trend over the past few quarters, looking forward I am sure you can make some investments in your support organization at the same time presumably your mix of subscriptions will continue to increase, so just wondering how you are thinking about particularly about service margins come up near?
Steffan Tomlinson: We are not going to break out specifically how each of the components of the services gross margin work or the product gross margin. On the services gross margin in particular, the dynamic around subscription versus maintenance and the customer support realization, subscription revenue is going to be recognized rapidly over the life of the contract and to be consistent small tail win that builds overtime as we sell more subscriptions.  The cost of support to deliver maintenance is very much headcount driven and systems driven and those costs are more pronounced upfront. So we have a couple of countervailing forces playing against each other. We have been more disciplined in getting more efficiency out of our support organization which is helpful and as WildFire and other subscriptions continue to build, there should be a positive tailwind to services gross margin over time. There will be some near-term fluctuations. I think the biggest thing to understand is given that this is a fifth consecutive quarter, we've added over a 1,000 new customers but we want to make sure that we are adequately resourced to ensure a great customer experience and that's a big differentiator between us and in the competition.
Operator: Thank you and your next question is from Aaron Schwartz, Jefferies.
Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies: Just a quick sort of follow-up question on the deferred revenue, obviously that's been well ahead of what we have modeled, should we expect and I'd assume we would but should we expect a more pronounced revenue mix shift to services as we build the model out in the back half of the year and into ’14.
Steffan Tomlinson: It’s a little too soon to tell. We are primarily a booking ship business. If you look just on a revenue basis still we are getting approximately periods of our revenues from products. Over time, we think directionally services as a percentage of total revenue and total billings we'll be building but given the fact that we are adding so many new customers per quarter and we are following our land expanded expense strategy of mining our installed base and selling to you new opportunities within that base, we expect to see both robust product growth and services growth. We will monitor it over time but right now we are not making any predictions on the split.
Aaron Schwartz - Jefferies: Okay and the sort of just a follow-up question, you spoke about the trend of a couple of more multi-year deals, I think you said that was balanced between the maintenance and the subscription services. What's actually driving that, is that more of a customer preference or do you have the sales and partner program actually out trying to do multi-year deals.
Steffan Tomlinson: Most of it is customer driven and the fact that we are selling into the Global 2000 and high end enterprise, they want to standardize on us and they are effectively making that standardization call with a multi-year deal and that has translated into structurally us being very well situated in the account for both the existing deal and for follow on purchases.
Operator: Your next question is from Keith Price, Morgan Stanley.
Keith Price - Morgan Stanley: The one thing that I noticed in the quarter is you had in the second quarter a really robust sequential increases in EMEA, anything in particular looking better there or sort of catalyzing growth there that's really leading to those two nice [uptick].
Mark McLaughlin: Yeah, what you can see is you know different numbers we increased the business sequentially in last three quarters and particularly in the last two quarters at really healthy rates so you know obviously we are pleased with that. It’s a little too early to speculate as whether any of that means as a general matter or resurgence with confidence in the EMEA market macro wise, but we are in a position that's going really high value technology and a great secular trend, that's going to affect enterprises all around the world including EMEA so we would expect security to remain top of mind to budget issue over there, or you know top of budget issue up to there.  More specifically your question for us what we have seen is larger companies where we've been working on larger projects starting to bring those projects to fruition and replacing [low key] technology with (inaudible) and that's a positive again for us in the second quarter. So I don't know if that means that the (inaudible) strings opening more, generally over EMEA but that’s kind of what we're seeing specifically to us.
Keith Price - Morgan Stanley: Got it. And in terms of where you are investing in additional distribution capacity, can you give us any color is it spread out evenly across the globe or is it more of an international focus?
Mark McLaughlin: We were investing pretty much everywhere. We have (inaudible) market and basically is we do or call it rationalization of when you are putting the dollar rate, where do you expect to get some most out trying to get a good balance of that on like earlier high growth market versus more stable places where if I just be splitting territories. But generally we're investing everywhere as we're still growing very nicely but still under distributed, pretty much on a global basis because the markets are still large for something (inaudible) felt.
Keith Price - Morgan Stanley: Got it, and maybe if I can sneak in one last one. I think on the last conference call, we talked about really good volume increases from the PH (inaudible). I think you talked about greater than 70% unit growth in the quarter, any chance of update on that (inaudible).
Mark McLaughlin: I am sorry I don’t remember that specifically.
Steffan Tomlinson: Yeah, on the volumes, we don’t typically go to a level of granularity on giving the product unit growth sequential or year-over-year numbers. But I can tell you just by virtue of the revenue growth, unit volumes were up across the board. Each of the main appliances that we sell had various strong demand in the quarter. The biggest positive development that we had in this quarter was the traction we had with the PA-3000 which we introduced in November and the update on that was extremely strong. But I will tell you, both the high end, PA-5000 and the low end the PA-200 they all had nice performance in the quarter.
Operator: We have time just to take two more questions; one from each of the following parties. The next question comes from Frederick Grieb, Nomura. 
Frederick Grieb - Nomura: Just to circle back quickly to the new customers added in the quarter, can you give us an idea if the average size of these new customer purchases is increasing and what the dynamics are that’s causing those initial purchases to grow?
Mark McLaughlin:  Yeah Frederick couple of things that would be - the answer is yes, call the ASP around that continued to go up and I think the reason for that again just goes back to the more step with (inaudible) more likely you want to make a bigger purchase with those upfront. As we said many times in the past that we were really not focused on that number, what we are really focused on is (inaudible) customer and we have a raft of examples of folks who spend well over million dollars with us it started with a relatively small five figure toward the [year] but then rapidly ramping well over $1 million. So that’s what we focused on is the time spend that (inaudible) initial purchases.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question is from (inaudible) FBM Securities.
Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Your mix effect was negative because of the I think you had ramping (inaudible) of the 3000 series, but you hinted that as the sales mature the margins will improve. So I am just curious about how you see the mixed dynamics playing out over the next several quarters. You also hinted at potentially a new high end box at some point, higher throughput boxes, it seems like this is the low point in terms of mix any thoughts on mixed dynamics going forward?
Mark McLaughlin: As Steffan said it earlier we had a very strong demand for the 3000 (inaudible) is going very well has been all new particularly hardware launches with the same kind of product growth margins we get until you scale into the volumes start to do savings we expect to see that overtime with that 3000 Series. (Inaudible) last year roughly at this time in the introduction of PA-200 where it sold really well out the door and had lower gross margins that because it was new product has improved as we expected overtime. And I did say a little earlier that there is demand from all the customer based for the larger devices which we certainly to think about. If we did that we would launch our device at the lower gross margin than it would later on but you had increasing demand. And one thing as you always noticed, you should expect that to continue to launch devices in our family of our products for probably all the time based on what we are getting from the customers and where we see the ability to do that. 
Operator: Thank you. And I would now like to turn the call over to Mark McLaughlin for closing remarks.
Mark McLaughlin: Well, great, thanks again everybody to be in our call today. I want to reiterate my appreciation (inaudible) Palo Alto Networks been the supportive for all our customers and partners, as we continue to revolutionize the enterprise networks security market. We look forward to seeing all of you at our analyst day in New York City on March 21st. Thanks a lot for your time.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference. This concludes the presentation, and you now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2013 Q1  (2012-12-06 00:00:00) =====

 Now I'd like to introduce Mark McLaughlin, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Palo Alto Networks. Mark? 
Mark McLaughlin: Thank you, Maria, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'm delighted to be here to share with you our achievements in the fiscal first quarter of 2013. Palo Alto Networks is transforming network security and our clear technology differentiation continues to drive our growth. Customers globally are recognizing the benefits of our solution to solve their pressing network security needs and this is reflected in our growth, which continues to significantly outpace the industry.
 Today, I would like to outline some of the progress we've made in recent months, which includes a strong first quarter with record revenue, the addition of over 1,000 new customers in the quarter, and hosting our first ever user conference where we further extended our technology lead with multiple product introductions.
 On the financial side, in the first quarter, we generated record revenue of approximately $86 million, which represents 50% year-over-year growth and approximately 14% sequential growth. We also demonstrated continued growth in operating leverage and delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.04 per diluted share. 
 On the customer side, we continued to focus on our land, expand and strategy to drive results and fuel our growth. From a land perspective, during the first quarter, we added over 1,000 new end-customers, bringing our current customer count to over 10,000 total end-customers. This is the fourth consecutive quarter in which we added over 1,000 new customers.
 And on the expand and extend side, our customer lifetime value continues to grow as evidenced by the lifetime value of our top 25 customers increasing to 9.9x their initial purchase, up from 9.5x last quarter.
 Some examples of wins in the field in the first quarter, we're in a competitive bid against Check Point and Fortinet. We landed a new deal with a major European telecom operator where we're replacing Check Point firewalls and McAfee's IPS for internal IP systems protection, as well as replacing Juniper and TippingPoint for their MSSP business.
 Additionally, we became the primary firewall for one of the leading European broadcasting companies, replacing Cisco and Juniper in a multimillion dollar transaction. And for this customer, we also provided them with a real-time threat prevention services. We also expanded our relationship with a very large U.S. government agency. At this agency. We won the data center IPS business about 5 quarters ago at 1 location, and this quarter, we extended our presence to all the data centers throughout the United States for IPS and firewalls.
 We replaced McAfee and beat Sourcefire for distributed security at a global health and beauty company based in the U.S. And finally, on the extend side, one of the leading lifestyle media companies in the world deployed us a data center IPS solution 6 quarters ago.
 In the fiscal first quarter, we expanded our presence as a customer deployed us as their global data center firewall, replacing Cisco.
 Also, in November, we hosted our first ever user conference, Ignite, where we had close to 1,000 attendees from over 500 companies and 25 countries. It was exciting and validating to hear repeatedly from our customers that we are helping them to solve their security problems with unmatched solutions. The message from our customers that resonated loud and clear was that our solutions are clearly unique in the marketplace, as no other competitor is able to safely enable applications.
 At Ignite, we also launched 4 new products, all of which address today's virtualized and physical enterprise networks to further extend our technology lead over the competition. First, we launched 2 new hardware platforms that will address identified opportunities within the enterprise. The PA-3000 Series which is a mid-range next-generation firewall and the M-100, which is an easy-to-deploy, high-performance management appliance for our Panorama management system that introduces distributed log collection capability for large-scale enterprise deployment.
 This launch represents a significant step forward for our management tools.
 Also, we introduced our new VM-Series, which is a virtualized next-generation firewall platform that brings next generation network security into the virtualized datacenter environment.
 We believe virtualized security will become increasingly as important as more core applications are run in virtualized environments, and we intend to be a leader in this emerging space.
 We've launched the VM-Series in collaboration with VMware to provide our shared customers the ability to address their security and compliance needs while accelerating their adoption of virtualization.
 We also formally launched WildFire, our subscription-based modern malware protection and prevention service. This new service gives subscribers 1 hour response times for the delivery of modern malware signatures and integrated on-box logging and reporting. To date, WildFire has discovered more than 70,000 new malware files that have not been identified by existing anti-malware solutions, and the enhanced response will ensure that the damages caused by 0-day malware and targeted attacks are mitigated for our customers.
 WildFire not only detects modern malware but for the first time, enables enterprises to prevent malware. All of our newly unveiled products are supported by the release of PAN-OS 5.0, which has more than 60 new features, focusing on solving unique network security problems in cloud environments, scaling and simplifying network security management in large enterprise environments, enhanced IPv6 capabilities and increase control for managing the growing amount of SSL traffic in the enterprise.
 Increasingly, we are becoming a partner of choice for other leaders in the technology world. We announced a new multiphase relationship with Citrix that starts with validated joint solutions for their virtual application and desktop virtualization solutions, as well as other -- as well as popular and applied applications. Separately, we added 9 other leading companies to our Technology Partner Program, including RSA, SafeNet, and Skybox Security.
 Security remains a top priority for CIOs around the globe. In general, we see that security spending is resilient even in a challenging macroeconomic environment. We believe that there will continue to be significant displacements in security spending amongst vendors with the market favoring the next-generation technologies that provide significantly better security and at an increasingly better value.
 As we look forward, we will continue to be aggressive in maintaining our technology advantage, increasing our market share and ensuring the highest levels of customer satisfaction.
 With that, I would like to turn the call over to Steffan, for a detailed look at our financial results. Steffan? 
Steffan Tomlinson: Thank you, Mark, and thank you, all, for joining us today. 
 I'd like to mention that unless specifically noted otherwise, we're discussing all numbers, except revenue, on a non-GAAP basis that excludes share based compensation expense and where relevant, its tax-related effects.
 In Q1 '13, total revenue grew to a record $85.9 million, an increase of 50.5% over a very strong Q1 '12 and 13.6% sequentially. 
 In Q1 '13, product revenue of $55.5 million grew 29.5% year-over-year and 12.3% sequentially, driven by sales of our series of appliances.
 Services revenue, which is comprised of both subscription and support, of $30.4 million increased 113.4% year-over-year and 16.1% sequentially. Services revenue accounted for 35.4% of total revenue, an increase of 80 basis points sequentially. This is in line with our expectations, and underscores the power of our hybrid revenue model as it provides enhanced visibility.
 The geographic mix of revenue was 64% Americas; 23% EMEA; and approximately 14% for Asia Pacific, with all tiers posting growth on a year-over-year and sequential basis.
 Total non-GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 72.6%, in line with our target range. Non-GAAP gross margin decreased 160 basis points year-over-year and increased 70 basis points sequentially.
 Q1 non-GAAP product gross margin was 74.2%, down 180 basis points year-over-year and 60 basis points sequentially. The sequential decrease is primarily due to product mix.
 But looking forward, product gross margins will fluctuate as we introduce new products such as the PA-3000 which was introduced in November. New products have a higher initial cost of goods sold, but will improve over time as volumes increase.
 Our non-GAAP services gross margin was 69.5%, up 60 basis points year-over-year and 290 basis points sequentially. The sequential increase was primarily due to the timing of headcount and project-related expenditures in the quarter.
 Services gross margin will also fluctuate depending on the timing of the ramp of our service organization.
 Moving on to operating expenses. We continued to invest in product development and expand our sales in go-to-market organizations. 
 Q1 '13 non-GAAP R&D was $11.6 million, an increase of $1.4 million from the prior quarter, primarily related to spend on programs and headcount additions. As a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP R&D expense was 13.5%, flat with Q4 '12.
 Q1 '13 non-GAAP sales and marketing expense was $38.3 million, an increase of $2.8 million from the prior quarter. As a percentage of revenue, it was 44.6%, a decrease of 230 basis points sequentially, primarily due to operating leverage.
 Q1 '13 G&A expense was $7.2 million, an increase of $0.8 million from the prior quarter or 8.4% as a percentage of revenue, flat with Q4 '12.
 In total, Q1 '13 non-GAAP operating expenses were $57.1 million or 66.5% of revenue, an increase of $5 million or 9.6% from the prior quarter. 
 Moving on to operating margin. In Q1, we saw a strong increase in non-GAAP operating margin, which grew 300 basis points sequentially to 6.1%. The sequential improvement in operating margin this quarter can be attributed to continued natural leverage as we scale, as well as timing of headcount additions.
 As we've stated previously, our goal is to grow operating margin in a steady manner, but we've also noted there will be near-term fluctuations. 
 Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 42.6%. This rate will continue to fluctuate throughout the fiscal year as it's dependent on our global pretax profit mix and potential discrete events such as the removal of our domestic valuation allowance.
 Non-GAAP net income for Q1 was approximately $2.9 million or $0.04 per diluted share using 77.8 million shares. This compares to non-GAAP net income of $1.9 million or $0.03 per diluted share in fiscal Q4 '12, and non-GAAP net income of $5.6 million or $0.01 per basic and diluted share in fiscal Q1 '12.
 On a GAAP basis, net loss was $3.5 million or $0.05 per diluted share -- on a -- basic and a diluted basis for Q1 '13.
 Turning to the balance sheet. We finished October with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $342.1 million. In Q1, cash flow from operations was $23.1 million, free cash flow was $19.1 million and free cash flow margin was 22.2%.
 Cash flows benefit from our hybrid revenue model in which we bill for our services at the beginning of the engagement, and we collect the cash shortly thereafter.
 We ended Q1 with $56.4 million of accounts receivable, up from Q4 '12 balance of $45.6 million. Average days sales outstanding were 53 days, in the middle of our target range of 50 to 55 days, and up modestly from 50 days reported in Q4 '12.
 Moving down the balance sheet. Our hybrid revenue model helped increase total deferred revenue to $160.4 million, an increase of 86.2% year-over-year and 18.1% sequentially. Short-term deferred revenue of $101.4 million increased 17.5% sequentially. While we're continuing to see an uptick in multi-year deals, the majority of our services engagements are on an annual basis. 
 Let me now turn to our guidance for Q2 2013. We expect revenue growth to accelerate on a year-over-year basis and be in the range of $90 million to $94 million. This equates to a 59% to 66% year-over-year growth. Additionally, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be approximately $0.04 per share using 78 million to 80 million shares on a diluted basis.
 With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to open the Q&A session. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Greg Dunham, Goldman Sachs. 
Gregory Dunham: I guess, first question, a common question I get is how often is Palo Alto used as a primary firewall vendor, and you kind of highlighted a couple of wins there and you also noted that the 9.9 statistic from existing customers. But can you address that concern from some investors and how that's progressed over time? 
Mark McLaughlin: Greg, it's Mark. We said before that we were on the road example that about half of our installations were on the primary firewall, and more than half of our new sales were the primary firewalls. So I think what you're seeing in our results here is -- and plus, the lifetime value statistics we're quoting is that, more and more often, we are the primary firewall, either in the initial sale and specifically, when we're already in an account. That is happening more and more often as well. So that is trending in a positive direction for us where we are becoming the primary firewall and installations were already been put into a company and more of our new sales are primary firewall as well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. 
Keith Weiss: I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color into the environment, and in particular, 2 areas. One, the federal government. I know you guys had a really good year last year in federal government, just wanted to see how it turned out this year. And maybe, give us a little visibility into what you guys are thinking about fiscal cliff and whether that's going to impact you guys at all. And then, maybe a little bit on EMEA. It looks like EMEA, you had a nice balance back there -- or a nice balance there in terms of growth, the absolute revenue number from Q4 into Q1. How are you guys feeling about EMEA given the current macro over there? 
Mark McLaughlin: Let me start with the highest level question on the fiscal cliff, which is, it's really uncertain to say what kind of impact that would be. I think from-- if it was going to be a big impact probably, it would be more in the government space if there was sequestration or things like that. The main impact of that sort of thing, primarily, would be at end of the year for that, which has gone by, so there's quite a bit of time for everybody to get all that stuff worked out. That sort of macro condition aside in the Fed space, for us, that continues to be a very strong vertical force. We expected a strong quarter from the Fed, as usual, in Q1 and it performed to our expectations. All that aside, there's still new vertical accounts of more than 15% of our overall business, and we are still very nicely diversified. And then, from an EMEA perspective, we continue to keep our eye on that like a lot of companies do, particularly, in Southern Europe but that region, for us, had very strong year-over-year performance. And also we had good strong -- sequential growth in EMEA this quarter as well. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow of Credit Suisse. 
Philip Winslow: You had a particularly strong number in deferred revenue this quarter, I wonder if you could just comment on the trends that you're seeing in terms of just attach rates of the various subscriptions and then, renewal rates. And I just have one follow-up to that. 
Steffan Tomlinson: Sure. So deferred revenue grew very nicely, it grew faster than our revenues on booked quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. When you think about the profile of the deferred revenue, it's split between subscriptions and maintenance. The attach rates have basically held steady to directionally improved a little bit. We have -- in the subscription bucket, URL filtering, threat prevention, GlobalProtect. And now we've just started to monetize WildFire, that wasn't in these latest results, but that will be a benefit for us going forward. The attach rates haven't really changed that much since we talked last time, although, we typically get, call it, 1 to 2 subscriptions at the time of the initial sale. But as part of our land, expand and extend strategy, we are getting more subscriptions that are being sold into accounts after we win them. On the maintenance front, the attach rates remain very high and in the renewals, for both maintenance and subscriptions, are also very high. 
Philip Winslow: Got it. And then, just one quick follow up on just pricing, I mean, one of the concerns that investors have is there's a sort of price war going on in the perimeter security market, just curious what you're seeing in terms of pricing, this quarter versus the last, and sort of, year-over-year. And any commentary around that will be great. 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, Phil. We do see competition on getting aggressive on pricing. We've seen that for quite some time. There's been not a lot of impact to us on that because of a number of things. The first, and most importantly, is that customers see the difference. So it doesn't matter how cheaply you want to sell your technology if it doesn't actually solve the problem they’re trying to solve which, in this case is, "Can I safely enable an application?" And since we are the only guys in the market to have that technology, people continue to buy. They continue to pay premium price for that. I think it's reflected, as well, as our margins are very good, they continue to hold steady. So we do see pricing pressure out there, but I don't see that being a successful tactic against us. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joel Fishbein, Lazard. 
Joel Fishbein: It looks like your spending on sales and marketing almost doubled year-over-year, can you just talk about ways in which you're focused on increasing distribution and maybe going after different vertical markets there? That would be helpful. 
Steffan Tomlinson: Sales and marketing is definitely an area where we're going to continue to make meaningful investments. And what's been happening over the last year is, we have, again, a high-touch indirect fulfillment model where we have quota carrying  salespeople and we are basically selling everything we can get in front of. We're balancing that with a robust channel strategy where we have a 2-tier distribution system. So we've been selectively adding high-quality partners to help extend our feet on the street without incurring too much cost that, now you can see, on a sequential basis, actually, sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue showed some nice leverage coming down, call it, about 200 basis points. And that's something where -- our target model is 30% to 33% for sales and marketing. And we feel like with the combination of our high-touch folks with a robust channel strategy and the additional partnerships that we've announced, with Citrix and VMware, et cetera, we should be getting more leverage out of sales and marketing going forward. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jayson Noland, Robert Baird. 
Jayson Noland: Getting a lot of questions on software-defined networking, and we saw the big switch networks announcement, I guess, how important is SDN to you and then, how are you positioned? 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. So I think that SDN is a trend that a lot of folks are talking about now. And from our perspective, it's a good thing if it actually takes hold. Just because it makes the -- what we're selling even more unique and relevant makes proprietary hardware guys less relevant. But I'll let -- Nir's with the tier 2, I'll let him dive in on that for just a second. 
Nir Zuk: Yes. If you look at SDN, SDN is really looking at solving 1 big problem, which is very frequent changes in virtual data centers, where things move around. And when virtual machines move around or when they're added or removed from the infrastructure, security and networking has to follow them. And that's really what SDN is trying to solve. If you dig into the announcements that we've made around virtualization a few weeks ago at Ignite, as part of PAN-OS version 5.0, you will see that there is -- not just that we announced a virtual firewall the VM-Series, but we also announced functionality that can track the movement of virtual machines in data centers, track their addition, their removal, their movement from 1 place to another. And by that, by integrating that into your VM infrastructure, into your orchestration tools, we are able to effectively perform what SDN performs, which is, track changes in their data center and adjust to them in realtime without needing to change any configuration manually. I think part of our work with VMware is also around that. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits, Raymond James. 
Michael Turits: Two questions. One, was there any change in the mix of the amount of license that isn't deferred? I don't know if that had any impact on product or licenses, because that was a little -- a little bit slower than the rest of the business. 
Steffan Tomlinson: Yes. There was really no change in mix in deferred revenue. As we said previously, the vast majority is services and deferred revenue, so there was not any mixed change. 
Michael Turits: And then, did you -- what did you add in terms of headcount? How many -- what was the net add in terms of the headcount this quarter, and what do you expect that to be like over the next couple of quarters? 
Steffan Tomlinson: Yes. So we ended at 847 total headcount in Q1 '13 and that was off of a Q4 '12 number of 755. And what we stated previously was, we anticipate adding approximately 75 to 100 heads per quarter. The prior quarter, we came in at the lower end of that range. This quarter, we came in near the high end of that range. There's going to be some fluctuations as we go forward. But we are heavily investing in the business by doing it in a profitable manner. 
Michael Turits: And if I could squeeze one more in. What about your expectations around CapEx? I know that you planned some it accelerations there, what's the schedule for that? 
Steffan Tomlinson: The CapEx this quarter was approximately $4 million. And for the rest of the year, it will be in the, call it, low- to mid-single digits. We're not providing specific guidance on a quarterly basis, but we expect to be in the low to mid-single-digit in terms of CapEx. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Tal Liani, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Tal Liani: Hello. My question is about the gross margin and breakdown between services and products. So if I compare your gross margin to some of your competitors, your margins are lower. But earlier in their lifecycle, they also had similar gross margins, if I compare it to Fortinet, for example. And later on in life, they had a massive boost in gross margin to the 80s and high-80s. So the question is, is there something different in your business model that is going to result in lower potential upside to gross margin? Is gross margin, mostly the services side, is it the function of volume? How do we compare between you and other companies in the space on this number? 
Steffan Tomlinson: Well, let's start with our target model, which is 70% to 73%, we've been operating within that range. When you make a comparison between Palo Alto Networks and some of the other folks out there, whether or not it's Fortinet or Check Point or Cisco, on the security business, every company is slightly different. What we've said to folks over time is, once we get to our target model, which is -- when we talk about target model, we also look at operating margin, which is 22% to 25%, we will reevaluate where we are in gross margin. So this isn't a long-term target. This is a -- it's a target model that will be reassessed. Structurally, a tailwind for gross margin will be increasing subscription sales, and as a positive potential tailwind down the road is, we just introduced the paid-for version of WildFire, which will be additive and it's very high gross margins for us. The maintenance part of our services revenue is very much in line with other companies of similar size and scale. But unlike other companies that we compete with, we are adding over 1,000 customers per quarter. We're growing -- if you look at the Check Points, the Ciscos and the Fortinets, on a -- if you just compare numbers on a sequential basis, we're growing 10x to 12x faster against some of those folks there. So we're making investments in the maintenance organization to ensure that we have the best customer service that's out there. So to net it off, we think that long-term, there could be some upside to the gross margin target, but we want to get to our target model first, then we'll reassess. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Kvaal, Barclays. 
Jeffrey Kvaal: I have 2 questions. Mark, maybe this is one for you and Nir, and that is, could you help us understand the ADC vendors rolling all of this, I think many of them have started to talk a lot more aggressively about security in the past several quarters. And then, Steffan, one for you as well. Is there a seasonality element to the deferred revenue and with -- affiliated with your fiscal year end, should we expect a different pattern in the upcoming quarter? 
Mark McLaughlin: Jeff, I'll take the first one, at ADC side. I think specifically, you're probably talking about F5 that talks more and more of security as a growth opportunity for them. When they are doing that, they're talking about a different space than we are in, from a security perspective. So they are sitting in a different part of a network for different purposes and from a network security perspective they're primarily consistently talking about safe installation of firewalls at different points in the data center market we do not play in today. So with... 
Nir Zuk: I could give some more details around that. If you look at where customers deploy security, there are several places. Firstly, of course, the perimeter. The Internet-facing -- what's called Internet-facing firewall and really, the requirements there are next-generation firewall, meaning safely enabling the applications, scanning traffic for viruses, for spyware for all kinds of malware, for exploits, for data leakage, and so on. And of course, we don't F5 playing in that market at all. This -- we don't offer inspection as a viable solution in that market at all. The secondary area where security is deployed is in the data center and even there, there are 2 use cases. The first use case is the external data center, the Internet-facing data center where you run your web servers. And the requirements there, in many cases, from security perspective are pretty minimal, meaning, allow only traffic to the web servers, meaning ports 80 and 443 and then, blocking all the rest of the traffic. That, of course, can be achieved using a simple system inspection firewall and I think that's what the ADC vendors, such as F5, are doing. They call it an outbound firewall. The third area where you see security being deployed, which is still in data center, is in the corporate data center. In the corporate data center, the requirements are, again, for next-generation firewalls because customers want to control access to applications, control who can access which application, perform which functions in these applications, and also scan the data for bad things and for good things moving around. That's, again, something that we don't see the ADC vendors playing in and we're not sure whether they have the path of getting there without significant investments in anti-malware technology, in IDS technology, data leakage technology, as well as next-generation firewall technology. In terms of market size, we think that the external firewall, excuse me, external Internet-facing data center firewall is a much smaller market than the corporate data center and the Internet-facing firewall, the perimeter firewall. And these are the areas we focus at. We believe the ADC market -- the ADC vendors are focusing on the small part of the market, which is the Internet-facing security or Internet-facing firewall. 
Steffan Tomlinson: And Jeff, on the second question, is there a seasonality element to deferred revenues. I would say that it's a little-- it's still too soon to call seasonality trends, although, we are seeing a little bit of natural fiscal year seasonality with Q4. We were happy that -- and pleased with our sequential growth on a revenue basis and on the deferred revs. With our guidance, we're obviously guiding up, sequentially, and you would expect that there would be also an increase in deferred revs. We are not going to get into the specifics around what the rate of growth in deferred revenues is forecasted to be, but we anticipate that, that balance should grow. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard, Citigroup. 
Walter Pritchard: Mark, I'm wondering if you could talk about, you had -- I think, Mark Anderson, the new head of sales on board here for now a full quarter, I'm wondering if you could talk about what changes have been made or you foresee making under his leadership in running sales? 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes, Walter. Mark's doing a fantastic job, not surprising for us given all the demonstrated success he's had at F5 in building a business, growing at these kinds of rates, over time, at scale. A number of things that we're doing that probably are relevant, the first is, is that we are very, very focused on large accounts. So the company's always been successful into selling in, I'll call the Global 2000, and you can see from our LTV numbers that we continue to add business in all of the accounts, particularly, in new large accounts as well. Ken has just really haven't been super organized about that, and Mark's done a lot of work on bringing a lot of organization and focus into large accounts so we can keep the LTV growing there, as well as across the entire customer base. In addition to that, making sure that we are doing as good a job as we can with the channel in a coordinated fashion, we didn't really have an owner for, across the company, from a channel perspective before. Mark has really taken the reins on that as well, and put some new hires in the organization working with the channel folks. And then, the third is just a lot of operational discipline that he's brought to the system as well from certainty of numbers, commit, culture, those kinds of things, which are very important, obviously, when you're running a publicly-traded company. So all very, very positive things going on here. 
Walter Pritchard: And then, I'm not sure if for Mark or for Steffan, but you mentioned the LTV number and the 9.9 versus the 9.5. Can you talk about how much of that you're seeing come in from luring an annuity and WildFire being the most recent versus just simply going in and more fully penetrating a customer that starts out with you guys in one part of the network? 
Mark McLaughlin: It's a mix in a good way, good blend. So in the cases where the customers are doing repeat purchases, and these are pretty much across the board with all the customers doing these repeat purchases. We find 2 things that happen and they are a good blend of their buying more devices as they continue to spread it out to the network and they continue to buy more services to put on those devices. I think an interesting there, Walter, is what's penetration, even at some of our largest customers. And our conversations has been, looks at their networks, how large the networks are, boxes that have been deployed over time. We think that's still -- given some of our largest customers are relatively small, just penetration, because these guys measure devices in hundreds, and sometimes thousands of devices in some of these biggest networks. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz, Cowen and Company. 
Gregg Moskowitz: Mark, I know we're only about 3 weeks removed from the Ignite user conference, but just wondering even anecdotal...
 [Technical Difficulty] 
Mark McLaughlin: Everybody, this is Mark. I understand there's some issues where folks can hear us but we can't hear anything on the line. 
Operator: I'm back on the line sir, it looks, I do apologize all our lines have just dropped. So we can just proceed with our next question it will be just be one moment. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz, Cowen. 
Gregg Moskowitz: Second time is a charm. So Mark, I know we're only about 3 weeks removed from the Ignite user conference, but just wondering, even anecdotally, with the early interest has been like, thus far, for your PA-3000 appliances? 
Mark McLaughlin: It's good, Gregg. So if I could just it at a higher level, and I'll talk 3000 specifically for a second, but the user conference, Gregg, we had -- it's our very first one. We had almost 1,000 folks there and I thought it was every interesting that almost all of them paid to attend, which is unusual in these tough times. But great, great feedback from folks across the board about things we've done and very excited about the things that we launched. So we put a lot of stuff in the market here recently and spent a lot of time with the customers explaining it. The 3000, in particular, is a device that was clearly being asked for from the market. There's a clear market need for that, for a midrange device. And we've been selling it ever the since the day we announced it. 
Gregg Moskowitz: Okay, great. And then, just a quick follow-up for Steffan. The tax rate, as you noted, was higher this quarter and I understand there are going to be fluctuations going forward. I just wanted to get a sense, for fiscal '13, are you still expecting the tax rate to be 34 to 39? 
Steffan Tomlinson: Right now I think it's going to be at the higher end of that range. After we get through this fiscal quarter, Q2, we'll give a little bit more guidance on the back half -- for the back half of the year on the next call. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brent Thill, from UBS. 
Brent Thill: And just as it relates to some of the value-added subscriptions that you can cross-sell to clients, can you just give us -- like bring us up to speed on where you're at, maybe you can talk a little bit about the economic model in terms of what you're seeing from customers? 
Mark McLaughlin: Sure, if you mean subscriptions services, so now with the paid version of WildFire now in the market, we have 4 subscription services. We have threat prevention; we have the URL Web filtering, we have our GlobalProject, and now the paid-for version of our WildFire. The economics are similar for the subscription services, so it's 20% of the list price of the device per subscription service. So there's been no change to that since the last time we talked. 
Brent Thill: Okay, great. And maybe for Nir, just as it relates to everyone talking about a APT and they're looking at, potentially, incrementally-priced products to go after this. Are you thinking of this as an incrementally-priced piece, or is this embedded in the platform? 
Nir Zuk: So the way -- so our APT or modern malware service called WildFire is made of 2 pieces. The first piece is the collection service where we collect -- we let our customers run their traffic through a separate -- through a cloud-based service which we don't charge for. And we scan their traffic and we look for malware in it. And if we find malware, we take that malware and we generate, immediately, signatures to go and block that malware and similar malware trying to get on the customer network, as well as to block existing instances of that malware that are already on the customer network trying to communicate back with the bad guys. The receiving DOS signature is a paid-for service. So sending us traffic for examination is a free service, and this is really what our competitors are selling, meaning, if you look at the standalone APT vendors, what they are selling is a detection service, they don't have a prevention -- they don't have prevention capabilities, mostly, for the fact that they don't have a high-speed firewall IPS and anti-malware device sitting in the network. They don't provide that, and nobody is looking at them to provide that. So we decided to give that part to the customers for free, because we also see value from collecting those samples. The second part that we do which is unique to Palo Alto Networks, no one else in the market can do that, is to turn those signatures around -- is to turn those malware around into signatures that, as I said, are designed to block both the malware trying to get into the network, as well as existing instances of the malware trying to get out of the network. This is unique to Palo Alto, and this is what we charge for as part of the new WildFire subscription service. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Frederick Grieb from Nomura. 
Frederick Grieb: Two for me. First, some public software companies disclose how changes in billing terms may have impacted year-over-year billings growth in the quarter, could you give us a similar commentary? And the second question is just on the competitive environment. You're clearly taking share, but when you compete against Check Point, Cisco, Juniper, who do you have the best win rate against, and why? 
Steffan Tomlinson: On the first one, we have a hybrid revenue model, and one element of that revenue model is SaaS-based. We are -- the crown jewels of the company are in software but we are an appliance-based vendor that has a portion of the revenue stream being SaaS. So with that as the backdrop, there's no changes in billing terms for our services, our subscriptions or maintenance. So there is no impact on a quarter-over-quarter basis relative to billings. Now I will say that billings is not something that we focus on because we are primarily a book-and-ship business. With that said, billings was $110 million in the quarter, and it grew faster than revenue. 
Mark McLaughlin: And Frederick, on your competition question, those are the 3 firewall vendors you see in the market, you mentioned Cisco, Juniper and Check Point. And we have been taking share from all 3 of those vendors. As far as which one we see more often, thus, Cisco has the largest market share so we tend to see them in more instances. You remember, most of the sales we do are displacement sales so they are in more accounts already to start with, and we tend to see them more often as far as we're displacing. But generally, it's just all market share where folks are already installed. 
Frederick Grieb: I guess, I was wondering more -- I guess, win rate, do you beat Cisco 60% of the time, Check Point, 70% of the time? Did you have a statistic like that? 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. I think the better way to look at that is -- the way we look at it is, when we get into an account, like we said earlier, if we can get the technical valuations done, our win rates are very high, and that is across-the-board against any competitor. It doesn't matter who it is. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Ho, William Blair. 
Jonathan Ho: Just one question around the competitive environment. Are you seeing any competitive response or any shift there in terms of--and, maybe, a reaction from some of the incumbents that are losing significant share either on the pricing front or on the product side? 
Mark McLaughlin: ;
 Jonathan, as I said a little -- I'll take those in reverse. On the pricing, we've seen some more aggressive pricing in the market, which is a natural response if you don't have the technology that the customer's after, which is, the more important piece, we haven't seen any competitive response to what we're doing as far as safely enabling application. So interestingly as well, we pay attention to that question a lot. We think we're very far ahead of the competition already, we think we've widened that gap with the 5 products we put in the market in the last few weeks. And when we asked our close to 1,000 customer that came to our user conference, what they thought about that, just resoundingly, they were very clear that we're unique in the market. 
Jonathan Ho: Got it. And can you guys talk a little bit about channel, incentives and training, and maybe some of the results of the investments that you guys have made on that side and, potentially, what the impact could be, sort of, going forward? 
Mark McLaughlin: Yes. So on the channel side, we have a bit of different model than other folks, so we're a quality versus quantity shop, about 850 channel partners today that we-- from that, that will continue to grow over time at a pace we like. The reason -- I mean of pace we like is, it's very important when you have the disruptive technology in the market -- you're almost always displacing an existing provider, that you are adequately trained to represent the technology in order to get the sale done. So we're very careful with who we bring on from a channel perspective. And then, we spend quite a bit of time with them, it does cost money and resources to get them educated, and trained, and tested and certified, but the results are -- speak for themselves. When they go through all that with us, they do very well. We had our North American partner conference right after our user conference, actually, and it's very interesting, with over 200 of our partners there, has asked a quick question of how many folks had more than doubled their business with Palo Alto Networks in the last year, from the last conference, and we had multiple dozens of people stand up in the room and everybody else in the room said, yes, I'd like to do that, too. So that continues on the interest side. Also at the user conference, we trained a couple of hundred -- we certified a couple hundred of our partners and users through testing, which is important as well, to make sure they understand the products. I think that's all working really well for us and at a pace that we like. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Catharine Trebnick, Northland Securities. 
Catharine Trebnick: Could you provide us -- at the beginning of the call you said that you were up significantly 14% quarter-over-quarter, but could you delve into some of the vertical segments that are possibly driving some of this? And if those are driven by any of compliance or regulatory in nature? 
Mark McLaughlin: Catharine.,, So if we look -- if we break down our entire business from a vertical perspective, it's very nicely distributed, not only vertically, but geographically as well. It's very nicely distributed, so we don't have an overwhelming concentration in any vertical, which we think is a good degree of lower risk in the business. No vertical accounts were more than 15% of our business today and the ones that tend to be higher, as close to the 15% are financial services, the public-sector space and the high-technology space. Not surprisingly, since they have a lot of assets online to protect. 
Catharine Trebnick: How about health care? I'm kind of curious on that since there's a lot of move to digitization of all the patient records. It seems like that might be an emerging opportunity. 
Mark McLaughlin: That's very -- that's a fair impression. So I think health care is probably number 4 or 5, I listed the first 3, but you picked up on the -- it was either the next one or the one right after that. But, yes, I think what you're getting at is, is that in a number of industries, they have different compliance requirements, regulatory requirements than other industries. And if that's the world you live in, then you're likely to be very interested in our technology, and health care is clearly one of those. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the present -- I'm sorry, that concludes the Q&A session. And I now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark McLaughlin for closing remarks. 
Mark McLaughlin: Thanks, again, everybody, for being on the call today. Sorry for some of the technical difficulties there. I'd like to reiterate my appreciation for the hard work of the Palo Alto Networks team in support of all our customers and partners as we continue to revolutionize the enterprise network security space. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.
